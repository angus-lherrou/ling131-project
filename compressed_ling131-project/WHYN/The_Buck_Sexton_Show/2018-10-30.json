bigotry is not just non conservative eat is anti medical to conservatism because\nIf we are not all God's creation in doubt by our creator with an ailing herbal rights and if we are not all equal in the eyes of God and in the eyes of the law then there is no such thing really as conservatism and conservatism as we know it in this country does not exist\nIt ... it is not possible to be a conservative and believe that a white person or any any black person or a black person than a Hispanic person and a white person at that that they do not all have equal dignity equal rights\nEqual work as human beings and as citizens of this great nation so\nWhen the last try so hard to create this perception that people who are conservative I I Can't speak to the right means the right\nA meeting all of it I was I can speak the write in general terms but you know there are some fringe elements of the right that you that they consider themselves on the right and you'd say well hold on a second in what meaningful way are they conservative though\nYou know this is where you start to really get into what is right wing and left wing even mean you know if you are more in favor of individual rights if you were about the individual instead of the collective right the left\nIn this country is all about the collective and they're about collective guilt collective identity collective economics they are collective is\nThey believe in groups they believe in\nThe common good as defined by a core of elites that all speak in the language of equality in commonality but leave\nAs elites and separate from the masses but use the envy and antagonism of the masses in order to beat the other side politically which would be us\nWe are the individual is we are the individual rights we're all God's creation we're all human beings in this struggle together and should help each other and respect each other at each other's rights and dignity and life and that as an obligation on all of us\nUm when when they try to make this case that racism and anti Semitism and these different ... and bigotry exist on the right I just I\nHave a a real feeling of uh of outrage at that because it's show on true and so unfair and\nI think that the reason they push it so it's not just because it works it's dirty politics but it is useful for them it is a shame that so many of the\nClasses that the Democrats view as victims whether it's just the working poor or African Americans or a or Hispanics Latinos women whatever the group maybe it's a shame that so many of them have been propagandize to such that they they really believe that I Know this from talking to them\nThey really believe that conservatives are racist they believe that and\nYou and I said you knowing that that is a lot it's not true we're not racist in fact we're the ones that are always advocating for people of all races to be treated equally under the law is the left\nThat advocates for disparate treatment in the eyes of the law based upon race based upon skin color based upon not even real but perceived\nGender\nThey're the ones that want these differentiation and then they turn around and say that we're the ones who are obsessed with with race and gender and these other differences among among human beings\nAre when at the end of the day I I think it couldn't be any more clear that our side the side of conservatives unconstitutional is are the ones that advocate for individual rights and the dignity of all people and\nThere has always been this effort to rewrite the histories of the ... the two parties this is why Democrats you get so there I said triggered when they just brought up but they are the part of the Democrats are the part or a party of slavery segregation Jim Crow just go down the list it was it was historically always the Democrats\nDemocrats have been and are the party of the mob mob mentality the mob feeling how does the mass feel how do the masses view an issue what did they demand what did they show what where's their rage direct that has been the aid that has been at the core of the Democratic party\nThere's always been an intellectual straining conservatism that has been first and foremost about the American founding the constitution and\nThe rights of each and every individual and the natural law that underpins all of this that it's not really just about what the founding fathers said if at the founding fathers were able to harness a sense of what is a universal and eternal truths about human beings\nWhat is always true about people what is always good for society to promote and what is always necessary for society to try and prevent it to condemn those universal truths are at the heart of conservatism and so it's just\nIt he's

very very a\nDifficult situation do you think that all the\nGuard I hate to think of it that way I Will say that I hate to think of it that way I don't want to see you\nSaid oh it's certainly an option\nRather than Trump saying maybe an armed guard would have been able to save lives in that horrible shooting at the synagogue in Pittsburgh we got somebody who's got strong opinions on the matter of having somebody who is armed and trained on premises as a general matter a Jesse Kelly is with us now he is of course the host\nOf the Jesse Kelly show he is a fan favorite here in the freedom that you can ... on our eye heart a sister station up nine fifty K. P. R. C. down in Houston every night Mr Jesse Kelly ... have you on\nDrugs to be here buck happy to do it rather\nUh so I you know I'm I'm always a little\nFrustrated 'cause I'm not surprise surprise not the right works I Know that after a terrible shooting incident wherever it is there there's always this suggestion of all why do you bring up armed guards\nOr as though that some crazy idea a you know I've I've seen plenty of armed guards end or armed police at major religious sites where I grew up in New York City I just don't know Jesse why this gets dismissed\nBy the ... I guess I Do know but it frustrates me that the leftist dismisses this out of hand we really do just want to save lives\nThen that's where it gets dismissed for simple reason just because it's the truth it's just like the left most dismiss off things that are the truth it is a simple\nObvious solution that would obviously solve the problem and therefore the left is forced to hate it because they have to live in a world of make believe we have armed guards everywhere we truly care about everywhere you truly want to protect the place the target or potential target\nAs an armed guard side of it or will walk that cold security that's the norm that's the real world\nBut even bringing up an actual solution is just going to get your reactions horror from the left who they think the only solution to disarming every ...\nI just can't imagine the circumstances where I'm In a place\nThat generally speaking a lot of people do not you know you're you're you're not expecting to sell it depends where you are right I I don't know what it was like in the Pittsburgh synagogue I'm guessing probably none of the you know none of the parishioners are ever arms or you know I don't know or or another congregants I shouldn't say rubber arm\nUh but I Know there are some churches in the south where I was people are All right I mean it it depends on where you are\nBut the the idea that this is automatically a bad idea I think it just goes to show how ideological lot of the reaction to this is because if I'm sitting there and I see somebody who's got a side arm\nAnd that's that's either a law abiding gun order showing their side arm war is trained security or orbit perhaps off duty law enforcement\nBill last often ever goes through my mind is oh well I'm less safe now Jesse I mean it seems very basic\nWell it seems to basics you book because you were CIA or do you have comments that you you acknowledge the way the world really is but I I one thing I have come to grips with is how frightening guns of any kind are for\nThose who have never experienced it never held them never shot one ever been taught the basic safety about them it really is a terrifying thing for people who don't know they look at it and honestly it sounds crazy they see the thing is just going to start shooting\nI Know I think you make a really good point and you know I Know you're not just a Texan but also were a marine so you've got double firearms familiarity baked in there\nBut you know you you look at at the the cultural differences in the very very blue areas versus a lot of the rest of the country you know when I tell people that I went to a a camp\nAs an eleven year old where we were firing rifles they look at me like I'm nuts\nI mean they think this is crazy sounding but it just goes to show that part of the political and cultural divide we have now in this country is exactly what you said it's not just that people don't have some illegality with guns all that's a big part of it they've also been raised to think where they've they've been led to believe by their peers in those around them\nThat guns except in the hands of the states\nHeavy lifting folks as what she says that's how she thinks she's coming back I've been to I'm you know I've been saying all along and you could tell her that\nShe knows she's not supposed to let that out right now she knows she's supposed to hold back a little more it's not supposed to go there and not supposed to be you know obviously pushing for her own future and the White House at this stage of the game\nBecause she comes from a damaged political brand\nUh but you can't help herself Hillary Clinton\nI have said has a hole in her soul the only thing that will fill it in her mind is the ultimate power of the presidency\nAnd there's nothing else that you could ever have or could ever do that would make what she has been through because I'm sure she views yourself as a kind of victim and a and I'm a martyr for the left wing progressive\nCause politically speaking you know she stood beside bill she allowed so many people to uh bash are all these years I mean I'm saying this is in her\nIn her mind the only thing that is just the only way that justice is done is if she becomes president United States and I I've been saying it and I just want to make sure that I'm very clear very on the record here\nWhat happens is that the Democrats if they take the house marchers right into fights over impeachment that becomes the whole discussion we're just going to be fighting over impeachment really for the next Eighteen months\nAnd then the narrative is that the only way to set right what they could not get because they will not have two thirds of the Senate so they can't remove Hillary but the only way to set it right would be to make Hillary president finally to break\nThat LA and\nFinally put her in a position where she gets to be the president of the United states\nI'm I'm not the only one who's thinking this Hillary yourself you could tell it's like well I mean I'm not saying I'm running I'm just saying that I really want the jobs bill and nobody is more qualified than I Am I mean this is this is the kind of stuff you say when you want something that you know you're not supposed to walk\nAnd or at least you're not supposed to say you want it that's where we are with us she she has not given up\nOne bit\nShe still thinks that this is the way that it's all going to go and and what a what a a a a crazy story at her mind it's got to be for running against Brock Obama losing run against Trump and losing\nAnd in the end though in her mind justice prevails and she sets right the world and you could tell that she said oh you know there's so much work to do and her ... her mind set her attitude is alright America you know I'm the one that's got to fix fix them asked that\nThat Trump created and oh by the way you over this to me you owe me the presidency\nThat hasn't changed one bit and she is very much so that mindset so I Know it's a little early but keep in mind that next year or this coming Tuesday way now yeah next Tuesday next Tuesday the midterms will be over and the presidential election will begin\nA next Tuesday is when we start to talk about who's really going to run the Democrats I think by by you're going to have a huge field of candidates on the\nDemocrats' side I think you're going to have a a massive field of all kinds of people including some real characters\nI'm not totally convinced that I have a nod he still thinks that are doesn't still think that he's going to run on I'm not convinced as crazy as that may really be to anybody who's living in the real world\nI Would not be surprised if you did in fact have an ... candidacy I could see I could see that happening and I think that you look at some of the\nOthers out there Elizabeth Warren probably still going to run again Pocahontas herself still going to run because she thinks that in the Arab Trump\nAll that matters is that you deliver for your side and no matter how humiliating her whole fake Native American or deal may have been she thinks that she can still deliver\nA socialism for America that's that is what the fights going to be make no mistake about it this is going to be about this election will be about socialism the last election was about the crony corrupt ... Clinton's\nThat was quite alliteration but you know what I mean the last election was about the progressive media elite establishment finally getting getting the upper cut that is so deserved after all these years and the next election is going to be socialism\nNo doubt in my mind it's going to be open forget about the kind of Bernie Sanders cuddly I just want free school stuff is going to be open a\nSeventy percent tax rate kind of\nRedistribute the wealth reparations for all kinds of historical wrongs\nA massive government intervention the healthcare markets open borders so that you can dilute whatever pain the productive citizens feel by just drowning out their votes with with new arrivals are that's going to be with the next elections all about\nAnd what's with that in mind by the way that I think of some of these\nSome of these never Trump ... are just getting crazier and crazier you know they they've gone from Russia collusion and now they have to find something else to justify their their hatred and I mean Max Boot I feel weird even talking about him because he's such a weirdo and show in significant\nIn terms of his influence and his thinking in the in the conservative movement in fact the only ... was to get us into wars that we're a at least in one case a very bad idea um but you know he'll just slander Trump with stuff like the ten\nFox News on that crowd Breitbart and enforcing the Daily Caller Republican congressman there been vilified George Soros for years and basically because George Soros for say a rich through and so when they talk about Soros they're talking about\nA rich Jew who is in control of everything for when they talk about global us which is a trend that first right when ... when Trump says Kobus right wing extremists here Jews versus those for\nA ... dog whistling which has gone assaults and you're right it's not just ... it's a lot of Republicans it's a lot of folks that Fox News they really everything that he ... in their ...\nSmear by the way everything people don't refer to anti Semitism when there's criticism of Sheldon Adelson who is a very wealthy Jewish Republican donor that's apparently not anti Semitic this notion that global list it's some kind of dog was a global as is a term that's been used in international relations\nAre for decades\nAnd has nothing to do with someone being Jewish ... Jimmy Carter was a global is I mean there there are lots of people that you could look at him referred you historically that work for you then as global have nothing to do with Judaism or certainly with anti Semitism\nUm but booth realizes that if you're going to go to the other team but it's not enough to just say I don't like Trump you have to say I despised Trump I hate Trump I'll do anything I'll say anything I Will bend the knee and beg forgiveness from the left and be a turn coat and slander all my former friends\nAnd allies\nDon't know how these people sleep at night\nI Can't imagine turning on all the people that I respect and work with a known now and am ideologically in line with and later just turn around because it was convenient for me and\nCall them ... ...\nWhat a creature is max ...

even have that federal agents even I think that's a better question why not just abolish the ATF\nI don't think it should exist because I think that when you create a federal law enforcement agency that has as its mission arresting people for firearms violations for example and and that that's a specific mission set that it has\nIt's going to work really hard to try to find people to nab on firearms offenses and there's a lot of\nComplicated firearms rules across the country you know I have had a fair number of people over the years federal lecture me on how a book it's on you as a legal gun owner to know the laws of the state you're in an\nOkay true but guess what there are some states where even the police don't really know what's legal and what's illegal because it's not clear based on how the laws are written\nHere's one for you in New York City if you have a handgun permits you have a legal premise permits for a handgun and you want to check it out of the city in New York state does New York state of reciprocity depending on who you ask I've got a totally different answers about\nThat I'm ... and then when you add and do it the practice that New York uh was engaged in for a while I mean I just know the gun laws are the best 'cause I Lived there for so long where people's flights were diverted\nPeople whose flights were diverted think about that you're you're flying from Chicago to a Miami let's say and all of this would be a pretty bad route you know ... you know you had bad weather on the way to Miami so they divert your flights in New York\nAnd now you're there and you have a hand gun that you checked legally\nWhich in Chicago it'd be hard enough as it is let's just assume you checked it legally with the airline you unchecked because now you've got to get another flight the next day when you go back to check in with your next flight they've arrested people for that for not having a premise permit for New York city and having a firearm in in New York\nThey've arrested and they know that that's why that's why they had to go so I'm just saying that they they look to penalize people I mean there's a an aggressive attitude about gun owners that some law enforcement agencies and I think ATF has very high on that list that someone force when agencies or adopt in a way that is I think that puts them in tension\nWith the constitution and and it's really problematic but with the hog and these others about the ... it just gets so boring after a while they they know that they're not really going to get this ban on farm the guy spoke today from ATF I remember his name doesn't really matter\nHe wants his solution to the gun problem is to have all semi automatic rifles all semi automatic rifles because as you said a rifle that can kill a

that more and more and I said oh do you really think that I could get a fully I I live in DC do you think that I could even get a fully automatic weapon here no matter what I tried to do no matter what my background is and he didn't know the answer I said the answer's no dude\nI'm just kind of shocked has got to work the ATF for twenty five years and seems like he doesn't know the gun laws that well which was surprising except for the fact that he's obviously an anti gun sell it\nBut that's the truth\nAnd you know this is what you're going to see people who\nAre not particularly well versed in and what's real and what's not with these issues to orange\nA very strong on the second amendment will pretend to be they'll say well you know I think you should be able to have a twelve gauge shotgun you know ... maybe a side by side from way back in the day and that's enough to you know with with twenty gauge shotgun shells with bird shot that's how you can protect yourself well\nNo that's all well and that's all well and good until somebody pulls out a you know a glock Nineteen with a full chamber and you know your are full of magazine rather and you're trying to defend yourself against them and you got you got two shots at twenty gauge bird shot I I I Want I Want the bad guy part of that equation\nOr I Want to be on I'm going to be armed the way there are I don't want to be

make them move look [noise]\nCome on [laughter] so there you have a pool from\nThe Simpsons and this comes after the reports late last week now oppose one of the more recognizable characters on that show who is not\nThat are really will a that guns gay but\nUm but up who is\nYou know about to get written out of the show according to reports from last week\nBecause uh you can't have well a couple of things right he's a an Indian a quickie Mart owner\nAnd so he's an inconvenience store owner and you you can't have you know Indians in seven eleven you're you're not allowed to to have that stereotype anymore and pop culture and media where we've talked about the war on a ... before but now they finally decided that it's not just that there there were some concerns or some\nIdeas out there that they were going to have somebody else voice a pool because Hank as area who is the uh the guy who wrote voice and that was a white guy\nYou know the whole lot of voices he's a voice actor but he he's a white guy voicing a brown guy which is obviously on this for the social justice love it's a big no no but they're actually just going to or at least the latest warning I saw as yeah that's right there are writing him out of the show\nSaying that uh you know that that they're running the show now some people are pushing back on that saying that it's not true\nThat he's not being written out of the show and I I think they are responding to back last year because people were saying really that this is where it is now now now you you can't have this cartoon characters been around for Twenty years and and I would note a pool is yes he's a stereotype\nOr on the show for sure there's no question he's a stereotype\nBut he's also\nNot ... you know he's a family man he's a successful business owner I really mean that I mean it's not\nHe's not being put down in fact he's often used on the show to highlight the silliness stupidity and ... of other people whereas you know he's actually kinda living the American dream has got a nice wife you hurt or on the ... when we came and it's like there's got a whole bunch of kids he's a business owner I mean\nYou know there's a lotta people aspires you in this country for themselves\nAnd and he's not you know there's this big difference between laughing Adam laughing with a pool is I've seen enough of this emphasis in many episodes certainly not all of them it's been on for Twenty years but of who they laughed with character\nYou know you're laughing with it and you find him funny he does insightful political commentary yes he has an accent and yes there is some stereotypes behind it but it's all being used for the purpose of\nNot just entertainment but also a inside and I just think that they're being really unfair to the character but I I Would say this\nYou know over the weekend 'cause the political correctness thing everyone hates it\nExcept for the twenty percent of the country are so that are just social justice left maniacs everyone hates this cult of political correctness this idea that we can't laugh at anything anymore nothing is allowed to be funny anymore everything has to be treated with this and this deadly seriousness and there's no way for us the just\nThe normal people ah who can laugh at things that a normal person would find funny\nWe all reject this but we find ourselves still stuck in these totalitarian psychological prison all the time of the political correct speech and and thought police but I I'm kind of happy though that they're not I I'd rather than get rid of a food than just you know do what they usually do which is\nTake the character and remove any hint of humor from him\nRights and all of a sudden a pool was going to have like an English accent and be a Harvard professor and just make fun of like the stupid fat white people like The Simpsons character Homer all the time you know that that's one way that they would go\nOr the social justice warriors would want this to go a ... and in another way that they would go would be to use them to make social justice you know to make more social justice related points\nYou know now all of a sudden the food so I just I I don't want any of that you know I just part of me as happy they'd rather get rid of his character then destroy the character I I think that's a\nAll right I'm going I'm going to leave the

to the New York magazine story about a you know reasons why young millennials aren't voting a five await says Steve I uh I Hope you don't think you're taking over uh the show one time he has gone you're literally the most obnoxious human being alone\nA ... literally the most obnoxious human being way thanks five\nOh wait I worry that either way it's going to be [laughter]\nUm there's also a lot of people who are saying that you can get ... uh stamps at a grocery store or CBS or supermarket\nLook guys don't want that secret out okay you know they talked about voter suppression to voter ID laws no no this has been the great conservative scam all along or suppressing the millennial vote by hiding stamps at post offices and CBS is in supermarkets they this is how we complicate their voting\nOn the one time I tried to buy stamps that he be asking do you think sound like an here like the like the un Philip stickers and ... and I said and they weigh more than ... should I buy them at\nCBS markup yeah you should probably find that police shot and it's now it's like [laughter]\nAll right so uh this is a New York magazine article they went out and interview people who are probably not going to vote in the upcoming election one week from now or this is in a age Twenty one New York New York\nI'm trying to register in my hometown of Austin, Texas ... New York New York city registering her hometown of Austin, Texas it's such a tedious process to even get registered in Texas let alone vote as an absentee there's no notification service about the status of my registration there's a small outdated website where you can enter your information and check\nWhen I was at the post office to register this poor girl clearly also a college student like me didn't know what post marked man had no idea how to send an important documents by mail most people my age have zero need to go to the post office and they have never stepped into one before honestly if someone had just had\nThe forms printed for me and was willing to deal with the post office I'd be much more inclined\nThan I was in college I think my parents were air followed that I Would take that route as as that girls in the last segment that ... I'm not doing that to my mom would call me on a daily basis and say I got this forms leaves about did you vote yeah are you voting\nSee they actually they they made it really easy at boat and they actually set up a the Brunswick County clerk actually set up a polling place in the union so you if you were walking through like anywhere on campus they made it so easy to vote and it was always so pissed off about it\nBecause I knew exactly how all of them were voting and you'd have these ... out of state college students all in a line in the college Democrats are walking up to up and down the line saying a vote no on one yes on to yes on three no on four\nAnd they're saying yes to all these bond initiative just like hey you guys are college students like a get it\nYou're hoping change do you want to go vote for Barack Obama you want to vote for gay marriage like I get that but don't vote on the bond issues do you're not you're not sticking around to pay off the bond issues like these these are my people that you're settling with all this debt for some environmental project or some water projects some union handout but don't don't vote on the bond issues but\nI think a good amount of millennials vote for the stamp yeah I voted stamp and then they put it on social media ... you\nAll right I've got to get to this last one Jocelyn grace refused to read it because she thought that it would be unfair this is a Jocelyn from Arlington, Massachusetts on why she's not going to vote it was easier to get my medical marijuana card no right or even federally legal than it was to register to vote Massachusetts had online registration but only if you have a DMV issued I date\nI don't drive so I was like okay I can register in person but I'm also dealing with a chronic illness every\nDay's a guessing game am I going to fill up to doing it today I put it off the week before the deadline ended up being really sick and I wasn't able to leave home you can send in your registration by mail but I didn't\nGet as far as I'm concerned how he'll be back tomorrow it's free [laughter]\nThis will not of course include person born in the United states who are foreigners\nAliens who belong to the families of ambassadors or foreign ministers accredited to the government of the United states\nBut will include every other class of persons\nThat's right notch foreigners okay this is different than do people who are permanent residents who are green card holders there are no longer foreigners they may not old citizenship but they're not consider foreigners for the purposes of this discussion\nBut it is very clear should be very clear that it was never the intention\nOf um the ... of the\nPeople who are drafting this of the senator back in Eighteen sixty six Jacob how for example who was who was talking about this amendment and there were dropping some and it was never there intention that this would extend to people who are in the United states illegally\nAnd now this is where we get into some complexity and some difficulty because for quite a while now it has been treated as such and this is where we get the anchor baby phenomenon right if you come into America and you have a child\nThe law has been the way that the federal government has interpreted the laws that we have on the books\nIs that you have a citizen now or you have citizenship\nSo if you come into America you have a child that child ISIS's this has led to some open it outright scams of the system most notably with the citizenship or you know or a birth tourism or citizenship are scams that are on\nAnd there have been all stories on that so where in California particularly you have people from East Asia who will fly to California and stay in\nA specific hotel and and the whole purpose of this is the they're\nWhen they're you know nine months pregnant so that they give birth here that with a child that citizenship in this country and they can then go back to the mainland China or wherever and then when they want to go to college or they want to you know moved to the states when they're older they already have citizenship\nWell gee that's that's a pretty that's a pretty sweet deal isn't it but citizenship is not supposed to be a commodity that people can just sort of snacks for themselves whenever they want they're supposed to be more to it than that\nAnd we obviously can tell that it's a scam when people are showing up here and just having a child and then leaving\nBut oh but it's a citizen right all but this person's a citizen people say ... what about military what about um bachelor's abroad yeah they're on official government business and they're abroad on behalf of the United states so it's obvious that there should be and has been an exception for people under those circumstances\nBut illegal aliens\nThis by the way it goes right to the heart of of what the what the Democrats have been not just allowing but encouraging now for decades which is people violate our laws\nAnd then they benefit from that violation of law and they are a combination of emotional appeal and political pressure\nOverrides an actual plane interpretation of what the statutes are\nAnd it's unfair to the American people\nOur government is supposed to be putting our interests ahead of the interest of those and the rest of the world who just want to be here and that means enforcing what yes I understand on a philosophical level who's a citizen of what country who's born in ... in one country another that's all it's unfair\nBut life is unfair and nation states are inherently somewhat arbitrary system just like the lines on a map at separate them are generally arbitrary yes some of them have geographic boundaries but a lot of the time it's just okay well that's where the line that's where the line is\nAnd if there is no government enforcement of that than the line ceases to exist if there is no government enforcement of laws around immigration than those laws in effect cease to exist and then you keep working back from this and you find yourself saying whoa whoa hold on a second here\nWhat Democrats really what Democrats really want and what do they believe the fourteenth amendment says and and they clearly believed that and and ... it's not just believe that it's also desire\nOr that anyone who comes to this country and has an anchor baby a we'll have that person to be a citizen because then that makes it a that makes it much much\nMore likely that later on that person will be able to sponsor all that's\nRight you get to sponsor family family reunification right\nSo if you if you come let's say from Honduras because that's in the news a lot right now if you come from ... to the United states you're waiting to find out if you get asylum\nYou have a ... maybe a five year lag you have a baby in America but you're you're not in the country in any permanent status you around the country even really legally you're going through a process to determine your legality if you\nHave that child\nIn America and then you go back to Honduras let's just say theoretically you could have family reunification migration ... chain migration to bring interest the family in the oil revenues have one kid in America I Know you're already at the front of the line\nWhen it comes to the immigration system yeah so think about the it's not just the incentive for that one child that's the incentive for the entire family now\nYou know the uh what was it the er I'm trying to remember the name of the group but I Do I can tell you the center for Immigration Studies there you go\nAbout a fifth\nOne in five and twenty four seven hundred and Ninety One thousand\nA birth in the United states were to in immigrants whether legal or illegal and illegal immigrants counted for seven point five percent which is almost three hundred thousand so in twenty four teams bleed the three hundred thousand illegal aliens had\nIn the United states but it's not just that three hundred thousand or so remember that's a few years ago it could be even higher now it's a three hundred thousand plus then the likely sponsoring of their entire family for unification oh but maybe it's even more complicated than that\nBecause once you've had that child in this country let's say that you are here illegally and you've had a child now you have a citizen child you know the Democrats are going to say oh we can't separate families\nSo forget about whether they can even sponsor the rest of the family for a for a legal immigration system ah forget about that right because now what you have is just the politics and the emotional appeal\nOf oh\nOh hold on a second you already have a citizen citizen Charlotte American citizen Trump of course we can't send you back of course you can't be deported hence the phenomenon of an anchor\n\nSo I just discovered ... dot com it's a totally addicted new jewelry site with big

typically it's going into mutual funds or exchange traded funds that we're using to accumulate wealth during our working years are high earning years\nThat whole equation changes once we retire and we hit age sixty five Seventy and we say gee son of a gun I Need to take some income from my portfolio\nYeah if it really does change and specifically you are going to more of an income generation mindset and it's difficult today because if you will get a lot of the ways that people historically did that CDs yielding five percent\nBonds yielding five or six percent or you don't have those tools available anymore so you need to make sure that you're still adapting your portfolio to the new demands of retirement\nBut you need to make sure that you using the right instruments and so that can be a combination of dividend paying stocks it can be equities that you simply think you're going to grow in poll little principle off there as well as hey the right mix of bonds that can generate some income as well what about municipal bonds is that something that people use\nIt is in particular if you are in a high income bracket it's something that a lot of people using that we tend to target

Andrew Gillum is an example of somebody who\nI I don't know how you can think he's a good idea of the state of Florida I mean I we've played it on this show and the Florida election I think is probably going to get more national attention than any other election and his mentor\nBut Gillum guy with a lot of people focused on obviously he's a young telegenic African American and you know so and and the state of Florida politically\nIs a kind of Lynch pins state or anybody in twenty twenty and that's why you know when you when you look at this and you try and assess\nThe conversation around this raise you got to remember that it's not just even about this it's about how it\nThe future\nUh for the Democrat Party and you know there's going to give them though we we've talked or we've talked about it before on the show doesn't know how we pay for some of these programs doesn't know how he would\nUh actually improve health care but really what it comes down to is a lot of these politicians they they talk of the game about how they're going to get more health care to people really just they're gonna raise taxes and expand Medicaid\nThat's all it's going to be raised taxes expand Medicare\nAnd Medicaid health outcomes are really poor and you're not going to get better health outcomes just by adding more state dollars thrown into programs you know we we've seen this with schools\nYou can spend a lot of money on schools and have them be bad you can spend a whole lot more a lot less money on schools and have them be good but the lid answer is always just more money for schools\nThat's more money more money and when you look and pull it apart you actually get into the nuts and bolts of what's happening in our education system which\nYou see is that the money isn't going to the kids it's not even one of the teachers going through these bureaucrats administrative the teaching system what do you thing happens with the state state paid for medical systems a tremendous amount of waste and abuse so I mean given image the bad idea but you also get a sense he's kind of a it's kind of a nasty guy\nUm you know he's very very willing to uh say whatever he thinks he has to say about the opposition which I guess it's true of all Democrats these days but it's quite fourteen\nAnd most of the fact is is\nHow the given too much harbor a two races and you know\nAnti Semite he himself when he became the Republican nominee went on Fox News to the voters afloat and that's a monkey the state of price race has been an issue from the very beginning or in this campaign because I introduce my grandmother used to have the same [noise]\nEver ever [laughter]\nBecause you both get dirty but he actually like\nOffensive is from what to do is a threat to the gutter yeah but I\nThink if they can survive getting dirty I can survive\nNow let me just take a moment of stand back with you and just admire what what happened there\nThat is a rhetorical technique known as ... veteran CEO is I could talk about how my opponent is a complete moron who would be nowhere without his family money but I'm not going to do that it is doing the thing that you say you will not do\nAs a form of attack and a\nA print or its CEO in this case is on full display he says well you know dissenters said monkey it up about the state and he's clearly saying to send it to the races that's what that is with any but then he immediately switches to budge I don't want to play dirty and wrestle with pigs why won't\nDo that or the the classic cynical technique of politicians and it's right there on display for you from uh from Guillaume or who I Would notice my understanding is Tallahassee he's got a lot of problems in the city which is not surprising at all\nBut speaking of the supporters of the left or this was during a moment of silence for Pittsburgh victims Marsha Blackburn had a had a rally and she called for a moment of silence for the victims in Pittsburgh and here's what happened\nWe think that the way to make this problem better is bring people in who need even more out of the government that they given\nThen they pay in this is nonsense\nPeople will say there was like oh they ... they'll they'll they'll be paying taxes to really\nA vast majority of people who are earning what illegal aliens earn are going to over the course of their lifetime paid much more and government benefits and they pay in taxes but even close\nSo how does this make us wealthier better off with the country by the way we're always hearing about how divided we are as a nation oh we're so divided\nOkay how is it supposed to make us less divided you bring people into this country or allow them to come into the country and say who do not speak the language who do not share our culture and whose first by definition first act on us soil is to break the law\nThat is going to bring us together that has some\nUnifying effect that uh up to this point the most of us have been on aware of that that that strikes me as very strange that strikes me as very unlikely\n\nBut they've been lying to us about this for a long long time there are many many people who have a vested interest\nIn propagating this lie even further and propping up\nOh Schmidt by the way is not is not done with the big by job though that they Betty de ... but ...\nKellyanne Conway despicable early\nToday goes on national television and she said well this shooter's motives were because there's an anti religious sentiment no man the propaganda industry that she commands with the ... president that she serves a bet it by ...\nAnd Rush Limbaugh at Breitbart and news pastors and judicial watch and all the rest of them have blood on their hands for the insight match that they have made that have triggered\nAn radicalized these crazy people it is delivered in in ... he said the mother and a lot of religious guys aggressively\nAggressively stupid and the fact that he was in charge of the McCain presidential campaign to any level that was really all you need to know but why McCain's campaign was do you also was the one I think that Sarah Palin as the BP was a great a great idea writer who was part of that whole process\nSo but it but to the to the main point here\nClaiming that Breitbart and\n... a rash and live in and others have a lot of their hands is just is just a a a smear each just slanderous\nIt has no basis in any reality especially because the first of all really he's he's going to go out he's going to go after ... after ... after an anti Semitic shooting in a synagogue these complete book food on MSNBC speaking about propaganda that's out there he's going to go after mark Levin\n\nWow I mean it showed brazen that there I just can't figure out is she too stupid to know the full scope of what he's saying or is he in fact just that cynical but he doesn't care\nAnd that MSNBC put this on the air and allows us to continue by the way I'm sure
