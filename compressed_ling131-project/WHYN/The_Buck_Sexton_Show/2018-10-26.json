{"month": "10", "state": "MA", "station": "WHYN", "content": "Have some consequences for those who were part of a smear effort my French Shawn Davis over at the federalist has the following\nQuote Grassley is criminal referrals of ... and sweat Nick also contains new evidence that sweating it has a history of making false rape charges\nUnder penalty of perjury an ex boyfriend says she explicitly threatened to falsely accused him of rape and\nHave him deported Grassley has criminally referred ... and sweat and into the deejay the FBI for three specific felonies\nConspiracy to defraud the United states oh barring the over broad but\nA show both sides live under it um favorite tool of Muller materially false statements to federal officials and deliver obstruction of a federal investigation\nWow\nOh yes this needs to happen I think Grassley is no fool Grassley is a serious and very powerful guy in the Senate and\nThis referral is going to be tough to ignore the department of justice is going to have to look into this and that means folks that there could be unlike the proceeding that the left was so excited to use to try and smear Kavanaugh which was not a\nStandard criminal proceedings right there they could not subpoena people they could not uh take their phone records it by the way they're no phone records to take the allegations were from thirty five years ago or whatever it was just the whole thing was insane and I'm so I'm going to say that I Am so proud\nOf what we did hear on the show me and bike and John the whole team and all of you supporting me when that was a really difficult a couple of weeks especially in the early days we knew it was garbage and we held the line\nWe kept our shield sigh yes we did\nWe held the line on this one and people notice by the way\nThere was a front line on defending have it all and we here in the freedom that we were on that front lawn\nPublicly in every possible way I was in contact with the White House team I was trying to get in through the confirmation on a near daily basis\nShow 'em\nThat Grassley is not passing this thing up and saying okay you know we'll let bygones be bygones is the right move and this could this this will mean that the deal Jay now has the ability\nTo pull records you know they they might be able to see some communications perhaps between sweat making other people but\nYou know this ... you want to play in this game you want to try to lie and get somebody ruined and smear them you're gonna sign ridiculous sworn statements with no ... nobody would be able to tell you yes or no I mean\nThe whole thing if they can prove she lied if they can prove ... he was part of a conspiracy for her to lie they must both be criminally prosecuted\nThe law either matters or it doesn't there's really not a lot of room for interpretation\nHere if they can prove it now\nThere is the possibility that they won't be able to prove that sweating collide because her charges were so vague or the statement that she swore was so vague I was at a party in the eighties and there were gang rapes and I think maybe Kavanaugh was near the punch maybe he wasn't but then again she changed her testimony\nPublicly from what the sworn statement was which is when we all knew that this was not just a fix but an obvious\nFix my that was when it was clear to anyone paying attention okay this really is too much this person has a problem this person is ill is sick so um and that's where I think we are now but\nIf they they're they're going to try to do two things on the left now because by the way they really don't want can you imagine if Julie sweating it faces criminal prosecution for what happened there what then we're supposed to think what the other two women just they were the ones that were really attack but Julie sweating it just came out of nowhere to lie\nAbout what that does to the narrative and I am very clear on this one for if you can prove somebody makes a false criminal allegation against anyone they must suffer consequences because they are doing violence to the truth and they were trying to ruin someone's life is an attempted ruin nation of the human beings life\nThat must be punished crystal Gail magnum I told you this this was the\nUh the stripper who claimed with Mike knife on that despicable district attorney down in Durham North Carolina that did you cross team raped her it was a complete fabrication a total lie which you find the guy was raping or who was miles away at an ATM machine and they had\nHim on video and using his card there so kind of hard for him to raping her when he's a few miles away a complete fabrication they didn't press charges against her they did this far knife along and he should have gone to prison for a long time but that just to support him\nShe went on to kill her boyfriend stabbed to death later on maybe she should have actually had to deal with justice of course you should have had to deal with justice perhaps somebody would be alive today\nNot only did Kavanaugh survive and therefore due process survive with him through this process but if we really do care about truth and decency and justice in our system if we care about due process and\nThe right to protect your reputation in the right to face the acute the to face your accuser the right not to be destroyed at the political\nWhims of the left for their convenience\nThan people who live in order to destroy you under oath must be punished\nThe left as good a kicking scream over this one because it's a very bad look for them they know it now will they be able to prove this I Can't say quite yet is it clear to me that sweating it as a liar absolutely\nAbsolute as\nI Know she's a liar not just based on statements he made a base in the contradictions overstatement if you don't say I think someone spiked punch at a party which what what would that even mean\nThat was such a crazy thing to say in the first place he spiking what he's drinking the punch\nHow was your spiking the punch he's gonna he's going to poison or very or get super drunk all of his male friends too so that they pass\nOut and can't move think about that she didn't she didn't say spiking of drinks spiking an entire punishable that everyone's ... yeah maybe he was putting alcohol in it so that everybody could have some alcohol but he was the whole thing it's just it's none of it rang true it was a fabrication out of this woman's mind she's deranged she neurons I mean\nAnd that's where they're going to say if if they really nail her on the lie\nThe story will be she's not a sound mind let's let this go she suffered a novel that kind of stuff I'm Sorry I Know if she was of sound mind enough to bring these charges

to this country and get kinda tired of this caravan any kind of our country and well they returned home\nOkay that's true but but but but\nThey're being coached along the way they are being told exactly what to say all they have to do was establish a record and that just means saying they don't even have to\n\nIt's it's sort of switched around it used to be\nThat Central American immigrants at the border would would would lie and say they were Mexican because if they were going to be detained and sent back they didn't want to get flown back to Central America because they spend a lot of time and money often do you get to the border\nAnd so they would rather just be released back into Mexico you their Central America but now that's changed because of this asylum claim situation and as long as\nAs long as they can\nI'm\nConvinced a border patrol agent or a few border patrol agents and the immigration and Customs Enforcement process that they are from Honduras um they're going to be part of this asylum deal right they're going to get brought in and letting the injured the United states and uh as I've been telling you that's not going to that's just\nThere's never going to be real enforcement alright\nWhat can be done about is how much can you hear all bucket oh what do you go to\nThe issue the ultimately the thirty thousand foot level Congress needs to change the law so that it is very clear that asylum in the new to change the asylum process so that you apply in your in your country or in the nearest country you can get you\nOut of a U.S embassy and that there is a process it it should not be that you just present yourself in this way out of port of entry\nUm because you're in walking within walking distance the United states that's not that's not the way that this law should be but uh as important that there's something called a safe third part say third country agreement\nIs well I can tell you things on the show that you won't hear from other people because I actually read lots of things and do lots of research because if you were kind enough to spend your time with me I have a mandate to make sure that it's time well spent team\nSo the say third a third country agreement would mean and we have one with Canada by the way so this is not some crazy concoction and we've we've discussed the possibility of this uh at the government the government level with Mexico but what it would mean is that we would set up\nThe border but on the Mexican side of the border we yes we would probably have to pay for this and I was a book they should they should pay for it but go a lot faster and much more effective if we pay for it we would set up a centrally\nTrailers you know a holding facility Sunday is the tension facility but it's\nA what would be somewhat similar to a a refugee camp situation it would be a place where people you know they have\nUh they're they're able to stay safe there's water there's food um but it's on the Mexican side of the border and we would move infrastructure down to the border so that you have\nPort of entry courts\nSo you would start would move the judicial infrastructure to deal with these immigration cases right down to the border and people that were waiting for their adjudication ... so that would speed it up obviously and people that are waiting for their education process would be on the Mexican side of the U.S border\nWhich means that they don't uh they're they're not able to just go further and further and ensure United States and get some you know immigrant rights lawyer to represent them pro bono to keep suing the federal government all the rest of it if their claim is denied guess what they they get to stay in Mexico\nOr or the Mexican government then can can hand them off to their country of origin\nThat way you prevent what's happening right now which is using the legal system is very important we understand that they are not illegal immigrants\nThey may cross illegally so then they are in the U.S illegal but at the moment that they say I have a credible fear of my safety these Honduran immigrants\nGo into the asylum process and then they're due process allows them to stay in the United states that is the law I've talked to senior immigrations officials about this is talk of war is about this that's how this works so we need to take action here beyond just\nPart one point with ...\nPercent chance yeah I said I'm going to allow that ... percent chance at the bike us having if I find all it all the things that are going on to care that have a little\nAdapter that herbal sense anyway having I think the caravan to as I can I be incredibly ... to get to the border I'm at you know on the day of the election again that's that's not right in fact I think you'd have to understand I very much on health light pole\nSo okay\nI mean a bruise your Mike right I Want to bring you as an as an impartial observers here that you know you can tell it's a little there's a little bit back and forth but there's nothing to do crazy there right\nNow that was good at the conversation this is exactly the guy's a spirit of conversation and then things get a little a little more tests like Ninety\nThere was another tweet that said the Democratic party is comprised of\nRacist white liberal that is correct and I write the slight well let's go back um and let's say I will say that that many people in the ... are not aware of what's called ... that I Am concerned about the color and the White House um why why would you ask a question\nThat has you speak about black shale oil and why why we got to laugh at that is why don't you ask that question today because I ... and ... and about that\nBecause you're bringing a whole group of young African American leader so I said this is something that I talk about ... light levels don't realize that will put on that\nThe race caution that ... ... ... ... ... ... that you place it only had how they're going to crash it that way okay yeah I ... had a conversation about ... that will shape full\nAnd apply that will shift is ... I don't agree with that if I don't look a little quaint and others I ... I had trouble at the private\nStack and try to challenge Congress ... surrounded by right\nYeah I felt like I got a little like I look at their word yelling were civil but\nI felt like a little bit tension there producer Mike yeah definitely it was fun I like watching it and I like looking at the [laughter]\nThis is the problem whatever whatever we have a segment like this and I'm like well that's not really the ... the show every book shut up people are funny [laughter] I'm like well wait I thought\nThey thought we were the truck tree I thought this was a mess that it I think we're all going to supposed to like you know buck slap each other and I'm not even ... there there's more there were I'm like okay because the control room because I kept going beyond replay their their control rooms like we've got to go to break we got to get a break and I'm like okay we're going to break Chris was like no not done I was like damn okay here we go\nSo uh yeah it was a spicy spicy\nWondering whether we'll get we'll get producer Michael one of these panels man that oh man\nMy could we do that absolutely right yeah the bosses would never be the fed will never be the same again buck I Know exactly what Mike Mike slaps will be like new truck bomb it like being left living I'm real quiet it on assuming tell them not yeah no no he's from your do your your feisty and I know the Irish are\n... to go on one one thousand Native American but I'm half are good things are thanks where I see I Want to make sure that we got producer Mike in with the\nWith the objective opinion there because you know for me it's like I mean I obviously ideologically agree with Candice I'm and and I I think that she's very talented and but I also am very ah very fond of crystal even though I think that her politics or\nOr I'm\nWrong [laughter] so you know we were just it was it was quite an exchange there and um we'll see\nTomorrow I'll give you a little preview later on in the show with the expectation is for a for tomorrow there might be I might be involved in a a shall we say more more spirited discussion tomorrow things I might be the one that actually has to do a bit of a bit of debate\nBut we've got a I don't we don't have time to get the pop adopt ...\nThe funding to say the men that guys that guy's been treated turban certain says well you know we we can actually do a little bit of it so I interviewed Papadopoulos we're this one today and here's what he said about the notion of Russia collusion play twenty\nGeorge what is what are your feelings now that it it has come out it's been a reporter here at the hill that there was an exculpatory evidence based on your conversation with an FBI informant that you weren't trying to do anything wrong that you oppose any trees in our collusion that that information may not have been presented to the Pfizer court what do you think about that\nOf course it was for me it's a it's a very sad it was I was impressed when John reporting but for me it was a sad day to see that ah that was not presented to the price of the court\nAnd that in my entire image has been characterized by this false narrative that I Am some sort of patient zero uh about a Russian conspiracy and a a Russian a Coca Cola collusion conspiracy when in fact I have absolutely no Russian\nContacts whatsoever I've never traveled to Russia I don't speak Russian I don't even have Russian American friends are in this country so um when I found myself at the epicenter of this a conspiracy as somebody who actually has no rush of contacts something just to not smell right at all to me\nGeorge Papadopoulos who\nRemember when when it looked shaky on Carter Page you also had nothing to do with collusion or conspiracy running this stuff\nWith a look shaking him as the auto Papadopoulos that's how the FBI justify this investigation that that it was supposed to be Papadopoulos I'm telling you people who believe that Papadopoulos was part of some of some crumbling back conspiracy will believe\nAnything don't believe anything\nThis you know normal rational person could sit down and look at the facts talked to this guy and come away with thinking yeah that's right he was trying to throw a presidential election that\nHe's utterly insane orderly insane\nThere's just no\nRationale to write all other than it it it explains for some people\nOr gives them an outlet for their anti Trump rage and anything that gives them an outlet for anti Trump raged they are in favor of so if someone will tell them that there was a massive conspiracy to undermine the election everything and they have to believe that this total ...

Fox News federal and local authorities now looking at Florida as an area of interest as they hunt for the person or persons responsible the series of suspected bombs sent to several high profile Democrats and the other day one was founded dressed actor Robert Deniro package\nIn an off to the kind of start that you would have expected for somebody who was getting paid producer Mike what twenty mill do we know\nTwenty million a year I mean she's making like LeBron James money\nTo do a job that and that ten million dollar new studio they built for so she's making LeBron James money to do a job that\nA lot of other people could do quite honestly better than her for about a tenth of the money\nI in fact there were other people doing the job before that we're getting better ratings and we're making a fraction of her salary people water but\nExecutives at these places these are big public companies place you know NBC and NBC Universal on their own by big paramount or big a parent not paramount parent companies and uh\nYou know they could they can determine what the salary is right that's 'cause we've got shareholders public companies lots of ways to slash the money around without any Bruce or Mike oh no no no my kids in sixty nine mill none of them like I Know that for now that's her severance I'm In a year in salary\nThat's for her full they're paying out her full contract that's what that sixty nine mill is I'm I'm Talking about you know the uh\nThe year to year so we should make a lot of money\nBut if they go oh she really work that the answer was no\nUm you know they some of these people will get\nIn touch with the corporate structure at these places and they get huge huge paychecks but anyway\nSo then Megan Megan a had a few bumps here or there forget exactly what they were but she oh she brought up a Jane Fonda is plastic surgery which I didn't realize Jane Fonda would be so sensitive about but she was and it was kind of a weird thing to bring up in the interview on the circumstances\nAnd that was kind of a bomb for a you know for her to bring up in that way just wasn't wasn't smart and anyway the latest controversy which has gotten her ousted got her booted from NBC\nWhich remember she gets booted right away for this folks you know\nSpecial sex dungeon door closed by button under the desk Matt Lauer guy was there for decades and\nWas the the the chosen one I mean the the face of that network twenty million dollars plus a year I think it was actually making more like Fifteen when he was twenty five million a year they're paying ... unbelievable sum of money\nFor a skinny balding we'd who was completely replaceable by about a hundred different people but Andy lack in these people that NBC make decisions like Matt Lauer that's all you have to do that like you you're good you know\nIt's not about the ratings it's not about the audience really what the what the exact thing in the in the east we were the C suite the corporate suite east we should be the way it's called\nSo Megan decided than in a segment on Halloween and political correctness decided to tackle the subject well that was the subject and and here's what you well let's start with what she said that got her in trouble John Cleese place that click\nAnd you get in trouble if you are a white person who puts on or a black person ... white the low in\nLike a kid that was okay as long as you're addressing other character controversy on there are places in New York with the land as she is Diana Ross and she made her skin darker than it really is and people said that that was racist\nAnd could she wants to look like a A N around one day\nI I don't know how that got ... Holloway\n\nSo she didn't say anything racist what she said was that she doesn't think that people necessarily dressing in costume when they dark and their skin to be in costume should be considered racist now you could agree or disagree with her I Would note that a lot of you probably like the movie\nTropic Thunder I think it's a very funny movie I think the best part of the movie is\nUh what's his name Morton Downey junior rather go please Iron Man isn't that his name William what's his name again you got to leave me out here to dry\nWhere what his name John ... Robert died Robert ... Robert Downey Jr and Robert Downey do more than yeah Robert Downey junior so so he uh you know\nHe ... he was in black face in that show I mean in that movie he was he was driven by his pretend to be black men in black face and they make fun of it during the movie and it works and everything's pretty much it's a funny movie\nYou know there was no picketing there were no people freaking out about it at least not really and a movie did pretty well actually so there are situations in which culturally black face has not\nBeen deemed to be a insulting and racist I I just named one now I also can understand why given the history of\nSlavery and segregation in this country and the way people use to dress in black face in in in ... [noise] excuse me in mockery uh that that would be offensive to some\nPeople I get that I'm I'm not but I'm just saying that she is not even really taking a definitive declared his position on all the she's just trying to have the conversation\nBut because she veered away from black race under any and all circumstances is racist is wrong is terrible really any darkening of the skin is part of a costume is racist and wrong and terrible NBC just I mean they had different anchors coming after\nNBC just fed her to the wolves\nOn this one and then that led to this which\nI always find\nSo depressing and and the whole thing is always so sad the Soviet style show trial forced apology um here's what she said in an effort obviously to keep her job one that was doomed to fail before she went on the air please play her apology\nShall I making tally and I want to begin\nWith two words I'm Sorry [noise] he made her they answered a we had a discussion here about political correctness and Halloween costumes\nAnd that conversation turned to whether it has ever okay for a person of one race to dress up as another a black person making their face later or white person making their darker to make a costume complete I defended the idea saying as long as it as it was a respectful and part of the Halloween costume fooled okay\nWell I was wrong and I am sorry\nOne of the great parts of sitting in his chair each day is getting to discuss different points of view and as I talk and sometimes I listen\nAnd yesterday I learned\nI learned that given the history of blackface being used an awful way by race is in this country it is not okay for that to be part of a costume Halloween or otherwise\nNow\nI could have told her of making it called me up and I will have a soft spot for her because she used to be nice you know started my career and having on her show and\nUsed to tell me that I was very talented and had a huge future and that I was amazing when I filled in for Rush Limbaugh and I was you know her favorite of all the Rush Limbaugh feelings and and you know so so I have a secret soft spot maybe not so secret anymore from and kill it I'm just going to be honest about that okay I Do\nEven though I think that she turned on her people and bitter horrible decision by going to NBC and was on grateful for the positions you had a box and all that okay fine\nI would've advised her because I understand how this game is played now because I have to deal with it from both sides and no one's paying me tens of millions of dollars not even anything in the universe of that\nTo do this kind of work that once you're in this kind of a gym you can't you can't take the oh my gosh I throw myself from the mercy of the politically correct to court\nOh my gosh please please just just let me keep my job I'm\nSo sorry I'm so sorry because there has been a a very clear shift\nWe're now when you upset the PC police now when\nThe social justice warriors come for you\nYou have two choices\nFights and go down fighting or enjoy ritualized apology humiliation and then let them take your head those are the choice that's it and maybe you win the\nFight by like maybe you're able to defend yourself and and see it through and but I promise you if you do the oh my gosh mayor cobalt I'm so sorry I'm so terrible I should never have thought such as the number to then they just go see it's like a it that's why I said at the Soviet charge for all this is you've you've signed your confession now you're\nDefinitely guilty now they definitely have to\nDestroy you now they absolutely have to ruin and they will\nHow Megan did not know that is I don't know beyond me she should have known that\nShe absolutely should have been aware that they wanted to get rid of her anyway her show's ratings were not strong the NBC audience was not warming to her she's not a morning show\nHost this was not a risk oh I Know you don't really care about all that but the politically correct part of the the social justice war aspect of this and how she came up against them it's a reminder to all of us\nWhen you have aired unless you feel a personal moral obligation to apologize to an individual you don't apologize do not apologize to the mob do not\nSay you know it it must you truly believe that you don't think you will appease the mob unless you have trends Greste in your own mind unless your own honor\nMiss sets the tapes apology and then you'll just deal with the consequences but do not think that this is now the penance\nIs the apology oh no no no the apology is the news that they will hang you that's how this works the apology he's signing your own confession and the court so they can lock you away in the gulag that's how this works\nUm and uh somebody may seem when I was on a special report earlier tonight on Fox News which you can still go check out our mind if you want to uh put the clip up on Facebook\nI reject I'm Sorry I reject out of hand there's this notion that there is equal blame on both sides yeah there's blame on both sides but there was not equal blame on both sides of the political climate in this country\nAre a Trump making fun of journalists who are the most pompous preening overpaid annoying people on the planet as far as I'm concerned\nTrump making fun of them is not tantamount to a fascist state meanwhile people reporting we're supposed to be serious journalist reporting on the existence of a creeping fascism because of Trump\nThey are doing very real damage to\nOur ability to have any kind of political discussion in this country and they're obviously enhancing the likelihood of there being ugly incidents with all the stuff that we're going on so I I just I refuse to play along the way that they want and say yeah you know what all sides have a problem here\nHow what Trump even to this is something I Want to I Want to leave with on this and then we got to talk about Hillary in a moment you're getting ready for it it's got me how could Trump even comply with what they're saying here let's say Trump came out and said I won't use enemy of the people anymore for the media I won't say that any more\nDo you think that then they'd say oh okay that's reasonable\nYeah you know Trump toning down the rhetoric I guess he's not such a bad guy after all I Know I I guess I guess we've gotta let it\nYou know they would do that\nYou know that's not what happened that's not what they say they would say oh that's not even a start to this oh he's so terrible\nThey just want to hate him\nThey don't really want him to change his behavior even if he did change his behavior wouldn't really matter to them\nWouldn't matter so I'm\nJust note that by the way you know one one little sudden I'll throw in there I've never really cooked bone and pork chop before and this weekend I'm hoping to actually give it a try went to a butcher especially Bush or and got a couple of big thick bone in Port jobs are going to make a little spice rubbed Ford them married them overnight\nTried to sue the my cast iron I miss talking to you all about my corner adventures it's been a while and I haven't had the time to cook recently\nSo this is the I'm going to try to bring this back because one of those things that when it's done right I just think so incredible is they shared\nA shared bone and pork chop is something special as you can tell I haven't eaten yet and I'm doing this radio show and I am\nThat's what got me my mind my mind shifted deport Joplin because I'm starving and it's been a long day um but we do have to talk about Hillary coming up your men roll call and then maybe I'll get this year and myself a pork chop\nSo much more\nMoney matters minute you've brought you might be

reporting that the usage of cell phones and cell phones ... might have been part of this as well especially once you figure it out where the drops were for this mail\nYou could probably pull cell phones within a certain radius and this guy had his phone on him um then they have a way of narrow things down it he also is a certainly not a criminal mastermind buddy career criminal\nWith a wrap sheet of all I mean not so much stuff that I Can't even think of it all on my head and he's got all kinds of a criminal activities background including a previous previous bomb threats\nUm previous bomb threat I think for two thousand and two as well as drugs stuff and stealing and he's he's got he's got a long long wrap sheet\nSo the threat based on everything we know it was completely gone there is nothing there's nothing to suggest that this guy had any one assisting him there's any cell or cluster hear anyone else that his operation on his behalf this was a lone crazy in a van\nThe van which you may very well have seen already\nThe van is covered in pro Trump and ... and CNN sucks and other anti\nA mainstream media stuff he clearly was very attuned to the rhetoric of the right and particularly of Donald Trump himself in a way that\nIs being seized on 'em now look ... we we left open the possibility all week that there would be\nA few different ways that this could go right that there would be a few different possibilities for motive here\nUh we discussed that it could be a crazy we discussed that it could be a yes it could have been a false flag operation but there was no evidence to support anything other than bombs are being sent it was a very dangerous situation needed to be a fixed\nDealt with as soon as possible what's also just take them home and just say the law enforcement did an incredible job here and they should be commended for working under tremendous pressure and doing show uh with the entire country watching in\nA very much paying attention to every move here by the way a little more from attorney general sessions he actually read out the charges place well\nHe's been charged today with five federal crimes including interstate transportation I'm an explosive ... university\nHere sessions intersections read it out again a lot of charges he's facing life in prison\nIs facing life so uh that's this is really over with now there's not all that much to say nobody was even injured in this so thank God um but there's just now and entirely political discussion that's where this goes there's not a security and law enforcement\nWas on the ball got this guy tracked\nHim down everything that we thought would happen with this happened this was really textbook from an investigative standpoint now this is the food fight that we've all known was already happening\nBut now it's going to get even worse about how this is Trump's all they want to say that this is ... doesn't matter that we didn't blame the laugh we didn't blame Bernie Sanders himself for the James Hodgkinson shooting on that baseball diamond doesn't matter that\nEach a fallacy to assume that somebody who says something that has not calling for inspiring violence can be blamed for the violent acts\nOf another person who happens to agree with a public persona a politician any number of different things um this is on tenable we can't actually be forced\nTo take responsibility for actions that other people do not based on what we tell them to do but based on them\nFact that they have their own demons their own problems and they are crazy but be prepared\nFor an avalanche fear of media coverage and commentary particularly commentary about how Trump\nNeeds to change his town Trump has to stop calling the media fake news yet to stop he used to stop doing everything that that they don't like\nThis now is the secret weapon that they have to get Trump to shut up and I'm here to tell you that\nWould be a huge mistake\nThis is not Trump's fault it's just not your fault that is not my fault we take no responsibility for this because we bear no responsibility for this we share ideas we fight for the truth and we will not\nBe forced into a mic position in our politics on our principles because of the the acts of one lone crazy man it's just not going to happen the media is going to try really hard they're going to engage

to have to go out and put a bullet and Donald Trump and that's a fact ...\nWe're going to talk about rhetoric and we can find all that for you very quickly very easily\nThat's all about is as overheated it gets isn't it a short of a direct exploitation of violence from a short of somebody saying go do this thing now although\nIn a you know it was pretty close there was some of what was being said I don't think that we need to have any lectures and the left about this I don't think that we need to\nIn fact I refuse to be lectured by the left on this issue\nI think they are disgraceful\nAnd the way that they have largely embraced mom tactics right now they've\nDefended them and that that's what's so different no one on the right is saying that this mad bomber was

any\nProminence known with any kind of following known of any of any decency or or public rip you would ever say such a thing\nAnd yet here we are\nBeing lectured by life I mean that the amount of jubilation I saw from the left on social media today when they found out that yes this guy's\nA as one Twitter user put itch a disguised van look like Steve Bannon was a transformer oh yeah there was a lot of a lot of pro Trump stuff all over it\nOr I referred to earlier days the Breitbart immobile which I was kidding obviously but you know there's a there's a fair amount of\nPro Trump

last Eighteen months but going forward they're going to use this as a hammer against us they're going to use this as a cudgel and a means of essentially blood joining us all into submission on is

you're a real baller like Bush when when Bush said Mr underestimated I knew exactly what he meant you know and that's no word when he called himself the decider\nThat wasn't technically a word either but it might as well up in a word and now it is or what I think it's great you know who's the decider say oh who's the person who makes the decisions I don't know the decider uh anyway so I made up or the let's get back to the substance or so they they're all saying these things about Trump\nVery nasty things very um two rockets or anything\nAnd then they all immediately jumped you it's Trump's fault\nIt is Trump's fault that this\nClearly disturbed very yes dangerous and and an evil but added pathetic human being or decided to send these these homemade there were pipe bombs and they were they were alive bombs I mean they could have gone off at this guy I knew what he was doing thank God they did not um but\nThere's really no principle that the left as using here to determine you know what is acceptable what is acceptable political speech and what does incitement it's just what is your side do that's bad but it's my side do that's okay and that's really the primary
