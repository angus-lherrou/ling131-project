that's what you can expect from Kavanaugh at all\nBut you know Obama's past shortcomings ... illegal activity whatever that was all charming and grade and you know evidence that Obama was cool\nA Bill Clinton's sexual improprieties which by the way I Would say are in a whole different category of anything that Obama did I'm not trying to see I I can make these distinctions the left will say yeah capitals like Bill Cosby 'cause they're idiots\nWe cannot encourage people that then take their politics take their psychotic beliefs their leftist delusions\nAnd then act upon them in the public

doc seeing fixation of different times is the New York times spent its\nInk on today so to speak Trump engage in suspect tax schemes as he ... a reach riches from his father\nIs very unusual for me to find myself trying to read a front page news papers story you know at a paper like this the New York times or big national paper and find myself barely able to get through\nThe issues I think it was twelve thousand words long is what I saw I mean this is like a novella\nAbout Trump and and here's the short version but I'll I'll get into what they're really trying to say or what what the purpose of all this is they're saying that Trump is in self made and that Trump and his whole family were engaged in quote suspect\nTax schemes now\nIs Trump's self made not it's not if you're going to say that he pulled himself up by his bootstraps and didn't get any money from his family of course not he got money for his family inherited a very large real estate portfolio and you know he was born rich no question about it\nNow has he built in ... in international brand and in Russia recognizable brand that did not exist are based on what he had been given inherited of course and did he inherited a political future than anyone ever think you'd be compressed the United states no\nSo I I don't think this is nearly as potent or criticism as the New York times thinks it is but they're saying oh his books and the art a deal and all this stuff is is a poke them I'd solved bunk nonsense\nThen there's the other part of it and and there's I when I say excruciating detail I really mean and they're like on any you know bought a whole bunch of white out to use for some paperwork back in Nineteen eighty seven and any I mean they're just\nMan this is an exhaustive they say it's based on a hundred thousand pages plus of documents in interviews and all this stuff and it felt like I was reading a hundred thousand pages of it myself\nReading this is a front page New York times story a or

five minutes ago it's easier to my son for me to get in the shade my Irish skin doesn't do well with it\nBut I couldn't help but think imagine if they had\nDone this kind of a deep dive into the

that they were getting offensively for charitable purposes in order to support different aspects of their lifestyle but I've never seen a comprehensive media\nDeep dive by any newspaper or any TV organization into what was really going on with the Clintons with the how is it that the Clintons were worth a hundred million dollars within a decade of leaving the White House a hundred million dollars plus\nRemember to have that you know you gotta make about a hundred and sixty a hundred and Seventy million\nTo have to be worth of a network of a hundred million I think they called us money what did they didn't they didn't own a company they didn't create a product\nHow they make all this money it's it's astonishing when you think about oh oh by giving speeches are some really amazing speech you find I have the best\nThat was kind of an sounding a little more like George our banks instead of Hillary and my my Hillary is getting a little rusty folks and in a more Hillary

it on the floor of the Senate so he couldn't be sued forties he's legally free to say whatever he wants there\nAnd it was intended to just be a political black guy for Romney that Harry Reid gave him and that was all that was what it was\nThe New York times says the Trump was engaged in these tax schemes that Trump was doing all this uh you know shady behind the scenes\nUm evading of what was due the government enemy Fred drunk pure and from a Donald Trump as well\nThey're saying this and we turn around and say well hold on a second this will never be adjudicated this will never see the inside of a court so how do we do if they're telling the truth about this or not is anyone really going to dive into this hundred thousand pages and also what is the shady tax dealing really mean\nDo they have them dead to writes on tax evasion no of course now they're saying that he did this and that and try to find all these different ways to avoid paying taxes really an avoidance of taxes is not

when the Palestinian authority declared itself to be the state of Palestine we don't recognize it as a state of Palestine we've consistently across democratic and Republican administrations opposed\nThe admission of Palestine or to the United nations has just said because it's not as\nBoom that's right like you had national security advisor bulletin there was like oh I'm Sorry you want

'cause she's already she's telling us what she thinks which is that it is on a helpful to refer to it as a show called state and I guess that reporter I don't even know where was I just heard the audio wherever it is I was not prepared for the fact that both in actually knows what the heck he's talking about\nAnd that there is no state of Palestine that does not exist that there's there's a reason why we don't talk about the state of Palestine because there is no state of Palestine and yet all these reporters hey if you were to ask\nThem and it it's amazing to me how many left wing

malign behavior\nThey see our comprehensive pressure campaign is serious\nWe must be prepared for them to continue attempts to hit back especially after a full sanctions are imposed re imposed on the

in the south very important for oil you got a lot a lot of oil the flows through there to port city\nThere were rocket attacks on the U.S consulate there they dishes Iranians trying to clap back if you will the United states after we pulled out of the Iran nuclear deal and I put sanctions back in place this has been a concern for a long time the Iranians control militias are inside of Iraq\nThe Iranians are able to escalate violence in Iraq whatever they want and they see this now is a way of\nJust look they haven't gone all out of the violence that that could happen in Iraq the sectarian violence is is pretty terrifying really it's it's horrifying what what could go on there this has been a concern all along and it might devolve back into a state of\nEssentially civil war like it was back in two thousand six two thousand seven between Sunni and Shia in Iraq and you've got the U.S caught in the middle in some ways we've about diplomatic personnel there obviously military military trainers still there\nBut the the Iranians are trying to show us that they can still cause problems\nFor the Trump Administration and palm ... who is acting as a diplomat here not a military man and saying look\nThere's not a not not a good move not a good plan the running to do this week we expect them to engage in this kind of behavior that doesn't obviously mean that we're going to be okay with it though the Iranians think that they can use paramilitaries and their proxy forces and places like Iraq to go after us to turn up the heat on\nOur interests um that's because\nThey actually can't win this game of well we're just going to allow the economy to keep getting getting pummeled while we hope that the international community comes to our side we hope that Trump you know the Iranians are hoping the Trump doesn't\nStay as president you know that they've got all these different ways that they can try to rationalize what's going on there at the end of the day Trump in Venice ration has taken a much tougher hand with Iran the Iran deal is Trump said when he was running for the presidency was terrible deal badly negotiated wasn't something than anybody\nShould have been proud over should have signed on to you and we're out and now the Iranians are starting to try to find ways to\nYou know just just to Ronald Ronald with sort a little bit you know foreign some rockets

I really feel for professor Ford as a you know and and and Brett Kavanaugh because they were mistreated by the Democrats if you look at her testimony especially you know about the question about when she was asked\nThat you know we have come come to you in California to be interviewed she basically was like I didn't know this nobody told me this lawyers\nThat the Democrats for\nNot informed of this option they wanted they wanted her to come to DC and they even tried to tell her to say oh tell her that's attorney client privilege and she was like no I I I would've I would've entertain them coming to me in and answer their questions in California\nI think that she really did not want things to go public that she just had some recollection that she wanted to keep quiet and then the Democrats said this is something we can use\nTo a store\nAnd she she will be I feel very badly for her obviously if you listen to her testimony something happened to Christine for something happened to her at a party but she can't she can't put Brett Kavanaugh there none of the people she said were there could put him there\nThe story changed the date changed\nThe story about having to doorways at our house really doesn't hold up because one of those entrances was made for an office at the house\nSo it wasn't about being panicked the story about being afraid to fly doesn't hold up because she flew all around the world and big planes in small planes\nI Know that that if you're afraid of flying because my wife is terrified of flying\nAnd if it's for work or pleasure it doesn't matter she thinks if you're in that plane something bad is going to happen so a ... if she truly had a fear of flying it wouldn't just the fact that in business relations were affected in every aspect of her life\nSo there's just too much there to hang this on Kavanaugh now did something happened to her yeah probably she was in a school where there's a lot of drinking and by the way\nWe'll get into the devil's triangle tonight because they yearbooks are really going to weigh into my conversations this evening I've done a little bit of snooping Jeremy Jeremy or can I ask when you graduated high school\nI graduated in Ninety seven and here's here's a here's here's another thing that I'd like to throw out there to okay you're listening to this this is something I'm not a victim of sexual assault but my wife was when she was younger literally Thirty years ago when she was\n\n\n\nSo or go on line to get yours today or any time and money\nAnd now look back at this week in history\nThis week an eighty Ninety an act of Congress creates Yosemite National park it's almost such natural wonders is half dome\nAnd the giant sequoia tree desire mental trailblazer John Muir and his colleagues campaigns as a congressional action which was signed into law by president Benjamin Harrison said the way for generations of hikers campers in nature lovers along with countless signs of don't feed the bears\nThis week in Nineteen sixty two Johnny Carson takes over from Jack Parr as host of the late night talk program Tonight Show Carson went on to host this show starring Johnny Carson for three decades becoming one of the biggest figures in entertainment in the twentieth century\nThis week in Nineteen Ninety less than one year after the destruction of the Berlin Wall Ethan West Germany come together on what is known as unity day reuniting east and west for the first time in forty five years\nThis week in Nineteen Ninety five at the end of the trial of a century\nFormer football star OJ Simpson is acquitted in Nineteen Ninety four double murder of the strange life Nicole Brown Simpson and her friend Ronald Goldman any ... two hundred and sixty two day trial Simpsons dream team of lawyers employee creative and controversial methods to convince jurors Simpson skills had not been proved\nBeyond a reasonable doubt and this week in twenty Thirteen espionage in military thriller author Tom Clancy booze books included the hunt for Red October Patriot's games guys in Baltimore at age sixty six following a brief illness\nDuring a career that spanned nearly Thirty Years' Clancy than more than two dozen novels a number of which were made into movies and popular video game\nThat's your look back at this week in history books on\nI'm Jerry Thomas magical quest hits the top of the box office this weekend\nYou know what a war is Louis ...
