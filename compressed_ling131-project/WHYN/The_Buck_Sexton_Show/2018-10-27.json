statistics that they look out for this they'll say well you know neo Nazi got into a bar fight and stab someone to death Nicole ... well if the guy was a minority those ... now is that a hate crime is murder yes\nIs it terrorism though in the way that we think of terrorism the the definition can be a little bit\nA little bit less obvious less clear right it's a hate crime it's murder but it's terrorism or and then you you look at the way that they constantly exclude from a from the discussion\nOr infamous sophisticated worded attacked him in the moment that you start looking at worded attacks and you realize that radical Islam is far and away the biggest threats\nAnd you look at the times square bomber you look at the underwear bomber frugal ... column I mean these are attacks where to go hundreds of people most of the right wing terrorism at the site with a with a couple of exceptions over the last Fifteen Years most the right when jurors may site is single acts of violence against individuals by\nA neo Nazis or or or white nationalist again pain is evil\nOr crimes that should be punished the full extent of the law but it's not strategic level national threat terrorism the way the radical Islamic terrorism is but I'm just telling you you're going to now that we've got this guy a who's been captured today\nThis is a says our fellow says or or say rock was where I keep forgetting is\nHow safe last name I never remember his first name but not not studied everyone's saying ah everyone's saying that you know he's obviously so pro Trump Betty such a bad guy or or say ... say opposites Iraq say are\nYou know a charismatic presentation and a compelling personal story and all this fancy degrees and other things but ultimately Obama things that\nSociety is broken up between those who have stuff\nAnd don't want to give it to other people and use the government and the power that they have other inner outside of government in order to make sure that they keep the stuff that they have stuff and that other people don't uh that sounds very that has a Mark Twain right that sounds like it's\nVery much about the redistribution of wealth and I think it's show\nNoteworthy that President Obama who himself he's incredibly wealthy incredibly powerful\nThat's where he knows that's a sweet spot for Democrats envy envy push that pushed that notion it's it's powerful politics and accused the other side of being cynical ... what is it that Republicans Republicans want to give a little less of their own money\nTo the government there being greedy\n... this is a a at a central talking point on the left you'll you'll hear this all the time you know tax cuts for millionaires and billionaires go when they're still paying a vastly disproportionate share of taxes overall I'm In uh the top one percent pays I think thirty percent\nOf all federal income taxes so there we already have a very\nProgressive income tax system but that doesn't really factor in does it for for Obama it's all just about\nYou know ... you are oh you being the people that he's talking to wherever it is wherever it is every speech he gives\nSame basic scene there are the other guys don't want the government should have more control over lives and take more of their stuff because they don't want you to have more stuff\nHe creates this perception that prosperity and security and all these things that people strive for and society that that zero some one\nSide has it the other side doesn't\nMean what what are the Democrats have to say how do they explain all these Democrat billionaires who are out there you know what do they have to say about that and the answer is you know they never really addressed is you know why why is it that if you're an incredibly wealthy Silicon Valley entrepreneur\nHedge fund manager a Hollywood celebrities are going to listen to these are people that have amassed incredible fortune\nWhy are they all Democrats\nYou know what what I find to be the case that people people that have had to work incredibly hard\nOvercome tremendous struggle to make their money uh tend to be at least more fiscally conservative people that\nWhen the genetics lottery by being incredibly beautiful Hollywood people or people who get really really lucky with you know signing onto a start up early on in Silicon valley you know being with the temp guy in the door and now\nThere are options are worth a billion dollars and they tend to be liberal I you know this is just that anecdotal but that's my sense of it if you had to sweat it out risk many night's sleep or you know do your own taxes take out your own trash\nA cut back on on you know eating out because you're trying to make a a business work that you started yourself I just find that those people in my experience\nAre concerned\nI just that's the only way I could explain the difference in the economic philosophy here a little Obama was preaching about even more than than just the notion of the powerful and the privilege and how they want to hold onto their stuff he also kept talking about the economy play that play Seventeen [laughter]\nThrough one of those concerns\nCrisis in our life [noise]\n\nWhy did it start with Obama how how about we've had even we had an even bigger financial pull back with the great depression and we recovered from that and went and entered\nA period of huge economic growth and a boom I mean Obama really at what point does he does does it become laughable that he thinks he takes credit for the economy and we're we're almost two years into the Trump presidency we're still hearing about how Obama ... reminder by the way Obama\nWas quote I can do pedophilia\nAccording to Islamic tradition the marriage between Mohammed and a six year old

H. Y. N.\n[noise]\n\nBack when you know because when it comes to the fight for self sauce never saw [noise]\nHonestly\nI thought this was a fantastic story in that it lets me do one of my favorite things which is beat up on millennials which ever the media does including people like me who are technically millennials\nAre you know this is where you make the pack need avocado toast joke oh this is where you get to talk about safe spaces and pajama boy at all that stuff\nAh this was this was in the daily wire\nWas that the earlier this week\nThat there is is it is a study\nFrom San Francisco State University that claims at twenty five percent of all millennials are suffering from getting ready for\nPeachy Estee now\nPie DSD is incredibly serious obviously the DSD is something that if you have for real reasons is a deserving of the most serious treatment and assistance and helping and sympathy\nBut they got beat DSD because of the election that's right they are so psychologically traumatized because Trump won the twenty sixteen election that they are now considering themselves to be officially\nA officially suffering from post traumatic stress syndrome to a clinically significant level\nA clinically sniffing level so you know this this is what I Would say\nGoes into the pile of evidence that I'm building up maybe we'll have to do a book or a product on this about how the left really has lost its mind I don't mean that as in oh I'm I'm trying to\nBe funny about them or I'm I'm doing the usual thing that people do on radio or uh in in political media which is you know you exaggerate to get attention nor do I I mean that there are a lot of people on the left who have had a real clinically I'm a possible to evaluate\nNervous breakdown that they have lost it I mean they've lost it in a profound way a and\nThis is this is telling us that that's exactly what happened you know I always try to tell folks ...\n... you know what my my main thing with with the liberals that I Know my little friends as when I when I asked me they say oh I don't understand how you don't know the countries in so much trouble or institutions they got all\nAll bummed out about all this stuff really just you know Trump is destroying America they they cry about it and they get really upset or whether we'll hope we don't actually cry but they they want about it\nI Try to tell them you know it really doesn't matter to you as much as you think it does these things that you keep talking about you know are fraying institutions\nIt's not going to affect your job I could affect your home it doesn't affect anything that you think it especially when you're talking about stuff like Russia collusion and but I I really do believe that there is a a big part of the general population\nThat likes the anxiety\nOf catastrophe that\nThey like to cling to this notion that oh my gosh like this terrible things going to happen and I'm not saying there aren't real\nConcerns that we should all have\nYou know first and foremost among them as you know we're all gonna die that's the truth that we have to deal with right there there are some real things out there to be worried about 'em you know we we are probably going to explode or currency at some point and you know the our currency has a\nHas an incredible track record historically of always always leading to financial disaster there was no it has never been avoided fewer currency leads to financial disaster there is a hundred percent a track record of this show you know that's a real concern a disease that\nIs in ... because of all the antibiotics you know especially antibiotic resistant bacteria and uh you know mass infection or met mash viral plague things like that that's real concern\nAnd day to day concerns are very real you know how you get along with your friends and family and how you doing work\nBut the concerns that liberals obsess over or delusions this notion that the planet is going to die and I mean they're quite literally the entire planet will die\nUnless we start making insignificant modifications George day to day lives with regard to shield to emissions that's crazy\nThat it's not based in any reality that's not a normal thing to be worried about but it's not a normal thing to think that just bonkers and when you start to look at the other things that get liberals really upset and Russia collusion and election security and all that uh they\nThey are worried about things for the sake of worrying and medications but the problem is they believe that they don't know that they're doing then\nWas speaking of a of of uh you know very real ... the ah I saw you know in the in one of the opening sequences of picky blinders which is an excellent show 'em and they really make use of the backdrop\nAs you know the judge judge with don't want anybody up too much fun you got to remember that I went to a Jesuit school\nSo they they're worried about the binge drinking and then the sexual lies costumes and cultural appropriation these you know now they're really just trying to take the fun out of Halloween if you can't wear sexy costumes and you can appropriate cultures what the heck is Halloween for as an adult at least\nAnd for kids I Would note you know it maybe it's a good lesson in a sense because you end up realizing that you don't really want to eat candy all the time you know you you don't really want to be in a position where you're just\nConstantly ... on ... pieces you will reach a saturation a saturation point for reaches pieces you will find yourself\nAt some point do have eaten all the ... you know ... the most the most popular candy in the world that's right eminent AS number one\nIt was random aside I almost a started\nWorking when I was waiting to go to the CIA I got a I've got a job\nOffer at a I forget which I don't remember what it's called out but some big advertising company and they wanted me to work on candy I'm pretty sure was the Mars account which is a ...\nSo I Would have been peddling M. and m's all over the world and most of the CIA take me thank thank God that did ah but yeah you read all that Kenny realized you don't want to eat that much candy as a kid you know nobody really wants to eat that much candy I mean you just reaches level we're like I've I've had enough I don't really need to do this anymore and that\nLearn that as a kid in it but then as an adult as a guy you know you you get to be a rather than women tend to dress some women some without a lawyer like buck I dress like a um I dress like a witch and not ... but it's scary one you know whatever that's that's cool\nBut some college age and and ... and older young women tend to dress in more provocative fashion so Gonzaga is worried about this and also it was a reminder for me that cultural appropriation which has gotten\nAll this attention right now or the or the holiday season cultural appropriation\nIs not a thing or it's not even that I disagree with cultural appropriation is that there is no such thing as cultural appropriate it's not even possible it's not something you couldn't do because\nCulture doesn't belong to any one or any group culture is just a way that things are done\nA ... way of um either eating or dressing or speaking or any number of things and any human being can adopt any culture that they want that's just the nature of and in fact all cultures in a constant state\nOf appropriation and evolution and the only way the culture of all just by having other influences that affected so there's no such thing as a static culture therefore you can't be stealing someone's culture you can only\nBe part of the general cultural ... is like that for about a fun fun word there that everybody else is engaged in as well\nBut now I also remember some of my my\nBest and worst costumes over the years John do you ever do you have a a costume and you're either very embarrassed about are very proud of\nThere'll be show I don't I don't think I've ever dressed up as an adult would dress up for Halloween as an adult now but I oh I see\nHow it is I feel your call me out and see what's out there is producer Mike is he going is he talking to a naughty nurse right now or is she within earshot of the microphone I think he's talking to a naughty secretary over some that's that sounds that sounds about right or you know every every job I think that we could get we can catch Mike on the Mike\nHe is he's out getting phone numbers\nUm but I mean I could tell you my best costume ever was actually when I was a young adults in my early twenties in DC\nI found a theater supply store so I got invited to a big fancy Halloween party and I I theater supply store and they let me read because you want to get really high in costume and not spend a lot of money got rent it and I rented a full\nOn theatrical production costume slash kind of your uniform replica of general Douglas MacArthur I mean with like the pen to lose and a pipe and the sunglasses and the whole thing man that costs you was legit by the way\nPen to looms be surprised how much attention to the ladies give to a guy walks around wearing\nWearing the ... so that was a very good costume I dressed up as Bjorn Borg one year uh with the kind of a you know the\nSeventies style tennis out fix I just basically shrank a a shirt in the ... in the in the drier by accident and I had a head band then enter wouldn't tennis racket so that worked out so I don't I don't have any fantastic costumes I'm not somebody who\nIs is quite as up on on their costume game as many others but I Hope if you do go out this weekend appropriate all the culture you want and if you want to or not it costs you guys or girls ... ladies and gentlemen by all means that is that is you're right because darn it\nThis is America a but obviously you know be safe don't don't eat too much candy corn and don't drink too much\nSpike a patrol candy corn pumpkin juice to ... candy corn Roger cheat as you're eating you know this site somebody you know you might finally appears some ask somebody what ...\nWhat is your what is your best or worst or both Halloween costume and you can remember\nI was never a huge Halloween guy I mean as a kid I loved it but other than adult I didn't get too much into it but one year it was actually a watch my buddies and friends that a group thing\nWe did the ah Addams family and uh I was a go mess Adams I'm and that was fun actually 'cause there was like seven or eight of us and at the individually people were like ... who are you like what are you doing and then but then when he got altogether it was like you guys are awesome\nSo that was a sort of on\nNice Halloween parties that ... I I Know I'm more\nFair enough you know and I will eat the candy and I will give out the candy but uh what is the best Halloween candy good question\nI mean I I'm a\nI have a huge sweet too so I don't ... I go reasons pieces for me like if I'm if I'm able to just pick any candy I think Greece's pieces is yeah it was pretty spectacular ... consider\nI mean we actually got into this conversation the officer of the day I'm ... I'd like to freeze some of my candy and I think when you go frozen the Milky Way it doesn't get a whole lot better than that in my opinion ... yeah\nI I had not thought about that I Do know that ... for all those listening if you ever like make brownies and you don't want to eat them all at once and you keep it in the freezer\nAnd then you want to put them in the microwave the you'd do maintain freshness baked goods frozen is actually a very smart thing to do yeah I didn't learn until like a couple of years ago as apparently they didn't\nThey didn't teach us that in CIA school [laughter] so ah anyway All right yeah good good good times producer Mike good times we are going to come back we gotta our buddy Benny Johnston in the mix and then we've got a Stephanie\nHamel kind of like a double dose of the Daily Caller this Friday on the show\nAnd you know before I actually did a sit down I did the federalist radio hour which the podcast today\nWith Mollie Hemingway who's just just so cool she's great so good on on Fox so a lot of content that oh by the way I Will be on ... and Bream show tonight at eleven pm eastern\nSo talking about all the stuff bringing all the truth\nAnd uh I'll be back in just a moment [noise]\nThe FBI calls home titled fast one of the fastest growing crimes my friend's brace yourself if you've ever had your credit card stone it's nothing compared to the hell you're in for when\nThe steals your homes title everything's online these days including your home settled domestic and international thieves hunt American homeowners because we have equity in our homes\nAnd the bad guys are stealing it may take you off your homes title an add an alias than they borrow hundreds of thousands using your homes equity and stick you with the payments\nYou won't know until you get a late payment notice identity theft programs and insurance policies don't protect you\nHome ... safeguards your homes title from cyber thieves and hackers by putting it on line perimeter around your homes title\nThe instant they detect someone tampering with it they're on it to shut it down for pennies today home town of law protects my most valuable\nStill putting off building that dream home\nNow the perfect time to talk with us about a mortgage loan\nMany options to consider find your loan them right\nHere in college football\nCall today and let it get started\nThe commercial airline industry is booming\nWith this level of demand the industry needs more aircraft technician we are the aid\nCalm promote coed gym that's eight hundred nine seven eight seven four zero nine or\nMy below dot com promo go Jim the only thing you have to lose is another sleepless night use radio five sixty\nFly in and WHYY NSMBC Springfield [noise]\nYeah and I think that uh people are starting to have second thoughts about whether or not he should run for president that strikes me as not the best move\nOr not the best movie you've happy might crash when you and your major cheerleader from an ID or you have people at CNN or making sure that ah his name is trying to move down and the DNC a presidential candidate with\nA he is a criminal as I said maybe it's time for us to rethink\nAs being the founder\nNow I I got an also has your buddy ...
