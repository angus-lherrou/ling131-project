{"month": "10", "state": "MA", "station": "WHYN", "content": "She's saying I won't be her 'cause that was on CNN was reporting earlier today which I don't know that wouldn't have surprise me all that much you want a master's based in New York on ...\nLike me are New Yorkers at heart so they probably want to be back up there as much as the swamp holds its charm for some I I'm not really one of them I'm here for work\nAnd I get to talk to you or my lifeline from the swamp everyday team I I I Do not bond with this place I I cannot I've lived here before for years I've never bonded with this place\nSo ah the reality of the U.S ambassador position is that it's a two un is is that it doesn't really make that much difference\nWhy people are so focused on it now is that Nikki Haley is an interesting political figure in the Trump orbit she's obviously female she's a half South Asian and so she has\nA mind you know people think of her as a minority female she is a minority females or you know she has minority female or in her background or rather she is by back on a minority\nFemale um she's also liked by the establishment people think that Nikki Haley is in that circle of Trump Administration officials who are not surprises Judy the\nBeltway swamp types right I mean there's there's Mattis there's Nikki Haley um there's trying to think of who else would be you know you think of who who would be in the role there and now in any administration that's going to the game you can Play Doh Kelly is chief of staff in because there are some people but certainly\nAre well within what your expectations would be for the role that they have 'em but the Trump Administration is non traditional and that is included a lotta nontraditional appointment but so Haley fits into that circle of people that are thought\nTo be establishment approved a\nAnd so when she left initially when she announced her resignation there was a moment of oh my God what does this mean and as I said I don't think I mean very much at all\nI think that she served two years she's on good terms with the president and from what we know all of his chief policy folks oh I was gonna say pumped but I I I don't think bump pale would've been secretary of state in another minister ration but he's\nA former congressman he's a somewhat establishment figure I think compares great but you know he's somewhat of an established he's a Tea Party congressman I Know but still uh\nBut I don't think Haley ... does this matter is all that much people find it interesting because the dynamics between Trump and and and Haley and the others in his cabinet who are thought of as being\nVery Trump be whereas Nikki Haley is not but I think Trump using is increasingly I've always thought it was a compliment but increasingly now it's really an honor effect right it's it's a title that guys being trumpeted means he's kicking button taking names\nSo whilst they focus on Nikki Haley today oh was the big story oh my gosh Nikki Haley's up\nBecause there's thought in the GOP that Nikki\nHaley is is the most likely post Trump GOP nominee now let's just pull that down to earth for a moment here or\nDoes anyone really know what the political climate is going to look like in six years never mind in in you know in in ... or in in in two years never my six\nAnswers now they got no idea or am I absolutely\nCertain Trump is going to win re election now but I'm pretty certain\nUm but Nikki Haley as a woman certainly fits into what all these political journalists like to do which is come up with a narrative that will interest people with speculation which I've told you before is the favorite tool now of the TV pundits and the different\nTwenty four seven cable news networks Phil lots of speculation ... filled the airwaves with speculation and\nYou know you'll you'll ah never have to worry about content you'll have\nPlenty of speculation as easy and cheap and so that's why we do it and look it happens a lot on this bizarre oh I think so and so it was going or what oh I think part of it is that it's fun right speculations also fun and it can be interesting and just not worth all that much but they're saying that Nikki Haley may run on the honest with you\nI don't know I don't know you know\nNo one knows well that's for sure but I\nI don't see that she's necessarily I'm quite as a compelling and Kennedy because here's here's what the what did you always got to remember these situations\nAre side doesn't get credit for breaking the glass ceiling our side doesn't get credit for oh this person is incredibly accomplished and a minority you know in fact what is said about those who are either minority or female and the conservative side\nWho achieve high office in government is that they're sellouts that their traders traded of their race straighter to their gender or whatever it may be a lot of that was said for example about college because of her vote on Kavanaugh\nThat she was a a a gender traitor\nWhich I suppose is is now he's saying um but I think that uh you know Nikki Haley step aside today and it was a slow news day answer everybody got all frenzied about this and I'll just let the former or soon to be former U.S ambassador United Nations is speak for herself on this one of them we've got a lot of other things that will be getting into political twelfth\nNight late in the end of the airlines go and that we make sure that everything is in\nAn effort to accept that fair to come and in fact in ... and the United states and I'm proud to be part of the game now I don't have anything that I'm Around and go I think that um the main thing when\nHour or six years and we got like a hurricane fountain near ... sitting for hitting them to come in here and I'm On a ... it's been a cat\nScan and I'm a believer in her mind that I think you have to be software for not to know when you\nElse to do the task [laughter]\n\nYeah there you go pardon on good terms reputation intact didn't have some big uh inter personal blow up with the ministry\nI Know this isn't going to convince any I don't think any moderates are centrists to who really joined right here is you know in\nKey in key house races you need Republicans to get some upset victories um but now I don't think there's going to convince people to do that necessarily but what do you think about where we are as a country right now and what they have gone to this president along the way it is\nBonkers this whole special counsel and the and the investigation and the\nThe grinding machinery of this special counsel bureaucracy chewing people up costing them fortunes in legal fees threatening everybody with perjury charges\nAll of this Trump has had to do this with that Obama didn't have that Obama didn't have that for his first two years in office okay and\nAnd you look at the comparisons of over people say oh you inherited you know that yeah there was an economic reset from decades of bad policy when it came to housing and lending which by the way it was pushed by social justice warriors that's a whole other conversation\nBut the bank bailout everyone was because the bank bailout happened on Bush's watch tarp\nIs what happened or the or rather the stimulus pardon me ...\nThe stimulus is what happened on Obama's watch that's what Obama which was a trillion dollars of what exactly does that do oh that's right you have a lot of money away the Democrat\nGrab bag issues and causes and and buddies and special interests\nThat is what the ... trillion dollars of just you know Democrats bending stuff on whatever they want to spend money on to help the economy that was your money they spent the bailout of the banks occur when Trump was in office right so I'm Sorry when Bush was in office\nSo there's a whole thing that Obama turn the economy around no everything he did actually maybe it's made of the slowest and most painful economic recovery since the great depression so this is just a rewriting of history they're engaged and in Obama's last two years in office\nThey were trying to excuse the weak economic growth they were trying to excuse the lack of optimism about the corporate investing environment in this country about jobs and wages and how they were stagnant ... they were coming up with anything to make Obama seemed like he was older so great\nAnd now the narrative of the whole together Trump has been doing a fantastic job he really has I Would love to see the Republicans\nStay in power in the house and the Senate because I think\nIt'd be good for the whole country I think there will be good for you for me for even the silly lives out\nThere running around cheering on anti for you good for everybody I just

I Believe if we are fortunate enough\nThat twin civility can start again\nBut until then the only thing that the Republican theme to\nRecognize and respect strength and you heard how the Republican numbers led by Mitch McConnell\nReally demeaned the confirmation process\nCivility folks Hillary Clinton one of the leaders of the lives is out there\nTelling people\nThat for civility to Richard in our politics today\nFor that to happen Democrats afterward this is the problem we have right now with the political exchange between the two sides they are delusional this reminds\nMe of an of an editorial that I had been meaning to bring up to you or earlier in the week I was so excited to talk to you on Monday I could have been a few days\nThan it skipped right past us but the editor in chief of Politico who I I don't I'm not even really familiar with I Know what political is which is a political side left wing people a dozen bill itself as that but that is in fact what it is a but he wrote a piece about how maybe\nMore or less it's time to to take the gloves off or about how ... maybe now is the time for Democrats\nTo stop playing night's stop playing nice they weren't using cabinet of being a gang rape is during Senate hearings these people are completely insane they're completely nuts\nDo you even look I got asked this question recently by a college kid at a at a conference where I gave a speech what do you do when people call you a Nazi because you're pro Second Amendment I said there's nothing you can do don't engage because you're talking you might as well be talking to a person who's pushing around the shopping cart with you know John three\nSixteen written on a piece of cardboard hanging out of it I mean that's that's what we're up against now\nAnd this is unfortunately the end result of a massive media echo chamber that has given this kind of thinking\nSome form of of intellectual cover for a very long time that's what's really going on people think that this is a normal way to approach\nThere are problems they think this is a normal way to deal with the other side to just go completely scorched earth insane and then they to borrow from the left the Democrats have normal lives their craziness they're crazy tactics and so what is crazy to a normal person is no longer crazy to Democrats\nI you know I\nI'm not I'm not even going to get to the the the clip I think today but somebody that I'm friends with over at a a nother\nNetwork or somebody in front of the other network you were\nSaying today that what happens when people are being chased out of restaurant that's not a mom I I'm Sorry that's them up if we can't agree and this was a CNN\nAnd I'm not we're not going to play that clip today I'm gonna let it just uh 'cause 'cause I I like\nThe I like the person on a on a person to person level who who said this stuff but she's been subjected obviously to this kind of thinking too much and has unfortunately bought into it at some level if we can't agree that\nThe people that are changing Ted Cruz at a restaurant or the people that are public officials were laughing about Rand Paul almost being beaten to death on his front lawn because someone didn't like what Rand Paul stood for a ... if if they're going to laugh about that\nIf they're going to go on TV it's senator Hirono did and said well you know this is just what happens ... meaning that people should yell at others and get up in their faces everything else\nIf they're going to say that that's OK and that's normal\nWe have no choice but to own the lips are only choice becomes victory the only response we can have two this insanity\nIs to defeat them and do it and I don't know what else to say to enforce our political will through the system legally and legitimately upon them that's it\nThese these are just a basic laws of human nature and power the left does not believe in these things and they'll say oh but look at what about the equality in in Sweden first of all\nThey think that equality just means having a large welfare state uh but there's not a huge emphasis in some of these European countries of the less points to\nA there is not a huge emphasis on the state enforcing the same outcome was for all people right there was some people do better than others maybe not necessarily economically but some people just have\nHappier life outcomes some people there's only so much the state is able to do it unless you empower it to a point where it's so powerful\nThat you no longer have any individual you have whatever the state Danes to leave you\nUm but I suppose I'm getting too deep into this rabbit hole a\nWhat I Would say about oh wait we've got more so so Trump will actually say what needs to be said here which is that Hillary's a loser to John loser for president never really done anything impressive and her entire career has just been writing her husband's coattails\n'em and crumble said other people right the Romney wing of the GOP the Romney wing of the GOP is much more willing to sit back and take these nasty\nComments from people like Hillary Clinton much more willing to sort of take the\nThe underhanded and unseemly an unfair critiques without punching back in any meaningful way\nShow a Trump is a new era for conservative and many of you listening to the show ... many of you saw that and very very early on I've not just come around to it now I I consider myself to be\nA a warrior ideologically for the Trump way of doing politics um he said things like you get tired of winning we're certainly not tired of winning\nBut that's not just a slogan you know you you win\nOr bad things happen I mean you know if you believe for example that the Democrats pursue immoral policies which certainly in the case of a roe v Wade and there are other things you could power right on top of that then there is something of a moral imperative to do at least everything you can within the political system to prevent them\nFrom having the power to enact\nThere will um but Hillary\nHas gotten in the past as we know from the media for very long time that CNN sits down the ... of course do your own on one pool that Christie on whatever name as sits down with her I just said er name so obviously I Know her name I just don't like to say that because it's ... uh not Christine it's ... and she told us ...\nThe ... uh but they'll call it he'll call Hillary out you sit there and and just allow or to get away with the lives and the nonsense but on the issue of Bill Clinton's sexual harassment 'cause we're in this me to moment and everyone's\nAll focused in on how you know Kavanaugh in the Arab meat you is going to affect women's perceptions going into the midterm elections and\nAll that stuff I'm a porous jewelry about her husband Bill Clinton what went on here and I I Want to play the answer for you and then I Want to bring us down to brass tacks place of it\nYou say that you're going to talk about the difficulties that your husband went through the U.S who are ... you're going to be prepared to have questions about that moment in Nineteen Ninety eight impeachment um the allegations of sexual harassment against your husband or your pet to answer those questions in ... for them and how do you see that\nSimilar or different from what President Trump is being accused of and ... and others today\nWell there's a very significant difference and that is\nThe intense long lasting part of an investigation that was conducted in the ...\nIf I'm you know the Republicans starting with President Trump on down a want a a comparison nation welcome such an investigation themselves\n\nIsn't that an incredible sleight of hand from a dishonest and dare I say only ...\nPolitician oh there was a big difference alright between\nWhat happened with Kavanaugh and what happened with Hillary Clinton's husband Bill Clinton one is that his misdeeds\nOccurred while he was president of the United states or in the case of the credible accusations of rape on the record by women he did have sexual interactions with\nWho did know him worth seeing him there was no question about where they were or did this ever actually occur in terms of the date and time and could they have been there all the things that we never get answers for Ford\nBill Clinton was accused of rape by Juanita broader Roderick but he was accused of sexual assault by Jennifer Flowers and these women came forward\nAnd said that he was a predator a predator\nI really said wow there's something to this um and what's interesting is when you do a little bit of research you find that these devices are programmed\nBy Silicon Valley to be addictive you know they are studying behavioral science and behavioral psychology and breaking down ways for how many times we need to know how many times do we need to create\nSomething in this game so that it creates you know a ... for people to be addicted and how many times do we need Snapchat to do X Y and Z to get people addicted to streaks and we're a bunch of puppet\nSo being the personal responsibility girl that I Am it was like oh I Want the free market to shut this down it was hey wait a minute just because you're designing these things to get us addicted doesn't mean that we actually have to use them that way\nYou know what you're saying all this stuff it it makes me think of some of the uncomfortable recognitions about myself but I've had it's in the last year maybe year and a half\nWere I realize things like I get a little ... and I don't know about the only ones I talked to some friends about it I've been I've talked about on the show I feel anxious if I don't have my if I don't have my smartphone within reach\nI feel like I'm going to miss a call I'm going to miss an email something's going to have a doesn't mean I have to look at it all the time although I Do look at it too much it means though that you start to have this I Need to be able to physically touch my phone or else there's something wrong I Know I'm not the only one\nRight and that and as you know if anybody who's done a detox with food you know how you you go you're doing a juice fast for five days at first you feel kind of sick you feel even more nervous because now you're you're pulling all this stuff out of your body that's bad\nThat happened initially initially you have more anxiety 'cause you're like wait a minute what am I missing and might not plugged in I remember losing my phone and a taxi cab and I tell a lot of really\nEmbarrassing crazy personal stories in this book and one of them is that I lost it and a cat it was like I had lost a child or a dog or something that was alive I was completely untethered that with a sign that I had and I coined that phrase OCC they obsessive compulsive disorder people laugh\nBut it's really really true and and and the thing is to you you and I around the same age but I think I'm a little older than you I don't know why it has brought that up maybe the audience can forget I just said that but\nThese are ... times ... looks twenty five so for all intents and purposes she is twenty five go ahead my friend\nBut we come from a time where we grew up and we didn't have all this intrusion we didn't have all the social media we weren't setting staring at their cell phones\nWhat drove me crazy is thinking about kids getting into dating for the first time and they're doing it all on these phones parents should be worried that their kids are not learning basic skills I wrote an article for bus all this week saying\nYou know I remember my middle school dance and the way that you know the boy had to kind of get the courage up across the middle school dance floor and asked me out and face the potential rejection and you know learn how to handle those face to\nFace conversations for the first time he's one of the things that turn boys and girls and women and men and now you have kids hiding behind these devices they're\nThey're not they're spread it completely than among a bunch of people things like intimacy and personal conversation or getting lost in those first relationship people have in college and and finally be on young kids don't they don't know how to have a personal\nRelationship they don't know how to communicate anymore because they're doing everything by tax all the time so it's multi faceted the problem I'm having been a teacher for years I Can't tell you how many phones we confiscated and the bullying that goes on and social media how people look at social media and they think it will\nBut it's not it if if I call it the perception deception like you think that somebody's real life but it's not it's what they chose to show you so I really go through all these ideas in the book and it's it's a reminder to you know even you yourself find yourself too focused on these devices and fitting in\nWe eat your dinner with friends or your relationships whatsoever you're dating or your phone conversations you're on the phone and there you are scrolling through your phone you know your your second phone or your your on your hat\nOr you have kids and you're worried like what is this feeling that that my kids don't play outside my kids don't know how to talk to people anymore they don't know how to write properly because everything is done through the tax\nThis is a book for you to kind of grow diver and ... takes on some of my depth and if not on the ... and then just having awareness that\nJust because a product that rises doesn't mean you have to use it and B doesn't mean you have to use it the way they want you to use it it's really a self towering rock\nIf you could get everyone listening is right now ... everyone should check out do not disturb ... new book out right now about how you can take back of your wife from these tech devices that are meant to overtake her life and she pointed out there they're actively trying to do that I mean the people designing them\nBut if there's one rule I mean my my rule genocide that I've been pretty successful and implementing is no phones at the dinner table unless there's an emergency but then you ... do you have a role for folks were a couple of rules\nI mean the the main role I Would say is that when you're spending quality time with people that I don't if it's in part than if it's at a dinner if you go to your your your daughter dance recital\nTurn those notifications off putting\nYour phone away and if you have to take photos this is another ... people say all the time which I understand that it will I I Need my phone that's how I take photos charting the other feature off learn to use the airplane mode function on your phone I understand you want to have your own ... cases of emergency we live in a different time now people are used to\nThat convenience maybe you want to spend two hours\nAt someone and then you want to call home and check in with you on your daughter or your husband I get it\nLearns the airplane or the trick to help you said that you actually get a break your phone not a thing you can put it away for a short period of time and actually ... he'll like your mind if stealing you will feel it I promise you and if you have to use it you know what you take your phone I can take a picture and you put it back in because if\nIt's on an airplane mode and your not being compelled then oh wait while I'm taking the photo let me just check Twitter real quick own answer this text message\nOh let me answer the female and then suddenly your work day which was once you know acting on our goes through the whole night and your exhaust don't do it for your mental and physical health airplane mode is fantastic\nTeacher and it's a fantastic for that for people who are like hey let that and I can't just abandoned the phone altogether I'm not even for a few hours I'm not ready for that that's okay it's not supposed to be a you know I read this book and suddenly you change your whole life it's just not make thank 'em and and I hope it does\nStop all taking individual private jets I'm not going to believe that this is real I respond to warnings as a rational person would which is provide me with the evidence and explained to me why I should believe what you were saying don't try to shame me into it\nDon't try to take the perspective that if I don't agree with you I must just be ignorant or foolish right try to walk me through this\nAnd saying all scientists degree does not count because one that's not true they repeat it anyway though I Would not always a very bad sign an argument\nThis you know here's an example of this liberals will say there's no such thing as voter fraud and then I provide them with a case of documented voter fraud where someone to prison\nAnd they say oh okay fine but you know there's not a lot of voter fraud why do you keep saying there's no voter fraud you you you know that's not true right but you're trying to just create a climate where there's no discussion of voter fraud that's why they do it\nWhy do you say there's there's there are no scientists that disagree with this quote consensus on climate change which not because they don't know that there obviously are including professor Richard limbs in from MIT pretty well known place\nOr the founder of the weather channel another guy who is questioning the climate consensus such as it is a lord bumped in\nJust a journalist but a guy who's pulled all the stuff together he's supposed to go to all the crap predictions and said you guys are wrong you the climate change police are wrong wrong wrong over and over again stretching back for decades and you're not a little bit wrong you're entirely wrong and then you start changing the numbers and making excuses\nBut then they try to suppress conversation this by saying what does it again that's right\nDo you believe in climate change at the answer is no you're not allowed to be a part of the discussion\nYou are an intellectual untouchable or she didn't want to suppress the debate they don't want to have a debate they want to suppress a debate and they want to convince everybody there is no voter fraud how could even talk about voter fraud well there is oh okay but not a lot of voter fraud and you must be a racist way what I just thought we are talking about wrote a voter fraud\nThis is the way that they do it this is how they play the game important that you all we\nAre constantly made aware of is that we we make ourselves aware of this we are made or wherever it by the way they act\nBut notice how also they they tie this into Trump this is another version of oh let the UN releases this report and now all these different news organizations are reporting not just on catastrophic catastrophic climate change\nWhat is catastrophic flooding even mean\nThink about that for a moment could they define that could they tell me what what that that there's going to be a flood somewhere at some point and the next ten years\nThat kills people is going to be very tragic and look very bad that's always been the

it's ... now it's a question of the number one that the ... what do you mean it's a mob when you've got a a big mess up when you got more than three people\nWho are together screaming in your face and acting like maniacs because you're trying to have dinner with your wife 'cause they don't like her politics they don't like your political party that's getting in the ... when you get twenty or thirty or forty people that are doing it which is what we've seen in these restaurants at a minimum\nThen it's definitely my behavior but that that is the word used to describe it but you see there are very sensitive\nUsing that were there very sensitive about saying it because they know that their audience is all a bunch of lives and they don't want the lives that feel like anyone standing and mean about the really devoted lives you\nKnow there there's a sympathy just because people don't go out and you know where all the black stuff and act like anti ... doesn't mean that they despise anti fun\nFact I think there are way more Democrats and you're seeing this now who don't necessarily agree with that he was methods but they agree with the message and they know that the audience the CNN audience does not want to be told hey are there are there's a problem\nOn the left here and people are acting like maniacs mob maniacs no less\nThat's not what the audience wants to hear so they stay away from it it reminds me so very much of what was being or what was happening back in the days of black lives matter you guys don't I'm Talking about um black lives matter days there were all these\nIncidents the most probably well actually the one in Baltimore was really well known and then there was one in in St Louis\nMissouri layer these incidents where you had a mob that followed onto a protest of some kind\nAnd they were burning down buildings they were looting stores they were throwing rocks at cops and CNN would go from there showing burning building one moment to political analyst later on doing what role is mostly peaceful\nProtest it was a mostly peaceful protests ... mostly peaceful protest or what is it even made\nIt can you imagine if if you just did a very simple thought experiment if you looked at a Tea Party rally circuit twenty ten\nAnd there was anybody throwing rocks at cops there was anybody who was letting buildings on fire they were like oh my gosh look the country is in turmoil look at the rioters\nAnd yet when you flip it around and you have people that are saying they're part of this black lives matter movement then all of a sudden\nYou know they're they're not ... you can't afford them as writers you certainly wouldn't refer to what was going on even though it was about race and racial animation claims of racism and never allowed to call it a race riot on TV\n[laughter] where in the black and white and black folks are about to train Kanye West and the racial draft okay they've had it with him\nYeah I I got to say\nI I don't know how it is that that segment on CNN is considered up to ... in any way up to that network standards that that's acceptable\nI how how that how it is allowed to happen on a cable news show when when keep in mind there was a guy who I interviewed a what was it maybe a few weeks ago it was a sports\nCaster and he said\nSomething about about boobs on he said that he you know I forget what it was exactly but he made some reference to the female organ that is\nCalled by some\nUh boobs and\nIt was a big like oh my gosh you can't say that I don't see another excuse me or this is like when does all\nOf her and it was a big problem but then you add what just happened there where there's obviously very\nRacially inflammatory language being used in and people laughing and and mocking\nKanye West to look I Know that he's a provocateur tour and people have all these very strong opinions on it but I I think that there was a line crossed there and I'm I don't understand how anyone doesn't feel like there was a lot of cross there\nBut you also get a bit of a window into how the left at this moment in time it their grasping\nOr reasons are grasping for for ways to justify a their intolerance of other ideas the the rabid way which they approach trying to destroy their enemies\nWe have so few celebrities on the right that speak or soap operas alright period and we have so few people that come out and and espouse conservative principles that with someone of ... a level in celebrity land\nSays anything about being pro Trump it's there's this mob yes there's that word again this mob mentality to tear him down immediately\nIt's one thing if they want to say who cares what think about what a disparity there is in this route you look every idiot celebrity I Know we talked about you know I'm not saying she's an idiot but we're talking I don't know we're talking about Taylor Swift and uh you know her effort to\nHelp the Democrats in Tennessee in all these different celebrities out there you
