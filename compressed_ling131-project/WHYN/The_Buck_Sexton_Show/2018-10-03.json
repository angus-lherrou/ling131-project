I Know they're talking to mark judge now the FBI is going to go interview marketing marketing telling exactly what he's already written down and just warn statement\nI don't know this woman I don't know what you're talking about this didn't happen cabinet never did this July basically\nWhat you can say about Ford Ford Ramirez\nIt was and sweat Nick ... is the one who says that maybe maybe he\nKavanaugh exposed himself during college she can't be sure but she called a lot of people to ask\nThem what they think that's not that's not something that\nInspires confidence in her telling of events is it can't be sure exactly but you know it might have been him so let's try to pile on and help ruined his life that's were mirrors\nAnd then they find some room mate or doesn't like look you could find people in college didn't like me to they were losers they were jerks but there were some of them you know they'd probably say oh yeah a buck was you know he was bad they say whatever to trash me if I were running for office of any one of you went to college is they could find somebody especially in a really politically contentious time if you're a conservative everybody\nLoves to bash on conservatives oh gosh makes you the hero of a lot of cocktail parties really does\nBut I think that you might see flake vote no regardless of how that shakes out and so then it comes down to Collins and Murkowski\nCollins and Murkowski Murkowski no votes I think Collins realizes that she's done in the Senate if she boats now she's done that's my impression that's my analysis I could be wrong\nMurkowski though strikes me is more transactional rent or Murkowski is a little more whatever's good for her forget about the Republican Party forget about whatever principle she's a spouse\nIn the past so\nThat's that's part of my concern and then you also have this is continuing narrative and this ties into\nWhat I think is they're trying to build an escape hatch reflect you see they can't get cabin on the rate they can't convince any normal reasonable person the cabinet was above gang rapes or that or that there's any evidence running this because there is no weapons\nBut you've got to remember then there's the Mazie Hirono senator Geraldo from Hawaii there's the approach that she has which is just whatever we can do to\nCriticize this guy to take him down a peg to make him look small after we should do whatever we can investigate about him we should investigate IRS Mazie Hirono on the ice throwing allegations play twenty\nAnd I can't I Want to ask you about these developments we found out overnight you leave the Donald with that at least ... cabin all through ice in someone's face during a bar fight when he was in college you feel that that is in any way just qualifying for somebody to the Supreme Court [noise]\nThis is why we need in the eye of the nation because there are a lot of allegations reports really are about how he behaves Lenny ... truck\nSo that is very relevant and trail of himself as practically choir boy\nI'm very much contradicted by his late for example in college and some people who knew him and I still why we need an FBI and the reason why I'm calling from one for like seems like months\nMonths what\nI Do think that there's a strong case to be made that senator who wrote it was the dumbest woman or man in the Senate I think she's the dumbest human being in the Senate that's a very that seems to me to be a strong case right now the evidence for that is clear\nWe need an FBI investigation of capital because you might have thrown ice into someone's face during a bar fight Thirty years ago\nThirty five years ago who can say that and not feel like a moron really\nDon't don't allow yourself to assume even for a second well she's on TV she's a senator she can't be that she can't be that silly right maybe maybe I'm being harsher no you're not being harsh on her\nTotal and Bissell total and complete a missile but\nThis story about temperament and the lines of the reason that that\nTalking point is something that I Am analyze it for you there on the show\nIs because that's not going to convince anybody you got people that hate Kavanaugh or because you know he's a white male white male privilege and it was a front row and he's a he's a conservative and overturn roe all that stuff and you can people that say no I'm actually a constitution list and also I Believe the rule of law\nYeah that's our team\nNo one's going to change their mind about this guy based upon the alleged ice throwing into incident of Nineteen eighty four whenever it was no that's not serious near times doing a peace right now on how he was part of a\nLike party planning or something back in the day in New York Times doing that base whoa oh gosh and he was a college\nKid I mean they're they're adjudicating his beer drinking and his social life and social habits from college when he's a fifty something year old man this is what the New York times has been reduced to a joke a disgrace times also had Emily Babylon reporting on Kavanaugh\nAs a quote reporter when in July before any of this happened she came out and said she opposes him because of the threat that he poses\nTo civil rights and women's rights I'm sure to of course that's that's that's a given you can assume that book\nBy creating this storyline of temperament and oh he's a he's a belligerent drunk he was mean he's a bad guy that's not for any normal person to change their mind one way or the other than that it's all about\nGetting an escape hatch for flake and maybe Murkowski\nOh we don't want to let's put forward we agree both lakes word is good for nothing I mean he could come out today and say I guarantee you I Would vote for capping off this has done and we don't have any more derogatory information I still wouldn't believe\nUntil the votes happened we do know guys a coward an absolute wet noodle spine coward\nBut if they can open this story line you see how it goes oh we need somebody who's a more bipartisan pick this whole process has been tainted the country's two divided right now\nSo in response to the left waging an unprecedented partners in assault on cabin on all of his supporters and and all those around them in the entire system and all the women dressed in The Handmaid's tale costumes and putting anatomically correct female body parts on their heads as hats and all the stuff that they're doing\nAll that late takes the position of\nOh well we should have now and give them what they want in the spirit of bipartisanship that's what I think's going to end up happening I think flakes going to be a no vote at the end of this whole thing knowing that yes you'll receive a lot of\nViciousness from Washington viciousness a lot of anger is not vicious it's completely warranted legitimate justice really\nFrom people but he's playing the long game of I Want to get a book a book deal from Simon and Schuster or whomever you know a big big big publishing house\nThat's that's what flakes game this year so that's why I I'm concerned I don't know how the votes will go I'm not\nI have zero confidence in the ability of Republicans in this case to do what's right one thing that just that just got released and I I wasn't sure I I'm not going to read to you from it\nBecause it is salacious that you could definitely say it as it is a salacious document sort of like the salacious dot CA but he did\nI I have noticed All right I ... I have noticed this I I Am aware of it\nAnd\nThe Senate Judiciary committee they released a statement from somebody that I think kind of romantic linked to sweat Nick and man oh man are there things in there essentially telling you that sweating it gives a very disturbed and sexually\nI don't even know what the word would be you'd have to read the document I Can't read it on their family show there's some really intense stuff in there though bottom line is the woman is crazy that's that's the bottom line uh and that her allegations should not be taken\nSeriously and and you know they they they posted up some activists and Reagan\nSports fans of Sandy lasted I'm here to take you on a journey back\nTo this week in sports history let's start back in Nineteen Twenty one and the first broadcast of the world series on radio to New York Yankees beat the New York giants three to zero [noise] this week in Nineteen fifty five Baltimore coal full\nBack Alan and meet she becomes the first rookie in NFL history to top one hundred yards rushing and the\nFirst two games get a hundred and fifty three against the Detroit Lions after his one hundred and Ninety four yard performance\nIn his debut against the Chicago Bears this week in Nineteen eighty four Walter\nPasses Jim Brown as the NFL's career rushing leader\nThis week in Nineteen Ninety One the New York rangers trees burning dentals to Edmonton for march ...

people who are or annoyed about what's going on\nThere like we are to show up and vote people that are happy to get a little complacent you know with the status quo they figure out things are good things will stay good well\nWhat are you seeing in the cabinet debacle is that Democrats cannot be trusted with power you can't have these people in charge you can't do it\nAfter stop them from being able to set the government agenda will be a bad thing for all of us so I don't want anyone to lose sight of that but the truth is nobody really knows what's gonna happen right now with the election the truth is that\nIt could go either way we're over a month out from election right around me and my as my date yeah oh no yeah month and a couple of days\nOver a month out from election day Senate

is not telling the same place people keep asking me I I don't I don't certainly holder probably going to win but and you know what they're probably going to win it's not like I think the world's going to be a perfect place we don't have any problems\nUh because politics is interesting it's about human interaction and a way of resolving conflict between people in a way of joining together to do some things that makes\nSense for all of us right but at the end of the day it doesn't determine who you are what your value is that this is the problem with the Democrats love the show personally wrapped up in\nHer party and all that stuff I mean I I Am wrapped up in principles of their ideas that really matter to me\nOr you know justice and truth and these things that it sounds like I'm given a speech to be high school president or something but that you know those things matter to me I think the GOP is doing a good job of the country they should stay in power because they have been doing a good job ... not not\nBeyond reproach but you know there's some very very positive things that are happening that that's one point I wanted to make here and in terms of what we've seen with Kavanaugh I Can't say what the reaction is going to be because until you see their reaction then then you\nSee the reaction you're not in a position to really assess whether it's going to have an impact on its capital doesn't get through Republicans better send a message for the good of the country\nBetter send a message that this will not stand this aggression dude will not stand that's what has to be said and that means preventing Democrats and taking the house\nDemocrats take the house it's going to turn into one long endless investigation and impeachment fight that's the only thing that's going to be out there that's the only thing that the Democrats are really going to focus on there's no ... no policy agenda they're going to be all agree on\nTalk later about who they think they're going to run for the presidency but we're a month out from election day and I have to say this week which\nIs hopefully going to come to a close with Kavanaugh's confirmation but if it doesn't have that could be the difference maker in the midterms\nI don't believe this other side of it I think that this is wishful thinking and the Democrats than women will turn out in huge numbers of cabinet gets on the Supreme Court I think the only women who really believe the capital is a bad guy and a Kavanaugh's a you know a predator and that and that you know women should be believed all all that stuff all that clock trap rhetoric that you hear\nThe women who really take that to heart and are mobilized to vote as a result of it hated Kavanaugh anyway this is like all the senators are saying oh it does we need to have you back beyond us occasion and that'll decide well you decided before\nAny there's even if you decided before the hearings happened you know coups and find Sunday we're never going to vote for this guy\nIs all this is all the charade it's all ...

person is doing is they're more difficult thing to do\nUsually whenever anybody asks me what's going to happen in Washington I'll say my general prediction about politicians is what's the easiest thing for them to do 'cause that's what they're going to do a this was not the easiest thing for Jeff like to do the easiest thing for him to do would be just a vote for a cabinet to get him out of committee and that's the end of that but he held his vote ransom as uh\nWe're basically saying you can have my vote but we need a week to do this FBI investigation and that took whether or not you agree with it that wasn't gutsy thing to do it because it made every Republican in the Senate mad at him\nTapper is the most overrated thinker in the news business I Would wager he's entirely wrong here with his analysis on\nThese Steven cold there show that's absolutely wrong it is the opposite what Jeff Flake did the flake out as it were is the opposite of courage because flake had already said earlier that day that he was going to vote for Kavanaugh\nThe reason he did not was that he could not take the heat\nThat's not courage that is actually the opposite of Kurds that is called cowardice but notice how this spring\nThey're trying to you and this is very all top are very establishment news media they want all the little senators that are still in the mix they want everybody who's perhaps persuadable on this one when you get to the final vote process\nThey want everyone to know that you know the ones who wants to stop this process or the brave ones let me tell you what Jeff lakes calculation was\nJeff Flake really really wants to be liked\nBy CNN by the New York times it's seductive\nThese are powerful cultural institutions and especially if you're no longer going to be a politician you want in your day to day life\nYou'd be thought of well by people who have large megaphones who have cultural influence and also by the way can pay you a whole lot of money to do a whole lot of different things that's what you want\nThat's what the self interested person is going to be concern with first and foremost\nLike didn't show courage not the harder thing to do he knows this is a scam he's not a complete moron and he knows\nThat if he were to have gone along and do the right thing he would be in tremendous hot water right now with the left with the media so what did he do try to create an alibi for himself\nI'm Still not convinced that he will vote for Kavanaugh but I Would note that even if he does vote for Kavanaugh flake thinks that he's going to be the Republican in this process who when he wants to give fancy speeches in Aspen\nOr East Hampton or wherever when he wants to be among the lead again and treated like somebody that they can stand from the right you know that they can kind of accept him\nHe will say oh well I was the one that got the one week extension I was the one that made sure that there was a step beyond ... investigation which as we now she is a sham it was always going to be a sham inflate knew it was a chef\nSo what's it like do why did he do it self interest which is the opposite of courage\nCowardice because he felt like he had been cornered by those women including a straw rose funded active if you can't even make this stuff up\nYelled at him and so he decided to make a different call that day and what he had already said in the morning same day like is a self interest in power in this whole process and that won't change even if you vote for cabin on the ad because what he's doing is just created additional risk for\nA man in this case judge Kavanaugh who has been ambushed who has been smeared who has been slime\nIf you're a person of honor and integrity you don't allow that to continue when it's in your power to stop it that's what Jake Tapper doesn't understand apparently that's what Jake Tapper doesn't know yeah there was a hard thing for me do it was a hard thing for him to do for the few days but he'll get criticism from the right\nIt's much easier thing for him to do for the rest of his life when he's going to want to be at the country club or he's going to want to go and get a contributor ship at MSNBC or CNN or ABC and he'll say I'm the Republican who broke ranks in order to try and defend\nA what the the process here of getting an FBI investigation was total and complete garbage I just want to note tappers got an entirely wrong that's not surprising you know top always on the on the cold there show always so hip and cool\nThe whole thing over and see it as a fraud and

this is what they'll tell you\nI'm this doesn't square with the reality and you know I'm I'm Out here in this this conference with stands for research some of you know them 'cause I Do a podcast with their with their founder and chairman and stands where it's a\nIt's a great group I I've learned a lot about investing in finance from them I really enjoy working with them but they bring out all these experts experts on trade and crypto currency and investing and all kinds of things are just a whole slew of its three days\nOf a world class experts in speakers I brought my buddy Sean Parnell out this year who are\nShown that a great job if you ever get a chance to er here Shawn tell the first major enemy contact you hadn't Afghanistan maybe you'll have him come on and tell us that story as kind of fun I'll\nI'll sit back with all you and just relax kick up my feet on the desk milk oh Sean Scott story time for us\nBut I'm speaking to all these different people who are\nVery involved in the markets the economy and they have to be right you know that's one thing you get a lot of these people go on TV are all going to cost them a style of a credit card numbers oh this is what Paul Krugman says\nI'm Talking about people that have to be right because of where they're putting their money where they're investing what they're doing and even the ones that were very skeptical a Trump and there's a lot of Trump skeptics out here that I'm Talking\nTo you will just capital Trump or saying you can't disregard\nThe results and that's what people want to do I'm not even saying you know you're not allowed to argue that the results aren't as good as people say fine you know people want to quibble over how good the results have been that's one thing but you can't just regard them you can't say oh the economy is amazing but it's not Trump\nThat did this or Trump doesn't get any credit for this that just\nThat's being unreasonable that's not looking at the evidence and making decisions are based on what's all making coming to conclusions based on what's really happening here\nOr there and there's some other stuff that has been said about Trump in the last day or so you had a a union leader a union leader no less thanking Trump for tax breaks play Thirteen\nThanks to start ... and the tax rate farms and then on\nGeneral confidence in the economy I guess we have really been able to invest more in our employees and grow our company and the last year were investing more in\nIn play wages and ... says are spending millions on Clinton and I said and\nIn general I think a huge increase in the work they're coming out because utilities are spending more to update\nThe aging infrastructure\nSalad thank you very and I made a huge impact and we are\nLooking to grow about ah twenty or thirty percent more and places and the next few months we had a lot of large projects that are starting and I will make I think a big difference and\nReally it is and ... that aren't good for businesses are really important for our employees also the community is working and leave [laughter] really than thankful and has the ... President Trump and an office\nSo that's a union leader telling you what the tax break has meant for the union that she represents for the employees that people showing up trying to earn a living trying to pay their mortgage feed their families and all this positive stuff she's saying you're getting that message elsewhere\nIt's not rocket science folks if you have more money if you're a business has to give less of the money that it makes if you have to have less of your property taken from you by the government venue or in a better position to invest to pay people more to grow to compete\nThis is ... it's\nSo straightforward isn't it Democrats come up with all these convoluted theories about oh no we need a higher tax for why should we have the highest corporate tax rate in the world why does that make sense someone explain that to me because we get the best government services for our business is that's a laugh\nAnd it's not even just the tax breaks that have resulted in so many benefits and and so much good stuff going on or there's also the regulatory environment change which I ... I'm ... I'm speaking I'm going to play some more ... more a\nAnother soundbite here for you from a small business owner of the Trump rally but I'm Talking to small business owners just for for days I'm Out here in Vegas for three days\nThe last six I'm Out here for three days and I'm Talking to all these different people from industry and and corporate America and even the ones who don't like Trump style or\nDon't align with them on all of his policies they're saying what he is doing is working what Obama was doing before was that\nIt makes it harder for businesses when you think that growing massive government programs spending more money on entitlements a trillion dollar stimulus give away a left wing interest when you think that's the most productive way to use capital you're wrong bad things happen when you let the business of the American people will be business to borrow from Calvin Coolidge\nGood things can happen and that also means de regulating and here's one of the a steep junior not he had these small business rally the Trump patter at the rally he's a small business owner play fourteen\nFirst I'd like to uh think President Trump for helping us with his fiscal policy which have enabled my company Arcadia electric [noise]\nTo bet on more work\nAnd uh take on more jobs um that were able to do now because we have more coming um that's available to us\nA more than ever before and as a result of that\nUm we have been able to\nKeep our a hundred and twenty people employed but next year we anticipate higher in twenty five percent\nMore a hard working union workers middle class um workforce tank or the president of the United states for his perseverance and for us to get this work [noise]\nAnd um [noise] to change the regulatory policies that he's been doing that he spoke of earlier this is all health food to us so President Trump Nineteen\nIs the what is the counterpoint to this really we're going to hear in a few minutes we'll talk about how it was about the war and like I needed to be around my war and in my Hillary impression and very similar because\nAnd I find them very similar even though they're I guess pretty different we need to turn around the country around you said earlier that we've got that sound forty drone how make it worse make us more poor turnaround\nThis wealth creation turn around the investment in the job creation that that's where we are in ...\nThis is what you get some left or even when things are going well even things that they hate things that work if it is ideologically not working because of what they\nSaid ... if it goes against their ideology that it doesn't matter that it's bringing all kinds of benefits to people and doing all sorts of good stuff so\nI I got to say I'm hearing it from the horse's mouth so to speak lots of business owners lots of investment professionals and they're saying is from ... the real deal we should remember that one of the midterms\n\nAn honor and privilege of bringing my thoughts on things that matter to us as Americans every day and you know your opinion matters to gene\n... started to tell you about this new social media site Snoopy dot com if your frustrated with the discourse on your social media pages and looking for an alternative take on conventional conversation ... is it\nIts boundaries of greater forum where people can feel free to express their thoughts frustrations ideas anything really on maybe dot com you can write about what's on your mind upload photos and strike up a conversation about anything\nOr you or someone you know a member of the ... community who's recently experienced sexual violence or maybe confused about a recent event you are not alone el GB GQ people and members of marginalized communities disproportionately experience sexual violence and all too often don't know where to turn\nIf you or someone you know and experienced sexual violence Fenway helps violence recovery program is here to help\nOur goal is to meet you where you are and help you get to where you'd like to be based on your individual goals and need sexual assault is not discriminate and\nNeither do we with offices in Boston Cape Cod western mass in Fall River Fenway violence recovery program provides L.

catastrophic\nImplosion between now and then she has in my mind no chance and I mean no chance\nOf defeating Donald Trump just doesn't have it doesn't have the skills\nAnd I think that she's also already really been marginalized by building a career based on racial fraud that's what she did she became a senator because she was a Harvard law professor she became a Harvard law professor because she claimed that she was a Native American on an application\nThere now I Would say that I'm actually\nIn favor of doing that meaning I'm In favor of using the system in that way but only to bring the system crumbling down and to be open and honest about it and say oh no I Know are not Native American but I claimed it I think I'm a\nI'm about two percent according to my brother's ancestry DNA I think I'm two percent so could I claim Native American status I'm I'm not exactly sure I don't I don't know but it's worth a shot\nBut I don't think Warren speaking of a shot I don't think warns got a shot and the fact that she's even talking about this for twenty twenty just goes to show you wow Democrats have a very weak bench right now\nAlso this notion that she needs to turn the country around and I I keep returning to this notion to this point because I I have to tell you I'm I'm sitting here and I keep saying to myself\nWhat exactly is the Democrats hate so much about what's happening around us what is really their objection again we're not starting wars in countries we don't need to be at war and we don't have some\nYou know we don't we don't have the worst thing happened in this country right now so crazy the Democrats are it's just the truth there's nothing that's going on right now that you say to yourself oh my gosh this doesn't stop I don't know what's gonna happen I don't know what kind of shape\nAre going to be a no that's that's not reality\nReality is that overall the country is doing quite well over all the country is on a very solid trajectory and you could say it's ... it's the strongest economy certainly since the year two thousand so it almost want to hear some people just wrong as economy more like forty or fifty years really strong\nSo I I have to ask what does she think needs to be turned around exactly the Trump tweets out mean things what what part of what she's saying here is based in reality versus what part of this is just demagoguery ... the usual stuff would expect from what\nI did it twice twice when\nShe has no charisma no charm nothing and men people are going to get really testy with all of\nThe mockery that's going to come her way for claiming that ... that ... you know she's not\nLook there's nothing there's no I'm not trying to say that being a school's not a good thing but she didn't have the academic pedigree to become a Harvard professor without it it's not like it was a close call unless you went to an Ivy League law school and then she wanted to be a professor at Harvard she went to a state school in New Jersey not a particularly\nYou know selective state school again not trying to be a jerk but she used because you can get a great education folks at any of these schools now really it's all up it's all up to

I saw\nHow to another sworn declaration today that a person was at parties in the eighties there was drinking insects and and knew the cabinet was that these parties\nI mean at what point are we just put it in high school drinking and socializing\nOr in some kind of weird public trial here there there's no names there's no allegations of specific criminality oh yeah I Know I I I'll swear I'll swear testimony out that I went to a party a long time ago and there are people who are drinking and having premarital sex and that was happening\nOkay that's not ... you can't dish prove that you're not gonna get in trouble for perjury it also doesn't prove anything they have an easy thing but the left should keep I keep running into they should be ashamed but are they have no shame and they view this as an end justifies the means such a situation and that's why\nI Want to remind everybody right now\nWe've got to keep our eye and the ball here this has never been this has never been about getting to the truth is to lay is not about getting to the truth it's not about being fair to Kavanaugh or even respecting the process in any meaningful sense\nThis has been do anything to get the Democrats' way that's what this is\nAnd I'm concerned we've got a lot of time it's going to pass\nBetween now and friday there was a lot of room for them to come up with something and you've seen the narrative shift oh the FBI investigation is in Folsom enough they haven't done enough and you've seen that happen but there's another component to this to\nThis is where I'm most concerned as\nTo how I could see a vote failing or the Senate not having the boats one or the other\nAnd that is this notion now that the only way that we can come back from this\nBrink of partisan a base is if Kavanaugh becomes the sacrificial lamb if Kavanaugh is the one who has to get swept aside here so that we can bring the country back together you see so that we can heal the nation\nI Want to slap myself as I say that but\nTrust me that resonates with people like flake Collins and Murkowski and you could see today some of them at least jockeying around this issue a little bit\nTrying to position themselves for maximum political benefit around Trump oh how how could he so terrible making fun of the victim\nWasn't making fun of or he was really making fun of her testimony which is a different thing a there are people who could make fun to a great extent of Dr Ford you know people will say oh she's so credible she came across was where it came across to me is very strange it a little disturbed\nAnd you know the day off I'm hearing all these people that are going on the media and saying well well I was you know I had a sexual assault in my password\nI Know somebody who's actually saw the show I Believe Dr Ford dishes ethically him a\n... completely untenable unacceptable position that will lead a monstrous outcomes something bad happened to me so I think that any time there's an allegation of that bad thing involving someone else I Believe that person or I Believe the allegations\nThat's not the way the system's supposed to work that's not the way moral judgment can be passed\nBut this was a hysteria there was a frenzy here and it was fed so much by politics but also by the personalization of so much of this\nKavanaugh versus Ford situation you notice the second the second allegation firmer mirrors and the third from sweat Nick ... they're barely even discussing that anymore\nJust ... you really can't make a case that somebody should be believe when that person isn't even sure that she knows what she's saying\nAs we found out what their emir as and in the third case would sweating it it's an intelligence test watched that interview with Julie sweat neck where she's talking about gang rape and being and in community college and hanging out with high school kids all this stuff and and if you think that she's being truthful\nDon't buy any books with big words in them anytime soon I it's just the truth\nIf you think she's being\nTruthful your your skills of discernment in analysis are ah are lacking\nTo say the least don't be fooled by what's happening with the Dems here\nDon't be fooled for a second just because the narratives are collapsing just because now we can really come out now it's really safe out there to say hold on a second there is some big gaps there's the whole there's women were lying are we to believe the second and third lying and that's just a coincidence but the\nFirst is Oso honest I have a hard time believing that now we can speak\nHonestly and truthfully about what has been said to us last week in week and a half\nAn inch\nWe need to understand that Democrats aren't just relying on that in order to take down Kavanaugh now it's going to be oh we need bipartisanship oh there's a\nTemperament issue here as we discussed yesterday it's about it's about Kavanaugh's character you see\nThey're stuffing his background this is the latest just breaking before I came on the air the ... the Senate with Feinstein in Coons just do basing themselves for the amusement of the ... cat wearing lunatic left\nThey're saying now that will be back renovation information from cabinet six other background checks that where the real mother lode is\nLet's talk about this and and much more aid for for nine hundred to eight to five eight four four nine hundred bucks team we have a jam packed show right back don't wait why\n\nEverybody is ... and I'm here in Studio in the free them up with mark Bachmann the c._e._o. of global verification network you know more when people hear about vetting and background investigation services they may not really understand the full scope of what you do like it's not just employers it's also property owners who can use your services\nTell me how that works thanks book and you're completely correct\nA lot of times when you're renting to people you want to ensure that their credit history along with their civil and criminal backgrounds are valid and viable and they haven't had a checkered past in one way or another we can help you by doing that by checking those issues and ensuring that you're renting to people who have the credit\nJust\nMore more ambushes and then smokescreen more no more nonsense more garbage this is where if I were somebody who used profanity on radio I think I'd have to throw them into the mix you were to describe what's going on\nThat Democrats have something else here I'm telling you there is something else they're going to all you know they they they are going to leak something if they ... from his background from his background files are going to find something to add into the mix year\nSo that they can say well you know you know even if Kavanaugh was not a rapist or a gang rape is which is what they were saying last week\nEven if that's not true now we have to take into account that his um\nPashtu spotty in some ways there are some places where it seems like you might have had too much to drink and I saw this letter about how he you know they should tell the neighbors that there are a lot of when they were in high school or high school seniors there's too much drinking a little bit of feuding\nThat's\nThat's on whether you think it's unfortunate behavior or not I mean whether you think it's a big deal or not that's very common place among millions and millions of Americans\nAnd Democrats the party of Bill Clinton and Ted Kennedy all of a sudden being Puritans my gosh alcohol and like men and women mixing of parties\nThat seems to me to be just as as brazen a as it gets\nBut they're saying here that the information and he's six background investigations that have already happened that's what has\nTo come out now also know that\n... Ford's lawyers will not hand over her polygraph examination notes or her therapist notes and she'll she gets to speak to the FBI\n[noise] here we go again why is the Y. is blah before why does she require speaking the FBI she already gave her statement under penalty of perjury\nThrough the house the Senate Judiciary committee so why does need to give the saints she's going to give it if she gives a different statement or the FBI\nThen she's lying and you've got to be pro matches and criminal jeopardy so she's not going to give a different state in the FBI she'll watch with this only give the information the FBI oh that's right more ... more complaint more delay\nWhich is the name of the game which is why flakes all thing I always found out since ... was that we should have had the vote last friday in the lake is a moron that's what we found out that's all we found out so far there's the that the information that's come to light has just been\nFurther evidence that cabinet or should have gotten his vote last week when they plan to do it and this is not healing the nation at all and I'm telling you they've got something else it's going to hit tomorrow [noise]\nThey're going to put something they're they're cooking something up behind the scenes I I I don't know exactly what it is but I think it's going to be about something unrelated to sexual assault now\nThey're going to say that Kavanaugh's an alcohol\nRevenge of the S.
