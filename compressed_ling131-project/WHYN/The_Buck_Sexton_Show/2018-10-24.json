Arabia certainly not going to feel the same for very long time and I'm not sure where the administration is going to stop this I think there may be some sanctions against individuals or there will be some replication of visas maybe they'll expel the Saudi ambassador\nBut it's going to be hard for people to hang out with Mohammed bin Salman anytime soon and act like everything's just fine\nUm that's that's where this ... thing for the media up to the left this was really just a it like I said it's an opportunity to bash Trump and that's what they are fundamentally most concerned but this is an opportunity to bash Trump because whatever he does will not be enough\nDoctors they'd also spoke about the uh the caravan which I wanted to spend a moment we'll talk more about that than the next hours this caravan which I Do Democrats that are tied house races and Senate races really don't want this getting all the attention is getting because it's a\nIt's a problem for the Democrat yeah the base is all about oh we just want to legal and bring people into the more the merrier but\nThe majority of the American people do war or ruled water the respect they do believe in sovereignty and pump ... spoke about the caravan today here's what he does say play twenty four\nThe migrants your caravan is violating Mexico's sovereignty laws and immigration procedures\nPresident Trump will not stand for this to happen to the United states\nTo those who say say this is a hard hard stance let's not forget that the United states is a historical generous nation when it comes to immigration\nFor one million people per year rented permanent legal status here in the United states\nOver thirty three million people to total are currently here who've immigrated to this country illegally\nTo those who want to come here\nCome here legally\nPretty straightforward isn't it and yet it almost sounds revolutionary coming from our own secretary of state\nCome here legally stop trying to find ways to get around our system actually use and respect our system and these people to keep saying that it's native fish than it's racist and all this to oppose masses of\nMasses of people just walking literally just walking into our country because they want to don't seem to take into account that we have had an enormous change in debt in the region decades and the demographics of this country in favor\nOf more and more and more immigrants all the time from everywhere from all over the world\nWe taking we we we had a million people a year told that they can stay in America forever legally in this country looting a large number of of citizens and as I've always said welcome to those who are citizens who come here legally ah but that's\nJust crazy for people to then say you know what we just uh we just really think that America has his native his policy and the caravan is yet another time where we're seeing the truth of it all that foreigners\nWere bringing in more people than anybody else but we're doing nobody else is doing nobody else is taking this approach and every other country has allowed to have borders why can't we have borders why doesn't sovereignty matters here\nWhy is it that that anyone should be able to come here and and then access our benefits member the tax\nDollars that you pay my friends or what gives these benefits and yet the protection of our military the protection of our court system\nThat's all paid for by us that it's time out of your life because that is what time is money right they you pay them money based on the time that you have accumulated either you're you're giving them hours of your life so that we have a judicial system so we have rule of law so we have a military\nThat protects us as well as the infrastructure and and

a sense among those who want to come to America without going through the legal immigration process that now is a good time ah now there's all this focus on\nThe caravan right now and and the\nUh the demographics of it who's in it you know they're the left will focus on the women and children that are in it but it was we know there are a lot of military age males there's a lot of young men that are part of this caravan uh the left will say that they're just seeking a better life and jobs but\nPeople in the right will say well hold on a second there is also going to be people with with gang ties in this tide realized that getting into America is going to be a much more lucrative for their elusive practices and\nThere's always going to be people that you would assume once they get to the border are going to try to use this mask that will strain any police resources used that moment to try to to try to bring drugs and other things over the board\nI mean that that's just we don't know but that's a reasonable expectation\nBut ultimately for the left this is I think a losing issue I'm a losing issue because the point is not how many ah middle Easterners or non Hondurans there are the point is that we don't know\nThat we have no verification mechanism in place that we have no means of proving who is and who is not a part of this whole thing\nOh and by the time they get to the border and there are so many thousands of them it's going to be too late for us to have any realistic process in place that's assuming they make the border maybe this will dissipate although I doubt it\nI doubt it but here is what a CNN was putting on for analysis on this last night get ready for it hit the decade CNN play succeed\nJust because someone is Middle Eastern of course there are no Middle Eastern people there\nBut that doesn't mean that they're bad it doesn't mean that there are terrorists you know we were in this world now where Trump can say Middle Eastern and everybody then immediately somehow began to think of terrorists of most of the terrorists that we are as we've had the United states are not being committed by Middle Eastern people or by Muslim\nThey're being committed by right wing extremists in our own country so I just did this to lie on top of lie on top ally wrapped up and live and then with life and then on top of it\nAnd I appreciate you trying to fact check it but I just don't I mean there are clearly you know people from other parts of the world who would try to come through the southern border there is no evidence of terrorists people with

losing their minds about the politics on this I mean they're they're show vicious and nasty and I'm desirous of\nAttacking one another as human beings and his people on and doing so with the most vitriolic terms they can think of\nThis is obviously a political discussion\nAs well it's going to be reconsider I considered child you'll look later on the show them and I've Joey Jones joined us these ... D walk us through everything we know about these bombs I had a little bit of bomb training myself back in the day and the CIA so you know ... and ... also dealing with kind of terrorism investigations which often involve\nA bombs in IDs\nSo we'll walk through that component of it but but the overwhelming focus of the media\nIs already are going to be about assigning blame and ah and settling scores you're quite honestly and and making sure that there is a maximum political impact\nAnd you you just heard that statement from President Trump he says there's no place for political violence in this country and Jeff Zucker overt CNN CNN is one of the places where they had this suspicious package and they did all their coverage today from outside of CNN and\nA ... Jeff Zucker released this official statement from CNN the president of CNN released this ... or you know ... President Trump had already said what are the audio that I played for you of you know there's no place for for political violence in American society not worth threats not that President says\nHere's how the president of CNN response quote there is a total and complete lack of understanding at the White House about the seriousness of their continued attacks on the media\nThe president and especially the White House press secretary should understand their words matter ... far they have shown no comprehension of that\nThis isn't just disgusting low blow from the president of CNN that's what this is this is it's the president's fault that some lunatic this is the president of CNN saying it's it's the president's fault the president's words\nThat are tied to this in some way right away without even knowing without even knowing who says or what the real motivation is\nThis is the this is a disgrace and\nNo shortage of this rhetoric coming from people now they they view this as a means of getting even with Trump now\nYou know and they also view this as wiping away what had become a very powerful narrative because it was so true that the left is a bunch of screaming mob ing maniacs\nNow they're going to say oh it's both are now now the the the entirety of the Democrat power apparatus and all of its all of its media wings which CNN is certainly one of them\nAre going to claim victims status over all the way up until election day before we even know who did it before we know anything about what they've done\nAnd you know I I'm Sorry but I Do not remember I Do not remember the head of Fox News or the head of you know it and forget about the head of it and they do not remember ah the the biggest names in the business that I Am in\nRush Limbaugh Sean Hannity or you know Glenn Beck I Do not remember any of them saying oh it's it's the fault of CNN for example it's the fault of CNN that a Bernie Sanders supporting lunatic\nActually shot Steve squeezing you almost died\nAnd tried to shoot a whole bunch of conservative members of Congress because of their insane rhetoric because of their ... they've been calling the president of the United states are trader a Russian huge a crazy person a rapist\nOr race is a white nationalist effectively a clan member and they said he's destroying the country he's undermining our institutions\nSomeone must take action someone must do something about this\n\nAnd here we are here we are\nAt a point we're finally there's a moment where the Democrat power structure feels like they are under threat and I and I I Am the ... I you know I Am consistent on this you do not hurt people hit people attacked people or worse because you don't like their ideas you don't do it\nNobody should do it knowing justified and doing it it's disgusting\nIt's illegal it's immoral and it's\nIf you really are a true believer in some ideology at least in America and now it's truly counterproductive because right now\nIf you\nTake those kinds of actions your entire side by I'd have to bear the consequences so to speak so it's it's wrong and and an evil in stupid on every level\nBut it's the Democrats who have been trying to blow these lines for the last six months or so and if the Democrats who have been saying all those things about President Trump since he became president\n\nAnd as I've been telling you if you really believe that we are descending into fascism as mainstream left wing writers will have been saying if you really believe depressed the United states is a threat of starting an unnecessary nuclear war\nIf you believe those things then\nTaking extreme measures does not seem like such a leap does it they have not been pushing back\nOn Trump for tax reasons they have not been pushing back on Trump's for you know health care with any of the same\nVigor and seriousness and ferocity and they have on all these fantasies that they have conjured around Russia collusion and twenty Fifth Amendment and Trump is crazy and he's going to start a war\nAnd now and now they want to pretend that oh it's it's Trump's fault that this up\nAnd this is right from the very top is just right from the top of the Democrat left wing power structure in the media Jeff Zucker himself\n\nGeoff my assistant is going to be overheard by a friend of mine declaring that CNN has declared war on Trump that's right that happened you have ... you\nKnow I can sit here and say without any feelings of of ah she position is that my criticisms of CNN all stand\nCNN is a dishonest news organization that is pushing an agenda that is further division in this country that lives about the president addresses it up as news coverage and that has a lot of coddled babies like Acosta and others\nWho refused to accept that you know if you want to be taken all kinds of shots at the Republicans and the president maybe they're actually going to criticize you back with words with words there are allowed to do that\n\nBut that doesn't mean that I Can't also sit here and say I am happy to hear that no one at CNN was hurt\nThat I have friends including some very dear friends who still work at CNN and even if I hated everybody CNN which I don't I Would still pray for every single one of them to be fine and come out of work unscathed and go home to their families and I do feel that way and I know you feel that way too\nBut there's something deeply wrong there's something unseemly and unethical about immediately trying to make it or will you can still criticize us and hope that we're okay you can't condemn these bombs being sent to us\nBut also continue to criticize no I I I can and will and it's not just seeing that it's all these other ... you know it's it's George Soros is doing the funds incredibly destructive\nIncredibly destructive programs for freedom and for liberty in America I mean he he is behind a lot of very bad stuff and then when you add it you know then you add into this also obviously the the Obamas and the Clintons have people who are ideological opponents\nDoesn't mean that I hate them I don't\nRespect the Clintons but I disagree strenuously with the Obamas I don't really respect the Clintons but that's a different thing I'm allowed to not respected that doesn't mean that I Would ever advocated violence against any political figure anyone for their beliefs for that\nMatter but not not even a day passes not even a day passes\nFor us to deal with this issue to figure out who's behind this to figure out what's going on or without it\nBeing used right away in the most obvious bashing to score political points like I said the Democrats think this is the way they can actually\nEnsure they win the house and maybe stopping a red wave in the Senate that's what they think this is that's what they're using this as a month and they brought this on themselves I'm not saying that this is a false like let's say any of that I'm just saying they're leveraging this for political purposes right away\nThe radio every ESPN Radio wherever you\nResist receives other religion is just for the\nThan a century World Series on ESPN Radio he's\nHome\nUse radio five sixty WHYY [noise]\n\nNo reason to assume motives to assume anything at this point but we do know what all of these targets have in common these are all targets that had been criticized mercilessly by right wing outlet uh by fringe groups on the Internet and\nBy some right wing commentators and already there's that's awful rush to try to claim it's a false flag operation fingers like Rush Limbaugh with a lot of power well a lot of influence well a lot of fans are out there saying awful things up but as you said it's a matter of leadership presidential leadership\nIt could be a ... why we don't know well\nWhy is it all I mean it's well they say it is because you don't know right so that's not to say it could be\nDemocrats there there are plenty of big hate crimes are this is this reminds me of when people say that women have a right to be believed they never lie well no actually there are women lie about sexual assault allegations and then you write off a number of prominent cases and not to say that everyone's longer ones not lying but everything is judge that an\nIndividual basis could there be a false flag going on yeah of course they're good oh of course there are good\nWhy is that beyond the pale did this could change the election for the Democrats noticed I'm not saying it is ... and I don't know we just don't know you got a ration attacked the media barely even better than either someone send rice enjoy matters in the White House or the Pentagon\nNo that was a story for about an hour on ...\nSo we ... what what are they ... the whole ... thing there with oh you know I must say we're not blaming anybody just all the right wing people criticized these people and that's the only thing we know about them so it's clear the right wing ... that's that's what you're really to take away from that\nLeg this game of ... we're not jumping to conclusions but here's a conclusion with a left up to hear oh this is inherently a very political issue\nAnd I and I know that this is a serious issue and nobody should be no should be bothered no one has been injured yet either so let's also let's let's not let's not back resolves into we can't even talk about this oh my gosh you know the\nYou know there's ... there's a you know the bodies haven't even been very you know what you've been harmed yet so we should feel free to talk about this issue without feeling like we are being disrespectful to the families of the you know\nWe want everyone to be safe we want everyone to be okay but this is in the heat of a political campaign to so yeah this is an issue we are going to
