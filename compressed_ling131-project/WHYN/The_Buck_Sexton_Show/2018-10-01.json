Fox News the leader of the Senate says they will vote on the president's choice of a Supreme Court at the end of the week\nSo You're welcome to weigh on in on this at any time then joining the conversation now today\nToday we had a the Monday after all the Sunday shows\nAnd I look forward to what happens on the Sunday shows 'cause we can get a couple of things\nIn our minds if you watch the Sunday talk shows meaning meet the press and ABC's This week and Fox News Sunday and even the thing over and CBS that nobody watches and Jake Tapper you can kind of get an idea\nWhat the talking points are from both sides of the aisle and yesterday Lindsey Graham was doing ... do\nYou getting out there making what I Would consider a primary ... case against the Democrats and exposing what they have done the despicable approach they took on trying to block judge Kavanaugh at all costs\nSo I'm a I'm Amazed amazed at what I saw I Lindsey Graham just lifted my heart last week when he made that statement saying what a weasel the Democratic side of the aisle he turned into and how they treated judge Kavanaugh\nAnd if you watched the Sunday talk shows I was going to say that it was the greatest episode of meet the press ever\nBut I don't know if anybody will get the joke yesterday was the single best episode of meet the press that I have ever seen\nNo nobody\nWell it wasn't on last week because uh\nThe Ryder Cup match the golf match preempted it so that's why was the single greatest episode ever but the the terminology that has shown up\nIn the language of the left when it comes to blocking judge Kavanaugh now let's go over some of the arguments that they have a brought up to block Kavanaugh one of those arguments was well he's going to ah he's going to overturn roe overturn roe v way\nThat was the first one they said we can't have that she's going to overturn roe v way and then after the meetings with judge Kavanaugh and some of the testimony it seems like you\nKnow maybe he's not going to come in with a judicial prejudice in and look to overturn roe v white so they they shifted gears and then suddenly at the end of the hearing process they came up with this accuser and the anonymous accuser that Dianne Feinstein at Santa for six weeks\nAnd so we said wait a minute we're going to question his character from thirty six years ago on we then discovered how many holes there were in the story of professor Ford\nAnd then over the weekend after the testimony and I was in DC last week I saw block on Thursday we ran into each other the book party for a friend of ours\nI was in D.C to cover the or the hearing and the protests and then last week when they look like\nDespite all the obstruction and deflection and and all the moves that were being made by the left that judge Kavanaugh was going to push through and we would still have this week long investigation which everybody knew\nEverybody and the dog knew that the Democrats who were going to complain that a week was not enough\nThey started shifting the narrative and listen to your friends listen to your friends on the left who are saying they're using the phrase the wrong temperament to be a Supreme Court justice\nHe has the wrong temperament\nThis is being said by virtually every single one of the pundits it's being said by the senators the or the Congress people on the left and are bringing it up\nAnd you will hear the parrots from the left on Facebook and Twitter bringing it up he's the wrong temperament and SNL which will get into\nThat so now when after Kavanaugh and ... and everyone's saying he was yelling I'm Sorry he wasn't yelling if that's what you called yelling\nYou're ignorant\nAnd let's not forget a week and a half ago when a judge Kavanaugh was interviewed on Fox News they said oh he's too robotic he's he doesn't have a motion and then when it comes out in defends himself and his family he's called too emotional he doesn't have the right temperament\nThey're even now playing the card if a woman had done what judge Kavanaugh did\nShe'd be called hysterical and not the good hysterical you know the the craziest here we'll get into that a little bit but it got to check in with one of the buck family on the phone from Alabama Solomon checking in this evening Solomon welcome to the buck section and show how are you\nDoing fabulous I'm Glad you're there but now a move the country forward\nOh God Bless you thank you what what part of Alabama my friend\nWell I'm ...
