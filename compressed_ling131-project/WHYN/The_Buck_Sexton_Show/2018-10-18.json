end\n[noise]\n\nShe was you know because when it comes to the fight for shell shocked never Josh\n[noise] [laughter] I think\nWe're going to do really well and I\nI look I don't want to make predictions we have great poll numbers we have tremendous turnout at these rallies thousands and thousands of people more than we can hold this enthusiasm like we had at you know the last election twenty sixteen which was quite a spectacular day in the evening I think we have a lot of enthusiasm and I keep hearing about\nThe enthusiasm the blue wave but I think we have tremendous centers yeah\nI Do think we have a lot of enthusiasm and I spoke to Donald Trump junior yesterday and sure enough\nHe uh he is I could tell very optimistic about how it's looking for the Republicans going into the midterms you know I think that he's I'm really feeling it when he's going out there and meeting with all these different people in the campaign trail\nBut you know the this is going to be very close it's going to be very very tight indeed and there was one thing that Trump brought up in that same interview a I think of that same interview that that is really got me\nA concern and it has to do with what happens if the economy takes a nosedive and if it if it's cyclical I don't think that's going to necessarily be on Trump play a clip six\n... or anything in this country when we say oh there's but there's no inflation is very low on tape Powell my thing is that because the fed is arranging rage just too fast and it's independent so I don't speak to him but I'm\nNot happy with what he's doing because it's going too fast because he looked at the last ... numbers are very low\nThis is going to result in some painful stuff going forward ah this is going to be an issue and I would say this there were people that were writing books right after the crash in two thousand nine saying things like you know this time is\nA this time is different or how this is a unique and uniquely dangerous moment in our economic history and and there was a there was a real clarity around\nWe're in uncharted territory or starting in two thousand or ... or so\nAnd I think we've been a little complacent for a while now even with the debt Twenty one trillion dollars we reached this point where there's all this prosperity Trump is cutting regulations cut taxes so much good stuff is happening\nAround the country and sure enough\nI'm what I think we're starting to see now is an understanding that there is going to be\nSome rough water and that's a very gentle way I think of saying it as a result of unraveling all this all this money we put out in the system all this chewy and these things that have been done last ten years\nTo keep the economy going to try and and do you know Keynesian stimulus\nAnd you know you have people like Krugman who are saying oh this stimulus isn't enough right that was the problem them but we spent all this money and you have an enormous or a series of enormous debt bubbles\nA student loan debt trillion dollars credit card debt trillion dollars auto loans especially subprime auto loans very very high uh we're more indebted now\nThat when we were at the time of crisis in many ways and you know deeper and deeper in debt and we are deeper in debt when it comes to national debt\nAnd we haven't really fix than any of this stuff structurally now be impossible for Trump to fix it right away but here's my concern that I'm not I cannot do economic prognostications I really can't right that's not something that is in my daily political stuff maybe national security stuff shore but\nHere's where I see there being an issue right now and ... and that's your job and are all these other groups out there in the far left wackos\nAre considered very fringe will you'll notice that the the media apparatus in general is very slow to condemn them and generally uh does not seek to um\nYou know talk about them any more than they have to and I think it's because they do have a certain ideological solidarity with the right they maybe they don't agree with all of what ... does all the rhetoric but they like that they view themselves as resistance to drop right they like it they view themselves as\nA opposite oppositional and willing to take action about all this\nAnd with that\nUh I I think we have to remember that they could very quickly become a much bigger part of the political conversation if this is the ... this is what worries me if we have a major economic\nHe was so upset when he was a writer on Saturday Night live that he just he quit but in quitting he screamed in the face\nOf a ... of his boss I guess it was Lauren Michael's but mine but somebody else screams based on quitting on not at all thing and then when he went home and it was over the weekend he realized oh my gosh what am I ... I don't have a job or that was a great job I made a terrible mistake\nAnd then he\nDidn't know what to do and thought and falling thought and then he figured out he figured you know what I think he talked to a friend who told him and do this if I remember the story right which I might be missing some of the\nDetails and he just showed up to work on Monday and pretended like nothing had happened and it worked\nEveryone just acted like he was fine and he just you know they maybe they forgot the mouth out or just chose to ignore the whole thing but they wanted them there and he showed up at everyone just went about their business no he said there was not even a conversation about it\nUh so I think that's what it lives with one thing she's going to do when it comes right for the presidents I think are approaches hey America let's just\nPretend that that whole thing didn't happen let's just get past the whole DNA thing and\nI'm Still your progressive heroine right let let's pretend that that's the case show I'm not going to fly\nAnd we heard there from Debbie White delve a poor echo who is a descendant of the real Pocahontas Pocahontas was a real person it's you know John Smith book honest although I gotta say John I think that the Pocahontas animated Disney film is one of the weaker ones not not good\nCan you seeing with all the colors of the mountain I don't even know what that means right and that was not particularly in June you get the idea you know what I'm Talking about some of the some of the young ones and they're like yeah I liked the Pocahontas but yeah it's fine\nI mean the best she's actually to you know I ... and people are going to get married for this one I think you gotta figure the best animated Disney movie\nIt's tied for me between a Latin in Lion King I mean their their neck and neck I think those are those are two of the best I'm also very partial to beauty and the beast of I Know it's a little more for tend to be a little more for the ladies\nBut it's very well done was the first animated film ever known it for us the okay bakar poker back to a descendant of the real Pocahontas\nHabit ah what what you saw here was that the left\nHas this whole framework of something that call cultural appropriation I'd the last has this framework where they will say um you are not allowed to make the cuisine\nOf another of another culture you know you're not allowed to wear the ah the garb of another culture and cultural appropriation let me just say is a stupid concept because all culture borrows and steals and is influenced by other cultures all the time\nIn fact if you were to look back at what we consider to be western fashion a lot of the most well known western fashions today come from other parts of the world are ... are from fabrics that we're only possible because of colonialism and I mean there's there's a lot of stuff\nI mean you were like oh you mean like Muslim city of Mosul for example ah you know getting a pattern from Malaysia getting I mean you think of as a very\nWasp be northern northeastern\nAmerican kind of a thing but now that comes from Malaysia ah Sears sucker comes from India you've heard me talk about that before so\nCold culture is always changing and shifting and we should celebrate anything that's good at any culture right is this notion that people have a a particular claim on a kosher strikes me as odd to begin with but if you're going to be policing appropriation\nThen for somebody who is as white as Elizabeth Warren\nTo claim that she was a Native American specifically for the benefits they're all but also\nReally to to to have some kind of an identity to make her a more interesting person which I think it was all part of this I mean she wrote in she was a fake Cherokee who wrote into a cook book called powwow chow\nAnd stole a recipe from my real French chef and called it a charity recipe so it's a fake charity stealing from a French chef to make a fake Cherokee recipe\nWow that is this is the person who wants to be the next president states by the way you know there are a lot of personal failings there are a lot of things\nThat I think I you know you could point you in any number of people and say you know that\nI could have made that mistake you know there's there's there's certain things that you can feel a little bit of a personal understanding of it and say you know what that person maybe across the line with that or\nThat went bad but I can understand how it got there I can understand what the circumstances were that led to it ah being that way\nI'm pretending or Native American for many many years has not won a and and I played that story for yesterday where she talked about her mom and how her mom was dealing with the sting of racism because of her Cherokee family really their parents were\nOr you know that that the parents involved here were worried about the grandparents I guess for Elizabeth Warren about a maybe eighth ninth tenth generation back\nNative American ancestor that's a that's pretty crazy\nThat's pretty well but cultural appropriation was always destined to collapse under its own stupidity and the moment that it is politically advantageous to last will try it out once again the most oh no you can't do that you can't wear that kind of costume oh I saw this stupid\nHulu all these platforms are just overrun by lives can't we just get some normal people involved a guy\nWho had something about you know this Halloween you don't wear a costume that's offensive twenty culture or a culture ancestry or whatever\nOkay so now that means no no no costumes or somebody dressed as a Native American garbage can dress up as Pocahontas you can dress up as any of the foreign Disney Princess is\nA ... and I just wonder you know what but if you're if you're not white then under liberal rules do you have the right to dress up as anything that's not as any person or you know any entity that's non white\nFor a Halloween then so is it really just white people that aren't allowed to dress up in and cultural Garp\nThat's not you know I guess I could wear Viking ... I mean I could wear a Viking thing\nBut I don't know I don't know what the rules are and here's write off for you I don't think the left knows what the rules are either I mean I I think that they\nIn general just make it up as they go along and this is just a power trip it's all a power to remember political correctness started out as a means of trying to rebalance power for what they thought were a underrepresented indiscriminate minorities but with time political correctness is just turn into a weapon\nFor those who want to use those groups and I'm Talking about white liberals now for their own purposes right to use those groups for their own power so cultural appropriation\nAs stupid term but bottom line here is that if what Elizabeth Warren did knock cultural appropriation\nThere is no such thing he does not exist even for ... [noise]\nWas visiting with buck about his show on home titled fried\nWe're the retired FBI agent demonstrated a crime dislike everywhere it's called home title fraud and it's simple because all home titles are kept on line in fact the FBI guy\nAnd home title log found the title to bucks family's home they forged id and showed him how easy it is to transfer title and lose your home had it been real estate for taking out loans using\nAnd I won't even get into it I mean the but the description of stuff that she says in that book and it was reported on with glee by\nMajor news outlets these people have no decency have no integrity yet they try to use\nOur integrity against us and this is what brings us to this difficult political moment where what you good people\nDo in American politics in American Life who are sick of losing because they refuse to sink to the other side's tactics what did they do right\nIf you if you don't want to do with you if you're if you're not willing to go and fight if not dirty it'll be no holds barred how do you defeat the other side and the answer is I don't know that you can\nI think we all have to be prepared for a fight and I think that the left is realizing that they cannot persuade the American people to their side in the argument and they can't even successfully propaganda using the media as their\nMassive echo chamber and as a as a reinforcement mechanism for the Democrat Party as I said Jewish and executive which I'll talk to you about later this hour on Twitter today and appendage of the DNC which is what\nCNN it but if they can sway the American people with all of that\nMay be the plan really is just to try and smear us into submission to try and be as aggressive as possible with us personally and as threatening as possible in groups yes I'll say moms\nMaybe that's the really the plant that's what they think that's where the aid of the Democrat Party is right now and I I Believe that is true you know Nancy Pelosi who is just such a such a Charlotte\nNow ... what is Nancy Pelosi samples used as an incredibly rich courtesy of her husband are disconnected from normal people self involved political powerbroker\nThat's what she really is helping people care about people here's what Nancy Pelosi what do you\nThink about it or what what can you point you oh or or great achievement was ramming through Obamacare\nThat's that's fantastic talked to somebody who has to deal with Obamacare now or lost her health care plan and tell them how great Nancy Pelosi is I think you'll you'll hear some four letter words\nThis is now where it where it's all gone this is this is the reality of trying to deal with them um and by the way ... essentially endorsing this anything goes at any cost attitude play Thirteen\n\nThey way they can [noise]\nI guess where they say that I have to have to weigh in on\nYou see she's saying and this is part of the disconnect you have from a left she saying on the one hand do would you have to do to win big right do whatever you got to do I mean that that's really what follows these views on this do whatever you got to do I just don't let the Republicans with\nAnd then the same time she's saying but I refused to let the Republicans you know she she goes from anything goes just wind power to oh I'm so outraged that how how rough the Republicans play this game this reminds you what we saw after cabinet after the Kavanaugh\nTravesty that was televised for the whole nation is the after all that\nThe Democrats didn't take a step back and say you know maybe we shouldn't have been psychopathic about this maybe we shouldn't have tried to enrich realistic fashion torture man on TV in front of his wife and children tens of millions of Americans were watching because we just really want a Supreme Court justice there that\nAgrees with us ideologically that's all it was wasn't about women wasn't about sexual assault that was all part of\nThe smear campaign that was the plan all it was about power it was about a Supreme Court seat but their take away from that\nWasn't okay hold on a second maybe we shouldn't have gone quite so dirty maybe we shouldn't have taken it to such extreme lengths and engage in such represents will be hit or no they can't really think the Republicans were playing so mean\nThe Republicans were so mean to editor in chief of political\nWrote an editorial he says you know I guess the gloves has to come off though if that's the gloves on meaning Kavanaugh and what they did the gloves off I'm Sorry I mean gloves off after what they did a cabinet could only mean violence and and widespread civil disobedience and and writing in the streets I mean there's just\nThere's nothing else you know that if you're going to take it to the level of 'cause remember\nThey didn't just want to destroy capitals character they were talking about trying to trying to dredge up criminal charges against him oh there's no statute of limitations in Maryland oh there should be a criminal investigation oh she's ready to go to the police\nThey wanted him in prison they want her to use the state to lock up cabinet not just stop him from the Supreme Court they will do anything as long as it was going to destroy\nAnd they thought that wasn't enough they thought that was playing by gentlemen Lee rules\nHow do you have a conversation with people like that how do you have a discussion with people who take that approach the answer is I I don't know what they call you could do you stay true to yourself stay strong and when\nI'm now seeing the wisdom of Donald Trump telling us all that we're going to win so much we're going to get tired of winning we need you\nThe alternative is putting people in positions of power who cannot be trusted with it who do not act with decency who do not acted in good faith do not care about the law\nAnd what's ... perhaps most disturbing of all they don't even recognize those things anymore they're so ruthless they don't even understand that they are ruthless it's a terrifying thought\nThere's a lot of social media activity out there but you know that all the stories of piled up over time and there is bias at work\nWhat if we can have a platform where you know that you're not going to have to deal with censorship and you don't have to worry about conversational health or

do I do or or happy learned how to hurt\nA so the headline on media today CNN executive trade barbs with X CNN commentator I don't think of myself as an ex CNN commentator technically that's true but I was just there for a little bit low but your shoveling\nStuff although they didn't say stop to score cheap points obviously there's a person running the media to lives they wanted to go with the big line from the CNN\nSo a senior CNN executives throwing down with buck section is according to media I'd a former political commentator for the network Africa conservative pundit criticized the network's coverage of Elizabeth Warren's ancestry\nThe ... began after the right wing host of the hill TV posted a critique of CNN's reporting on warns attempt to prove or Native American heritage warns claim has been a source of criticism for years this week's you open yourself to scrutiny or again since or DNA test results they her Native American ads that she might amounts only one in one thousand and twenty four\nSo here's what I wrote folks\nUm it's a good thing CNN wasn't blatantly complicit in the massive on forced air ward pulled yesterday that would have been really embarrassing oh\nWait a minute and I had below that Elizabeth Warren this is the CNN politics headline Elizabeth Warren releases DNA tests with strong evidence of native and Native American ancestry no strong evidence is in quotes\nBut that's ... that's hysterical right I mean this would be like this will be like running with a headline that says you know for somebody that was caught on video you know that that that is and it's already confessed the murder be like\nA man accused of murder not guilty in quotes and they'd be like well it's that that's what his lawyer said\nOkay but is that you're making an analytic judgment by pulling that out in the strong evidence\nIt it's not strong it's garbage is not strong evidence knowing Dixon strong evidence they would never do this if it were Republican anyway so this drew the attention of CNN vice president of communications all Matt ... never heard of this part of my life\nWho defended the network's coverage while accusing section of not actually reading the piece I read the piece but thanks that that's cute anyway\nMatt wrote to me see how strong evidence isn't in quotes that means it's a phrase attributed to someone other than the author it's almost like you didn't read the article or watch our coverage oh wait\nA okay that well I did read the article and I did see your coverage because CNN is on the news room where I work all day long so yes I saw lots and lots of see it as garbage and it was a appalling me stupid so there's that\nAre in the media outlets unfamiliar to fight to get an earth bucks X and responds to ...\nHa ha sure dude CNN coverage of war is DNA release was really top notch journalism and your headline wasn't clearly constructed to put a positive spin on a disastrous decision by likely Democrat twenty twenty candidate just own your bias\nAnd he writes give me a break you didn't watch or read our coverage you're just shoveling S H on Twitter to score cheap points here six more headlines from CNN and the DNA test I don't care if you criticize Y Z but I have no time for trash\nBooks actually goes back that's funny you're leaving out this gym of analysis by a reporter a quote reporter who wrote in this piece Donald Trump never cared about Elizabeth Warren's DNA\nWeight but that is a reporter she's doing analysis though oh you mean opinion\nBut no they called analysis but oh she's a reporter so what's the difference there was no difference are defined game and then I wrote to him CNN tried to run covered for war and and then got caught looking dumb your coverage than adjusted out of self preservation it's fine to be a DNC appendage just own it\nYup yup yup yup yup yup yup that was fun just take your spanking CNN just take your spanking and just go home All right don't don't try out

thinks that he can just deny his way out of it\nSo what exactly is in his for Trump now but here's here's the Russia or cut cut through the\nKind of fall back on my work as a prosecutor where if it takes this long to\nCome up with this explanation as to what happened well we kind of already know that the Saudis are responsible now they're speaking to mitigate or just you know who knew at the highest\nLevels and actually this is very similar to many of the witnesses we had in our Trump Russia investigation a number of times we ask a witness a question and they would take a timeout consult with their lawyers for five or ten minutes\nAnd then come back and we figured you know we already know the answer because there was a pretty simple one and I was so disturbing here is that the United states actually part of the you know\nHe's invited himself again if it takes this long to come up with an answer than we know the answer the same thing could be set up the Russia investigation if it

far as I'm concerned it was based on fact of history\nAnd I believe it was not over the top you know the Democrats as far as the cabinet or a a a areas or can strike they really acted like Nazis and and suddenly they get to the past\nThey did I I mean there there was a total lack of due process here and and you know and then why they keep saying I think the maybe the scariest thing that was that

have laws that are in place\nSpecifically so that we do not have people show up and just\nStay\nIf we didn't have those those yes we would open borders state the Democrats are planning to demagogue this issue\nThey are going to use this to try and get their base fired up are going to try to use this to create this sense of a moral separation between the Trump Administration and the Democrat Party and between the Republicans who support Trump on this issue and the Democrats\nAnd is very likely that these individuals who are going to show up at the border will\nEnd up in the interior of the United states ah they will be processed but if they claim asylum if they turn themselves in a and they claim asylum they are going to get a hearing the hearing will be delayed so you'll have another another wave and another wave\nWhat happens when you have a law that is not enforced what happens when the state has decided their actions that are bad but there are no consequences for that bad behavior what we're seeing this happen right now\nIt is show very easy for Democrats particularly well off connected coastal elite Democrats who don't compete with illegal immigrants for jobs you don't have to worry about illegal immigrants uh and draining\nFrom over already overcrowded public schools public schools that are attended by Americans of all ethnic backgrounds of all religions\nThey don't have to worry about that doesn't affect them in fact\nThey view it as nothing but win win by being essentially for open borders from Latin America at least in this country the Democrats get to feel morally superior\nThey get to achieve power and\nPerhaps even eventually defeat the Republican Party for ever by changing the demographics of this country such that there'll be a majority of voters built in for always and and forever for the foreseeable future leaders who vote Democrat\n'cause they know that immigrants particularly the elderly people well [laughter] illegal immigrants they're not supposed to vote for them but who really knows what's happening there uh but but immigrants in general\nAre tend to vote Democrat and people who come to the country and have a greater need for all kinds of government services are obviously going to vote for the party of the government the party of the state and state isn't that the Democrats\nNow why is it a bad thing for the president to say enough stop we can't keep doing this the answers that it's not\nBut they won't ever tell you the Democrats the media when they set up his problem they won't act like there are two sides to it they're not going to present this as hey we understand is very difficult problem\nUh this is how we come down on this and we would like the president to take the following actions no they want to point fingers and scream racist and they want photos of crying children being separated from parents they want photos of\nPeople looking hopeless and indigent being told by immigrations and Customs Enforcement or being pulled by border patrol in this case you know you're you're now going to be taken into custody and they hope to make this an emotional issue\nIf it's really that emotional Fordham why don't they just make the case that\nThe imagery makes for them which is well I guess we should just taken everyone and everybody everybody who has been waiting in line for years has been going through the legal process\nAnd who is respected our laws are many people who are still waiting to get into this country and whoever respected our laws along I I guess they're just Trump's they don't have and MSNBC CNN New York times Washington Post in their corner so they don't count\nAnd it's just very very destructive and it's also ultimately an issue of sovereignty\nIf the United states cannot determine who comes here under what circumstances then it's just a matter of time before the United states ceases to exist as a policy we will be a different country different political union if we don't control who comes in who goes\nYou cannot have open borders and the welfare state I think the answers are really the truth is you can't have open borders and state\nYou have something else I don't know what it is no other country in the world allows says no other country in the world takes in a million people and makes them legal and God Bless them welcome to America legal citizens year in and you're at a million a year I'm Sorry legal permanent residents and citizens a million a year\nSo a lot every year working in a million for a legal process\nAnd when when Trump says well for security purposes we're gonna take refugees Middle East down from think something like fifty thousand to thirty thousand all my gosh he's like a ... he's a monster\nWell hold on a second we're already taking a million a year are we allowed to discuss that number changing can a number only go in one direction can only get larger this is also why yes we do need a wall 'cause it's not realistic to expect the president's gonna keep having\nFirst of all we have a Democrat president going to do anything\nAnd if we have Trump even in office for\nIf we're lucky the next six years\nTo try and stem the tide of recurrent migrant marches to the border is just not realistic by sending additional forces by dealing with this on a one off basis you need a permanent barrier you need a wall\nDemocrats don't want to do because Wal\nFirst off would prove its utility very quickly and then they'd all the forces are walls don't work no I'm pretty sure walls work you know if you're if you're going to walk on your neighbors' property and there's nothing there that's pretty easy for going to walk her neighbors' property and has a ten foot cement wall\nThings just got a little harder you may think twice about walking onto their property in trespassing right\nThis couldn't be any more straightforward but they said oh walls don't work and works in San Diego San Diego sector of the border fence they're absolutely works so why wouldn't workouts where all they don't have any answers for you they just don't want it to get built because once it's built we can see that it works and once we see that it works\nAnd they're they can't do very much about it I don't think they're going to be successful with you know break the wall down\nThis is one area where Trump has an on look he has an unfulfilled promise now as to who's behind this march and who's pulling the strings here I Know there's a lot of theories out there I don't know but I Do know that this is not a coincidence\nThat you have the largest of these migrants caravans that I that I Know of just a couple of weeks before the midterm elections on the way the border\nThis allows the media to play the emotional manipulation game this allows them to forget about the fact that the economy is incredibly strong to forget about the fact that all their\nPredictions about economic calamity because of Trump and all the things that they've said twenty Fifth Amendment he has to be removed 'cause he's crazy Russia collusion that the mainstream media has wasted over a year the American people's time\nOn this fantasy that Trump colluded with Russia worse than a fantasy minute it's a plot it's a plot that was put into motion by anti Trump elements in our own government to undermine the president I'd states\nThey wasted a year of our time on this year and a half of our times it's insane is absolutely insane\nBut\nThey can get enough people at the border looking sad and looking hopeless take lots of photos of lots of videos and talk about how heartless Trump is for enforcing the law that was the law in the books during the Obama administration about how the safety\nOf all involved and also yes as a deterrent you separate people from their children at the border you should reunite them but this is the process that they have had\nAnd if they do this again I Know the Trump administration's changed the way that they're going to do it because the outcry originally but if there's any separation whatsoever even a temporary separation I mean even a matter of hours\nWe're going to be told that it's heartless it's cruel it's you know it's evil it's a it's a Nazi concentration camps all over again I'm not making that up people were saying that about this people that we're still supposed to take seriously in public discourse which is\nIn itself just ... we are in a fight my friends and we need to understand is such the other side or the future of the Trump agenda and the trajectory of this country for at least
