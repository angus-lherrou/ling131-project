Congress or NATO and the White House and it was close and that's why would Lindsey Graham bit it's easy now to see it and say oh well did it really matter that Lindsey Graham jumped him when he did the answers abs so ...\nIf ... ... and also this this storyline is pathetic more onyx storyline about how Kavanaugh was to mean\nAnd his response and so he's not he's not judge like\nEven though he's been a judge for like over a decade and the D.C court of appeals he wasn't being a judge when he was in front of the Senate he was being accused of\nOf being a a predator and she was on the defense stand okay he was being treated like a a criminal even though it's a non criminal proceeding he wasn't being a judge you being treated like a criminal\nThe reason they're so upset though and that they would switch that narrative is that they thought they had him on the ropes they thought they were going to finish them off and Lindsey Graham along with Kavanaugh rallied but this was close and I think that\nThat gets lost and all this and it also was not without consequences I had the opportunity\nTo speak to our buddy to ... on rising that interview will be appearing tomorrow morning if you want to see it you go to heal the TV but I was able to speak about this little bit and he made some important point I'm One that\nIt's not like there are not consequences for cabinet that came from this Harvard said that he's no longer allowed to teach because they they ... once again at the academy they caved to the leftist mob this is how they do things their place Thirteen\nPrime particularly outraged at my colleagues and students at Harvard law school those of them who have made it impossible for Kavanaugh to continue to teach their it's rampant McCarthyism at its worst reminiscent\nOf what I experienced what I was a student at Brooklyn College in the fifties where professors were fired because it was suspected that they went Seventeen or Twenty years old they might have been a members or fellow travelers are the Communist Party which just have to put an end to this\nAs right this has to stop\nGoes dishes corrosive to politics this degrades and your roads political discourse and for the\nFor the last two have ever been the ones trying to shame conservatives over Trump and his and his erasing of norms\n... the hypocrisy here is insane factors also spoke about that specifically about how how one of the primary things you see going on here with the way the left tried to take on Capitol just how hypocritical thing is but it's well\nIt's a ... around rampant the constitution would not permit impeachment of a sitting justice for actions he took while a private citizen thirty five years ago a nor I think what it for ... using\nThe laws of perjury which are very tough after me about a material fact it has to have been a deliberate live not forgetful is not a Bush not an exaggeration but it will full deliberate lie about um material facts\nI think that the Democrats are shooting themselves in the foot we ought to be moving forward let's judge justice Kevin off on his um performance as a justice of the Supreme Court [noise]\nThat's right\nLet's actually ... doesn't even like Kavanaugh the judge\nTheirs was disagrees with his jurisprudence disagrees with a he disagrees with McConnell by the way is\nLike a boss\nGotta give credit where it's due because I don't get too big high fives pull off your virtual disagrees with holding the Senate or are they holding the Americans that has to be the Merrick Garland seat open which I Would not want your Gorsuch is not this isn't even this isn't even the guard Lindsey but people still talk about that like there are keeping some kind of a scoreboard tally\nYou want to keep a scoreboard you know what you got to keep in mind the only reason Republicans were able to get through the justice is they they do right now is because Harry Reid figured hey I'll I'll Obama's going to be president forever man so let's just pack the court with left wing activists pretending to be judges and let's get rid of the filibuster\nHarry Reid started that battle started that fight Republicans now set to finish it at least for the time being\nA but this is this is where you see that the\nDamage that has been done to I I think too that the whole Senate confirmation process I think they should just get rid of it I mean they should do it but it should be a very pro forma\nYou know okay this guy presents no witnesses nor grandstanding for the senators no more asking questions that are really just disguise speeches none of that\nIt should turn into okay this the this justice gets to make a statement and then the Senate votes that's it that's advisor they know his background their nose or her background in case a cases have been involved and that's it\nNo because otherwise you open it up to this and we're going to even this character assassination ever was bad just wait\nUntil Ruth Bader Ginsburg is

there's where my mother my I get from [laughter] you know we don't all I see your eyes you buzz while I watch them hey maybe\nIsn't are ridiculous books I mean the the left wants to lecture us about Trump and his decorum and his tweets\nAnd army hearing more and more from our swamp sources that they're the plan really is as much as I'm hoping it's Hillary me as much as I'm hoping it's Hillary the plan is going to be worn for twenty twenty\nMaybe Warren and then a a a a veep ticket of either a Kamala Harris or maybe maybe Booker\nBut they really think it's going to be Warren and you know here's somebody who is entirely unremarkable in her career weren't not for racial fraud\nRacial fraud you know if you lie about the assets you have in the bank to get a loan to go to jail you know a lot of trouble prison federal prison and if you lie about that you get it all out of trouble if you lie about\nYour race in order to get into a university or in this case to get a professorship at a at the most prestigious university really at\nHarvard or Democrats as long as you told the line for them or are willing to excuse the whole thing I mean it it should it seem it's embarrassing and there's a middle is with Warren has now here's what's important about it to me well there's a lot of things\nBut here's what I won't let go she has never owned up to this she has never said if she came out and said you know what I disagree with the racial spoil system\nI did dish knowing that I could get away with it because I don't believe that this was ethical you know but maybe she could claim but I also think I have enough that technically I caught technically a qualified no\nInstead she pulled this whole high cheekbones thing and then we're supposed to pretend that somebody wants to law school at Rutgers I'm not putting Rutgers down but you don't go to law school workers and they become a professor at Harvard law you just don't unless you have a special angle\nI didn't less you have something to help you through and she's never been forced to own up to this and the fact that the less I mean this is just like the NFL kneeling thing you know Trump is incredible at\nPicking means areas he he it really is like a political six sense that he has he knows that he can pick things that the less just get so fired up and energized about that they lose sight of whether it's a political winner for them or not\nAnd you know the NFL kneeling for example the less thought oh and and these different players who obviously we're dealing with the media narrative around this was over the players they thought that the players would went out and that all these teams would eventually allow kneeling\nAnd Trump kept poking at this ... you know you guys better stand shoulder because Trump understands that the end of the day a vast majority of the American people want respect to be shown flak Moore show them that love football\nPeople want respect shown for the flag Trump knew that he understood that and when he refers to Elizabeth Warren as Pocahontas he knows\nThat the left is going to jump into oh my gosh he's being a racist it why Pocahontas was a historical figure we all know from the Disney movie which was by the way not one of the better Disney movies out there uh I was ... and I'm somebody who really like the early Disney movies of that era you know Lion King I beauty and abused a great movie\nThe original or will he gets on radio but the old school Robin Hood where he's a Fox is a great it's a great cartoon of your kids haven't seen that one of my favorite cartoons cartoons used to be way better than they are now now there's\nA the cartoons are making for kids these days\nBut he knows when he called Warren Pocahontas they'll go oh he's raised the jump on this but what what a lot of us were just\nNormal people were not emotionally destabilize left is where we hear is why are they where they defending\nElizabeth Warren being called ... ... you know she's not a Native American right we'll understand this so why do they act like this is some big slide against Native Americans the boy and his use of fake she's a phony\nBoca hottest is a very well known female Native American in in our history you know there are others but Pocahontas was probably the most well known I mean you could say she's not the most historically significant I'm\nSure I'm about to get an angry email from somebody bought the\nEra coordination and how it was a matriarchal societies they were the basis for U.S Constitution\nWho there's some really interesting revision is out there about\nA native peoples in America and how technologically and politically advance their societies where or when you have not mastered the wheel or writing it is tough to claim I think that the European columnist we're taking much of\nTheir political system or you know I I you know you can call me crazy but but with the war and things are we going or Pocahontas\nAnd you'll notice that one of the themes we're hitting on him to show\nThe left deserves to be mocked what has to be ridiculed they're taken seriously they ... when they're being an serious if they are taken seriously there's no way we ever snap them out of it\nOr they need to be mocked and ridiculed and and brought down a peg when they're acting this way on these in these positions on these areas because satire is a very powerful\nTool it's very powerful a there's a reason why we still know the names of people like Samuel Clemens Mark Twain why we know the names like volt tear because of their stuff was there ...\nPowers right and in their writing that were show timeless and and really resonated with people\nAnd you you must be willing satirized people like was more than most known to point out the hypocrisy the left has here and that that she's even being considered that she's been talked about by anyone\nLow level pie TST that they had run\nBut they think the triggering now just applies to Trump himself did they think that his mere existence as president easy traumatizing Henry traumatizing experience which really degrades the whole notion of psychological trauma\nBut it's not getting your way traumatized as you if not having your politics reflected back to you constantly from the ... the United states is something that you have emotional difficulty dealing with\nIsn't it fair to say that you're not very emotionally well adjusted he's in it straight forward then to just point out that you got some grown up to do and you got some ... you got some ... as the kids would say to work through\n'em so I just wanted to know the core Ocasio Cortez who was a darling of the left now refers to leftists in her district as people who are having a psychological breakdown because of Trump\nI I'm not reaching what I point that out I'm not just basing it on their behavior and try to mock them all that's fun to hash tag owned the lives it's also the case that they recognize that this is really that left ism is now a psychological disorder in the era of Trump\nUh but that wasn't even the ... the silliest or or weirdest things you said I got to tell you I've\nAlways there are some viral Internet clips uh that that are out there that you just never forget right there's the O'Reilly you know we'll do it live and will do it live I mean you know and you can say that to somebody and they know exactly you can say those words will do it live and everybody knows exactly\nWe're talking about I mean that clip is it's timeless truly great uh\nThere's also the maps like such as the Iraq and the south Africa such as that young woman you know very beautiful young woman in radio and it and it was the Miss America pageant a thinker and his team usa pageant or whatever it was\nAnd and she uh she got a little caught up in her answer and didn't really know what the heck she was saying and I know what that's like you know sometimes I've gotten really tired and and now I'm excusing the lovely young woman's ... of course right I'm using that whatever ah but I Know I caught myself\nBut Ocasio Cortez had a moment that reminds me of that I just\nWanted to play this for you there's so much here this was on MSNBC over the weekend this is the favorite new Congress Congress woman of the progressive left and here's the kind of stuff that she offers up in terms of her analysis of what's going on with the Congress this is going to be delicious play clip on\nAnd you're also coming really as an outsider and among them watching people like her watching what happened today and want to storm the games are going to actually do that as well that's what's what's your plan [laughter] well\nI think a lot of them get rich holding our strategy around got now there's a lot of baseball and inside the beltway that turnout but\nThere are very ... organizers little Congress and I think that organizers operate differently if for some kind of strategy and what it is really about organized full\nAnd [laughter] at work organizing strip so they can learn we bring together at Cal strategy pressure on the shoulders of only focus on the pressure will find that's really interesting thought [laughter]\nJohn did you that's really interesting I Love groups have you jump through your style laughing [laughter] what are your router that was straight out of the Mario Lopez playbook that I quit because he was like thank you very much ms tendency like lead to do this like deep voice announcer man big after like such as Matt\nOcasio Cortez I mean that was\nJohn can you jump to the middle of that again just where she started talking about organizing can you do that 'cause I I don't wanna hear the whole thing again I just want to hear the\nOh okay well close enough\nYeah it's like organizing is like like so what's different about organizers is with the organizing is that they organized and like outside the box and you know close the loop on the organizing of the organizational and there's like the Congress with the organizers and they're just like so much of that\nStuff [laughter] she was I mean John I'm not being unfair right and that was one of the craziest word salads I've ever heard on television\nI think she was trying to find what you wanted to say yes that's right because she couldn't get to where to point as very astute analysis I mean she she comes out and you're thinking to yourself like okay I kinda know where she's going she's a community organizer she wants to borrow the Obama playbook of you know community organizing isn't just\nA way of doing you know agitation public education in pursuit of personal political uh goals right it's not just whipping people up into in ... style\nMob there's something more to it than that\nBut then she just gets lost and she's ... she's she's looking for the articulate soundbite that's programmed into her mind because so much a progressive ism is really\nThis learn the language of trigger warnings and like hierarchy the patriarchy and victim allergy and white privilege and checking your privilege and there's this whole other lingo\nAnd these phrases that come with it and she's looking for the ... you know she's looking to lock into that\nBut she got a little lost and then you realize like she's not really thinking about what she's saying\nYou know this is like when Al Al Sharpton do this resist we much like the resist you know you realize he's reading off the prompt or but he's not actually thinking about the words that he sang Ocasio Cortez how does the R. E. S. P. I. C. T.\nWe should keep that as a we should keep it as a drop job just to have for you know important moments like this R. E. S. P. I. C. T. that was one of my favorites uh anyway\nYeah ... record says this is the the great the great hope of progressive in this election is that she's a part of a crop of new insurgent left wing candidates who are pushing for a while I openly advocating for socialism catchy defined socialism now\nBut like she has an economics degree a country defined Marxism no\nCause she tell you much about marks or angles no\nBut she sounds right to the left and if you sound right and come from the right group right the right identity group they give you a tremendous amount of deference and that's what you see happening here uh I I Would just note that my fear\nAnd I I Know I'm On this and I'm now I'm going to be banging the warning drawing this way advanced and you're like buck come on ... great unbelievable jobs numbers everything's going so well and I agree and that's because of Trump because of the Republicans that are in charge now and it's I think it's going to keep going for a while here is what I'm telling you though\nRight now we can mock the socialist and these left is in the Democratic party because they sound foolish and we know their ideas are foolish and people are in a frame of mind where they will\nReason through it and understand you know anybody who is paying attention and knows anything you know are not limousine liberals and for people or people for whom politics is really just an emotional game and it's all about virtue signaling\nThey just want to talk about how they're you know ... Marxist in ...\nNo you're going there they made fun of Bush and said his eyes were too close together and he could use a Monica ones that have glasses and he's in ... and all this stuff they did that for years and years Bush never really hit back nobody in the UP really hit back McCain didn't really hit back Ronnie didn't really hit back\nWe actually need somebody who when ... when we see what the opposition is willing to do will will fight fire with fire these people or clowns polo seat and Booker and Feinstein and\nBlumenthal and just go to these people are jokers\nOnly it's not funny because they're really doing harm to the country and they're willing to destroy people into very dishonest things in the process you know and they're delusional\nThey deserve to be mocked they need to be ridiculed they want to step in public life not just conservatives\nThat need to sit there and take it and deal with this any more and that's this is important my friends okay [noise] ridiculing what should be ridiculed in the\nWith money matters minute is brought to you by the Armstrong advisory\nAmazon's plan to pay its workers minimum of Fifteen dollars an hour is fresh evidence of strong job market is forcing businesses to a bit of wages for lower skilled workers it's burning the benefits of a long running economic expansion to many who've been left behind wages several low skilled occupations\nWarehouse workers retail clerks and restaurant waiters are rising at a faster rate this year than the overall hourly pay according to the Labor Department data declining unemployment suggests a shortage of workers ahead which is forcing employers to pay more to this trend continues the weak rates of wage growth we have witnessed in recent years could soon be a thing in the past\nWith money management it has been brought to you by Armstrong advisory group for over Thirty years burying team in helping families with their financial strategy and the planning you call them today for no competition competition and eight hundred three nine three four zero zero one\nThat's eight hundred three three four zero zero wineries officer securities American corporate it's never been as if you see the demise reserved officer securities American advisors incorporated Armstrong advisory group of companies are not affiliated\nAnswered on dot com bust ... weeknight starting at seven on news radio five sixty WHYY end\n[noise]\nHe's holding the line for America bugs accent is that\nI almost forgot to say it everybody\nIndigenous peoples there you say\nOkay All right now now I Know this is also known as as Columbus Day right okay fine I I Know that people don't like to focus in on this too much because\nWho really cares about Columbus Day and the answer is I don't know not really me I don't even know it it's not even really a holiday like John do you feel like people to even have Columbus Day off ... off and my other job so yeah oh I'm Sorry ... I I just used it to John you're the man\nWho you're you are the rock of Gibraltar of team hot man you are always always there for us yeah you know I I think that uh it it just for me it's just\nNot a not a serious holiday you know it's not up there with the ... days so I Can't get that energized about it but there was a little bit of a new story here because Columbus ohio where lots of fun things happened I'm sure they are not celebrating Columbus Day\nSo they will not so the city is named for Christopher Columbus but they will not celebrate Columbus Day there instead celebrating indigenous people's day so I think to be consistent and John what do you think I think they should have to call it indigenous peoples town\nRight they got to rename this is like when people in Austin, Texas want to change the street names and then I go wait a second we might have to change the name of our whole\nWashington DC also has to change its name Washington D. C. would have to ... although I Will say it's a little confusing when I say I'm I live in Washington people were always like the state or you know DC\nYou know we should just call it D.C district of Columbia that shouldn't be Washington DC 'cause it gets confusing I Know that sacrilegious because our founding father blah blah but we got a state named after him and a lot of stuff named after him he's our dollar bill\nSo yeah Columbus doesn't call indigenous peoples anymore and and I like to point out mostly because it upsets the less which is fun because we're we're old and lives were only lives hard these days folks freedom we embrace this because lives need to be known for their own good at this point\nThey they need people to show them that in in politics their ideology is that new level and they need to get wrecked\nNotice I'm dropping all the lingo John\nI used to know this stuff when I when I used to be playing video games I could use all the cool kids laugh when I was about to say you sound like a game or no yeah exactly I used to I got so good at ... I got it like this special level tournaments in fever I was playing kids in\nAll the from Shanghai to Korea to Rio de Janeiro and uh I was I was pretty nasty it the fee for anyway I was like ten years ago\nSo Columbus Day people get all upset about because of the Columbus owned slaves and was a pill a jerk and to that I just point out why is it that we only judge\nAnd I know others are making this point you but I really I really do look at this because that period of in the history of the fifteenth\nSixteenth century is a particular interest to me you had a massive\nMuslim slave trade going on in the America so put that aside for a moment you had a huge slave trade and the Islamic world of white Christians I Would know they were being created a slaves all over the place a lot of them a labor to to get\nWork to death or the women were putting ... you can figure out what that was all about a that was going on millions of people over the course of a few centuries and\nSo it's not like it was just the slave trade in in Western Europe although we're always led to believe that but then you get into the Americas and you read a little bit about particularly the a Caribbean tribes\nOr in you know native tribes and the as tech and into people's as well as all the tributary groups below them and the Aztec Empire for example was a massive empire built on slavery human sacrifice and yes there was a lot of cannibalism\nThey were eating people\nAnd when they weren't eating them they were ripping they're beating hearts out of their chest because they thought that that's what they're gods wanted so I Do think that there was a little bit of a need to you know a move up the the ethical civilization scale quite a bit\nSo why don't we look on that at the same time period with any horror no we'll look on on Columbus and\nAnd apply the moral standards of today to back then well if we're going to apply the standards of today here's a point that you won't hear the left me Columbus was morally much more advanced than these civilizations he came into contact with in the new world and a dare I say in comparison to what he came across\nI'm In the nation as ranked by parents call us at triple late plan wreck that's triple late plan wreck or visit us at ... dot com that's rice dome and dot com\nBarons recognize qualitative quantitative including assets manage the size and experience of teams and the regulatory records of the advisory firms firms do not pay to be included investor returns that experience are not considered\nWhen a rising time left the hospital marina protect your boat from the winter season the hospital marina offers winner rising cleaning shrink wrapping and your choice of inside or outside storage make us your marine service you deal in the hospital marina located on an island road north Hampton or go to hospital marina dot net ... news talk Bob Bennett landed operating but the town\n[noise] radio by ...

thirty days in power or thousand you're right I mean comparing the geo Peter ... serious people don't do this\nIntelligent people don't say this without feeling deeply embarrassed at least with the left does not feel embarrassed they are licking their wounds this week I think that conservatives under the circumstances have been a quite generous in how we have responded now\nThat we finally achieved justice and yes it is justice or judge Kavanaugh to now be on the Supreme Court oh we recognize that there are other things to join our focus do we recognize that there are other ways to spend our time and attention\nI was very pleased that uh last night President Trump did take a moment to apologize for what was done to judge Kavanaugh in the White House at a ceremony like the one\nOn behalf of our nation I Want to apologize to Brett and the entire family for the terrible pain and suffering you I've been forced to endure [noise]\nThose who step forward just serve our country deserve a fair and dignified evaluation not a campaign of political and personal destruction based on lies and deception\nWhat happened to the cabinet or a family violates every notion of fairness decency and due process our country a man or woman must always be presumed innocent unless and until proven guilty\nThe presumption of innocence a has been something that's\nIs under assault here from the very beginning I mean the the presumption of innocence was going to be collateral damage was going to be a casualty of this whole process\nAnd sure enough\nIt was saved the last moment but but understand that it was a very close fought battle it could have gone the other way and Democrats would have had no problem\nIn fact they would have been gleeful had it gone the other way wouldn't have thought twice about what had been lost in this whole process despite all of that Kavanaugh is bending over backwards\nDoing everything in his power to make it quite clear that he will be a fair and there I said judicious judge\nThat he will do everything that he can to continue his legacy of decades of public service you know\nKevin all went to Yale undergrad yellow on top of his closet both he could have gone to any one of the big fancy law firms he would've made partner he'd\nBe making easily a few million dollars a year right now easily studies or been in a federal judge DC circuit court of appeals to me probably makes on every now and less than two hundred grand\nSomething like that which you could say well bug you still makes a good living yeah I get it but you know he couldn't be making millions but he didn't do that he's gone into the judiciary\nAnd understands it that's a very important role in very important service and\nThey don't want to look at his record though as a judge where he was really universally praise and understood to be top of his field that's something that's different here that's what brings together the different factions within the right\nKavanaugh was some the gold standard choice he wasn't the go all in and try and own the lips choice at the Supreme Court no no no Kavanaugh was the establishment pick Kavanaugh was the guy who was doing what he\nCould in order to at least be impartial as a judge should be whenever he hears cases and they tried to ruin him they tried to destroy his life destroys families\nDestroys reputation that there is no more room for anyone who calls himself a conservative sit around and say yeah you know what you know what the answer is to all this be nicer to the lives\nTake their arguments more seriously play more fair with them be a little softer and your tone with them that's just not serious anymore it's not a serious argument\nInto the lives finally recognize\nThat what they have been doing is no longer the way business will be done that they can no longer shame and destroy with impunity we must continue to win and we must continue to push for what we know to be good and right for the country no matter\nHow much they scream no matter how much they banged on the doors that Supreme Court or mob people in restaurants or act like a bunch of savages we have to push forward\nAnd we have to stay United and we have to win Trump understands that that said Kavanaugh's like look I'm I'm Still going to be\nNonpartisan is not about ideology for me so he's trying to do his part to say the right thing and to try and he will the country and so and so much as possible warmth liquid to\nArticle three of the constitution provides the judicial power\nShelby vested in one Supreme Court

nation [noise]\nAmerica's constitutional laws protect every person of every belief and every backgrounds every lead again the Supreme Court can be assured that I listen to their arguments with respect and an open mind\nThat is Brett Kavanaugh speaking there I mean that is what he did that is what he feels that is what he believes as evidenced by everything he's done on the court he was with the majority opinion of\nAlmost all the time other judges looking at the law agree with Kevin all almost all the time liberal judges conservative judges Kavanaugh interprets the law\nProperly now of course that will mean that he breaks with some progressive wish list items which is why they hate him so much but there is an underlying truths here and that is that the country is a better place with more\nRespect for the rules were there will be more respect the rule of law where every American\nWill have his rise more respected under the constitution because a judge Kavanaugh is on the Supreme Court now because he's justice\nCapital liberals will in fact benefit from Kavanaugh's presence on the Supreme Court they just don't realize it because they don't really want somebody calling balls and strikes when it comes to the constitution they want to ring or\nThey want somebody who will tell them yes the constitution says that thing you wanted to say even though it doesn't at least Kavanaugh will say\nI may not like this policy I may think this leads to bad outcomes in public life for a whole bunch of reasons but this is what the constitution says this is what the case law tells us and with respect to precedent and all the other\nInterpretation issues that come to mind ed I'm not going to give you the decision that I think I should based upon what I Want to give you a decision based on what is the law\nThis is where liberal separate from conservatives this is how we differ\nOn the Supreme Court on the constitution and what all this means Scalia\nSchool is a perfect example he he would say look I I don't I don't agree with\nFlag burning you know but that doesn't mean that I think that there shouldn't be flag burning under the law is I got I don't like flag burning but you you should not be made illegal you know you\nYou look at some of these decisions from very concerned conservatives will protect the rights of liberals even on issues that they feel very passionately\nAbout and that they do not because it's about principle right they they do not agree with the end policy for progressive is all about the final outcome it's all about you know did Ruth Bader Ginsburg and Kagan and sort of my yard it's entered the did did they give us the semi divine rich\nFrom these judges over the Supreme Court these unelected super legislators did they give us what we want\nAnd that's how they ... Supreme Court which is why they have such a problem with Kavanaugh uh but\nWe have entered a a very interesting period right now post Kavanaugh getting through heading into the midterms\nI don't know if the Democrat psyche can really handle that the collective psyche of the ... the Democrat Party can really handle what it means\nIPhone\nWages decisions on Charlotte's disagree with some\nI Would agree with some but that's the nature of the American constitutional system and I'm deeply disappointed with the way the Democrats handled as much as I was deeply disappointed by the way the Republicans handled\nThe Merrick Garland face I think the American outlook suffers when we make these issues partisan instead of trying to pick the best possible justices who served in the next twenty or Thirty years if the Democrats for system is foolishness of investigating\nKavanaugh and moving for his impeachment to kind of thing is it even investigation\nAmericans will not approve of that and it will be another example of the Democrats shooting themselves in the foot\nI think that there is right in part and wrong important I think he's right when he says Democrats have acted approaches we obviously but I disagree with bringing the Merrick Garland piece here\nIf you're gonna bring in America and you've got to also bring in Harry Reid eliminating the filibuster for judges\nYou got to get into well on a second Democrats decided when they had power to take it to the mat ticket to limit and then they wanted political buster game when they had a Supreme Court nominee and Republicans had a majority so Republicans responded saying well if you didn't like the block when it was on you we don't like the block when it's on us\nBut more importantly to compare what has happened to judge Kavanaugh justice capital thank you to Merrick Garland okay Marco and didn't get a vote no one tried to no one tried to destroy America Arlene's entire life\nNo one tried to ruin his reputation\nYou know there's real psychological damage that is done to people from false allegations people have been as was the case in the water ... driven to suicide by false allegations especially when it involves false allegations of rape or sexual assault\n'cause you were an untouchable in society even your own\nLoved ones you know friends and family may think differently of you if they believe that it's true I think anybody with a brain news the Capitol did not do these things certainly his own family knew he did not do these things was completely innocent of it\nBut to compare the Merrick Garland situation to cabinet or even bring them up in the same sentence I think lack\nJudgment I think that that is a poor context or for the overall discussion\nBut then he made one other point which was a good one and you know a a ... I got a call balls and strikes\nThere says that the only way that this gets fixed as if the American people hold the Democrats responsible at the polls yeah\nThat is the only the only check on the ... that the lead seeks to impose upon the country\nIs for the American people to just deal them stinging electoral defeat after ... electoral defeat and we\nThe courage to finish up to follow the march issue of Wall Street money trash worried shore losing about your money something about it\nSuited to the financial stories Saturday that nine AM with your host Richard Gere additional retires shot calm ... retires shot [noise]\nForce real region of B.
