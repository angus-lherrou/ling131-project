{"month": "10", "state": "MA", "station": "WHYN", "content": "You know they're showing up and they're screaming about fascism and from being a Nazi and they wanna they wanna hit people and they want to attack people and they want to do this little home videos of this because these are radical their political radicals\nAnd you know you could argue that the only thing that really separates him from a domestic terrorist organization is that to date anti for has put a limit on the degree of their violence where they have not engaged in to my knowledge or am I getting something lethal action against Syria but they have engaged in violent action\nAnd keep in mind that violent action if you have a very different very different political circumstances that could escalate it could escalate rather rapidly\nAnd all of a sudden a group that has issued lethality in the past when it comes with violence may maybe in a position where they feel like that is open to them and in fact that's\nThe path with it so I I Would just note that that's something that that I Want everyone to be aware of the ... has not been to this point\nA group as engaged in straight up ... it used to be that the anarchists were money a lot of in the foot\nOf the anarchists in this country we're the real terrorists I mean the did this sort of when I'm In real terrorists I mean they were the primary terror threat they were the ones who were assassinated presidents tried to blow up the stock exchange that's where I was anarchists not Islamic radicals\nThere was another incident by the way I I Know I Would get hit if I didn't bring this went up there was another incident on\nA friday in New York City actually right in the neighborhood I think where I grew up in fact when I looked at the videos I could tell even the videos didn't show you much what street I think they were on when they had this fight a there was this ... this group that the Proud Boys and I've never really understood\nTend to be\nPeople who won cultivated a certain persona with the media and to also are a little more\nShall we say willing to take a a point of view that would be well received by academia and the media on a\nWhole bunch of things I've noticed is before generals starting to get very political and generals like we love is this tremendous I have no idea I'm just saying that I'm aware of this as a phenomenon of that for example\nA lot of the stuff that came out of a general betray us I was not surprised by it all 'cause I had known for a long time that\nHe was a a a guy who was seeking out the media and very much trying for his own purposes to to\nCreate this narrative of portray us as the the greatest military might have a generation I Would I Would just point out that before\nEven are being brought low by the extra mile fair and the woman and the classified information that he didn't do it all the stuff that you already know about any of the plead guilty and pleaded guilty\nOr you know he he was credited with fixing Iraq which yes the surge work but it was really are a hundred and fifty thousand troops and people that were on the front lines that fixed Iraq but his strategy was successful there but there were some very important ingredients that were in place for that strategy to work\nI Would note that strategy that he tried in Afghanistan did not work was not working\nWas never going to work and he was not really willing to hear about how that was the case\nSo while I I think on the one hand you know he gets all of this credit for Iraq well if he gets all his credit for Iraq we also have to look and see the situation Afghanistan I understand that he's not a betrayal was not this uh men beyond reproach when I came to his ... certainly not beyond the road period but also when it came to this rather\nSo that's much more of saying I Need to do a little more\nI Need a little more analysis of what's going on here with or without ... that caught me off guard because I've heard so much positive stuff about matters for so long and maybe he just rub the present the wrong way recently and he just wanted to call him a Democrat\nI also this kind of funny that the president uses calling somebody a Democrat is kind of a a little sly or a\n... a little bit of ... you know as ed guys kind of a Democrat you know it's like when I say my uh my media life my guys okay it's kind of a communist so Trump's as a kind of a Democrat he also said that you know that Trump said that he does not trust everybody in the White House and this is this falls into that\nCategory of oh my gosh the palace intrigue here you know we we we need to we need to make sure that we run all these stories about Trump can't trust the people around him and there's all this stuff about how Trump is you know unable to manage and he's bringing in all these people that don't have\nThe right requirements and backgrounds and skills and everything else they love these White House dysfunction stories and anything that plays into that we tend to hear a lot about\nA so then I take a step back and I say hold on a minute given what we know about all the different leagues and all the people that are in the White House including Republicans who\nHoldovers from the Bush I shouldn't say from the Bush administration but from the Bush era of the Republican Party people that are not on board with Trump but all we know that there's somebody right now who roads if you if you believe in New York Times and I don't take that for granted\nBut if you believe in New York Times there is a senior White house administration official right now\nWho wrote an op ed effectively saying that we're working against the commander in chief behind the scenes to for his decision making to act like he's not really the president and to go to these\nIf you go to these extreme lengths because we know what's best for the country we will undermine the express will the American people through their elections because we know better\nAnd that's really the position that's really what they're that that's really what they're they're saying about that and this guy I wrote this editorial we never found by the way the non editorial as we never found out of this guy was the anonymous\nEditorial writer but then of course Trump of course Trump shouldn't trust everybody as White House of course it would be silly to do that\nThat's also why I I give him more leeway than I Would or the other circumstances and maybe you can say that's a little bit of you know self justifying here are that's convenient not self justifying ah but I understand why he wants to have family members around because he feels like at least he can trust them\nAnd if your Trump and you've seen what's going on with a lot of not just the opposition\nYou know make these changes but I felt that it kind of like a personal responsibility manifesto for twenty Eighteen\nWhoa whoa whoa what happened when you started actually taken back responsibility away from the machines\n[noise] so what I did was I started small you know everybody said\nOh you know how you gonna do that I started small and I turned off the

know what when I go to my bedroom\nI usually go in about an hour before bed I hang out and now I watch either you know old\nFriends episodes or I I read a book or I just kinda chill out that was a time I didn't want to be staring at the phone and what research shows actually that's really interesting is that even if you are not on the phone if the phone is by you even if it off and there's no notifications coming through nothing you are\nPerturbed you are distracted because you are compelled to want to touch that phone to want to look at that that by so I just remove it from my face I also did something really simple and I was with friends I said you know what I'm going to try something for these three hours I'm just going to put the phone in my bag and I'm not going to worry about it

Will have confirmation of it but as of right now it sounds like they are planning to say that this was a rogue element within the Saudi Government that's the latest reporting here\nOn the plan is for the Saudi Government to throw some intelligence official under the bus I've also seen early reports that it may be a maybe the Saudi government's position that an intelligence official decided to interrogate and it went over the line\nUm but the Saudis can't hide anymore that this guy was killed was killed in their\nCustody they're calling it quote an interrogation that went wrong that that's the latest on that so it doesn't really seem like a there's any room for the Saudis to keep the assembling all this that they're they're caught the Saudis are in a jam here I'm as they should be the

the left was not just they didn't just turn a blind eye to eye they aggressively aggressively and with all they could muster with all the help they could get in the media and you know people like

revolutionary leftist movements in this country and right now it's the me too movement it will change they will move to some other intellectual fat or fashion in some time just just wait for it\nBut

does not really matter to them that they will rush well ahead of the fact that doesn't matter that they may be creating a kind of pressure around the decision making of the commander in chief intended to get him to mess up\nThere looking for reasons to criticize him and undermine them there is nothing I can tell you this right now if Trump sat down\nWith the editorial board of the New York times in the Washington Post sat down with all the the big name overpaid pompous hosted CNN and MSNBC and say okay every walk what do you think I should do about Saudi Arabia if you went and did that thing or those things\nI assure you\nI promise you\nWithin forty eight hours they would be saying oh my gosh look what Trump has done again look at how he has made a made a mess of things they have no interest

stand up to ... former KGB agents and not man enough to stand up the Saudis shake\nI mean that's what we have in a president whatever they have on hand that are worth ... they could have had looks like a fun playing it is just money I guess so I mean is this what Donald Trump promised table or he was ...

for another time\nAnd Joe ... when I say whose team is he on I Know the answer he's on Joe's team it's oh it's all about Joe it's all about Scarborough himself\nHe doesn't represent any ideology doesn't represent any set of principles he doesn't even represent being a journalist use just they're just spout off and make sure he's Harris whooped up as high as possible you know come down with the swamp and the rock band Joe it's a little weird\nAnd you can tell they're trying to make this personal they're trying to they're trying to personally go the president of the United states on this issue\nWhat is she really going to do folks what what message is she going to send the Saudis on this one that would show that would show dramatically changed their minds that would\nAll of a sudden mean they would never do this again or they would think twice about doing is going what are we really going to do\nIt's just not a U.S citizen this was not doing on us soil the Saudis let's write this down to what it is the Saudis kill the guy on the soil of another country in a consulate is it disgusting and barbaric yes do the Saudis do discussing ... all the time absolutely\nThat is nothing new why is this problem I keep hearing about what what what is Trump going to do what is going to do what could he do and why is it on him\nShouldn't as we don't we have a United Nations for exactly this purpose don't we have this international\nCommunity that I hear so much about all the time so there can be multilateral and concerted action you show up but they won't do anything yeah exactly\nThey won't do anything we're all day but when they\nWhen they don't like what the US is doing it's oh why don't you wait for the international community it's better if it comes from from all nations United

media is engaged in right now to make this the biggest story of the country and just skip over what's going on with us troops for example in Afghanistan of place we're still at which we are still in war\nUm we don't hear about it do it you don't hear about the fact that we're in the process of slowly losing that or\nThey don't want it they they don't talk about that anymore or they want to focus on this issue and I would say it's not just because they do feel journalist ... special affinity for other journalists are this hits home for them\nIt's not so much during the Obama years when Obama was pulling the phone records of journalist and listing on deal Jay charging sheets on indicted co conspirators as you know journalists would you and that was Obama oh that's right you know tough guy tapper which I you know ... ... do\nYou think that that you are really the best this administration the best messenger on that issue\nYeah that's a new talk talk talk talk to the Obama administration which used the Espionage Act more than every other business ration combined not a lot of talk about how they're destroying the first amendment though right now not much of that you hear that about Trump all the time because he tweets\nBecause he tweets this\nUh this journalist Chris Yogi what happened to them we still don't really know\nAnd we should not lose sight of that we don't know what happened to the show we have not been told what the facts or of this case they're still trying to figure it out but everyone wants Trump to take action they they want to push the president I'd states litter the free world\nTo do something that could upset the balance of power in the middle East that could have long term ramifications and they don't care about any of that\nWhat they really just want is the opportunity to criticize the president for inaction and then dump all over him for whatever action he takes\nThese people are disgusting or describes\nNone other than she's national security propagandist for the Obama administration Ben Rhodes take this to the next level and you know it's once again it's always about Trump it's all Trump's fault somehow everything that the left doesn't like is Trump's fall play sixteen\nAnd met with President Trump is setting is that there is no consequences and where you have to realize is there's nobody else who can play the role the United states the whole people like this to a cat\nAnd we are the world's oldest and most significant democracy and we're not we're not saying after this there's not somebody else is going to do that and the consequences of that are journalist everywhere are less safe and and let's face it we have a president and fitness and they're also the state so ah values like freedom of speech and defense\nSuddenly are very endangered around the world\nThat's the trend line that I think it's getting much worse\nThat is a giant pile of crap a giant pile of crap from Obama's chief national\nSecurity propagandist a guy who laughed about creating an echo chamber of idiot almost entirely Democrat journalist during the Obama years to sell the Iran deal lasted they're ignorance in their stupidity at least on that\nHe was right they do have a lot of idiot journalists at these media outlets especially the young ones\nWere right out of college who have just bought into this left
