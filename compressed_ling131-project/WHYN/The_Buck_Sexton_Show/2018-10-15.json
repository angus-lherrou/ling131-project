the words are coming I could be one more to the other I'm not sure which I'm going to go with it keeps happening today\nBut she released the information from her her test today right uh she has decided to let the world know that her long scrutinized and many would say the bong Native American heritage\nIs now back in the headlines because the analysis reported on by the Boston Globe where the vast majority of warns family tree is European says that she has a dean of American ancestry code in the range of six to ten general [laughter]\nSix to ten generations ago so this is a really a non scientific\nBackground ed and heritage analysis of of Elizabeth Warren but six to ten generations ago that would mean she is getting ready for it between one sixty fourth and one one thousand and twenty four Native American\nAnd the Boston Globe initially did the math wrong on that one uh so I'm I'm here to to to fact check the Boston Globe's math among among many other things that we have to look at here\nAnd this was this was a truly\nJaw dropping moment today this this whole phenomenon because this was not some analysis that was released against Elizabeth Warren will this wasn't a some surprise that a a competing campaign or somebody else a decided to drop\nAnd make it difficult for her to get elected\nTo the contrary Elizabeth Warren took the position that this would bolster her claim\nI don't know which is worse here\nOr that Elizabeth Warren is show delusional she thinks that this proves her case or so tone deaf as it as to think that this will stop continued mockery of her for racial fraud\nI mean the hill where I work in response to this ... wrote that Elizabeth Warren DNA test shows quote strong evidence of Native American ancestry but the real headline here if I may finally be civil\nIs it there's strong evidence that she may have had a Native American ancestor a couple of hundred years ago and since then it has\nBeen one long on on on interrupted line of white people\nIn fact if you look at the percentage that Elizabeth Warren is likely Native American compared to the general white American population she is less than average\nIn her connection to the Native American population meaning you and me listening is if you happen to be white and an American and a lot or not but if you have any weight an American is likely you are more Native American that Elizabeth Warren\nAnd yet here we are\nHere we are she she must have thought that this was going to give her some degree of of credibility I I don't know what she's saying I mean ten generations ago\nThere's no realistically there's no way to know if even the ten generations ago if this is accurate and then when you when you look at the Boston Globe analysis\nAnd you start to read some of this you realize that this is all it's all kinda hazy and nonsense anyway quote the this is from the Boston Globe ... the analysis of warns DNA done by Carlos Bustamante who's a professor at Stanford\nOr really he tracks DNA Analysis bee population migration\nHe quote concluded that the vast majority of warrants ancestry is European but the result strongest support the existence of an on ad mixed Native American ancestor\nA six to ten generations ago\nA of\nFish folks if Elizabeth Warren what this tells any normal rational person\nIs that if Elizabeth Warren is in fact able to call herself Native American literally any white person in the country could credibly claim to be Native American\nFor professional purposes for the purposes of advancing oneself and therefore it would no longer even matter if you call yourself\n[noise] Native American it would no longer make any difference if you consider yourself to be in America's everybody's every but we're all Native American by the standard is just\nCompletely nuts\nIt's just completely nuts and the fact that Trump was able to get so in her head by calling or Pocahontas as we know he does time and time again the fact that Trump has managed to to force this incredible\nUh on for stare on on her part is just astonishing really is this is somebody that is getting in the top four or five of early support from the Democrats\nFor running for president and most of the polls that I've seen in fact those big CNN pull out where I think she came in for third or fourth place um and and when you look at this analysis when you look at what's going on here uh eat ease\nAmazing to me that that anybody could read this and this is what's so crazy folks people in the media took this as evidence that she was right [laughter]\nI mean she's she's like one one thousand Native American maybe and it's not even really Native American it's based on population migration from South of the border into the United states\nSo she doesn't even ... it's not even clear that that this one one thousand or one sixty fourth or whatever it is is truly from a Native American tribes\nAnd yet people in the media were saying sushi proved that Trump is wrong Trump needs to pay up\nNow what what\nAre they had desperate I think there's a little panic right now on the left because they realize oh my gosh Elizabeth Warren has completely clown herself here I mean it just made a complete mess of things and\nSo there that the media has to go even further and they have to somehow pretend like\nYeah that's right you prove things that's crazy she didn't prove anything and everyone knows it but what what else are they going to do I mean this\nIs a this is telling us that that that pigs are flying folks I mean this is complete detachment from reality by the lips\nIs bonkers\nAnd on this notion even that that she has any Native American ancestry\nLet me just give you this is from this post ah this analysis in the Boston Globe quote detecting DNA for Native Americans is particularly tricky because there was an absence of Native American DNA available for comparison this is in part because Native American leaders have asked tribal members not to participate in genetic databases\nTo make up for the ... a dearth of Native American DNA bustamante guy during this analysis use samples from Mexico Peru and Colombia to stand in for Native American\nThat's because scientists believe that the groups Americans referred to as Native Americans came to this land via the bearing straight about twelve thousand years ago and sold them what's now America but also Margaret further south\nHis report explaining to use a reference populations genetic material has been sequenced for was designed for ... accuracy or so\nFolks he's using South American DNA on this theory that oh well because they all across the Bering Strait I mean this is crazy this is crazy he's not even\nUsing Native American DNA to look for DNA that crosses over with\nWith Elizabeth Warren's background out I I uh there's more here there's more there's more in the in the why it matters and you're hearing all these pathetic justifications about uh lives with warns back I'm like oh well you\nKnow she didn't use this to advance herself poll only come on that's sitting bowl that's what you can call that a bowl blank coast to coast

chow inside your name Elizabeth Warren Cherokee\n[laughter] that's right folks and that would be president of United States the Democrats submitted recipes to powwow chow and claim to be a Cherokee\nOh my gosh six word used offensive racially charged language the defender claims of Native American heritage declaring that her family had quote high cheekbones like quote all the Indians do\nSeven word has now claimed that she may have one one hundred one thousand and twenty fourth Indian DNA this is equally problematic since DNA science proves the average white American has point one point up point one eight percent Indian DNA far more than warrants\nOh my gosh I don't know skip whether you're going to nine weren't DNA did not report did not measure actual Native American DNA and ten it is very difficult to argue the war did not commit racial fraud or that that was all courtesy of Ben Johnson but my favorite is the\nPower wow ouch [laughter] to our show oh man\nAnd and I see from my friend David French over National Review that she uh from what we were apparently from from what I see you're from David she plagiarize that recipe from a French chef\nSo that's right folks white as white can be Elizabeth Warren pretended to be Native American just submitted a recipe to a Native American cookbook at the Cherokee and she stole that recipe from a French chef\nOh my gosh you can't make this stuff up you really can't it it's just it's hard to hard to come up with a way that this whole story can gets\nCrazier it it really is it's hard to come up with the way that this could be even even more absurd and more bizarre\nI'm ... sure enough the lips if they can find a way they will if there's anything that they can point to hear that will distract or you know she says six to ten generations ago\nShe has a Native American ancestor she'd doubled down on this I mean she thinks this is vindication\nI Know you could say book how does this how does this really matter

create some kind of a\nLittle propaganda film for herself where she would have different members of her family and they're different people all involved in this and I feel I feel like there should be some degree of\nOf embarrassment here or there should be some oh my gosh what am I doing but then again when you when you look at what's really happening on ... across the board right now with with the media and with the effort to take down Trump\nAnything is acceptable as long as it is for the cause I mean anything is going to be considered okay here as long as it is a evidence or useful in the anti Trump cause I just\nI I've reached a kind of a new a new level here and a new degree of understanding of just where the media is taking all this stuff and and what they're willing to do and what they're only to put the American people through a in terms of propaganda and and the whys and\nThere's no way that a normal person could have read that Boston Globe report today\nAnd come away from it with anything other than wow that is a massive mistake that Warren has made here and she's clearly not Native American she never should have claimed to be Native American there's nothing about her\nThat justifies this notion of Being American and yet you know all I see right now on the on the front page of CNN here's a perfect example\nI see nothing in their main headlines all about the Saudi guy got which we'll talk more about your market show you later but nothing about that you go down one two three four five six seven eight eight stories down the CNN front page right now and you get quote warns\nDNA never mattered Trump\nOr how how is this Trump's fault\nIn one world is the is the takeaway here that Trump isn't a you know accepting her DNA results or something\nThese people are insane they really are I ... it's just impossible for them to be a embarrassed here's another another version Huffington Post\nTrump denies this is their top story about this Trump denies making charity pledged tied to Elizabeth Warren DNA test Trump shed and was it was very specific Trump said that if she makes it through\nThe primaries and is the Democrat and now the knee and then and then she proves that she as Native American heritage in that case will get a million dollars to repair a charity so that's what he said okay he denies what they're saying he said which is he would just give her a million dollars if you Bruce Native American\nAnd not even is not the point because\nIf she Native American everybody's Native American and anyone\nWho's trying to be honest anybody who's looking at this from the perspective of I Would like to really present the facts and and get to the truth year would automatically understand\nI vicious just pathetic eat is\nAbsolute nonsense that I'm seeing here from all these different all these different sources the way that they're covering this I mean they're they're trying so hard to actually cover is the right word because they're really covering forward\nAnd this is because what they think happened today is uh that would they thing happened today is that she's no longer really going to be a serious contender for twenty twenty this is laughable she's a clown she's a joke\nShe was a joke if you should be at least\nHere's ABC News which is supposed to be unbiased Elizabeth Warren releases DNA results on Native American ancestry a Trump says quote who cares that's their headline\nThat the headline to see this is a perfect case of media bias at work they think that they're progressive great hope for twenty twenty is in jeopardy right now because of her own just bone headed stupidity I mean this is just on cinco de dum and think of legal\n\nAntifa are you guys are ... they used to be a big thing I used to get a lot of media attention at least conservative media would sometimes talk about them but left doesn't seem to want to talk about them that was some audio that we play for you of the the latest and the incidence\nOut on the uh I don't do it as well as Trump Trump's anti ... better than mine do for a but I don't do it as well as he does\nOut on the west coast in Portland\nWhich strikes me as a strange place for that it'd be quite so much\nPolitical extremism but but that's I suppose it is what it is right that is going on there um but and you got these people with with cheaper group that were squaring off against some I think it's called the group for patriots in prayer or something I I forget exactly even what the what the group was called um let me do a quick\nRefresher on that one but you know you sure enough you had you had this uh this violent incident where your protesters and counter protesters your ego bears spray and bloody brawls at patriot yet patriot prayer law and order march\nPortland you have to be very careful my friends when you see the way that these kinds of stories are covered you have to pay really really close attention because there's a lot of\nA political hedging that goes on there's a lot of usage of kind of weasel words and what they leave in what they take out these descriptions for example\nJust because the ACLU and by the way I Know nothing about this patriot prayer group I Can't keep up with all the other group it's called patriot prayer and has a lot of American flags sounds cool to me but I don't know that could be wackos I have no idea there too many of these little you know local political groups for me to know every single one of them\nBut I just would I Would caution you all at the ACLU is not a reliable source at all\nOr I'm Sorry ... Southern Poverty law that the truth of the ACLU as well so yes you keep that get that at the Southern Poverty Law Center is not a reliable source when it comes to deciding who is a a a political extremist or a right wing extremist a white nationalist\nAny any of those things you cannot trust the Southern Poverty Law Center it has become a massive\nFundraising organization and a left wing really a left wing hate group and a lot of cases\nIn any group that has to pay a ... multi million dollar settlement too much it was a for being an anti Muslim extremist when he's a Muslim is a group that you probably want to check with a grain of salt whenever it comes to these uh these different demonstrations and and how they're reporting on who's there and what's going on so that that's one part of it\nBut then there's the other which is just this idea that it is a normal thing to want to show up and do these counter protests and they call them counter protests but when people show up to a demonstration right\nThey're all wearing black and they have gas masks and shields and and and homemade weapons they're not showing up because they want to engage in a battle of ideas they want to engage in a battle they want to fight people\nAnd the fact that they showed up with they're spraying these other things tells you all that you need to know of but I just think it's so interesting which media outlets will and will not covers this makes for really compelling footage\nThis is a story that you'd think they'd want to tell you how are almost entirely white by the way antifa radicals who are attacking this this patriot prayer group over there they're called the law and order group rather they weren't a march for law and order\nI I've got an I've got to wonder is is that just day is that a euphemism are they actually white nationals I I mean I have no idea and I know that I Can't trust\n'em I I Can't trust the media to produce honest assessments of this and tell us what really happened for example do just that they accept that there are counterprotesters and that you know the kind of procedures just showed up and like they didn't want any problems man but you know there were problems\nWell maybe it's because they showed up and the whole purpose of their presence was to ignite some kind of a confrontation right\nGet any game in ...", "year": "2018", "show_name": "The Buck Sexton Show", "city": "Springfield", "day": "15"}
