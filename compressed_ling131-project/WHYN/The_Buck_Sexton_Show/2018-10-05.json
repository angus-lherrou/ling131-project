the next to meetings going to be with\nDonald Trump and Kim Jong on and this part of the world is kind of important and meanwhile were arguing over high school yearbooks and ... and moving and God Knows what else\nAnd I think it's time we paid a little more attention to it so I reached out to a guy who I think is just one of the best in terms of understanding the region his name is Gordon Chang he's an author a columnist you see 'em on TV all the time he gets it a Gordon Chang thank you for taking time to talk to us today how are you\nI'm fine thank you and thank you so much for this opportunity\nWell I this is kind of an important part of the world you know more than twenty percent of the world's population a resides in a real small region and they have incredible economic impact not just in their area\nBut on us and I'm I'm a little tense or not so much about North Korea anymore although I think where we should be keeping an eye on them but I think China is starting to get to\nBe a a little bolder why why suddenly now are they coming within forty five yards of our\nNaval ships and trying to affect our elections\nWell that's a great question Mike and I think the Chinese have been doing this for quite some time we don't know about a lot of these incidents are we don't know the seriousness seriousness of the incidents\nBecause the navy for quite some time has actually been trying to downplay these um encounters [laughter] the the Chinese have been acting recklessly and I think that they have sense that we're a little bit afraid of them so they become bolder and bolder\nThe one good thing about the incident that occurred over the weekend is that the navy released a photographs of this immediately and that's important because it says to Beijing back off\nYou know under the current administration we're now see both sides of the aisles think that the United states needs to be more resolute needs to be tougher nice to have a different view of China and that's a good thing and so the administration's working pretty hard to change and we heard a lot of that\nIn vice president Pence's speech today\nWell if you haven't listened to people you can find it it's on line and you can do something ... going to C SPAN and watching\nWhich I recommend 'cause I think vice president Pence has the potential to be a secret weapon for Donald Trump while the media is watching President Trump kind of freelance and some of these situations\nUh my pants appears to be very methodical and pragmatic in not only his language but his actions and I I think he is a a real secret weapon for this administration and that that speech to me was welcome now Gordon Chang if we're looking at China\nAnd like you said the bold steps that they made the bold moves they made this weekend and the things we've seen lately with them a kind of trying to sway public opinion in areas affected by the terrorists\nIs this a reaction or possibly reaction because their economies taken a hit based on the tariffs that Donald Trump has imposed\nWell certainly the Chinese economy right now is fragile um Beijing is pouring a lot of money into the or the money supply in order to keep things going and and I think that the Chinese understand that long term they can't win a struggle with the United states\nExperienced the merchant capital source difference and get cash for your

Sexton show tests due to my friend\nHey good to talk to ya\nWhat's ... what's your thoughts on the Korea and Russia situation\nWell I think myself I think the reason why North Korea is probably the stall on out and some of the other issues that we've had going on is because they're all waiting to see after these midterms\nIf drunks gonna get impeached or add more problems because if that happens then they're in the clear they're there they will find we will find anyone else to put up there that can deal with like Donald Trump does\nAnd that's what they are open for that are ... are you getting her feet and we're waiting to see what happens in our media plays into that too because they keep her vote and all that\nThought gym but I Do think diplomacy on this level takes time I also believe as I told some of my more liberal friends who are crossing at the mouth going we're going to get the house\nAnd they were going to we might get the Senate and we're going to impeach Donald Trump and then we're going to get them out and I say you realize that means president pen will be a reality and if you think President Trump has been tough on liberals\nAnd on on people who are sticking it to America way to use the word President Pence would do and they were going to get him to who we got a plan for him to so I'm not sure about that I just\nI think diplomacy on this level takes time we saw progress in the Russia situation today with seven more Russian soldiers being indicted now they're never going to extradite him here\nBut Donald Trump's been tougher on Russia than Brock Obama ever dreamed he could be tough on Russia so I I think it's about time and it's about Trump being blustery in his speaking and then the the uh the pragmatic approach has to go through all the steps\nThe diplomacy to keep an eye on that gym but thank him for checking in let's ah stay in Pennsylvania and ah see what's on Felix his mind Felix welcome to the buck sex than shows her\nHey

he made that Fahrenheit\nNine eleven movie years ago and then he thought wow Donald Trump's election was on ah eleven nine I could do Fahrenheit eleven nine to go after Donald Trump and his movie has been a miserable failure so Michael Moore\nWho believes he's one of the guys who predicted Donald Trump will get elected Michael Moore came out yesterday after the test\nAnd he posted this on Twitter quote it was just to test but make no mistake about it this is the world in which we now live close quote and then he goes on to tell us\nThat's the final line in Fahrenheit eleven nine and he has to tell us that because nobody's gone and seen the movie the movie as Bert virtually\nA losing money it it was a stink or from the first weekend it was released probably the worst failure he's had but he said that was the last line in my movie Fahrenheit eleven nine\nA few minutes ago Trump gave us a preview of the state of emergency he is creating to justify the end of democracy is we know it raises is ... and I'm just wondering what Michael Moore\nWould he be unhappy if there was an attack and nobody got him a message or would he be screaming going\nNobody tells me nobody tell me this is going

Kavanaugh tomorrow Republican Senator Susan Collins and Jeff Flake along with Democrat Joe Manchin today announcing they will vote yes\nAnd delivered it with style and as I said with per faction the construction of the sentence is something that should be taught in government classes and law classes how to give a winning argument\nIt just was ethic but\nWhat made it even more important when you watched it on TV and I'm sure we're going to hear the numbers are massive\nThere were two women prominently featured behind Susan Collins\nNow so often we hear that the er and public and party is a party of a bunch of old white guys\nWere you at three women featured you couldn't see I'm\nJoni Ernst shoes off to the side but she was up there too but you had Susan Collins front and center in a very professional look I think she got a new hair cut too I'm sure she did you know oh it's all about image it's all about optics\nSusan Susan Collins up there on one side Shelley Moore Capito of West Virginia Republican senator\nTo the other side Cindy Hyde Smith a senator from Mississippi right behind her so now you have this moment where we as conservatives have had the tar beaten out of us for the last three weeks\nBeing accused of being just the worst people in the world the party that does not understand women\nAnd you have a woman\nDelivering the knockout punch a woman who is known to be pro choice\nSo now you have someone that other women especially boy that was ... that argument that judge Kavanaugh is going to a destroy roe v Wade you have a pro choice women standing in front of the world talking about how Kavanaugh can't do it\nThat in fact that the the people that\nThe um the Democrats who are worried about tearing apart ruby ... years ago not only did they not do it they wrote the argument against overturning roe v way\nSo you have brilliantly staged brilliantly written delivered for an audience that would then turn it into prime time\nResponse so after all of the

twenty twenty presidents he hopes for\nAh for Cory Booker or should we call them sugar as I\nTalked to guys last night I found the or your books from some of the angry Democrats on the Judiciary Committee started going through their senior year books to say gee what was in your year book\nCory Booker had his nickname sugar\nAnd I don't know about you but I Lived in the New York New Jersey metro area where Cory Booker lived and went\nTo school in those years in the late eighties and a book or we called a cocaine was referred to as sugar so why were you sugar senator is there something you need to tell us and also the guy who says\nAnd he had um groped a young woman at the age of Fifteen in the article he wrote called a stealing second or something like that a book or a also had his senior quote was let's go\nAll the way so\nCory Booker has some ... to do but he may be got arrested today it's not really an arrest as we saw with Amy Schumer yesterday it's kind of like being ... off to get your picture taken and then somebody pays fifty bucks you get a ticket and you go home or you go back to the protests\nBut there's so much to get to today so much I'm just so happy about this and we will dig into it but I Want to remember\nWatch barked all of this and it was Donald Trump nominating Mr Kavanaugh judge Kavanaugh\nAnd on the day when that happened Chris Matthews the elder statesmen and MSNBC you have to wonder how much longer he's going to continue in his role a Chris Matthews was on the air talking about revenge\nAnd I tell you all of this all of this anger towards anything Donald Trump does towards any nominee he brings forward all of this resistance an obstruction which started the day after Trump was elected\nIt's a dangerous thing for the Democrats\nIt's when you go out and develop all of your missions in life based on revenge they tell you to dig two graves\nBecause you're going to be joining whoever you think you're going to take down remember this from June twenty eighth this year Chris Matthews on MSNBC following the announcement of the Supreme Court pick from President Trump\nFish has time for vengeance for what happened two years ago and if they don't read the vengeance now with four and a half weeks for now wants to go before the election they will not look very strong to their base and I think there'll be under attack\nYeah yeah that was a good plan wasn't it wasn't that Chris Matthews\nIf you don't if you don't go after vengeance and he's talking about Merrick Garland he was talking about Hillary's last uh I'll I'll tell you to talk about backfiring\nBecause the way the shrill arguments came out without facts which was a hundred and eighty degrees from what Susan Collins delivered today they sounded like a bunch of sheep all\nEspecially when you hear the chanting the chanting the nonstop shrill chanting it just great and great in grades\nNow I I'd like to say this is a a\nA good sign for the midterms but a month in political terms is an eternity\nIt's an absolute eternity so I have sort of a plan that I think the GOP should lay out in advance of the midterms that will keep the interest of those of us who are conservatives who wants to try and save the house although it's a really tough\nTough event to try and pull off\nTo save the house when the president or out of the other part when
