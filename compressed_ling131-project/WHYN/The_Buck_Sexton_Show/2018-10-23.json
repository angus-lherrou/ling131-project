{"month": "10", "state": "MA", "station": "WHYN", "content": "There's a Senate race that I don't think nearly enough a judge\nAnd you got the veto obsessed media talking all about how he's going to be Ted Cruz when no that's just laughable but there's another race that maybe deserves a second look here at least for what it tells us about the Democratic party if not what it tells us about the\nPossibility of this race going for the Republicans ... joins us now to talk about what's going on in New Jersey she's a peace up on the wall Street Journal where she is on the editorial board smiling at corruption Democrats tried to save Bob and then does months after his bipartisan as admonished Mitch\nA Kim great to have you back\nAnd it's great to be here All right what's going on in in the Garden State which I always feel a certain love hate relationship for the New Yorker what's going on up there\n[noise] yeah well and you said you know what's notable here is that well the entire media has felt obsessing over Texas where those numbers look at a Ted Cruz's is definitely pulling away from it all worked\nAs a racist even within a smaller margin of error and in New Jersey where the Democrat Bob Menendez wet you mentioned um he was censored by his colleague rather launched by his colleagues back earlier this year\nI'm after he had been found to live accepted also get from a man who was convicted felon who ran one of the biggest Medicare fraud on the government an all time I'm not only was he setting a lot of gifts from this guy and not acknowledging that under Senate Ethics rules\nBut he was working on behalf of this guy to help them with his business interests in Washington including done so far as to lobby the health and Human Services secretary on his bat so um he he was actually indicted for this uh the the FBI ultimately I'm Sorry that department of justice ultimately dropped the charges after the Supreme Court\nThat change the standard um on what it would take to convict him but he was honest and he's now facing a very tough race against Bob Cuban Republican businessman who's been highlighting this and it it's really driving up on paper\nHow'd you say there is a a deafening silence Kim from so many of the au Jared Kushner most times some shady relationship with Saudi Arabia I hear this people are media all the time and I say okay well what is it ... and then there's this has nothing there's all these whispers of corruption around Trump\nMeanwhile Menendez who whether people want to just parse out the legality of what he did or not what he did was gross and the guy he was associated with even grosser and they're just hoping that Bush has got to go on for the Democrats\nYeah many Democrats are actually out there running a campaign focused on so called Republican corruption Nancy Pelosi this summer actually handed out to her members a toolkit\nA talking point about how they supposedly go after Republican corruption Trump and and all sorts of other issues none of which as you said\nThere is any real evidence for but in the meantime they just close their eyes of that in some cases\nActually or outright helping them look the Democrat that's why it's called the called smiling at corruption\nAt the biggest superPAC out their majorities superPAC helping Senate Democrats just decided to reroute three million dollars to help Bob Menendez in his race on money that they're taking away from even more important races for them or where they're trying to defend seats\nOn them places where Trump won\nA because in so much trouble but in essence this is the Democratic party say hey you know what we're OK with corruption how yet there's all trail of evidence that very clear in fact the Senate is on record saying that he engaged in corruption but we're still going to do everything we can to return to office\nAnd I have to say that there are two areas where I see a tremendous uh boxing loving to one of them is on this uh as as on the notion of corruption which as you pointed out is is a talking point against the Republicans would you have so many Democrats you start to think about all the Democrats that have gone to prison and just been the last oh four or five years for\nIncredibly I'll be is a very shady corruption and that never gets brought up in in any of this discussion as I said there's always this vague oh Trump most you know someone starts telling you about the ... that tends to be what I hear about a but also on on the notion of moms I I have to say I am\nI have been surprised and I take it very dim view of much of the\nOf the journalists class which I Know technically you definitely are a journalist on something else but I'm pretty close to journal land but most journalists I think act in a way that is really surprising to me but on the mobs Kim\nI'm seeing a lot of people would say you know they have no other they have no other way to make their case and these are people that write for the Washington Post\nIt's it's crazy look it's absolutely unacceptable okay the whole reason we have civil society we have to face it so that we don't have mob rule\nJust because you're ... election just because your person didn't get in office or just because you lost your Supreme Court nomination there is absolutely nothing written in any of the formal or informal rules that our society that give you the right\nTo shape Mitch McConnell or Ted Cruz added ... hound them at a restaurant\nUm this is the fact precisely why we have a ballot box and elections and anybody who's out there whether it's on CNN I've seen a couple on there are any way saying well eight not ma and be they're just saying what they think we all know that's not\nTrue I'm saying what you think is when you write an op ed or a letter to a newspaper um or you go to vote\nOr that you know harassing people on the street and not and if that's the best it got than conservatives should actually feel pretty good that they're winning on the policy marriage\nNow I Know that it's it's really tight and soda to ask you to make her production and who really knows but just in a minute or so we have less you're Kim how to eat where what's the main dynamic you see right now in the house race that's going to determine whether it ends up being the Republican the Democrats win the day\nBut I think the most important thing which won't hearing like mainstream yet\nIs how different it is today than it was just three weeks ago okay we can already saying with complete definite proof that the Democrats blown it to a certain extent or they were talking about a wave three weeks ago they messed up with Kavanaugh it's not going to be a way I think it's going to come down to five feet one way or the other right\nOn whoever does win and aren't going to have a huge majority but I think Republicans are still and\nAll right give us Ross everybody on the wall Street Journal check out her columns and also her book the intimidation game ... owns ... you make the time forest come back soon\n... back\nYeah I I think he was smart on there with the it's gonna be five seats it's going to be such a narrow margin I I don't think that we're going to know we're certainly not going to know who controls the house by the time I'm although you should listen for all of the show election I obviously but we're not going to know who controls the house I think uh by\nThe time this show is is over um I think it's going to spread well I guess the polls\nClosed around ... there's no way we would know okay yeah this is not even close but we might not even know till I don't know maybe the next morning it's going to just going to be drawn out\nAnd it's going to be very very tight which goes to tell you you know they've been telling us the Trump is a fascist and destroying America\nAnd now they're praying and hoping that they can not have a blue wave but a little blue reports a little bit [noise]\nIt's crazy right now you got the left freaking out chasing people at a restaurant screaming at little old ladies and anybody that shows up at a Trump rally ...\nYou've got all kinds of nonsense going on about ...\nPost Kavanaugh rage from all the different progressive how about we all just stop that crap and drink some delicious coffee how about that for an idea because that's where I Do every day I drink black rifle coffee every morning I drink at full on black\nBecause it was delicious high quality small batch roast or coffee I've made converts all of my office I'm like why are you drinking at Tommy's will when you can be drinking black rifle a company founded by veterans and that's all about delicious coffee go check it out for yourself\nNothing cares about attitude quite like starting your day with the most American coffee ever black rifle coffee visit black rival coffee dot com slash book mushy Fifteen Percent off your order that's black rifle coffee dot com slash book for Fifteen Percent off black level coffee dot com slash bar [noise]\nOr we can give a diplomatic statement about it we can say this was terrible you should never have done this but we're not going to prosecute anyone we don't have any mechanism even for prosecuting anyone ah this was a crime committed on Turkish soil so we don't have\nAny jurisdiction here to speak up it was also done in a conflict so it was done on Saudi soil on Turkish soil\nSo this is a diplomatic issue this is between nation states guy was not a U.S citizen now I Know he was a green card holder he was a permanent resident a lot of people focus in on that but he's still not a citizen or he held foreign citizenship show you know why is this the president's situation\nPrimarily to handle you know why is this something where the president\nOf the United states is the one guy who is supposed to take definitive action and we do we know the answer the answer is that is because the left wants to play this game of you know Trump is terrible and Trump is a dictator and all this other stuff uh and he loves dictators here's\nObama's former public relations propaganda is our from inside the White House Ben Rhodes and this is how dirty he's willing to be played with five\nWhat we're seeing here Chris this is really the continuation of a profound re alignment of American foreign policy under Donald Trump\nWhere we no longer speak up for democracy and human rights we no longer speak up for a journalist and said we called them the money is at the state and we're getting a green light not just to the Saudi regime but to any regime around the world who wants to harm dissidents harm journalists because the most powerful democracy in the world\nIs no longer on their side I think it has with Jared his son in law he's been sort of his vice Roy when it comes to dealing with the Arab world I think he feels that somehow he's in bed with this royal family over there that is sort of Romanoff phony ah family\nAh and their families seem to be locked together Jared yes it is yeah and his crown prince seemed to be in bed together politically\nYeah ... yeah they're quick Matt ...\nOh my gosh I don't know why anyone I don't want anyone listens to that guy just showed desperate to hang on and be relevant he must be good friends with the management MSNBC I don't know why people listen to what I really don't know among one of the worst analysts on TV or a total I Believe it used to be a conservative and say whatever you have to say to try and be relevant at any point in time\nBut you you have there are two different versions of giant bull crap a bull crap coming from Ben Rhodes is that this is Trump's fault that the ... the murder is because Trump calls CNN you know the enemy of the people are I I hate to break it to you but you know there are journalists there are\nPropaganda apparatus sigh in countries where\nJournalists are the enemy of the ... straight up is the north Korean ministry of propaganda the enemy of the north Korean people yes is North Korean state media the enemy of the north Korean people whether the ... yes same thing is true in Iran the industry and a lot of countries\nJust being a journalist did not give you some moral superiority which I Know is a shock to all the swamp dwelling journalists around me here in Washington DC they they really think that there's a national\nAnd they don't want anyone to tell them otherwise and this is she always I always get the sense of all these journalists that this is the only profession they could ever even consider having you know that that the notion of showing up to a job and just doing something else to them once they once they tasted a certain level of success in journalism is just\nA horrifying to them work with the pleads again oh no many of them have never done that they go right out of right out of school right into some J. program somewhere and that's that's the path anyway\nUh this is just idiocy though from roads and then you have this whole conspiracy theory about pushing her and Mohammed bin ... where ... cushion the Saudis are very important strategic player in the middle east right now that's a fact\nWe don't get to ignore that is a fact\nNew administration no administration has ever stood up to the Saudis any meaningful way for running one of the crappy as countries on her despite all of its oil well\nNo administrator no president including Obama who was powering literally bowing to the south it's okay to everyone needs to just slow their role and chill out on this stop making this about\nCheap partisan points against Trump that's all they want to do care about this guy to show the\nThey have a little more solidarity with them they would otherwise because he was not even sure he's a columnist the guy was and it is an opinion writer for the now I'm not saying that means that you know anything as sort of happened to him\nBut the way they're talking about it but it's like he's ... you know he he is one of them meanwhile has anybody ever writes that opinion column anywhere somebody that now get special treatment in terms of the media's view of them I can tell you this much if it were a conservative who had been attacked and music in American conservative Web and attack\nSomewhere else in the world you hear a lot less outrage about this just the fact it is just that if if it was someone who are critical of fundamentalist Islam and that\nWas the primary attack that Islam in Saudi Arabia is a destructive oppressive tyrannical force and the Saudis took that guy out that say well you know there's a lot of Islamophobia going on there I mean you know they shouldn't they shouldn't have murdered and but there is a lot of Islamophobia\nMeanwhile if you've been bring up the cause Yogi was and this is a fact and Islamist meaning he believed in political Islam\nAnd was very friendly and cozy with the Muslim Brotherhood it's like you're trampling on the man's great that's that's just telling the truth he wasn't Islamists ... nobody he wouldn't do not as if he were alive nobody denies it doesn't mean it should have been brutally murdered oh I I almost left out that he also a ... they dressed somewhat up as a body double and his clothing after they've killed him\nTo try to create footage of leaving so that was the plan they they were going to try to or they must not have known that the fiance was outside because they were going to try and say that he left and that they had no knowledge and ... they were going to disappear him that was the plan to disappear him and they are just really\nReally dumb about it let me give you a little bit of entail agency inside here in terms of what I what I learned when I was in the CIA about how foreign\nIntelligence often operates there this is a little bit of an inside baseball for you like that kind of thing\nThere are a lot of countries that are very effective their services are very effective at surveillance and at a certain you know the regime's security issues that that's generally what most intelligence agencies are their primary concern is ride regime and keeping the people in power in power and\nStopping any threats against them most countries aren't really worried about foreign invasion most countries are worried about toppling from from the inside um and they get very adept at dealing with that threat but they also often operate in places where they can be really\nHam fisted I guess that's kind of the wrong term for Saudi Arabia but you know what I mean\nThey can be clumsy and sloppy and get away with it and that's what I think happened here the Saudis the Saudi intelligence services the Saudi police they can be selfish in Saudi Arabia and can be thug issue in other Middle Eastern countries where they have a lot of sway\nCan't really be self sufficient turkey\nAnd that may have been the miscalculation here\nThey thought that they could get away with this and they're not used to operating on foreign soil where there is also a very by the way sluggish intelligence apparatus apparatus\nThat is at work so a lot of intrigue here we'll be right back there's been a change in the last few months people have started to realize that\nSocial media platforms are not a public utility they're not they're just for the free exchange of ideas they are Internet companies but they're also media outlet they are platforms\nAnd they make editorial decisions all the time and guess what the big ones out there are making editorial decisions that favor Democrats progressive and the left and they're doing it on\nSomebody who's not really that talented and make them into a pop star that can do that with politics on the media side of of a news and politics I think it's where they don't just basically a guy I really don't get it\nI'm I'm being completely honest with you ... with the Obama thing I understood what the left was going for with that and I got it you had that whole you know ... ... you know you sometimes you talked with a ... or whatever\nBut then those are those are the booming boards you know do the booming voice thing where he was just ... those are the new rules and you're going to them\nAnd you know look he he sounded he sounded presidential to the left or they thought he was really charismatic and and he he was able to get a good prepared speech off the cop really unimpressive but he could give a good a good prepared speech\nAnd but they've tried this with others now too you know Jon Ossoff as I mentioned Wendy Davis you know they\nAnd the whole Kennedy crew it that's all a construct the notion that the Kennedys are so exceptional and even they try to mold ... into a an extension of the Kennedy lures him oh he's kind of like JFK because he's\nYoung it's sort of answer the whole notion of of calling this guy ... by the way is\nJust such a ... it's just such nonsense [laughter]\nReally you know you're not Hispanic so why you would just have this Hispanic nickname strikes me as very obvious that people will just call you base your really your your father into Mr Mr O'Rourke was like I'm going to call my son they too\nUm strikes may maybe it's true I mean I maybe but it does ... strikes me as a bit as a bit odd now I don't want to make fun of people's names but I mean I'm not I didn't call myself you know\nThe way in G. U. E. Y. E. N. or something which is a fine name but it tends to be a name associate with Southeast Asia right I I didn't just adopt some name from another culture and like yeah I'm basically a part of that culture might as well be\nIt's it's cultural appropriation debate I was doing but\nWe're reporters and and the left and the Democrats they're\nObsessed with this guy it's weird it's it's really in the realm of creepy and here is for his he was just one example of this I mean here's a reporter was supposed to be interviewing bait or work and this is what she says to him during the interview played with not\nObvious strategies that I've seen him in a in a modern campaign to show off everywhere all the time for every one you can be without an interruption in from the federal backer much I Love your thinking well you know there's so many [laughter]\nRock star amazing ...\nThat's a reporter it's got the Mike and and the whole thing you know star\nReally that's what you say the the the guy that this is your interview subject now like I Know\nPeople were saying oh you're so great but does anyone has any reporter ... from the big mainstream journalist outfits out there has anyone on the left or or even in the ... the quote mainstream media is down in the middle journalists the big lie but they still couldn't do it and they ever gone to somewhere with Trump from like wow you're\nYou're a political phenomenon the likes of which this country has probably never seen 'em does anyone ever say that did they say he's a rock storming Trump's if they do it was a rock star Trump is a some kind of\nSuper human superstar I bet they would never do that and I'm not saying that they should I just want to know the comparison between the two because when you take a look at it you can find very obviously that you know they they buy into this mythology runs got ... ... says by the way you know always show handsome you so charismatic\nI I don't see it at all\nI don't and I and none of it I like the guy is okay looking and you know sounds okay and\nAs the whole ... thing strikes me as kind of funny but I I guess\nThere's a and a myth a kind of mixing here in their minds of that\nRunning a person from a red state as a down home Democrat who can speak to the whole country and but also has that kind of youth and coups charisma thing that Obama had\nSo it's almost like the best of Bill Clinton the best of Obama politically speaking pulled together um and\nI think that is how they view which uh I think that's kinda the way that cause they're obsessed with this guy and I'll tell you this and I've seen some other saying I think it's true\nThey know he's gonna lose going to lose by double digits up until I either lose by by nine or ten points\nThat's what they think that a lot of good enough showing in Texas the case with me and my ... at ...\nNight starting at seven o'clock news radio five sixty W. H. Y. N.\n[noise]\n\nBack was you know because when it comes to those places are so she never saw [noise]\n[laughter] [noise]\nFood seriously sheds seriously what it is not\nNot as cool I'm a French Jews princess we were gonna you know we must around with the parties so we're just picking up where we left off [laughter] let's see she went to it now she told me earlier she wants to be from the piece from the piece that yeah the ... that's me the prince to be on the ... the French fought\nTo generate a contract or something snow but I mean did you ask her if she wants to Mm [noise]\nWell I guess not really\nOkay\nCase you didn't know that is a kind of public service announcements from Amnesty International which is an organization that apparently has a lot of time on its hands and Amnesty International things that people need to be told the fairy tale\nThat there should be no uh no kissing women who are asleep\nThis guy also this this it's a cartoon we played the audio for him and he kind of like reaches like he's going to do a little group group thing a while this woman's passed out\nAnd you know this follows last week when you had Christian Bale who is a celebrity a talent or does not strike me as very bright shouldn't have a fine actors I guess I don't know she kind of plays at a you know tract of youngish blonde female\nOr I don't I've never seen a really extend herself the man who cares I'm not a thespian critic or a critic of the attack\nA but she said that she's worried\nAbout what will happen to young women that see or people in general including her daughter I think she said with a fairy tale of Sleeping Beauty who is kids to wake her up from her dream because that there is a violation of could send that goes on there now I put it out to you last week that\nThe the point is really not that there's a consent issue because\nThey were talking about which who has a magic apples and somebody's in a coma from eating the apple and it is a it is a fairy tale\nAnd really the only way for her to be awoken which is the the storyline is by a prince to kiss her she saved her life by kissing her show it's really almost like he's performing mouth to mouth resuscitation I Would say and therefore he does have\nConsent if we're going to take it to this weird place where we are talking about this\nBecause if somebody is choking and you give the mouth to mouth resuscitation you don't have to say hey can you can you verbalize that your choking and I'm going to give you or you know or they're ... they're hard to stop and choking is the Heimlich hard to stop you get the idea\nAh some out the mouth resuscitation you know in a fairy tale is really what we're talking about here but they ran with this they didn't stop they weren't they weren't it wasn't enough for them to just say\nI have an actress say that because there was another one I forget who another actors came out oh I'm worried about fairy tales and the patriarchy so they're they're destroying centuries old stories that is instill very basic one creative sensibility in young people but also\nHave some basic morality and tales of good and evil and now they're fairy tales they're meant for amusement I promise you I don't know a single guy who in college age was like well\nBecause the handsome prince ... the girl in a coma or I can kissed this girl in real life you're like no one would ever think that nobody no human being has ever ever ever thought that\nSo this was a problem that did not exist but now they've gone even further with it\nAnd you know in that video I don't want to play it again for you 'cause you're already heard it but you know there's some very dirt first of all there's a curse and there's some ... and they make it very clear that there are some are kind of crude sexual humor in there as well\nAre referring to the initials that he uses and everything and he's clearly supposed to be in a title frat bro the prints I mean there's there's all the\nThe patriarchy left wing stuff is there\nBut you know this is what the what the left doesn't yet grass is that they lose on this stuff\nThey lose on these cultural issues where they are acting like maniacs um and and this brings me to not just this battle over fairy tales and consent\nBut this whole this whole story that broke today about how Trump is are taking is telling the DEA Jane now

H. Y. N. [noise]\nTo years ago the presidential race I have never seen there and like I see right now I think the Republicans are going to do very well [noise]\nYou know people are tired of high taxes which we gave the tax cuts with us so much that they want a strong military they want protected they want safety\nThey want security we give that the Democrats do not feel that the Democrats don't know what they're doing they don't know what they're given I think we're going to do very very well in the rise yeah\nNothing Trump's right I think that we're going to pick up Senate seat something's going to be fifty five you heard it or for fifty five Republican Senate seats by by the end of this thing\nNot quite the super majority of sixty although it would not be sweet midterms going to be tight I mean a house rather intimate church going to be tight very very tight I\nI think it could go either way right now and it's going to be just a few seats that separates the Democrats and Republicans at the end the day but Trump is an incredibly\nPowerful voice in this whole debate and discussion I think that he's really making a very he's making the case very well\nWhich are the Democrats don't actually have an agenda or a platform other than trying to restore the legal and cultural and his fish of Obama is them while Trump is president and they're ... they won't be able to do that so this is really just going to be\nMuch more a rhetorical battling much more fighting it out in the media and nastiness\nAnd it really is it is moms or jobs and Republicans need to hammer that home the point that I think they're on that and they're doing\nThey're okay is that they could be stronger on this but on health care I'm furious with the Republicans because they don't have a unified message and because of a couple of\nVery unreliable GOP senators we don't actually have a real achievement to speak of in a in the healthcare realm\nAnd Obamacare is garbage in Trump is allowing people to get out of the individual\nMandate but that and also giving states more flexibility in this but they need to be telling people what that means and what it does for them you know they are not effective messengers on health care and that could be I really do think if if the Democrats when that when the house it's going to be because of that issue\nOn the Senate side however\nTed Cruz versus a bet to roar a no surprise here Trump is going out there to Stanford Stanford head and I just thought the thought this was a nice moment in your play play quip twenty as Trump's on his way to Texas\nThat any more taxes go up [laughter] that's true and I had a very very nasty stuff it was it was a very healthy [laughter]\nWe got together and then by the way very late in the cafe we last people were shocked I said don't worry about all the time and then ultimately what happened we voted out\nOf the outcome was obvious that we work together very closely I like a lot I actually like I'm a lot of very smart guy he loves people sexist which I Do that in fact right now I guess they said they've never seen it it's like every day or so miles is over a hundred thousand\nIs incredible the crowd that's going to be reading Trump in Texas saying over a hundred thousand people have registered for this thing\nA ... we've had some problem with the whole ... Nash\nOn this show tonight or but keep in mind it it just yet another case study\nIn the media malpractice and in the bias that's pushing so much of what they do every day I mean this guy beta ... never had a prayer never had a chance but the media just cried short thirty eight million dollars oh they're going on and on this guy\nAll in on it and I just feel like\nYou know it couldn't be any more obvious they have very little interest in the fact that there is a much closer than anticipated Senate race for the sheet Frankenstein up in Minnesota you you'll notice that not a lot of people\nNot a lot of people in the media are are paying attention to factor is a single digit lead right now\nFor the Democrat in that in\nThat Senate race in trying to\nReplace the Frankenstein joke you know the race where they think maybe they can get some big upset against Sen Cruz\nGets all kinds of coverage by like Senator uh Tina Smith is the one I'm Talking about here so she's just barely hanging on up there\nAnd uh we'll see\nSingle digit leader battles and see that she was appointed to falling Franken's resignation\nOur three coming up going to be a huge\nSeventh annual full flooring yard sales going on now with incredible deals there lumber liquidators we've got hundreds of floors\nOn sale up to fifty percent off in stock and ready to go see big on waterproof floors all on sale from just thirty nine cents get would look limited flooring all on sale up to forty percent off\nI also saw over the weekend I'm always amazed at how many people that are supposed to have intelligent opinions are are actually more on 'em and I know this is the thing that happens but you know here's some guy in Wesley Lowery at the Washington Post he ... he wrote over the weekend after this Mitch McConnell saying\nQuote yelling and elected officials in public is protected First Amendment speech and it's pretty disgusting to see journalists lecturing our fellow citizens for directly petitioning government officials\nLiked it fully branch clip everything he said here as it is wrong in in ... an hour ... yes it is is protected speech but that's\nRelevant because they're protected speech we're talking about here in a restaurant no one's saying the government has a right to come in and arrest these people\nBut the establishment can say get out your trespassing is private property they have that right to you know the the left thinks that the first amendment means they get to say whatever they want an act\nHowever they want and nobody else gets to say anything about it because we're infringing on their right\nBy exercising our right they don't understand this\nThey have no concept of a of rights existing in parallel to each other you know somebody can say something really stupid about Trump and I can say that was really stupid that doesn't mean that I'm getting their First Amendment right if\nI you know put tape over their mouth and locked him in a closet that's probably kidnapping but also it's that's negating their First Amendment right if I refuse to give them a permit to speak in a public park when I get that permit to other people to speak in a public park because of viewpoints discrimination\nThat's not respecting their first of All right but in a restaurant no\nYou don't have the right to go to a restaurant and act like a moron or any more than you otherwise you're going to a restaurant and play\nYour you know boom box which we used to have some you remember we used to have those the eighties and nineties poop [noise] the boom box you remember he's carried around with you I remember how cool you were high school was almost directly correlated with how big your speakers were\nYou know you want a big speakers then you were really cool\nI was a little speakers were much more than likely pleasing and people like why do you like little speakers but\nAnd and one of the speakers there there was a guy there was a public pool that I Would go to 'em over the weaker all it's not really public but to a community pool whatever that I used to go to over the summer and there's a guy who's to show up there\nWith and he would bring every time he was there he would bring a little outdoor speaker with him and play his weird Buddha Bar lounge music and and I just think that that's ... ... weird thing to do like everybody else the pool wants to hear your music\nYou know that that's a bold thing to do to inflict on ever bring a Bluetooth speaker with you you can blast your music at a pool with a hundred people I think that's very very strange\nUm and I think that you know it's it's something that people should not do anyway back to Mitch McConnell what's going on here and this guy was Lee at the Washington Post is essentially a doesn't understand where the first amendment stops and starts and you see this from a lot of journalists which you think that people who make a living from the first amendment would have\nA better understanding of it but their understanding of the first amendment is they have special rights in privileges and everybody else needs to just deal with it\nUm but that's not the way that's not the way this is supposed to function that's not how this is supposed to go\nAnd for the Philly branch thing\nTo say that we're giving comfort to white nationalism and we're uh I I hate this talking point it's so vile it's so despicable and unfair and they keep saying all the time and it's just a way of shutting down any on his political dialogue which is why people like me I'm increasingly said over the last six months you know what\nThe Russia collusion thing now they know they can't win that you're just you're just going to see that same that same mentality that same insane tenacity around an issue where they think they can destroy the president that's going to be\nA expanded to cover any number of things so that the the craziness that led them to believe that Russia collusion was going to bring down the president that same level of just was char\nOr will now be on everything the twenty Fifth Amendment stuff the can front of people in restaurants because that was just the that was the place where you had the first real symptoms of Trump trumped arrangements syndrome\nThe first major symptom was Russia is going to bring down the presidency it's really going to happen Trump is a Russian student a Russian pond where it's just a matter of time before we prove it and now you see that because that's just not going to work there now\nTurns out to everything else and you're seeing the same insanity even believe brains they're saying that you know it's it's not a big deal that people were yelling at Mitch McConnell\nAnd remember you know what I'm saying these people should be arrested were just saying they're idiots and people shouldn't do this and we should be able to share that opinion without people so you get your your opinion that's destroying the first amendment no\nIt is not he's not and uh I I just think that this is\nOne of these places where you know you either have principles you don't abide by the way I'm not skipping over we just don't have unless you're there were there were a bunch of people that were harassing Nancy Pelosi over the weekend too and they are total moron okay they absolutely\nShould not should not be given any respect or any you know an approval from any one I heard somebody say they were the Proud Boys I don't know I just know that there was a video of people so I'm getting over coal to my voice has been really shaky last week\nVideo people who ... yeah that's right I called I did the show every day I don't miss the show him sick 'cause I Love all of you so much and I can't I Can't skip a day and the freedom of\nUnless I have a work thing I have to do but that's where a but the people yelling Apollo see they've done nothing to help their cause a lot to harm it or if their cause is and I and I don't know what their causes I'm assuming it just anti left wing something\nBut the left you're doing their huge favor no matter who you are if you say you're on the right and I know some people are talking false black I haven't seen any evidence of that\nIf you say you're on the right\nAnd you are screaming and yelling and people on the left now you give them the ability to say oh she both sides are doing it when both sides are doing it but that one case will be magnified so those in Brussels were banging on ... on the far left a huge favor\n\nI just saw the c._e._o. of global verification network last week here in DC we caught up for a while I said hey mark how's business he's a business is great we've got companies large and small coming to us for their background investigations and vetting and I know why that is both because global verification is a U.S based veteran owned and operated\nBackground investigation company wherever your needs are for your age are department or if you're going to be leasing out of property to somebody if you need to make sure the person you are trends acting business with Israel they say they are you want to us based company a veteran owned and operated company one that doesn't offshore data doesn't send your stuff overseas and really just act\nIt's a reminder of how the Democrats are operating in general right now and what they're doing is effectively to connect trying to connect emotionally with people without having to put forward any of their policies to try and make it seem like they care\nA few uh uh for you\nYour hey that's what they're you know and I wasn't the only thing that Bill Clinton was feeling back in the day I I'm just saying\nI'm just saying a ... you know also\nGrapefruits in the grocery store or comes with no orbital things orbital object but you know Clinton aside for a moment here\nThe problem that Democrats have is the more people understand about what Democrats want to do when it comes to governance the less they trust in the left they trust Democrats with governance\nOkay so you have to keep that in mind and the more that we find out that the Democrats don't have any solution the less we'll listen to their oh I've got solutions talk solutions like what\nHow do they want to deal with homelessness the answers they they don't want to clear the homeless off the street and tell them that you know and it's actually enforce vigorously laws because that seems I mean right now you can't do that\nWell if we're going to create a system for keeping people off the street\nAnd we have places for them to go\nThat are meant to give them a safe place to sleep foods you eat and help to get back up on their feet which we do as a country that we do it better in some places than others but there are programs that exist for that purpose if we have those programs we should also be able to say hey you can't sleep and live and poop industry\nBecause that's what they're doing and it's not good for the people that are living on the street it's not safe it's not sanitary but the the liberal mentality is that they don't want to enforce the laws against the less fortunate because they want to use the less fortunate\nAs a political party or they want to use the plight of people live on the street to say oh you know we need\nWe need more funding we need more funding\nYou know look at the big mean Republicans with their tax breaks nobody is homeless because of the Republican tax break nobody is homeless because of Republican fat cats doing private equity restructuring or something people lose their jobs I mean I'm not saying it's all fine but\nThey ... they take it to this point and and the other issue is\nWhen you look at a mental health as\nA factor in homelessness um yes that's true but really what he means by mental health is is generally a addiction that's the primary or the primary factor that you find with homeless populations all across the country putting aside this whole homeless by choice movement which is a new thing\nWhich is happening in this country as well people say oh housing is too expensive I'm just going to choose to be homeless out but\nYou know I I Would I Would tell you that it's roughly Seventy to eighty percent of the homeless population is is the number that I Believe I've seen but don't quote me on it\nBut it's a huge majority for sure of the homeless population has either a drug problem a drinking problem or a serious mental health issue very severe schizophrenia or any number of different\nDiagnoses and that means these are people who need help\nIn is not helping them to read them in the public square literally in the public square to engage in all kinds of\nYou know human activity and bodily function and things that\nAre unsafe and you know not the way that people should be living\nOctober twenty second one today on the free I our radio ads check out our talk radio resentment inside a studio during a brand new episode with the legendary garden

making a more efficient energy source for businesses the renewable energy is nowhere near as efficient as a carbon based\nA fossil fuels right there there's just there's no comparison even still with some of the technological advances but renewable energy is what we have to devote ourselves to as though it were an existential crisis similar to what we faced\nIn the second World War\nI don't know how liberals go through the day being quite so crazy and quite so bizarre but but they obviously do and there is very clearly a strain of contemporary liberalism that wants to believe in the extreme catastrophe scenario\nOf global warming slash climate change last and and I'm really starting to recognize this as a disease of the uh western mind in the industrialized world of of the twenty isn't

that you see in his life the atrocities horrors just listen to how bad as it\nIf you want to ask me what makes me the most depressed about my job it's covering the rallies and it gets to the larger point of what it's like covering the president United States and and and Donald Trump\nIn many ways the danger is not what ... is doing to America the danger is how America is changing under Trump and I never thought I Would see the day where I Would go to a political rally in you know people would give you a hard time I you know people yelled at me at Hillary Clinton rallies to those make campaign\nOr you know that would happen from time to time and you know and during Mitt Romney you know people throw things at me and asked me why did you call but why did ask about Ben gossipy or do a story of the guys who that happened when I covered Mitt Romney but at rally after rally after rally having the president of states where people up into a frenzy can attack the press to me is\nThat the ... the most depressing thing that I've ever witnessed as a journalist and I guess\nHe's never recovered a riot [noise]\nHave you ever covered a\nFire you know what people are like crying 'cause their houses were destroyed that they've lost their their pets they've lost all their up prized possessions I mean he thinks covering a rat\nIs is is uh is the worst thing that's ever happened man is he led to a sheltered life as a as a reporter\nSpeaking of sheltered lives let's go to the the ... this is college campuses Texas I don't even know what college it is these are the these are the ... the beta groupie here listen to this\nHere in Texas the big race Beto O'Rourke first Ted Cruz if you had to make a decision right now who do you think you would support\nHim I Would probably vote for ...\nOf what I Know definitely better if the election when Morrow who do you think you'd be more likely to\nVote for that I'm having a ...\nTrust me because I'm a woman I think I Will go for the Democrat\nFrom what I Know and political science I just feel like they are they pretty much and they\nLike a a woman and like you know when he drives drunk I Know is never hit a woman\nHeld for anything that would help people in my situation like people in poverty and things like that\nAre there any a cop you know like you always wants to help people with poverty like that's why he burglar eyes that building on the college campus man like 'cause you know he's he's like like he's really his name's beta man and it's cool\nBut friends and his career as you can point to that would make him a for profit [noise]\nUm [noise] I Am not aware of a lot of American accomplishments that he has made\nThirty ... she ... she was the best read what she's she's read everything ever written about him and she was not aware of any accomplishments\nAccomplishment that he has made thirty accomplishments debate does that your point too I I don't know any so I Can't say any of that is there anything you can point to his things to me like\nYou beat the drunk driving around and I didn't go for the burglary I mean that's not bad is it come on\nIf I Can't say any of that is there anything you can point to is things would be like yeah she's accomplished for this um I think he's accomplished like aren't they getting his name out there for not doing much what sounds like he's really but it to be popular an accomplishment though like career\nHe's like he's like a a Texas ... man he's got his name a house like a ...\n... I I honestly couldn't points anything I'm just trying to you know I'm not educated I Would like to be an accomplishment of\nBitter or did you were not as if you're not as I said it as with like you to be either as your fellow voters\nHaving ... ... what our accomplishments debate is that you would point to [noise]\nUm I mean he's been working really hard when everything that he's been doing around tech if maybe he's not he doesn't really have\nA you know how hard it is to work when you got to hang over like that has\nA platform to make a huge difference right now\nYou got an evidence that was Obama just a couple of years ago talking about Trump when Trump was running said he doesn't have a magic wand he can't bring all these jobs back you can't do it and now the story is oh well he has done it so Obama is going to take credit for this\nThis is this is preposterous this is this should be laughable\nWhat it's all they've got all that and that's why Obama is out there on the campaign trail given speeches trying to trying to just tip the balance of the house to the to the Democrats\nAnd he's the guy who's were on there saying yeah that's right good economies because of me before I even let Obama make his case from South you're let's just understand this\nIf the economy were what they said it would be under Trump which was you know in in a freefall recession bad things happening do any of you believe for one second that the story would be well it's not Trump's fault it's Obama's economy\nOf course not just this is ridiculous\nSo given we can establish that we also know that we should not have to take it seriously and now they're saying oh that's right it's it's the uh it's the Obama economy that we are all enjoying right\nNow please please that is ridiculous um but here's Obama making that case like look too\n[noise] so by the time on wages were arriving on insurance rate was falling\nPoverty was Paul [noise]\nAnd that's what I ended up that [noise]\nSo when you talk about economic miracles right now remember who started it [noise]\nI mean this is a Obama at the at the economic level is the guy\nWho's you know who who's a who's white comes over to open up the ketchup bottle because he can't\nGet it and then he goes you know I losing it for you like it does it really doesn't really cutting edge lot really how this goes\nI just think that that's so indicative of they got nothing right now they've got they've got to try to ... they've got to act like Obama's still the president still the one making the decisions because the decision that I've been made for two years are good\nAnd they're helpful and people have jobs and the money and the more money in their pocket and they have less Lester be crushing tax burden in the corporate tax rates now in line with the rest of the advance world we always hear about how great the rest of the industrialized world is on health care and there's other things but on their corporate tax rate or or do we need a really high one\nWay to hire corporate tax rate that you know Denmark does it mean that that that's the kind of stuff with the Democrats ended up having to say I I guess they feel like they really have no choice but Larry Kudlow\nWho's or one of the ... one of the more stellar Trump Administration officials out there could be good when I was saying that Obama's recovered from the recession was the worst one since the great depression the worst one and basically a hundred years\nThere were ... they never had three percent GDP Growth under Obama's time it'll never not once in eight years that's coming out of a terrible recession the stock market hit you know thirty forty or thirty percent I think it was at the at the real downturn the Dow got crushed all that stuff\nCould low is just the one that's out there making the case played a clip three\nUnder his stewardship the so called recovery was by about two percent average per year or which is really the worst since the I Believe since the depression and already\nWe've beaten are critics including Obama staff people were on the economy it's three to four percent economic growth and the whole change here look\nShop is cut tax rates on small businesses and corporations and individuals he wants to do some more as a huge change from President I bought a President Trump is you know roll back onerous regulations and what you're saying as a tremendous increase and are\nMen and women who own and operate their own small business is a president has stopped the war against ... stop the war against energy stop the war against fossil fuels here's rewarding success\nAll good things all the kinds of decisions at the presidential level that would have a positive impact on the economy and that is exactly what we are seeing they can't make\nOf Oregon because of the facts of the facts are what are we do they make oh they create an alternate universe where Obama is the one who's really respond\nBut with the decision to drop is make it work for the the benefits that Trump has brought about the economy you know it's it's Obama who's doing all this great stuff they are living in a fantasy where\nThey they they they are not\nConnected to reality here are just not and eat it I Wish\nThe American people would would be able to get the the real scoop on this one vote based on it because then you have a a Democrat you'd have a red wave\nRight you'd have Magana taken taken the country by storm instead of any kind of a a transfer of power to the blue and uh you know and by the way I could get even better there's there's a there's even a new\nTax cuts that are that will be going there is a new tax cuts it could be happening show you\nKnow I think that's also very very important to think about there's better things coming in the future both well we'll talk more about you know whose economy\nIs this really who who's really the one that is a responsible for all this\nIn a more also get into the caravan with

Porter in chief and then build up the currency politically and what the media is help to make it seem like you're serious about immigration reform when really all you're serious about as amnesty\nBecause with energy comes to death of the Republican Party full stop\nSo whenever they have to do to get to that point there of course willing to do whatever you can do whatever you must do to get to amnesty you should do as a Democrat because it means that you effectively eliminate your competition eliminate\nGone forever right victory game over\nWe cannot allow people to pour in the U.S undetected an undocumented unchecked and we can allow people to get around those who waited patiently line that was Obama a few years back where are those Democrats now\nWhereas Obama now other than telling\nFantasies or that he has about his his economic record to Democrats in his last ditch effort to try and least flip the house at least look the house Democrats say they know the Senate on no chance and it's out of there out of their grass now\nUh put Obama's doing this whole this whole storyline about the economy and he's going to take credit for which is just not just nonsense I've been saying and it doesn't it doesn't comport with the facts but also an immigration there's such a fundamental dishonesty about this about how Democrats would approach\nShould approach this caravan what they expect Republicans to do and all of all\nThe arguments I hear from them or just emotional appeals there's really not a policy argument for them to make because they can't they won't tell you who can't stay who has to go back other than criminals and they certainly\nAre generally\nI got to tell you people have been asked to be about this as a buck how could the Saudis have been so stupid\nI mean for put aside the ruthlessness the brutality and this is a mafia style hit this is straight out of the Sopranos right this is you know beat someone to death count up into pieces disposed the body\nAnd you did this what you expect from an organized crime family that is ruthless and violent and what we shouldn't be surprised that at recognizing that was it the Saudis are effectively and organized crime family\nThey just have royal titles and a lot of money but they operate like an organized crime family and I just would know that is very likely that the Saudis have been doing this kind of thing\nFor a long time meaning there are a whole lot of body parts very down desert that we never get to hear about from people who may be critical of the regime or just pose a problem for the regime and Saudi and we have no idea we never will and even though people knowing Saudi won't say anything because they don't want to be buried in the desert somewhere\nWhy would the Saudis do this and such a clumsy way\nOr their services really that incompetent their intelligence services people that were involved in this hit\nAnd I don't have a great answer\nI mentioned you that sometimes in closed societies like Saudi Arabia where the services can operate without any fear of you know the Saudi ACLU getting involved or something or they can do whatever they want effectively if it's sanctioned by the regime they can tend to be a bit sloppy\nBut the Turks also have their own intelligence simply services that can do more or less what they want as long as they have the backing of the regime in this case the the air to won\nA government and the Saudi should've known that meaning that\nThe chances of them getting away with this we are so slim unless they were just dumb and really believes somehow this wouldn't be a problem there must have been a miscalculation\nHere that either we're not taking into account or that we're not yet aware of the latest reporting says that the body of the show\nAnd I was told his very early on but I didn't think it was ... well enough I might have mentioned this on radio I Can't remember now that the body of the show the main factor been buried in the garden of the head of the consulate consul general I think in in ... in his garden\nThat's what they decided to do with this guy which just go to show you how how just", "year": "2018", "show_name": "The Buck Sexton Show", "city": "Springfield", "day": "23"}
