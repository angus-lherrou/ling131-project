{"month": "10", "state": "MA", "station": "WHYN", "content": "I don't even mean the the content of the speech I mean his the level of his speech and and the sound of his speech now that the problem she's saying Jeb Bush was calm me yes Jeb is low energy this long since been established low energy jet\nTrump was giving a rally in Pennsylvania\nAnd you know when he talks about issues relating to to Florida and he's obviously very concerned is better cheap there's a big federal response but this is what I mean everything that Trump does Israel I mean when people say things like Trump could cure cancer tomorrow and liberals we're all of a sudden be pro cancer it's true\nIt's not an exaggeration they have involve them their sense of self so much in everything that they're saying and everything that they're they're doing all the time or it has so much to do with with from\nThat they just can't help themselves ... this is all part of the Trump delusion I mean he's the response or if you will get more to the response to hurricane probably the next hour um but there's nothing that they can point yet in terms of Trump\nBeing asleep on the job or not you know I'm doing the federal aid in quite the right way or something so now it's that his tone\nHis voice cannot be the new normal\nAh ... I don't know I Can't imagine waking up every day and being such a a hysterical Pearl clutching lip I really can't it must be a very uh well I was gonna say a very sad way to go through life but maybe that explains why there's all these rage mobs running around the left\nOh it's not a legal process it's whatever we say it is and it's it's all about what we can convince people to do because it's it's really just a battle of rumors right or just will ... will have people say things there's no evidence there is no there is nothing to do is we can't we're not going to subpoena any evidence from these people\nIt was all meant to create a parallel process to the legal process that the left can control\nNow impeachment is in fact a parallel process to the legal process that the left can control if they take the house and that's what they are gearing up for so whenever we try to have the argument that Trump was not found guilty\nWhen it comes to Russia collusion of anything they're going to say it doesn't matter this isn't a criminal trial Trump is guilty of malfeasance of high crimes and misdemeanors while in office a ... which is essentially whatever\nThe house of representatives decides he is guilty of now they can't remove him from office but the biggest feather in their cat they think going into the twenty twenty election is going to be\nThat President Trump was impeached\nBy the President Trump visited impeach president we have to remove him get rid of the corruption get rid of the uh you know the racism and massage any and sexism and all that stuff that's going on because of Trump's they say and that's a way to the left to avoid the fact that they don't have compelling arguments\nOn policy that they can't meet us on the battlefield of ideas when it comes to policy so what they do is turn this into a battle of reputational or a reputational fight or somebody's\nYou know the the perception of whether someone is racist or not or perception whether someone's a massage ... or not and just oh he's eighty don't vote for him he's ... which is\nReally what they want to convince everybody about Trump all along but there there's a development and his whole Russia thing today or this is what made me think of this that a lawyer for Glenn Simpson this from the hill dot com I my own website where I work\nUh I don't want us in my own I obviously don't own a time employee cofounder\nOf fusion GPS told the head of the house Judiciary Committee on Thursday\nThat his client will invoke his constitutional rights not to testify depart defying ... what is that your pie him take away his pie defying a GOP issued subpoenas seeking to compel him to get a closed door deposition\nThe lawyer Joshua Letty toll judiciary chairman Bob Goodlatte an electronic letter that Simpson will not participate in this committee's inquiry because it is not designed to discover the truth\n...\nQuote consistent with the September twenty seven twenty anti letter we sent you Mr Simpson who's testimony as a matter of public record will not be participating in a confidential deposition before this committee squirted lawyers for Simpson he will be invoking his right not satisfying the first and fifth amendments of the constitution\nAh now I understand that this is where people\nWill say based on their politics well if you take the fifth you must be guilty that's not fair the fitness a procedural protection and there are times when I assure you there will be people that you and I are much more favorably disposed toward\nWho would take the fifth and we would say that's absolutely the right thing to do so it's not just that he's taking the fifth but it's that there is such a clear pattern in general are people who are tied to the CIA people who were early on big advocates\nOf the whole Russia collusion theory with regard to Trump the election\nWho want to make sure that that the information does not get out they don't want to testify they don't want subpoenas to be declassified they don't want the release of the ... information they don't want the full scope even of Mueller's probe to become public\nWill win back the situation I think you do have to ask yourself what the heck is going on here\nYou never see a greater revelation amount of information from this investigation supported by the people that think that Trump is done terrible things it's the people that think that Trump has been set up an ambushed year and smeared\nThey're the ones they're the ones who want more information out there they're the ones you want us to be able to get the facts and get the truth so I just would note that they\nBack in office right now because one I think that Muller knows that you know to to put more kind of\nYou know Ricky ... indictments out there oh we're going to do much more Russian sock puppets you know they're never going to actually sit in a courtroom that would look really to borrow word from before achy ready for the election\nSo it won't be till after the election let me get more information but the Democrats are a little bit of a of a little bit of a bind here\nBecause they don't want to over promise and and they don't want to make it seem like they're trying to throw this mid term based on all the work that they've already done against Trump\nKids might be ... hasn't shown tracks with labor inspired by the we've\nEveryone's talking about like the people involved\nThe Joe Rogan experience all your favorite music all your favorite state\nBucks ... weeknight starting at seven on news radio five sixty W. H. Y. N.\n[noise]\n\nThat was you know because when it comes to the fight for self sauce never saw [laughter]\nI'll bet\nIt would cost me you know I see these people say oh Trump gets rich being president\nOutlet you I've lost billions of dollars just because it is one of my friends are very wealthy and I said you know\nHow bad it cost me two or three million dollars and it's worth every penny of it [laughter] I don't need the money\nAnd it's worth every penny because\nDoing so much for the country yes it's it's nasty it's just\nIt's incredible the false reporting is so incredible but honestly I'm doing a great job and that's why these crowds these crowds are showing up of I don't do a good job they see the difference when they make up to three thousand dollars more from taxes all of a sudden out of nowhere [laughter] they're getting two thousand dollars a lot of money to people\nAnd I think that there are a lot of a lot of people who hate Trump as I've said many times because he is so far a successful president meaning that that they they hate him even more\nNow that it is clear that he's actually up to the task I mean they they can say as much as they want about oh Trump twenty two at the moment we should get rid of him but they really despise this man because he's been\nAble to do such a strong job in that position now forget about they'll say his tone is terrible he's a racist and oh my God you know bring up all this stuff\nThe country and how it functions right now is strong it's going well everything is moving in the I should say everything but in general there's a feeling of optimism about the nation are certainly optimism about the the economy but they they despise Trump but I I also think\nThat when we started to evaluate why is that we've had some of these ... there was a couple of phenomena these are related and and I'm just really thinking out loud on this one but it's something that's been\nOn my mind for a while team so I'll share with you and then you have these these never Trump or types who have some of them have gone straight up Democrat now I mean they have actually switch teams officially although a lot of them might as well which teams are that they can say they're not\nNever Trump but for all intents and purposes they are\nA but why is it that they\nAre they hate this president so much and that there are so many people who come from\n... not exclusively government backgrounds but I I think come from backgrounds where they've spent time in government and they're of the system and all the establishment and they have this guy I really do think that they hate him because one\nHe isn't supposed to be able to do this and I can tell you that there's a lot of people in the government\nWho really like to think that they have some magic powers of of thoughts and an organization and management\nOf that other people don't have a right to that once you become a government employee long enough because you become culturally acclimated from being within this bureaucracy to think that there's something that\nYou know you have to be in government to understand government that's that's essentially the distillation of this ... you have to be in government to understand it you know you have to have been a beltway inside or or you've had to had to run for elected office time and time again essentially you got to be part of the professional\nPolitical class not necessarily a politician but part of the professional political class in order to be competed in these roles and it's just not true\nAnd I think that makes a lot of people who have power in this country a lot of people who are part of the elites and the establishment to feel uncomfortable because they built their careers and their reputations on the notion that well you know I've you know the the the the Gergen effect\nOr work for ... cents advisory wars were ... or ... or ... and buggy whip through it offers and\nYou know you get these guys do the whole\nTheir whole resume is this long stretch of government working and different government jobs the idea of being well they must understand they must make better decisions they must know this stuff better then somebody like a Trump who just has existed in the private sector in the real world\nAnd hasn't made this cross over into public service\nAnd I I don't think I'm over stadium when I say that there's a real resentment of this and I and I'm really aware of it now that I'm In the swamp in DC they really don't like that this president is able to do this because he's not supposed to be able to do this he he brings out Trump brings out\nBlink motion activated indoor and outdoor cameras are wire free set up and minutes and run on to double laid back [noise]\n\n\n\n[noise]\nThe use of

[noise]\nHurricane reports on hurricane Michael are unbelievably disruptive powerful it was the fastest hurricane and everybody said [noise] it just was me if it wasn't that would be absolutely nothing left because I just spoke\nWith Governor Scott they're very happy or food is being now following\nHurricane now brought in a way of unbelievable large amounts of water and food and everything that people could walk the electric companies have been a\nTerrific they're already working the roads are being clear that many trees are in the path of the electric company is uh the roads are being claimed right now they're being ah for the most part\nThey're open enough to get the electric companies and and a lot of electricity is already back on some of the false electricity there's already back on that's in Florida they're following up in Georgia\nSo the Trump Administration\nIs showing confidence and doing what the federal government can to help respond in a situation like this obviously it was a really nasty hurricane it was a two and then it came up with category for winds were really fast\nA but one interesting side of this and the first priority at first thought of everybody is getting help to those who needed and making sure that there's no or minimum loss of life and they're going to lives lost so far\nBut as we know it can often be the aftermath where much of the damage is done in terms of the human cost of a hurricane Michael a hit and they're used to be this\nI guess you'd call it a gentleman's agreement a gentleman's agreement among politicians that are when something like this goes on you will you will cease the political\nAttack that that was not the case here folks\nAre you had Ron dissent is his rival Andrew Gillum getting hit with some uh some ads you had a the the democratic superPAC that trying to help Bill Nelson and Florida take down his opponent governor Rick Rick Scott they called them a shady\nMillionaire and the ad by the way John I'd like to be a shady millionaire that sounds like fun you know\nBeing a millionaire will be great but shady millionaire sounds like you're the kind of a millionaire that has parties on his yacht and has a little too much fun so I think that sounds good to me but they're they're running these these attack ads um and and people were pointing out that that this is a different thing than what you you would usually expect\nRemember there was running attack at the ring attack ads in the state that is getting just battered while it was getting better by this hurricane and they're running ads\nSpecifically on the opponents inability to respond to the hurricane\nSo usually you wait for a politicization of these things and then with hurricane response is fair game to criticize politicians were I'm not saying that but usually you wait for the politics to fly into into literally the storm has passed\nAnd in this case the uh the candidates running these ads even while the while the storm was was overhead and people were trying to other bad down the hatches or\nOr or wait until they can return to their homes by word of the footage of it is just the devastation I I Know that\nYou know the the news channels because it's such a visceral human reaction to seeing you know we all think what would it be like if I lost my home over to feel like if I had to flee a natural disaster like this and so when you see those images you're immediately drawn to it\nAnd I and I know that there's something of a of a news cliche here with\nAll the coverage going on of of a of a hurricane like this but there there was this political backs Georgia which which I think also a illuminates how tight these border races are people are going to look to the Florida governor's race a and between Gillum and ... and Scott and they're going to look to the Senate race\n'em and they're going to try to extrapolate\nFrom that for the implications for the presidential race in twenty twenty you know the idea here being Gillum who is a a young African American guy mayor of Tallahassee very progressive very left wing I think would be really damaging the state of Florida with the policies and his opposing and he's one of these guys who's\nYou know if he if he's not outward I think he is for single payer outwardly so I I should probably but if he's not outwardly for single payer you might as well be\nA but you know they they certainly are drawing some comparisons between him and Brock Obama he's young he's telegenic African American\nUm and and that's what the progressive base wants to see in their new candidates they want to see the minority representation and they want females they want a ... and specifically for those reasons you know conservatives ... we like having people from all backgrounds but we just like having the best people\nOr identity politics is a is such a big factor on the left these days that they really get very excited about this stuff but the Florida races are going to be very very tight and and so tight that they're not wasting even a single day while they are getting slammed by category for hurricane\nTo take the ads or take the negative ads off the air so\nI think that gives you a sense of of where that all is\nAnd uh I I Do believe Scott's going to pull it out but you guys gonna make are going to make a close\nVery close\nOh I've I've got something by the way that I've been meaning to get to all week with you um and I just I've been waiting to have a night where you know I I'd have the time to read it and we can

Fox News this storm is gone to clean up under way in the Florida Panhandle one day after hurricane Michael made landfall Fox is the fact of what has more lively\nAnd he never came out and after a few hours she called a a contact and she was worried and then the police got involved\nAnd what's happened since then\nIs a ... information's come out that a team of about fifty teen hit men\nAre who were believed to be carrying Saudi diplomatic passports arrived onto private jets some of them are from NBS is personal security detail according to press reports including one who has an expertise in autopsies\nYeah you can imagine\nAnd the stories that were reading right now not entirely confirmed for the stories that reading involve a brutal murder of ... I I haven't read yet how but I I Would guess they probably you know tortured him and beat him to death\nA brutal murderer and then just remembering his body putting his body parts into bags and disposing of them in fact one Mideast base paper although it's\nIt's funded by the country so it's you know take it with a grain of salt one Mideast based paper claim they have a source telling them that the body parts of ... so the anti Saudi journalist that's been murder that's missing has now turned into this global story is body parts may be buried in\nThe residents of the consul general of er of Saudi Arabia in Turkey so this guy's centuries of senior Saudi official may may have these body parts barriers backyard\nAnd this is crazy folks either this is if you read about this in a fiction\nNovel you'd say come on\nThat so that's so outrageous not only is this not you know this is not the kind of guy you can disappear\nAnd I and I want to get into a little bit of well what does that tell us about the Saudi motivations are both the Saudis are saying what we'd expect which is of course you know they think that he left and they don't they don't they don't accept any responsibility for this nothing happened this is all crazy conspiracy theories you know you could assume all that\nUm but and then that'll give it some of the complicating factors here but the Turks have\nPretty good intelligence and police forces and plenty of surveillance cameras and other ways of figure out what went on here and for the Saudis to do this on Turkish soil instead of trying to lure ... back to Saudi Arabia if you went to Saudi ... we wouldn't you know he would have just disappeared and nobody would know\nSo they did this in Turkey a well keep in mind that a ... was a permanent resident of the U.S now he had gone into a a a self imposed a self imposed exile of sorts here in the states\nBut that the Saudis would do this show brazen and now you have all these different politicians you'll Lindsey Graham said there'll be hell to pay now and I like Lindsey now is you know hey I like Lindsey did the right thing and the Kavanaugh hearing I'm I've always been okay with Lindsey Graham but now I'm I'm pretty pro Lindsey\nBut people are saying is going to be held to pay\nA seems increasingly likely that the Saudis will just deny deny deny but the overwhelming weight of the evidence is that this was a a brutal\nBroad daylight you know ours assassination inside a diplomatic facility on another country's soil this is the kind of stuff that that you do cut off you know relations with a foreign country for because they believe that this was most likely ordered\nVery top of the Saudi Government or at least there was consent for given at the very top level is how to govern perhaps by NBS himself\nThis is crazy this does not happen and people will say oh by the Russians yeah the Russians have engaged in assassinations of critics and and but they they are tend to be ... former Russian nationals\nThey've done in the u._k. I Know but they've never done it in their former Russian nationals which this guy's a former Saudi national but as for Russian national and\nThey never do it in a diplomatic facility\nAnd they certainly wouldn't send multiple private jets with Russian officials I'm not saying that the the Russians are ethical for this they're just not so foolish as to do this but then you get to the ... the then you get to the book then you go to the point where you have to ask is hold on a second\nTo the Saudis do it this way to send an even stronger message I often tell you on this show and are upset in the past that you know sometimes burning\n... village sends an even stronger message you know we're burning down the whole village and not just one house obviously sends a stronger message too\nBut you don't have to burn down everything you can just make an example of one\nAnd here you have a very high profile critic Washington Post columnist who was writing about all of the\nReally what what is a mafia state I mean the Saudis or a mafia stayed with a religious veneer remembered Saudi Arabia is a is a clip docker see you know the ruling family has\nEnriched itself the tuna\nWho knows how many billions of I mean hundreds of billions of dollars over the course of of decades there's Saudi families incredibly rich and the Saudis are as you know very repressive goes all the way back to the unholy\nAlthough they would have thought it was holy alliance between the fundamentalist preacher\nOn the Arabian Peninsula even up to ... from the Eighteen century believe he was born in Seventy two I think he lived about Seventeen Ninety to ... or maybe Seventy eighty two so Eighteen century preacher who made this deal with the ... who were just warlords\nAnd that's how you get Saudi Arabia but they merge together this religious or this religious extremism which is known as ... but they they don't like that term they prefer ... Salah means the forefathers of the Muslim faith\nItself as it whether it's fundamentalism says it's Islamic fundamentalism\nAnd words law make you know liberalism texture wisdom although even that is kind of difficult to decipher because if you've ever read the Koran and there's a lot of 'em but they killed that they've they've killed this guy now and it's going to cause some major problems\nOn the international diplomatic see now I'll get into why and what the what the end result of all this will be in just a moment we'll talk more about this what looks to be most brazen high profile

spreading the word about the show and you use it among your friends and family to share your thoughts on everything that matters to you but\nWe've seen so much of the left wing bias at play in the last few years we know that Facebook and Google and these other massive social media enterprises\nHave all kinds of left wing conversational how shadow banning nonsense going on if you want to put a stop to that we've got a new site for you sniff the dot com\nMaybe dot com is a place where you can go and share whatever thoughts you want you don't have to worry about moderators administrators suppressing your freedom of expression totally free to join check it out for yourself\nUnfortunately we've seen at work in the conflict in Yemen where you've had thousands and thousands of civilians killed in these these airstrikes in a in a civil war that does not look like it's going to\nEnd anytime soon but we want the Saudis to be in the mix because we need the Saudis to be able to stare across the border at Iran and say you know don't\nDon't step out of line oh and we want the Saudis to be a counter balance because they are the primary Sunni Muslim force in the Mid East now and obviously the primary Iran I mean the primary Shia\nMuslim force in the Mid East is Iran so we we really do want this this balance of of powers or because otherwise we feel like we're going to be the ones that are working alone to try and box in Iranian proxies and and prevent a kind of Shia\nCrescent from becoming a realization that could be a very real strategic threat to Israel to us into our our interests more broadly so that's where I get to the I don't think we're going to do very much about this\nI don't think there's going to be a whole lot of interest in taking major actually see a lot of talk about this trumpet saying can make some very uncomfortable he doesn't like it but no administration I think would do all that much about this\nUh there won't be any judicial proceeding I don't think the Saudis would never extradite anybody under these circumstances to us they're not going to extradite people that were traveling under diplomatic passports to the Turkish authorities for a trial there\nAre an interesting so I Know that you won't hear I think on any other show ... has\n... is not it look he he was murdered it was terrible but just if you want a little more background on him he's actually very pro Muslim Brotherhood he's very pro Islamist he is not a liberal in the western sense of the term and an off in western journalists make this mistake they think that just because somebody\nEasy on board with the uh old school\nMideast strongman authoritarian regimes that they must be you know pro democracy pro women's rights in fact the show he was very opposed to democracy\nOr he wanted a I'm Sorry they're very opposed to liberalism\nYou saw democracy only as a means of instituting sharia um he was somebody that that believed in using the Democratic process to achieve theocracy whereas what you have in Saudi Arabia is essentially Salafis and without elections he wanted Salafis them but\nPeople voting art first\nAs you know once you get to that uh once you get to that place of of having a theocracy elections tend not to last very long in any meaningful way because you don't have the civil society below them to allow for the kind of conversation that would result in democratic process he's been meeting for\nSo ... is not this liberal reformer that a lot of journalists you talking about not not at all but he was a critic of the Saudi regime and you know you have this geopolitical reality and then there's the another reality\nAnd I can say here but I can tell you that a lot of places you won't hear much criticism of this you won't hear it talked about as a story even the Saudis have\nReally spent a tremendous amount of money investing in media in this country\nMajor corporations they're huge shareholders and major corporations\nAnd they also have invested a tremendous amount in some of our most prestigious universities so they have an influence in cultural and information based institutions here that allows them to mute criticism\nAnd that's something that we should all be aware of the Saudis have bought into American American media in ways that lets them call the shots and you won't hear talked about 'cause they're calling a lot of shots\nThey've written very very big checks and are not shy about throwing their weight around on these issues so\nKeep that in mind because when you look at what's going on with Saudi and you look
