establishing a new president\nReid didn't change the Senate rules he instituted the new precedent for breaking filibusters on all nominations except the Supreme Court Reid's decision incensed

of all of his exploits and appreciate you being there every time I'm here filling in for thank you very much my friends are\nA lot going on I Want to bring something up I was talking about uh just before the break\nI was talking about one of the sponsors of this program ...\nAnd it's a company that has a new social media platform and I think it's really important especially when we see what's going on\nOn social media it's been\nThat one of the brighter people on social media who happens to be a conservative has been silent some talking about James Woods James Woods has over a million followers and Twitter has told him he cannot come back on line\nUnless she removes something he posted he posted the comedic me him and he even said\nThis basically is a joke but they told them unless he deletes it he's not allowed back on the format\nAnd I thought wow this is a publicly traded company and and then I thought well maybe just maybe they're out there making sure that they apply the same\nKind of standards of principles to everybody who's on Twitter and I looked at and I saw the horrific thing they're Rosie o'donald posted after\nLindsey Graham went after the Democrats on the Judiciary Committee and called them out for what they were doing how they were destroying judge Kavanaugh\nAnd how they were actually make it impossible for anyone to want to be\nWell a Supreme Court justice God Knows what else will be affected by this attack on a good man but Rosie O'Donnell tweeted out and I have to um\nHave to delete some of the things she said because they can't say I'm On the radio\nShe said after you you closeted idiot\nThis is the patriarchy exposed\nThis is reality deal with it no Kavanaugh's confirmation not my president well Rosie O'Donnell put that out there and went after Lindsey Graham and she's basically here's a gay woman who's making an\nAllegation that Lindsey Graham is a closeted homosexual how\nIs that allowed how is that not considered hate speech\nHow does that not considered to be over the line by the gods of Twitter how Twitter how explain I guess if you're a liberal you can say just about anything\nI guess if you're a person on the other side of the aisle it's okay to smear somebody for example a Bill Maher did the same thing Bill Maher on his show this past weekend after Lindsey Graham gave his fiery speech supporting judge Kavanaugh\nThis was on television this weekend and appeared all over Twitter\nYou know what to bad is this is a fine [noise]\nThat from can either find people like him or make him ... ... ... am by strong stabilizing influence your boyfriend because he is [noise]\nSo now bill Marr has smeared Lindsey Graham and here's also smeared John McCain all in in Seventeen Seconds on his show\nHow is this a loud and don't even get me started on what senator now why did attacking Kavanaugh Saturday Night live attacking Kavanaugh in Graham\nAnd the entire process is all about any means necessary to tear down this nominee but I don't understand how one social media platform is allowed to\nSingle handedly silence conservative it's I've been shadow band if I put a post on my Twitter account at stumped for and if you will\nAnd I include a reference to a gun or a firearm is uniformly relegated to the ash sheet of Twitter shadow banning\nI'm shoved off into the abyss and not given the opportunity to let my audience read it but if I take out the word gun or a firearm and put in something like banana instantly it's available to everybody\nI Know it sounds paranoid but it it's true\nSo how is this a loud how's this even allowed to happen\nWell I think we've lost their minds we have given\nEvery opportunity to be offensive to the left and zero to be offensive from the right and maybe it's time we all stood up and looked at some of our folks in their alternative to these other social media platforms\nI'm just saying oh I don't get me started on Cathy Griffin\nKathy Griffin also went after Lindsey Graham and called Lindsey Graham ms Lindsey Graham and John Lennon overt CNN additionally said that Lindsey Graham had the vapors something usually attributed to a woman in the south\nSo Don Lemon Kathy Griffin Rosie O'Donnell and Bill Maher you can all make jokes that\nImpugn a man's heterosexuality or Monica man and yet you are the people living in the universe it seems like the people in the universe
