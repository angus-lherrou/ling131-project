{"month": "11", "state": "MA", "station": "WHYN", "content": "I mean I don't think they really want to go down this road I also think that looking at ethnicity and when it comes to mass shootings is is a an irrelevant and and really pointless exercise but they'll laugh like to do this because I think of us all based upon our or ethnicity as as a as an essential part of identity\nOr whether we agree with that or or not um\nThen you get a ... a ... or to make this brief uh that that the GED torch mafia a moron from Charlottesville\nIt's talked about so much in the media just goes to show you that they can't find where where's there's these white nationalist I'm always hearing about a month and they don't exist and say how many are there really very very few\nAnd to refer to that as a rise of a real terrorism in the country and that's the biggest terrorist threat and people like that are people like this pipe bomber guy uh we don't have the TSA because of the pipe bomb or we don't have the national counterterrorism center\nInsanity that that I'm Talking about so it is just is just while she was a while to see this happening and\nYou know that then there's also what I see from our own side and you know I've very frustrated with us today but not not surprising at all [noise]\nYeah I Know he's not running anymore but you'd think that after all the time it's been a concern circles and here's here's Paul Ryan not a constitutional scholar not a lawyer but then again neither am I but I seem to know more about this and\nPaul Ryan among many other things in a more about the Paul Ryan a\nBut here's what he says that the fourteenth amendment just one this is a very clear political and yes partisan issue right before the election we can count on ... on on Paul Ryan speaker of the house to come forward and this is what he does play\nYou cannot and ship with an executive order we didn't\nLike it when Obama tried changing immigration laws ... current and following the plain text of the constitution and I think in this case the fourteenth amendment pretty clear [noise]\nUm and that would involve a very very lengthy constitutional process where we obviously totally agree with President [noise] getting at the root issue here which is among check illegal immigration\nThe fourteenth amendment is not clear in that\nThe language when you look at the language leaves open room right subject to the jurisdiction thereof as we've been\nDiscussing if your subject to a foreign ... is a foreign country can say hand that then that guy back over to us and we'd go okay he's yours\nWhich which jurisdiction as you really subject to ... I mean you know this is where he started to get it okay well on a second\nAnd and also you know as an American when you're traveling in a foreign country if you're an American or you're traveling in France and and you're like hey I don't want to pay any more American taxes which you have to do when you live abroad by the way we do that in this country\nThey don't do it in many other countries are ... and you say well I'm only subject of French jurisdiction now because I'm On French soil a French French joy on French soil\nAh I'm always subject to do their jurisdiction we would say no you're subject to our jurisdiction so you're an American citizen I saw a jurisdiction has not just about geography\nAnd that's where this sketch where that's where this gets more complicated and there are instances already of where you could be born on us soil and you could even be here legally but you would not be a citizen I in the case of the sons of the adult us diplomats were born here they maintain their own nationality their own citizenship\nSo that's\nA place where there's no clarity often the courts and just for Paul Ryan to pretend that he's opposed to legal immigration when he's pro DACA he's pro this huge huge increases in guest worker programs and has just been so wimpy end immigration for so long and\nFor him when he's not running again to come out now and say this and just get a kick in the ... to the G O P side I got to say I was I was pleased\nThat at least at least Trump was was willing to call him out on this one I mean it was good to see that are here you go Paul Ryan is from Donald Trump quote Paul Ryan should be focusing on old and a majority rather than giving his opinions about birthright citizenship something he knows nothing about\nOur new Republican majority will work on this closing immigration loopholes and securing\nOur border President Trump is completely right I'm\nPaul right look it's one thing that ... to come out and say look there's there's a lack of clarity on this and you know we the courts need to take this up and it it is an important issue\nBut that's not what he said he said you know it's pretty obvious that the left is right here that yeah that's right we want people to show up and go and stay in maternity hotel or whatever it's called birth hotels whatever that is when you show up and have a baby when you're a foreigner and the whole point is to get citizenship here\nAnd you know birth tourism ...\nThat's clearly not with all that but you know Ryan just can't help themselves I he's the guy who clearly has all oh gee shocks\nI I think he is much more about Paul Ryan than he is about the party there I say and and that brings it back to how I don't accept this separation\nOf party and country 'cause I think that the Republican Party is better for the country therefore I support the Republican Party\nIt's eight other bringing back to that formulation for a moment and then I just have one other thing here for you I Want you to hear this is Joe Donnelly who's a who's running in the Indiana representative a or in the offender other Joe Donnelly here's what he just said during the during the debate yesterday this is incredible liquid one\nWe want everybody to have a chance in Indiana and in America and my officers reflect that both on the campaign side and on the Senate side or state director is Indian American\nBut he does an amazing job\nOr director of all constituent services she's African American\nBut she doesn't even more incredible job than you could ever imagine [laughter]\nWhat the heck is this guy said I mean\nCould you imagine if a Republican said I Know you misspoke but while the other hey a producer Mike you there\nOh All right well ... reminds you of cigarette break up a DJ brand it I just won't let you know that uh you're\nOh you're oh you're a white guy but you're pretty good at your job as what you do that doesn't sound like much of a complement does it bread banks I think\nI mean granted you you your your name is Brenda you're a white dude but you'd be amazed at how good you are at running the board\nShow people would be like her\nYeah exactly so this is what you get this this is the Democrats the best and the brightest bugs the Democrat Party Senator Joe and Joe Donnelly this is this is what the other side of results for

because when it comes to the place would never saw\nThe way they're more in this position and the first places because Democrats failed to come to the table staff failed to work with this president and pass legislation that helps protect our country that helps protect the citizens of America because they do not want to secure our borders they do not want to have a law and order a country\nThat the reason that we're in this predicament is because Democrats in Congress had failed to do their job and the president's going to look at any way possible that he can find\nA legally unconstitutionally that to make sure that we're doing everything we can this has been a long\nStanding debate there's good faith arguments on both sides so natural reading of this amendment which seemed to support unlimited birthright citizenship but the history\nThe tech some of the rafters tend to go the other way and courts view clauses like this has having meaning they don't just to

Huckabee Sanders I'm with her or the Democrats they can't have it both ways that can't be the law's the law and then be well but we're not going to do and cheering for Spanish let's not be meaner let's not separate families and all of us you can have it both ways\nAnd they wouldn't have it both ways with immigration all the time they want to say they want a strong border but they don't want to enforce the law when it comes to people illegally crossing the border\nThey say they want an orderly immigration system but they don't want to do interior enforcement is that there should be consequences violating the law but they don't want them to get prosecuted hints at home or anything else\nRight so you know this is classic and then with the constitutional aspect to it I have to say\nThe only thing that amuses me more than media lives discovering the constitution is what media lips discovered the Bible\nYou know and you know that's when all of a sudden you hear Corinthians to

where you see that they they have\nNo actual principle that they are protecting or that there there are trying to Institute here because they're they're very literal list in a interpretation of this clause\nLet's understand is it's just not it's not clear what that means and also to take a literal interpretation of the constitution also takes into account what was it meant to mean at the time right this is where a liberal does do the right to bear arms you could have ... million in Brussels that's why we said arms\nYes at the time it wasn't a are Fifteen it was markets but guess what it is arms and that's why it leaves it leaves open for what arms were then what arms are now\nAh and that's why the press the press has any dissemination of information the press is not an actual printing press and the jurisdiction there oh okay well what does that exactly mean what does that mean\nBased upon the understanding at the time and what they were trying to achieve with this amendment with the fourteenth amendment\nRemedies that the Obama administration\nUm first of all there's all this there's all this rewriting of history now about what the Democrats have been doing an immigration for the last Twenty years and here's a here's a great example of of of that you have Harry Reid\nOkay this is even before that this was Nineteen Ninety three but this is Harry Reid who was among the most

in Central America [noise]\nThey are by human traffickers who you need to know have no regard for human life you\nKnow or the more information we're getting\nOn all of this the more information we have on this caravan more obvious it becomes the the yeah that's right there are people behind this there are people who are involved in organizing and funding and and pushing this whole thing forward\n... literally and figuratively 'em and you know what am I been saying all along that there's this talking point\nOr there are thousands of miles away and now they're dying hundred and Ninety nine miles away you know\nThis was ridiculous because\nWhat we're already seeing now is according to NBC News an hour ago oh that's right now that they've assembled and gotten all this attention they're not planning on walking the whole way\nThey've advanced two hundred and fifty miles into Mexico and you have them asking quote for buses weary Margaret caravan residents of Mexico asks for buses that's right\nGot about four thousand\nFour thousand people saying that you know they want buses and organizers oh that's right it's not an organized event my friends but they are organizers somehow\nThey got organizers who are trying to get all these buses to materialize and get this whole thing going and\nWe're supposed to believe that there's that this is just all spontaneous this just came together\nBecause there's really there's really nothing in it beyond that there's only two of beyond that\nIs just nuts it's just nuts and there's such nastiness out\nThere right now about Trump's sending\nMore troops to the border again they're saying oh it's political theater it's political theater well in the military is not going to engage in a military sense the military just as they would use you know when we send National Guard or when we when we have military that assist\nIn a natural disaster zone no one stupid enough to sue all what we're going to do ... new houses that have been blown down like no\nYour militaries there to help to assist in whatever way they can because the interests of the nation and and it's people or the interest of the United states military\nAnd ... this is the commander in chief taking it upon himself to try and assist or border patrol and it's also a show of seriousness it's also meant to say hey you know whatever we can do we will do and ...\nWe want border patrol the feel like they have the full backing in support of the federal government which probably would not even not have one of the Obama administration did not have one of the Bush administration the Bush years are bad on the border\nYou heard it here if you've never heard of before you probably heard me say though but the bushes were battling borders or George W was he was he was really a McCain conservative in many ways I mean he was a squishy\nOn on some of these very weak on border issues and an immigration issues but we just didn't pay much attention to it because we you know have the really existential fight against radical Islamic terrorism going on\nBut I I think that the president is from a purely political respect making the right choices you're to show the difference what is the difference when it comes to immigration between the Democrats and Republicans and the Democrats\nDon't want to fix anything they want to legalize more and more people that don't want the laws to be enforced they don't want a system that privileges of those who will bring special skills and be a more easily able to contribute to the economy in a net positive what they don't want any of that\nOverall accents or\nShe's even like well you know it's hard to be dispassionate when the White House as being aggressive against us and raising spectra violence against us you know it's not hard for you to beat a dispassionate stop being a bunch of babies stop being a bunch of cry babies\nYou know at some acting like because people at Trump rallies yell mean thanks to you every conservative I Know has been who's in media has been getting\nA horrible things centered them set about them death threats all kinds of and some of them actually get assaulted and attacked\nI can think of prominent conservatives being physically assaulted in the you know Ann Coulter was was attacked giving a speech once on camera you know people have actually been ... doesn't happen lives lives don't get it get to live lives when they're giving speeches don't get attacked\nIt's just not the same it's not the same mentality out there right now you know the Trump people see this is really the difference that I Know they're gonna say oh but what about the Trump support and the guy was a media and their maniacs can support and you know anyone in anything\nI mean we hear very little about the family Research Council shooter for example but he was all about you know the MSNBC talking points and and one that you wanted to kill people who were\nPro life and and pro traditional family or you know how a lot of you're probably the clock when even talking about if you go and do a you know do a quick Google Search on that you'll be like wow this guy was a left wing terrorist\nBut no one ever refers to him that way he was that's what he was he was he left for any and he actually ...\nSo it wasn't it wasn't just an attempted something or it wasn't just sending in threats he actually took the kind of like the Bernie Sanders shooter who didn't try to\nShow up at a baseball field but got caught on the way or something got there in shock people and almost killed them very nearly killed these beliefs so but Stewart understands this this dynamic and now now look I Am a big\nCritic of the whole John Stewart clown nose on clown nose off thing it's like you know it's like ... I'm Down to it I'm all funny on ... and then\nOh well now let me lecture you all on the constitution and my Christiana mom poor impression voice it's like no if you want to engage in political issues you have to be willing to when you have to be willing to defend them as as a serious person and not hide behind oh man I just have\nI just have fake puppets going into my show beforehand you know it's all just a big joke man that's dishonest and Stuart's done lots of that\nYou know shows all jokes and then he has on a serious guest and if it's a conservative he tries to drill them and if it's a a liberal it's all ... joke joke the rights so dumb ha ha and that was what he did I mean he really just\nTook what you already have in mainstream media a step further the mainstream media is an echo chamber for left wing beliefs in ideology and what it does is create a forum and this is whether you're reading the pages of the New York times or watching CNN we're liberal ideas when\nThat's the whole point that's the whole purpose yes they give you information you know yes there is reporting all others reporting and you know breaking news and all this but the live idea always comes out on top\nAnd ... the last what those\nOutlets do to really serve their audiences and have a loyal audience because people want that they want to believe that want to believe that their side is is is winning but the way that the left does it as dishonest they don't say we're labs your idea they say this is just reality\nThis is just the truth and that's why I say that CNN for example long tours liberalism through a false prism of neutrality\nAnd that's the secret sauce behind what the mainstream media in particular has been doing for a very long time oh no we're not liberal\nWe're just we're just the facts man CNN's apple and banana slogan no that's nonsense\nThey should just say yeah we're we're in a package of the DNC we believe in the Democratic party we're going to bring your news but we're going to give it to you for a Democrat perspective that would be honest instead they're liars they're liars tapper liar\nBlitzer wired I mean what they're doing is they live on a regular basis Cooper all ... all of them I mean Donald limited uh like a whole other well that's a whole other level but\nYou know he's right about the stewards right about the narcissism point and it's so clear and quite honestly I think it's pretty obvious I don't think the steward has come upon some bit of brilliant year yeah the narcissism is what\nThe narcissism is what the Trump taps into of cars look he understands\nWith big egos Trump is a very very big ego we I don't think we have to dance around that Trump is a very typical guy\nHe's also the leader of the free world and pulled off the most incredible election victory that we will ever see ever there's there's never going to be anything like that you saw the most unbelievable election of your lifetime I saw of my lifetime that's it there's nothing that's ever going to be like that\nBecause even if something else is kind of like in the future will be like well remember that time when Trump did that thing that nobody believed could happen so I think the guy is kind of earn the right to have a bit of a you know you got to earn your ego I think that's an important thing for everyone to remember and then you know\nBe humble too but that's one part that I don't think we're going to too much from a from Trump but nonetheless he understands people's oversized egos and and this is where the media just really has no they have no response whatsoever there's there's nothing they can come up with as an answer because it's so once you get older you go oh yeah that's right\nWhy is everyone else press briefing about Jim Acosta wires every a criticism of CNN by the president of a threat to our democracy\nBecause these people have really over in ...\nIt senses of their importance let me tell you this and you know you're the Serbian all the time I Am lucky to be in this business and I'm Better at this than\nA vast majority of people were in the business and I don't say that to be a modest and just being object and being honest with you know very few people can carry a three hour a day scripted unscripted rather radio show very very few people can really do that um but that's not to say that I also don't ... I Am lucky\nI Am lucky to be able to do this for a living I'm lucky that this is my job this is my job is just my calling in my career because of all of you who listen to the show\nYou are the reason that I can do this and it was only through my service my constant effort to meet the expectations and the information or entertainment\nOr needs of this wonderful audience all of you listening that I'm able to do this but I I have no expectation that oh you know I'm American\nBooks extra or else of course not right that that's just that's just silly that's just nonsense\nBut do you see that a lot of these other big journal type said that some of these big outlets they really think oh my gosh without us talk of the republic ... probably be better off that the real that's more of a Trump calls them out because when they get so upset because they probably would be a you know easier without some of these out what's out\nThere I think some of them do act in bad faith and do spread misinformation and propaganda and and don't have a good ethos and an artful of honest people and I mean some of the big the biggest players in the space\nIt was a secret subpoenas for Trump they may say well I guess maybe there is something to that you know I'm actually going to go for the Democrat last minute I think I'm going to cast my vote for the tight election I'm not really sure and you know I I Believe the rhetoric about healthcare and pre existing conditions at all that stuff I Want to go the Democrats remember how upset they got\nThe media about coal me saying that they were reopening Hillary's email investigation whatever that was\nA couple of weeks before the election remember how just oh my daughter was little turtles so unfair\nI think that they would feel completely justified\nIn what is essentially a bad the leak story like this meant to create the perception that there's more to the Russia collusion narrative than there is I I think that that ... you know that's something that could very well of of that but\nI you know I haven't spoken much about this uh this is ... I think there's nothing that only journalist really care about but I'll just give me the quick in the quick and dirty on it\nSo there was a a guy in charge of the gateway pundits\nOh whose name is actually is scraping me right now but he uh what is this guy's name again\nI'd never heard of him before Jacob wool a twenty year old a twenty year old for rights Internet personality who was written for the gateway punted\nUm he\nAllegedly tried to entice a woman to claim that Mueller and sexually harassed her in the most ham fisted stupid ridiculous [noise] kinda transparently obvious thing imaginable\nBasically was offering women money to lie about Mueller was going to get a report on the allegations are what I don't think he understood is that of all the people that you would kind of mess with right now if you go that's I don't care who you are fake\nSexual assault or fake structural rationalizations were despicable I don't care who we are talking about\nWe don't lie about people we get them on what they did or you know what they are guilty of we never should get people anyone any hope somebody leveled fake\nSexual harassment allegations against Hillary why I wouldn't want that that's not okay I wouldn't be okay with that we can get her own all the other crimes she's committed but you don't ever\nPut fake stuff out there but this gay we pointed guy or he writes for the gateway pond is he a looks like he tried to entice somebody to live out more and uh that is not a bear that I Would poke let me tell you for all the nonsense about Russia collusion how it's going nowhere\nMowers a federal prosecutor special counsel low power I Would not miss what\nFor me a message from the national Highway Traffic Safety Administration the bucks\nX ... weeknight starting at seven on news radio five sixty WHYY end [noise]\nShe's holding the line for America bugs the thing is that\nWe often talk about how the media is not to be\nTrusted we often sometimes discuss owning the lives of got somebody you could\nSay has expertise in both of these matters joining us now amber ... with a she is a a writer at\nThe Daily Caller she's the media and breaking news editor ever are going to have you on the show\nThank you so much for having me buck\nAll right let's first talk ... I Know you spoke at American University so you went into the campus gauntlet recently\nAnd had to deal with all\nAll that craziness and there was even a little bit of backlash after you spoke but before we get to that just told me a little bit about some of the\nThe hateful rhetoric that used against Trump in your piece\nDefinitely so I decided to take a look into this because the media has of course\nThen blaming Trump's rhetoric for the recent on scores of hate crimes including the hype on such a democratic officials\nAnd then on the anti Semitic attack on synagogue in Pittsburgh and I thought to myself I've been covering the media for about a year and a half now and I can let things off the top of my head that they've said about ... that are just shameful\nAnd in some cases even violent so on this list you'll find things like uh Nicole walls and MSNBC saying that she wants to ring White House press secretary Sarah Sanders his neck you how to CNN gas a jet yesterday\nSaying that she believes Trump has I'm radicalized more people than ISIS which is a literal terror group that has a hundred thousand numbers\nI and just the list goes on and on Rick Wilson threatened to cut a channel is on CNN like a fish so likely to the media is if you're going to blame that Trump's rhetoric for insight that they need to take a look in the near and think about the things that you're saying is well\nIt is an amazing phenomenon to obscene in the last couple of weeks and we've been talking about it a lot on\nThe show that there's a there's kind of a refrain of dealing when it comes to the media that you know they basically just saying the conservatives hey evil fascist races terrorists why don't we all just stop using mean words\nThat's exactly right there [laughter] they a lot and I think it was a perfect example of how the media talks about the other side I'm On Monday Night on his show he urged not to demonize people\nAnd then immediately demonize people saying that white people are responsible for terrorism in this country in the literal faint brat so these people they talk about respecting the other side and rationing down discourse in being respectful but they're often the worst offenders\nNow tell me about your foray into a into a campus speech here in the swamp area recently it got got quite a bit of bugs\nYeah it got pretty sloppy so I spoke at American University\nAnd I was talking about due process on specifically in the air as me too and of course the Kavanaugh hearings that took place several weeks ago\nWhere he was accused of gang rape of all things and as soon as the event with announced probably within thirty minutes to an hour students started posting on social media about how they were going to try to shut down the beach\nThey had a plan state space\nTo physically either themselves from what I was going to stay on and then after the at that that group that invited me young Americans for elaborate actually denounced might talk altogether\nAnd said that I was being inflammatory by defending the content of speech and talking about it on social media\nSo all around this is just another example of how college campuses nowadays um have no interest in listening to opposing view points on and when they do have to listen to opposing viewpoint say without an act like children and colleges are in a place anymore where dissent is a welcomed and where people like a ...\nNow place where people have to be physically shielded from anything they disagree with\nAnd I got to say this is the first time I've heard of the the\nConservative group kind of back stabbing the conservative who's been invited on campus that that's a bit of a weird wrinkle\n[noise] yeah I certainly was not expecting that is the first I've heard of it as well on and I was definitely disappointed because\nThese people expect conservative ideas to win out on campus and they have to be willing to defend them and just by nature at twenty to thirty students shelling out to protest you that they immediately back down and through the under the bus\nVery very weak sauce I got to say [laughter] yeah I suspect conservatives talk yeah expected jurors out of the tobacco to especially on campus about this stuff because uh you know I guess they wanted to get invited to the\nStigma signify party or something you want to go to the ... those are everywhere else working on this week and then he goes to send your sides obviously the election but what else are we going to be seen you're right about the color", "year": "2018", "show_name": "The Buck Sexton Show", "city": "Springfield", "day": "01"}
