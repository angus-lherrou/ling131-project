I think we've got a winner\nIn Julie or your father or your coffee\nWho I did not know this or had been fired from Politico for a tweet suggesting that the president commits incest and she's very coarse language not just as the thoughts disgusting but the president commits incest with his own daughter\nThat's that's true political head on stuff yeah she got fired because I guess even for the

times a day which just you know enough we get it or\nYou know this is a guy though who is either will get very gets very aggressive with conservatives on a regular basis gets very aggressive with other people around the president calls them alcohol them for being liars and all that he has the off on a show and does not stop her\nOr challenged her at all when she says the following yesterday played with one\nYou know this past that at one of the things that he really launched his presidential run on is talking about Islamic rattle radicalization and\nThis president has radicalized so many more people than I ever did I mean the way he talks the way the way that is that's just it it's a hot the way the way they say a allows the way he ...\nYeah that's right presidents radicalized more people than ISIS now now I I Know that there's there's some people who might say hold on a second book you know if you're if you think that being a conservative as radical and they tried to rationalize isn't some way but none of what she just did there\nWas to compare the president and therefore his supporters who she says have been radicalized 'cause\nSo far has only been one radical that we know of who's actually been violent who's a Trump supporter one out of sixty three million that voted for Trump never mind those who didn't vote for him I think he's great there's a lot of those do\nYou got one and we know\nWe don't have people run around in the streets like we do with anti for large numbers causing mayhem and the name of Trump people that's all of us\nWe don't have anybody who's actually harmed and come very close to assassinate as being a a a member of the opposing party as we do with these deep Scully shooter Don Lemon treated out today that he can't even imagine a Democrat being violent\nSteve ... retreated that just with these eyes looking up at the sky like are you kidding me Don Lemon multimillionaire newsman image also Trump is right he's just not just not very smart\nAnd he's very insecure about that because he's just not it's not very smart but\nYou know you look at the way that this conversation happens and and and the way that the left tries to frame it and you know you off a\nDecides that ... whatever she decides it the way to get attention here and she succeeded in that regard you should just go even crazier than everybody else\nThe Islamic state ran a totalitarian caliphate for a few years that in Slade millions of people that engaged in massive kidnapping torture and rape operations as a function of of war and policy like they did that systematically\nA murder or\nAt least tens of thousands probably hundreds of thousands of people if you were to really kind of a mass graves horrific televised torture executions\nAnd she thinks it's she thinks that it's in any way rational and reasonable to compare Trump and his radicalized supporters to the Islamic state in in any context\nNow the only defense that I can come up with for for your coffee here\nAnd she's indefensible but I mean the only way that you could really try to explain this as well there are so many people on the left that casually\nCompare Trump to Hitler at this point casually compare Trump to you know the third Reich and uh and and on and say that there's all this this rise of white nationalism and not season that's occurred under Trump\nMother you know I remember when Brock Obama was president and there were all these\nAll these stories from the uh you know the Southern Poverty Law Center on these other groups all there is this terrible rise of white nationals group because of Obama\nAnd nothing happened for eight years in the white nationalist there's like fifty losers no one pays attention to really or just pathetic and want it and want attention you know the white nationalist are really the equivalent of like the Westboro Baptist church\nBut the media makes it out to be discouraged or coming for us and they're going to take over everything\nOr just delusional ... well it's not even to the ... they're really cynical because this served their interest their interest is to make a white nationalist seeing what they are much bigger than they are much more\nMenacing than they are because that's a means of of attacking Trump\nBut yeah you off he came back after that break and said that you know she got a little too you know Jake Tapper must have in the brick ... control and I'm sure Guns Germs and did you can't\nMuch cancer that with the President's Day and we're going to keep pretending remember this isn't even on a quote opinion show trapper runs [laughter] it's laughable but to ever run by a straight news show\nWhich is a joke and it's just a total joke but\nYou know if you were honest about what you'll notice how much less go after Mao and O'Donnell and you know I even I even had a a\nPretty ...

I'm just a nonpartisan journalist brigade there are a bunch of frauds\nTappers leader of the pack I mean Cooper's right there with them but just frauds\nAnd what they do every day uh and uh you

seeing as well no actually they're very few relatively speaking very very few\nSites where a vast majority of Internet activities occurring and if you control those nodes of activity and the way that speech you shared all those places Facebook Google Twitter then you have an enormous amount of control of conversation I mean it's really like we've gone back to\nThe Nineteen sixties the Nineteen seventies when there were only a handful of channels in the broadcast news networks were the only news and whatever they decided was was what people thought reality was\nUm but this idea that that Silicon Valley or it has has these\nPeople who haven't remembered Google's model used to be don't be evil\nWhich is I've always thought I always thought that was very telling because if that has to be

Brooklyn barber slash arches no cocktail maker or you know he talked about the Palo Alto mafia and the censorship of conservatives who started this on on CBS this morning\nThese are real things that are happening and it ... it reminds me of how at a place like CBS or NBC back in the day they didn't think they were biased\nAnd that was the really the the main underlying point and Bernie Goldberg who work at CBS for a long time then became more of a Fox News staple in a conservative\nBut you know the the part of this the liberals didn't understand was that they thought that they were being objective\nThey were so biased as to be in capable of understanding and accepting the degree of bias in their journalism which is a whole level right it's it's one adult level beyond it's one thing to

driving in a vehicle and actually hurt them and\nThen he can still flee the scene on a skateboard my friend do think that's not possible\n[laughter] either way whatever happens whatever the cops but the police report it was all I remember that but it was a lie\nThere you go to ... always lie about things like that so do you have any races that you're looking at a that you think are\nWe're we're you're expecting the Republican to over perform expectations up to this point or you know who do you really let me at best question for your ... who do you really care about seeing get the W. on election night was only a few days away but I mean who who if you get W by their names you can say it's a good day for freedom a good day for America\nRight so you have a of course you have Ted Cruz versus beta now what that is just position reporting twenty that was\nThe candidate a liberal journalist right now are writing the ... but he actually won ... shout out to the journal is right now that are that are already have that piece aired because they do is down by double digits in Texas or this just isn't going to happen for him also the president of course\nWaiting about baseball we're talking about as bad hair day there that was done intentionally to send a message\nTo white nationalist these our dog whistles at this point in their ... harms\nFrom at a comment politic trope tend to follow him everywhere\nHe has an obligation to try to read us up much of this tribalism and I think what he's done and I'm over the course of the last few years is helps foment this\nPresident has not been dabbling in elimination his rhetoric at some point she doesn't dog whistle continues as megaphones to tell these tribes that they belong to him and this is waiting to violence\nDirectly at the same so how do you marry the situation with the president last week says he's a national audience do say white nationalists to that he does have to take some responsibility for the type of races bio climate that we find ourselves in\nThe president's obviously races there's obviously demagogues you can do that is I'm ... stokes a national ... this is all the left\nReally has by the way at the national level for why you should vote for Democrats Trump is so terrible Trump is such an awful person and what they don't seem to understand is how much that then factors in to the other side beating our sides unwillingness to\nChange any of our tactics they're not trying to convince us\nThey are trying to strong arm us into abandoning trumpeter bending the movement they're not making good arguments they're engaging in moral blackmail\nWhy would anybody who's really thinking about the issues and thinking about what affect them and their day to day lives\nWhy would they listen to one that they're not even saying hey let's have a bigger European style social welfare state with free college and free healthcare now and as you know there's no such thing as free so it's really\nA ... you know state\nPaid for health care and they pay for college which means you pay for it ration of how much who\nAnd then let the may ... of the bureaucracy get unleashed in terms of price and and the distribution care and everything else but you're not even hearing them make a real picture about any of this\nThis is where we are the Democrats I think had been anticipating either a bad economy right a ... a downturn economy right before the election war they were anticipating that people would become\nShow beaten down by the anti Trump rhetoric and all this stuff about racism and racist Republicans in the show terrible not show up all that stuff they really thought\nThat that would be enough I think to turn the tables against Trump but they don't understand is by doing that\nThey're actually making the case 'cause there's only some people were going to be persuaded right you're you're never going to you're not going to turn the tables with some Magana hat wearing Trump early stage true believer many of whom listen to the show and high fives well if you are seeing a political movement that Ninety five percent of the professional political clout\nI had no idea what's happening until basically at at at already occurred on election day right so you guys thought Ninety five percent of the professional political elites did not\nBut you're obviously not going to change your mind based on what they said no matter no matter what right I mean 'cause you see the result but I'm Talking about if this is really a function of the persuadable going into this midterm election a few days right we're we're a week away\nFrom finding out who controls the Senate who controls the house that has profound implications for certainly the next two years a lot of them it's not the most important election of our lifetime that that's not true okay that'd be ... and it's not what that\nIs twenty twenty gonna be the most important election would probably be the second most important election of my lifetime because I think the most important was twenty six feet\nSo twenty twenty will probably be the second most important I don't think you're ever going to outdo twenty sixteen but you know obviously every election really matters and and the next two years or the tone will be set\nIn terms of legislation and what the government's going to do by how this midterm shakes out and that's why I just think it's so noticeable but Democrats aren't even at the at the national level they're trying to do this thing and every different race will do they're trying to run a good candidate\nFor the district right or a good candidate in that state if it's kind of a purple state so they have these people that are a little centrist on some issues it's like the Joe Manchin affect\nHow is Joe Manchin even a Democrat 'cause he likes unions\nYou know you look at it because he's pro worker I mean Trump is pro worker so you know you get some of these people who are Democrats who might as well be Republicans there's a few of those but much more common was on the left or people that are pretending to be\nA more centrist than they will vote to sexually fool the voters and then get in bed with the Democrats later I mean that that the more common tactic that's much more likely to be or what you see happening and and that's why it's either a local local media markets stuff about\nHow protecting protecting preexisting conditions in Obamacare and that's what this is all about but at the national level all you're hearing you get base turnout molesters trumpet Trump is a racist he's terrible\nAnd you know they're just they're never going to stop so that's why whenever they make it sound like oh if only Trump would only job would want what stopped being Trump and you'll like him this is nonsense words are based on a mentioned twenty twenty and how will be the second most important election of of my lifetime or I like what Trump is to say about this last night and Laura Ingraham show a place that\nSo far I like 'em all I don't see anybody not and should they shut down\nAll I could to let me very happy with Hillary I like 'em all [laughter] I don't see anybody that I wouldn't enjoy running against\nYou know the truth is that is the truth\nIs nobody right now that Trump looks at across the aisle things oh wow I don't know if I can hand\nI think that person might have the you know the magic formula to beat me oh wow you know I don't know\nThis is nobody there's nobody that's even close\nI the only one who you think maybe it was enough of a wild card that it'll be interesting is Bernie Sanders and I think what people figure out more about the more people know about Bernie Sanders policies at the national level the less they're going to like

think always somehow gets or other pushed aside because the politics or maybe there's just some some on his confusion on the part of those who are trying to get a handle on this epidemic\nBut we always hear that it's the priest gets prescription drugs that are pushing this epidemic for what you're telling me\n... it's it's really that these are similar to prescription drugs but there are being obtained illegally and being made illegally so ... is is that an accurate read of what's going on here because it is being made in ...\nMexico is obviously they're not being filtered through Pfizer and then sold via legitimate pharmacies to people in the streets this is just cutting out visor as if from the picture in or any drug company entirely from those\nWho are we so we know that there was a problem and we know that there was a problem with the pharmaceutical companies and that's been very public and that you know the dangers of you know over prescribing a opioids to patients even when you're going in for a debt tool for dental work there was over prescription of opioids\nUm we saw a rise in that not only with veterans but with with people across the board in the United states when when the escalation of addiction\nRates started skyrocketing but what what happened was as soon as those issues began to be regulated and of course the federal government stepped in doctors stopped over prescribing for the most part\nOne of the things that happened was the drug cartels said wow look at this\nWe can potentially be making billions off of this and that's exactly what they're doing and not just the drug cartels but China China is also a culprit of this with that and all and I think we've been hearing a lot about that at least a little bit more in the news media\nAnd what they've done is they have created their own 'til their own pharmacies and and they made him look like the actual pills so some of the markings I was actually in Ohio talking to some of the undercover da a officers that are working there and some of the local law enforcement who work with the DEA\nThey said look these pills are almost identical you look at it as an annex\nIt looks

dangerous it's addictive it and two lives lost but when you see it come talented with the enormous amount of narcotics that are being spilled into our streets this poison\nAnd I'd sure buck you you hear about this all the time but that in all it's so dangerous that in its pure form\nWhich has moved across the United states many times in its pure form could literally cause someone to overdose and die by just touching it and in the documentary it's explained very well that only for grant for little grains like four little grains of table salt\nOf that no could literally kill a grown man\nAnd we've seen loads of this stuff come into the United states for example in April this year in Nebraska state troopers they seized over a hundred and Eighteen pounds of that and all and authority said this is enough to kill twenty six million people when we showcase\nAre ... and premier the movie here in Washington DC and then showcase did in Ohio which was which is really the epicenter we use Ohio as kind of a microcosm of the rest of the country\nWhen we showcased it they're one of the head of the DEA Mario Jimenez came and talked to the audience you know the full house because Ohio is really struggling with addiction rate\nAnd he said look if I close up this theater right now and they released a small package affecting all through the air system\nWe would all be dead\nHe said so this is no longer just about addiction\nThis is about saving our children's lives realizing that this is a potential national security threat really understanding where this is coming from and not being ashamed not being ashamed about addiction we have to come out you have to talk to our kids\nWe have to let them know without on the street we have to be open and honest with one another if we're ever going to find a solution and I'm not saying we're going to find a solution to stopping addiction we have to stop this before something potentially so dangerous happened\nBefore we lose a generation of our kids and we have to face it and we have to be honest about it\n[noise] [noise] service the documentary tacos what is really the biggest\nHealth crisis in the United states are more people are dying from this than died from the height of the AIDS epidemic or the crack epidemic in this country where when you speak to these families obviously\nGoing to be very and people would have been affected by this in any respect it's very emotional and and it's it's haunting for people there's clearly now a greater awareness of it than ever before\nWhat what is the answer what can we do about this\nI think first of all people have to find their lane everybody in ... in an all parts of the ... our communities need to find out what they can do what's their role as a parent it's educating your child\nAs a health care provider it's understanding what's going on and be able to be aware of of the potential dangers out there and assessing those right away so we can save lives and that people we have to realize you have a problem with addiction we also have to have the right resources appropriate at the right way\nSo that when the federal government put money aside for this epidemic that there's accountability for it that this money isn't being funneled through the federal system through state and local agencies and and just disappearing into the bass array of our of our money pit but that it's actually working\nAnd that we support our law enforcement and our federal law enforcement\nI Believe that as this as we start looking at this on a broader scale especially with the threat of setting all especially with the threat of the drug cartels and now they're pouring this poison into our system and into our children's lives we call it not in Dane B. E. I. N. not in pain\nThe drug cartels are using the veins of our highways to infiltrate and move their contraband into the United states and that and you are people's bands and into our children's bang\nWe have to find a way to stop this we have to work with our southern partners with Mexico with Colombia with Guatemala with Nicaragua with El Salvador we have to insist that they do their part and honestly there were a few people in the documentary that brought up some great ideas\nYou know look this is not just a criminal organization this has now become a transnational terrorist organization they are pumping and chemicals that could potentially endanger the lives of millions of people and we have to start treating it that way whether that putting up the wall building the wall\nOr enforcing laws\nUm international laws and going after some of these drug dealers that's what we have to do more importantly educating ourselves and educating our children I Can't tell you about how many parents I Know\nThat have no idea that this is actually going on on the streets they have no idea that these pills are manufactured in trailers that that our kids are purchasing step that the drug cartels are making look like pharmaceutical or prescriptions a that what our children are doing really understand that it starts at home\nBut it starts at home and now we've got to tackle the bigger broader problem of holding people accountable\nLike the drug cartels in Mexico likes you know lower\nElementary do all these different cartel the Beltran Leyva and really making sure that the Mexican government understand that we're no longer playing games were going to stop the flow into this nation and of course ah you know we have a lot of issues coming up at the election whether or not to build the wall whether or not to deal with\nHow we're going to deal with Mexico and our southern partners\nAre these are issues that Americans should be actively involved in and put in their own thoughts and their own two cents and calling their congressional leaders and saying hey what are you doing about this what can we do about this to help\nSave our country from this ... this potential disaster which is already taking more than a hundred and Fifteen lived a day\nFor working people watch the documentary\nOr would work for people to go to not in vain V.

moderator horror movies cause people always a psycho and Hitchcock but that's different you know the Hitchcock stuff just\nIt's a different it feels like a different genre filmmaking the one movie that I Can't tell people in good conscience to go see that I've seen is the hills have eyes I I still can't on see some of that have you seen that one I'm surprised you have\nYeah and if you're afraid that the ... yeah the hills have eyes I was I was a little scarred by that one [laughter] that what I was like I don't know where my mom\nI got it really that long lights on yeah I guess but whatever

without without even challenging her without even jumping into\nSay uh okay okay you need you need to take a breath and not say such ridiculous stuff\nOn there but I tweeted out without article those you're on Twitter concede check this out I I I said in response to her\n\nCompletely insane statement on air which he didn't have to back down from and apologize because it was so dumb that it was indefensible but but in response to that I said this is not even the dumbest thing that you will see or hear on CNN all week\n... not even this week will that be the single most in because we've got election coming up next week ... people are going to try to outdo one another on the left with stupid hyperbolic destructive nasty comments\nI said it wasn't the dumbest thing this week and I present you to prove me correct none other\nThan Mr Don Lemon ... pie too\nI keep trying to point out to people not to demonize any one group or any one ethnicity but we keep thinking that the biggest terror threat of something else some some some people who are marching you know towards the border like feminine and when the last time they did this a couple of hundred people came and they you know\nMost of them to get into the country most of them ... you know got stuck it out before they even made it to the border um\nSo we have to stop demonizing people and realize the biggest terrorist threat in this country is white men most of them radicalized brought up to the right\nAnd we have to start doing something about them there is no travel ban on them there is no ban on you know they have the Muslim ban there is no white guy ban so what do we do about that\nThat's right folks multimillionaire CNN anchor\nSays we need to stop demonizing people Hama and understand that white men on the right or the real threat there are the real evil the real monsters maybe we should ban them from traveling\nI didn't make him saying I'm not taking his words out of context I'm just playing for you what he said on national TV and you can say about why there's so much for a while either you're focusing on this and come up no no no he is representative of the overall mindset on the left\nThat's why we did the montage this is this is what these people this is what the other side the left the Democrats what they think\nThey really believe\nThat they're not the problem at all when it comes to nasty\nOverheated dangerous rhetoric the other side is the problem dot dot dot because of the other side's a bunch of evil racist Nazi biggest Gina fold you know beautiful is with blood on their hands\nOh I see that that is\nAt the heart of why we're having such a a descent into political madness in this country they don't even have the self awareness that don't even have the\nThe the the honesty\nTo be able to understand that you are not going to improve the temperature of political rhetoric if in fact your go to position is that the political rhetoric is bad because the other side is basically Hitler\nAnd I wasn't exactly how many how many references to rights and you know the right stacked fires and not season or did you hear that opening\nMontage this is how they think about the other side and you know where to you know what it really drives a lot of this is the success of the successes that Trump has and the relative failures of the eight years of Obama's and before that\nThey told us they being all the opponents to the Trump movement\nThey told us that he would fail miserably that he was completely in over his head that he had no idea what he was doing and that we would all essentially they will be able to laugh at us as we all suffered the horrible consequences\nOf having Donald Trump as president\nBut you see we have suffered the consequences of Donald Trump as president and suffering with things such as the lowest unemployment rate in sixty years the lows black\nAnd Hispanic unemployment rates of all time a booming economy a ton of investment no massive foreign wars getting started no crazy foreign military interventions that are going to send our bravest and best Americans into harm's way for missions that\nThe powers that be already been clear on how they're supposed to end and what's supposed to happen\nThat's that's those are the consequences of Trump ism and now that we've\nFelt that for two years now that we've seen it for ourselves there's a desperation on the left what does it say about the judgment of\nSome of the most celebrated names in the Democrat Party whether it's politicians or pundits or anybody with real power ... what does it say that they have been wrong wrong wrong\n\nAll they can do is criticized Trump's words his persona his attitude is tone a but they're not able to say oh look at this issue of look at this major policy issue where we're from other why do is lied to his supporters lied to his base\nOr failed miserably no quite the opposite they they hate Trump more because he is successful they hate Trump more because he is by his ability to withstand them and succeed despite all of their efforts\nHe's in a front to the left very sense of self\nHe makes them feel insecure about their beliefs and on the left belief and politics are tied together\nIn such a way that the true believers the left wing zealots don't know who they are if they do not have their progressive virtue signaling they don't know who they are if\nThey can't believe that CNN is objective and the New York times isn't liberal and you know all the smart people all the good people vote Democrat\nIt rattles them in a way that people that view politics really just as a as a system for managing conflict in a in a civil society which is what I think conservatives that have a good perspective on this understand it to be a don't feel as\nAre the some of the the shooting victims from the the terrible anti Semitic hate crime in Pittsburgh were being treated\nThere there you have all ... and look that was unscripted I there's there's video of it you can see they're just the the first family is walking by and all those people you heard there just want to say thank you they really appreciate the president\nCame out there in a show of solidarity and a show of support and an effort to let people know let the people in the community Pittsburgh and what those who have been directly affected by this know that the president had states\nIs there for them at the government in the American people and the the symbolism here of course is that the the representative of the American people is there in support and solidarity with the victims and with the city of Pittsburgh\nAnd what what's happened to that can be what's happened to the Jewish community there\nIn the last week this should be as straightforward\nAnd a non partisan a thing as is possible right or there's nothing about this that should raise anyone's hackles there's nothing about this that should get anybody upset\nAnd yet and yet as we know are\nThere are so many people so many people who made this an issue\nOf Trump not you know from being a bad\nGuy here somehow Trump is not welcome that's what they were saying not welcome\nHuffington Post today I Know see I go to these things\nI go to these things because he cites so that the rest of you don't have to spend your time rooting around in the bowels of the left his mind but the really the second top story on that site is Trump's visit to a city that didn't want him\nThis is just disgusting\nThey find a few people here and there they find some left wing activist who don't want the president there and they used that they strap away from that somehow but the city of Pittsburgh does not want the ... the United states to show up and then they report that as news\nThis is how they play the games is is how you see the bias occurred\nI anyone could do this oh I found three people and they all agree with me on something and then I read a story the people of D.C say that ... going Republican next year\nWas that based on anything that's worth telling anybody that I asked three three people that were we wasted outside of a bar who were just trying to pull my legs I mean what what what's going on here\nThis is how they do with this is how the left\nEngages in his manipulation of reality and they really just wanted to make this even ... a more divisive moment make it even more difficult for the president of the United states to be able to do his job here which is to try and help and he'll be American people by turning it into some\nYou know bashed Trump's session\nThese people are a disgrace and you don't it really comes down to they don't believe that he's the president they ... they they don't accept it not\nMy president you remember that chance on the streets they think that he's not just not their president but he is not the president period unfortunately they are wrong\nWith money matters minute is brought to you by the Armstrong

going to get on the subject of this a burst right deal and if people are informed of the fourteenth conch constitutional amendment it has nothing to do with illegal ... yep\nOh I'm In it that in depth coming up later on the show but just I guess that's kind of a U.S kind of a preview of the courts have never held that that is that that is the case that illegal aliens no court has held illegal aliens or should be given citizenship it's never been addressed\nBy the courts before and when you really think about it that was clearly not the intent of those who wrote the amendment at Eighteen sixty six and why would that be the decision of the government now it makes no sense\nTo consider people who are foreign citizens meaning citizen of a foreign country who are not legally in this country who are supposed to be removed from this country as soon as they come into contact with law enforcement and our government apparatus\nThat their children should be automatic or their children born here should be automatic citizens and it doesn't make sense why would we do that\nIt doesn't make any shut it was formed to give the birthright to this ... children of slaves\nWith a four year the fourteenth amendment was what was for it was for yet that the descendants of of slaves after the civil war was one and it was very explicitly for that purpose and it also at all not this later on it when you look at the way it didn't deal with Native American populations at the time and you know there's a lot of\nLegal ease here about the different jurisdictions and overlapping jurisdictions but it should be clear it's pretty amazing really that we'd gone this far without anyone challenging it and I I think Trump is absolutely right if nothing else we should have clarity on the issue I mean we should at least have the court's\nWing in and explaining and and I think that the problem here Charlie is with the Democrats don't really understand is that no matter what once again they are
