wants to give Susan Collins a pat on the back test pseudo John\nHi how are you doing I'm good how are you know I Wonder I Wonder if say that for every one of the reasons why there's ... or to your bowl is because of speaking truth to power I think that's one of the reasons why Trump are so popular with people because\nWe're so used to all these politicians just here say they want to do something else you're never followed up all sounds good come up to election but when somebody actually scripture and our heart is you know Congress there's truth to power\nBefore Trump that was a pretty rare event\nAnd I think she tapped into that raised\nBy you know ... some of the inconsistencies these people look at the television and they're just like you know why or why would why would you go back to a party you know ten times where you know people will be drug the rage stuff that anybody would an ounce of comments parents\nJust have to say you know this is and the one thing I could phrase the media is so close that and I hope these people never get a new power look everybody goes that votes soldiers grow that these people vote that the media it'll it'll drive you crazy

we're going to check in with match lap\nMatch wife works in the White House I've known that for years from the pack the American Conservative Union he is a good conservative guy he's a Trump guy died

he always says his wife is more famous than he is but I Would argue that I think they're equally famous match slap welcome to the buck sex than shows or\nMike what a night to be with you\nYou know it's a it's a little bit of history I have to tell you I Am grinning ear to ear tonight oh what a speech today from Susan Collins\nShe's a great job should a grudge up look I'm sitting here with my wonderful wife mercy and at the end of a long couple of weeks and I don't think it's illegal on on the radio to tell folks that we opened up a bottle of wine and I was telling her I feel\nYour article here and I just feel like we've all been through the ringer I Can't imagine what it feels like for the Kavanaugh's but we've all been through the rigors were very emotional and that but very important that we win this battle\nIt's it's vital that we go forward not just for the party and not just for the president not just for the judge and his family\nBut for what Collins laid out is the rule of law and and America's legal system I think would have taken one and the guy had we not going forward and I I Know we're not done yet\nI Know where we're not across the finish line for about another twenty hours\nBut it's pretty much a fate of ... and not math\n[noise] it really is and um you know the only thing is we've had every ... ball thrown at us in this process or I Do think that um\n[noise] America has to figure out a way to deal with our divisions and I think of course I'm a part of sitting on the conservative side as or you might put the I think that the the left has become so radicalized so hate filled and they would justify almost any action to get the ends that they want\nBut I think the thing a peace loving a kind of like the Democrats that you're that were grandparents for many of us who you know I have orange is the Democratic party my family\nI think those folks need to find a way to recapture their party because it's quite as we when I see the scenes of the Senate hallways over the last couple of days\nI think it's off the ugly and maybe that shouldn't maybe those people don't properly characterize where the Democratic party is but I'm I'm I'm cheerful that actually is exactly where the Democratic party is that if that's the case every battle we face going forward is going to get worse until the American people decide that they just want none of that\nWell here's one of the things that I brought a man and I have a question I I have a personal question and when it gets you before you guys get to the next year or the next can of wine or whatever you're celebrating with\nBut I'm nervous that this victory happened too quickly too soon because we've got four weeks before the midterms and that's an eternity in political life\nCan we keep this engagement in the conservatives in the G O P to possibly save the house is there enough energy to drive us forward for four more weeks\nYeah I mean really if you think about it we you know the Supreme Court should be so separate from politics that shouldn't have implications on the election but because of what the Democrats did it is the number one issue in the election and I understand you're concerned about keeping the enthusiasm going but we have to think about this if we\nAs a party and were unable to make this happen and now that the filibuster is dead it just it just took Republican votes if we were unable to do this as a party then I Would be worried because I talked to too many people around the country I've traveled a lot of states\nI'm In too many people around the country to look at the same thing that if the Republican Party kids simply keep his promise the most important have its promises\nThen they just don't want to be a Republican anymore and I kind of shared that as well I kind of felt like this is a moment where if my party just can't stand for something then I'm not sure I Want to be a part of it so that we have the opposite of that we have people who feel proud of their party they're proud of Mitch McConnell the proud of Lindsey Graham they're proud of Susan Collins\nI'm I sold it to grant a Fox News you know they give a big huge hug and I've been a real critical of Lindsey Graham but like a lot of these people who hated Donald\nTrump were never Trump hers and it's come around because they see Donald Trump is actually keeping his promises I'm going to do the same for these Republicans who kept\nTheir promised that they kept their promise to support a constitutional is\nA Supreme Court justice than we ought to applaud them for it I think actually our movement this coalition a coalition of Republicans and Trump supporters and conservatives most of that coalition or conservative I think that there's great promise now more promise than I felt in a very long time\nWe're talking to match lap or I call them a friend you probably know him as the chairman of the American Conservative Union if you've been to see back you recognize him he's also all over TV even brave enough to go on MSNBC\nMatt or if you would have told me three months ago that I Would be doing exactly what you're doing praising Mitch McConnell Lindsey Graham and Susan Collins I would've said you're drunk match lap go home but that's exactly what's happened this is this is a little bit of a miracle\n... well let's talk about Mitch McConnell just for a minute here I mean it was Mitch McConnell who deserves the credit for keeping all those centers together when we had the majority in the Senate and when a Merrick Garland was picked for the Supreme Court opening that was Mitch McConnell's doing kept those centers together he kept all of them together\nAnd that's why we're where we are\nWho you are a hundred percent correct he just ... out of credit for that and he and now he deserves great credit for the fact that he has ... you know not done yet a tomorrow or will be the second Trump nominee tickets shepherd shepherded through the Senate\nAnd under increasingly difficult circumstances and I'm going to make a prediction I think we're going to have another one next year and a and if you thought\nMS our peak envoys list price do

George or a hundred percent correct and part of this starts not just a with what we talk about between ourselves\nBut Dana Perino who I just think is one of the greatest people ever in media Dana and she's fair to Dana tweeted out today that we just don't understand our history and I contend that because we don't teach it\nWe don't teach American history we don't teach the constitution we just finished what was it three weeks ago with constitution week\nAnd I guarantee it the school's took the money to hand out the pocket constitutions\nBut nobody had a real discussion\nOf the constitution no and uh I'm lax myself so that's why I carry one all the time\nAnd I think that if you get judges on the Supreme Court who will follow this operating manual that's been handed to them and not rewrite the laws are reinterpret the laws\nAre I think we're going to be in a better place and I also think this this whole success of today\nIs only part of what Donald Trump and Mitch McConnell have been able to do with the point in a more judges\nThat are getting confirmed that a record rate and I think what's happened there not just mad at Kavanaugh I think the Democrats woke up in the middle of this confirmation and what do you have any idea how many judges Donald Trump is getting appointed\nWe are screwed for decades and that's actually I think part of the anger so the\n... ... ... the judicial was always designed to be the weakest of the three branches it was just designed as a referee on the court ... well I'm In the basketball court right there but there were there were designed to be a referee here's what it says if you have a disagreement about what it says\nBut a week earlier when he was with Martha my column on Fox he was accused of being robotic he was accused of being dull and boring and giving robotic answers\nEight days later when he gets emotional\nHe's accused of being too emotional she can't have it both ways either he's too robotic or east to emotional but you can't accused him of both\nAnd that is that's where I throw the bravo Sierra flag on the Democrats so many times but I really do thank God for Susan Collins today because she made an incredible case\nAnd supported the victim or the accuser we don't know she was a victim of something but not judge Kavanaugh she supported her and she supported more importantly\nThe system which has been under attack are very governmental system this really I Hope to God they teach the speech in schools I Know the the limousine liberals and the Mercedes Maoists who run college campuses are going to fight

[noise]\nMichael ... on this fabulous friday evening where we are celebrating the\nEventual but it looks like it is a fait accompli a passing of judge Kavanaugh into the confirmation process for being a Supreme Court justice\nJust scan during the break scan over to Fox News and they have a camera on the Senate floor where Senator Murkowski is explaining why she's voting\nNo and nobody's there\n[laughter] I Know I'm not supposed to laugh at this but I'm having a shot and Freud a moment Senator Lisa Murkowski explaining why she said no and I'm not going to vote for judge Kavanaugh it's over Johnny\nIt's over\nAnd behind your are empty chairs when it was still a an important issue you saw people everywhere as a matter of fact every senator within their desk today which was a really special thing that tell you knew some major history was going down\nBut I also think there needs to be considerable worry that potential violence could be happening someone named\nCat to Calvin who goes by cat Calvin LA on the Twitter\nShe's the founder of spread the vote us and uh something called a\n... to a Becky dot com\nAnd uh she says she got a Fast Company one hundred most creative in business and Instagram and medium she says she ah bravery is contagious but she's also putting out on Twitter never let Collins have a moment of peace in public again\nSo now we're advocating for making people's lives miserable she's not the only one there's more of this going on out there and I work for the safety and security of\nOur elected officials are let's chicken real quickly with Terry in Florida Terry you wanted to share an irritating jingle and scary movie you want to get in last night's or Monday's poll too\nYeah I miss the movie thing last night the scariest movie considering what's going on in the world today was the passion of the Christ you\nWell you can't you can't ever argue with uh the power of that movie was such a powerful film\nThe the uh the uh trials of Jesus closely compares to the trials of the Supreme Court justice well they're\nThey're both powerful moments and I I'm almost out of the time we got about twenty seconds left what's your jingle the\nTortures you don't feed me no bologna was an Oscar Meyer that was a national one was a local one in Flint, Michigan\nOh okay I didn't know that one but thank you for sharing my ... and ... then here comes the Soros machine joined us next hour we got more\nYou want to be smart when you're hiring you don't have in this time and resources and you need the best people you know what's not smart posting to job sites one by one you know what's not smart waiting around for people to apply to you when you could be going out there and finding them easily you know what\nThey would have to check out what they were wanting people to do\nAnd today as we watched some of the protesters losing their minds and running around the Senate\nWe had flashbacks to Occupy Wall street let me give you an example of what I'm Talking about\n[noise] [noise] [noise]\nI [noise] senator [noise]\nDoes that sound like people capable of independence thought and and do what you're saying now that was an isolated case no just few minutes later in the basement where the ah protesters had finally figured out the senators on coming through the main lobby they're going in the basement they were gathering there too\n[noise] [laughter] [noise]\n[laughter]\nIt just becomes like a strange church of protesters who really strange church of protesters\nAnd I think these lost boys\nAnd mostly last girls don't understand the full issue they're not looking at facts they're only looking at emotions\nAnd it really is frustrating\nAnd then moments after that was captured Susan Collins was going in for the vote on cloture and she walked into the the uh same hallway where the robots where where these folks were and she was accosted by both protesters and reporters\nAre you how do you think Kavanaugh will make I mean you have you ever find out how it'll don't I'm\nBrett Kavanaugh I Will be I Will be voting yes on print said to the final confirmation vote and I will announce my intention signed out to vote later today said\nThat was Susan Collins earlier today before she delivered that epic address tonight who just a magical\nDay and again I I go back to the discussion we had an hour ago in this very radio show if you would have told me earlier this year four months ago that Lindsey Graham Mitch McConnell and Susan Collins would be the three heroes\nThe salvation of Donald Trump's presidency and the Supreme Court justice I would've said you're on your mind\nYou need to put down the pipe but no that's exactly how this worked out Susan Collins gave such a brilliant and measured address today I have to give you a little bit of a snippet\nOf what she said talking about the process because she really gave a history lesson\nShe gave a lesson in law and logic and decency\nOur Supreme Court confirmation process\nHas been steady decline for more than Thirty Years' wine and can only hope that the cabin a nomination it's where the process has finally hit rock bottom\nAgainst this backdrop that sat T H ... Senate or to decide what the constitution said fights and consent Judy ...\nI thought that was brilliant and you know we're talking to match slap earlier and Matt said that he thinks next year twenty Nineteen there may be another retirement on the Supreme Court\nAnd with that retirement it's more than likely going to be a liberal justice which means then the court with a pick from Donald Trump would swing from five for conservative to liberal advantage\nTo a six three and that is going to be too much for liberals to handle that ... that change\nIn the ratio would absolutely\nMake everybody on the left to go nuts and they would be a it'd be Armageddon for them be legal Armageddon for them so uh uh the the biggest thing I think Susan Collins did today in her argument\nThat she made her case was to talk about something that the left would not let us get through and that was the presumption of innocence\nThat if you were charged with something you're used to doing something in this country we don't hang onto the presumption of innocence than it is all over for America as a as a civil society\nAt Princeton and then it since since relevant to the five cent function when any accusation apart\nFrom the nominees otherwise six cents blurry record I worry that part of its print sentient could lead to a lack of public faith and the judiciary and with the huge damage to the confirmation process\nMoving forward\nSome of the allegations against judge cabinet illustrate why ... percent of innocence is so important\nI Am thinking in particular not of the allegations raised by professor for but if the allegations\nThat when he was a teenager jets cabinet Toronto multiple girls and use their week and the state to sell it to a gang rape\nYou know what's the most amazing here is that when you think about it\nThe apple collect the behavior of Democrats ultimately helped confirmed judge Kavanaugh and most importantly the absolute insane charges brought by Michael Avon not he\nThe guy that brought us Stormy Daniels or maybe she brought him to us\nBut Michael ... who tried to make this all about himself and his delusional dreams of being a twenty twenty presidential candidate ... brain for these insane charges that were debunked within twenty four hours but still repeated by the mainstream media\nHave a Ninety may have driven Susan Collins to make this choice she talked about this this wild delegation\nFish out last ditch alec gauge what's put forth without any credit supporting evidence and simply parroting public statements stepfather\nYeah she's talking about the media should go after the ... too much you go to Susan Collins could have taken the media part but what she did was make a well reasoned well crafted\nAnd cogent argument for judge Kavanaugh by saying that what was brought up about him was totally totally without any credible evidence and certainly not even a preponderance of the of what a brilliant day if you got a thought about that about\nSusan counts against thought about cabinet only of thought about anything it's friday it's freestyle friday the phone lines are\nOpen aid for for nine hundred bucks aid for for nine hundred bucks which is to eight to five\nI'm also trying to figure out what's the worst jingle ever the most annoying jingle my personal favorite for\nThe winner of the most annoying you hear it everywhere
