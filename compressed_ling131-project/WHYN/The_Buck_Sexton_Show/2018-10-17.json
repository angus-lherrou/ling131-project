socialist or the Democrats socialist project in Western Europe and in America because there are Democrats socialist here as we know ... and others Elizabeth Warren but she's got other problems right now\nThe problem that the Democrat socialist project has to face is that they believe in open borders but they also believe in a welfare state a massive welfare state that doesn't work the Math Doesn't add up and also people\nAre willing to help the less fortunate from within their own community from within their holiday right their political union there is still a sense of nationhood of nationalism\nShould I say where\nYou want to I I Want to help Americans first if we're gonna have a welfare state in this country it should be to help those who were Americans\nAll races grades and colors help them if they're down on their luck we're gonna have welfare state that should be but if if we have a policy of essentially anybody who shows up\nAnd has a ... a sob story about how their country has not I'm not talking to people that just generally that are facing any imminent violence they just say oh the jobs here are better\nWell guess what if I show up in Switzerland and say hey

millions of people from a different culture who speak a different language\nAnd once they come to this country increasingly claimed that this country is not fair to them because we don't do enough for them\n\nI was under the impression that if you came to America you're supposed to feel grateful and legal immigrants by the way of you listening Hi five thank you welcome to be part of the American

also all the goodies that the state could offer\nFree health care free school free housing free everything\nEven America with are incredible economy in our economic dynamism and thanking Trump for showing us that growth\nGrowth under Obama for all the people are saying well I'm a ... show where growth under Obama in his last year in office was like one point something\nPercent growth under Trump second year in office GDP over four percent single\nBest measure we have of economic activity in what's going on in this country so who's the Gobi Obama corn we're though the please yes there was a natural economic reset that occurred Obama made a slower and more painful and less powerful than it would have been had he not gotten in the way but he was\nIgnorant of economics I mean Obama is just not somebody who understands business not somebody who ever had to look at a balance sheet for any length of time not somebody who had to run a business of anything you know he was in the business of Obama different\n[noise]\nBut the facts facts cannot be allowed to get in the way of the leftist narrative with all this stuff this group is going to come to the border\nAnd they are going to be in a position\nWhere we can either let them in or not and you know what the liberals are going to say let them in and we're going to turn around and say hold on a second but if if their claims of asylum allow them entry in this country what we're really saying is that anyone can come and stay as long as they want anyone is allowed to show up\nIn this country and we effectively have an open border\nBecause all that all this required for someone who's to say the right things now the word is out now we know what the loopholes All right now the people in these communities that are coming into this country no that all they have to say is I fear violence in my home country\nI fear violence I mean violence can happen at any one country assign especially for people that are fleeing either a horrific natural disaster and by the way they're supposed to go back usually we give them temporary status for natural disasters\nBecause we're we're ... we're carrying country but we're not supposed to be Trump's not supposed to just be you know the the the fat cow to be milked by the rest of the world\nAnd that's what's happening the Democrats have no way of turning his back by the way they\nUnderstand or they understand that\nQuite honestly there is no way that they can explain to the American people what it is that they really want if they told the truth to Americans\nWould ever would have a lot of folks would say oh well it's like I don't think that's going to work I don't think you can just bring in endless amounts are foreigners\nNot through the legal process not go

to a if not a whole let's say they they they continue what half power at best sure they'll still be some executive orders still do that there'll be deregulatory stuff but\nWe lose the house you're

great people just bad leadership bad later\n[laughter] so I I like everything when Lindsey Graham who say they're still the very end I don't uh I like he was he didn't read it the way that it's out it I could say that I I he just misspoke\nA you know he didn't mean that you just been Iran is a bad country Iran is not bad people in fact the Iranians I've had many Iranian friends throughout my life and\nUh it would be a great day to have the Iranian people in Iran able to have the same some of the same freedoms of the a wonderful Iranians that live in this country uh we've had a whole ... running through anyway\nI Love the other stuff he was there though that I was going to take a DNA test every Lindsey Graham is he's very much a very much\nA man struck by a kind of knew swagger 'cause I I think that he really understands uh he he really understands that you got to be willing to fight the other side you got to be willing to go to\nThe madam Lindsay and this and it's kind of mirrors my own feelings last few weeks where I've just said last few months you know what as much as as much\nAs I always want to leave the door open for the other side and I want I Want people on the left to listen to this show I Want you know honest good Democrats to listen to the show as much as they are willing to uh in terms of the of the ideas\nWe can't just oppose them we got to crush the ideas I don't crush people but I Want to crush ideas\nAnd that means sometimes yes as the kids say we might have to own the lives a little bit\nAh so Lindsey Graham I liked that he's been ... is that a little more swagger is I've been saying and I also think that you know on immigration and he has some interesting things to say I I I got to get him I got to get them a little more hard line on this stuff ... here's what he said click with eight\nThey're eleven million illegal immigrants here that came from burning for countries\nWhat do we do with them I Want to merit based immigration system you got to get Democrats and Republicans working together build a wall control who gets the job more legal immigration moved to ... based immigration\nYou can't ignore the eleven may and they'll never be a deal right with the Democratic party that does make a deal with the eleven million or non felons who've been here for twenty and Thirty years once you get them in a good spot even have a new immigration system\nYou know I I don't think he gets around this one you had folks I think that Lindsey\nHe's a little a little too squishy on this issue as I've been saying thank you Yale University math nerds for backing me up on this it's not eleven million age twenty million it's twenty two zero at least\nI don't know what we have to do to get people to understand this is not a lemon it is twenty million at a minimum\nWhich is a vast number of people\nFrom a a generally speaking from one country\nFrom Mexico I mean that the vast majority of them are from Mexico\nWhich also happens to be a neighbor of ours geographically where there was an enormous border\nAnd you know it it poses its own issues for political unity in this country really doesn't know people are not allowed to national security analyst will tell you that when you have a population that has\nA that has moved across the border that has fought wars over that Porter we don't often think about that but we fought a war with Mexico over the border\nAnd then you have a population that maintains a tremendous and ... you know powerful and continuing tied to the the what's considered the homeland of the mother country a ... you have a recipe for stabilization you really do I mean politically at a minimum de stabilization\nAnd that's you know that's something that I think is a you know and it needs\nTo be remembered here I I think Lindsey Graham has might look I\nGive you a lot of credit for the whole capital thing but as much as I'd like to just look at that and say it's all fine now they're going to get fooled and immigration again they're talking about doing this deal\nAnd the deal is going to be amnesty and then we'll see what happens for your security we'll see what happens with this request for a wall and that's not good enough that's not acceptable\nTo eat and Lindsey talk a little bit more about this deal that he thinks is going to happen play seven\nHouses have been and a half for the wall I mean excuse me five being in the Senate has been a path will close the gap\nA duck I remember that six hundred and Ninety thousand kids brought here on the average age of six no place else to go Trump's going to win in court he can repeal dock of the day he went in court what do we do with these young people so I'd like to do a deal for wall funding for ...\nFor wall funding for DACA that ...\nThat are I think I think you could sell that to the Republican ... if it was full well funny you get that five billion\nAnd it's just deferred action still or that's not a\nIt but it can't be it can't be citizenship and it can't be permanent just okay well we're going to have a we're going to see how this goes it because you can't discuss what you're going to do with the eleven but twenty million illegals in this country and Jill you have\nA reasonable assurance that you're not going to be dealing with another twenty million in ten years\nAnd if you ... by the way I understand that the political sway that the Latino Democrat community in this country will have for even more a unrestricted immigration particularly from your from South of the border uh that will\n... the entire debate and discussion going forward and all Democrats will see is that they will be importing masses\nOf new voters who will essentially make the Republican Party a you know way and after all I mean they will they will be able to turn America into a one party state\nThat's the game the Democrats are flying the Republicans keep thinking about this like well you know maybe we can deal with them\nThe Democrats are looking at the immigration issue is how do we make the Republican Party extinct [noise]\nRepublicans are all you know maybe there was a little or no\nNo no that I [noise]\nHe's got much more coming up team uh stay right there they wouldn't it [noise]\nWith all the recent news about online security breaches it's hard not to worry about where my data goes making online purchase or simply access to your email could ... your private information at risk you're being tracked on line by social media sites marketing companies and your mobile Internet provider\nNot only can they record you're browsing history but they often sell it to other corporations who wants to profit from your information\nThat's why I decided to take my privacy back by using express VPN\nSome ... you know some good faith or not even good no not good faith strike that from the record\nSome not laughable argument I mean the notion that Elizabeth Warren is a Cherokee or could consider herself a Native American is is laughable to any serious human laughable I mean you should laugh about it\nAt the wall Street Journal said if she is a person of color than words have no meaning she is as far from a person of color as anyone could possibly be\nAnd yet she still kind of ... she used to she still clings to it but then there was just wondering well did she receive any benefit my friends there is\nSo much circumstantial evidence that she received a benefit that it is also laughable to suggest that that she did not\nUm that she did not have the ... and I'm not somebody who's a school snob but she did not have the academic pedigree for law school do then going to be a professor at the University of Pennsylvania an Ivy League school and Harvard\nConsidered to be the number one school and and really the number one law school in the United states no way that happens in last the hiring committees think that they can while they can but it's very important that they put out these reports very important that they have a Native American on the faculty\nAt a big big deal for them they have their pick they can have anyone they want\nAnd that's why I also why would Elizabeth Warren list herself as such\nIn less gave her some benefit it's a bizarre thing to do unless you are gaming the system the only reason you would do that if you were Elizabeth Warren and clearly not a person of color would be to game the system so it just defies belief it's completely\nRidiculous I can tell you that I spoke to 'cause I have access to a lot of Democrats up the hill or and I spoke to Democrats that I work colleagues and I got to say there are all they were all say it's true though this is just\nThere's no excuse there's nothing you can say about it that she thought that this proved your case was completely insane a Donald Trump also\nWe have one more to it on this he rewrote thank you to the Cherokee Nation for revealing that Elizabeth Warren sometimes referred to as Pocahontas is a complete and total ... [laughter] [laughter] sometimes referred to as ... as he has defeated really\nProgressive front runner for twenty twenty before she was even able to get into the race officially\nAnd he defeated or by getting inside her head and forcing her to make one of the great on force political errors of all time I have never seen anything quite like this uh this ... this is truly truly astonishing\nUh but then the president had this thing today later on that I got to say I don't know what's going on here I Want the president focused on what matters and I want the president on policy among fighting\nBack absolutely but what is this thing about\nWhat is this thing about old horse Oh yes here's what he wrote federal judge throws out Stormy Daniels lawsuit versus Trump Trump is entitled to a legal fees\nGreat now I can go after a horse race and her third rate lawyer in the great state of Texas she will confirmed the letter she signed she knows nothing about me a total calm you know it's interesting Trump really hold out here that that this is a lie start to finish\nAnd I have thought that ah that that there is no way that she's lying about Trump just because of the detail and they look they do know each other they have had contact it's not like the\nKavanaugh allegation and want it's nothing because there's nothing criminal about anything that's even alleged about Trump with Stormy Daniels or why should say about his contact with her people are saying was all the campaign finance that's pathetic than no no shot no chance um but I guess\nAnd now I'm thinking you know is it is it ... why why do people jump to the conclusion that Trump actually had they had this affair with her\nUm what what I said I shouldn't say jumping to conclusions I think that's obvious but ... why are we so sure\nA lot of people in those seem very brochure about it I I'm I'm just ... I'm keeping an open mind there's ... there's never been\nAny proof offered that I'm aware of meaning she's never been able to show text messages or emails running at you know that that that relates to the affair she just gave this description of him and you know there's another part of this and I'm just thinking through this\nHer whole description of Trump in her book it's like she wrote that description based on what she knew the media would want her to say which was just be really a ... and degrading and nasty toward toward the president\nSo I'm you know I I had thought that the president this was before he was the president I thought that maybe he\nAnd you know had strayed from his marital out here and I was willing to say look\nI care about what he's doing as president and the political movement he represents I'm not I'm not sitting around trying to judge all politicians by every every action in their lives um bad especially because it's you know the only do that the only enforce that against Republicans they want enforce it against Democrats are there is also part of me the things well you know\nMaybe there's something else here it it just I I'm thinking about right I'm thinking about I'm not totally sold one way or the other but now they they they're all focused on the present referring to a woman as a horse race\nYou know I this is why I say Trump was winning and winning and winning this week and this feels a little bit like a field a little bit like an unnecessary distraction and and not something that I Would really want the president to say but that said\nMaybe when you're when you're this when you're this ... when you're in his position and you're fighting against everybody and and it's all an uphill battle or maybe they're just going to be these you know is it's not they're not all going to be a hits right they're not all going to be great\nSo that that's part of it too I'm maybe he's human which we all know he is maybe he's imperfect which we all know he is a and I I think that we should be able to have that chalk\nAll among those of us who really support the president and his agenda which I clearly do and still be want to say okay I kinda wish you hadn't called some woman horse race on Twitter I just I think that that's yeah that's a little\nThat's a little bit but we're we're a presence droopy that said he's been crushing everything else all week and been amazing so you know so he's not perfect he's pretty darned good though so you know I'll give it to him on that and that's I I think that's an okay standard to have for politicians you know it's not perfect who's pretty darn good\nIt really is um and I I've seen recently some some conservatives that things start to come around to this notion of why do we have to why do we have to pretend like any politicians perfect\nWhy do we have to pretend like anyone is is beyond or not just pretend but hold them up to this standard of of moral pro bitty that isn't there for anybody else really in public life\nLook can be Trump is made more mistakes than a lot of other folks in that area but he's also clearly got a gift for politics for entertainment and he is he is the man for this era\nOr Elizabeth Warren let ... let me tell you why I said let me tell you why say instead of just standing and I let me break that down a little bit wider here's a perfect example of why give Trump a lot of leeway why I cut this president a lot of slack\nOn some of the tweets are some of the stuff he says about you know people here or there that I feel like maybe ... is going a little far here's why\nIf it weren't for someone like Donald Trump if we had a Mitt Romney instead of Donald Trump and Elizabeth Warren was going to be twenty twenty candidate it would just be him getting attacked all the time our guy getting attacked not fighting back and Elizabeth Warren getting away with being a huge fraud\nWho advocates for all kinds of class warfare while she's making hundreds of thousands of dollars a year as a she was as a tenured professor at Harvard law school I think a quarter of a million dollars a year you making plenty of money she got plenty of money\nUm and and all of that\nFalse miss all that fall so that she's out they're peddling to people would really go on challenged in a meaningful way and the worst of all if she were to win the presidency against a Romney like figure\nYou and I would have a harder time\nPutting food on the table paying our mortgages or in my case rent you know paying bills taking care of family taking care of medical bills would all be harder because of Elizabeth Warren because she has wrong ideas because she's self involved because she doesn't\nUnderstand the way the world really works and because she's benefited from this system the system in place that the left\nHolds up at all costs of some people you know get a get special privileges some people will get pushed through now and and others are told well you have some form of privilege so you have to just suffer in silence I'm Sorry\nThat Trump has saved us from yet another progressive destruction machine this case would have been lives with Lawrence while I'm laughing about the whole thing he's also don't the nation a great service by making sure that Elizabeth Warren Pocahontas does not become president\nUh you know I there was all Lindsey Graham\nI wasn't a huge Lindsey fan in the past but first of all Lindsey Graham's download saucy lately too he's really letting the less habit\nI like Lindsey unleash you know he's doing his thing but another one who's in that category and and I take a much\nMuch softer drone on Jeff Flake too he he could have been gracious ... himself to the ah MSNBC crowd but instead he did the right thing in the end he made a mistake he could've cost us the whole thing so I'm not saying he's not the same categories McConnell and John Graham for the or the special special folks were this anyway I just wanted to say\nUh the deficit is the highest it's been in six years folks\nAnd I came into this business of conservative media right\nAt the height of the Tea Party's power in this country and she party as a movement\nAnd I went to work for Glenn Beck and Glenn was very tied in with the Tea Party and you know I I saw this this wave of\nA just a a restoration of concern or the restoration of concern for our financial future for just so many\nUm so many things all of a sudden we're at the top of the list right and and also restoration of\nThe American founding as as a topic of conversation I I'm just saying we're we're not we have not done anything about this yet and we've had a Republican House Republican Congress\nI'm Sorry what was the Senate and White House now for almost two years and we haven't taken action and I worry that we're not going to take action I worry that this is June going to become one of these issues where\nAre we all talk of big game we all talked talked tough on this\nBut at the end of the day nobody wants to be the one that says that we got to spend less\nRepublicans will talk about okay we can't tax more fine but\nThe truth is we've got to spend less and that means we're going to spend less on Social Security and Medicaid or Medicare Medicaid\nThat's what it means that is what it means or else it it has no meaning and Republicans don't want to hear that and I know a lot of the folks listening to this than I have a tough time with that they feel like they paid in and so it's not an entitlement at the government\nYou know making amends for taking money from them for all those years Social Security that's pretty much true we just need to change the structure of a long term Medicare it's not true with Medicare your kids if you're listening to this really actually your grandkids if your Medicare age they're the ones and you're great grandkids\nAre going to be paying the financial price for the care that people take it out of the system today\nIt's not right it's intergenerational theft and I know people don't want to hear it but that's just the truth\nIn while the feds collecting record income taxes in twenty Eighteen so you know we're always told oh there's not enough there's not enough ah revenues are revenue which there's too much more than a revenue there's\nToo much spending government has got to rein it in and in\nLast were you know we're either going to have a serious national conversation about this and take action we're going to suffer some really horrific economic consequences and by the time the consequences are obvious it's going to be tough to turn it around and that's just the truth [noise]\nSo I I'm a look we'll continue to talk about this\n[noise] don't delay leaves are falling and so it was on the

it's going to happen in some places some of the time but it sends a very important and very destructive message to the rest of us\nThat this thing can happen that a woman running for state office can

yourself and punch turn the are do you think that'd be a new story my friends do you think we'd hear you'd think on\nCNN we'd have Cuomo and lemon cry all about what happened to know\nOh yeah\nNow is it an historic course that by the way that wouldn't be a new story but why is it not a news story that anyone pays any attention to on the Republican side why am I not hearing anything about this

need to realize that when people like Cory Booker said get up in their face he may say that's what I'm Sorry this is Ron Paul quoting Cory Booker statement to quote get up in the face of politicians they disagree with\nRon Paul's been talking about this I'm Sorry Rand Paul I talked to Ron Ron with us from getting them confused Rand Paul was talking about this and and I think that you know ... if if you were a Democrat we'd have to hear about how Rand Paul's victim which he is\nAboard and want us all both of them life threatening because of his politics in the last twelve months Democrats don't want to hear about it but there's no store there's no pattern you see there's nothing going on nothing to see how they would tell you that this is all just\nAll just the the right wing manufacturing this hysteria about mobs right they don't like the mobs as we know from CNN they don't want to hear about moms\nHuh what do we call angry large groups of people that are threatening and sometimes attacking individuals on the street which we call a large groups of people that show up in a concerted effort to intimidate harassed threatened scare and upset people when they're trying to have a meal\nThat's not a mob is no such thing as a mob but then again Democrats buildings Elizabeth Warren the Cherokee so there's that\nWe are entering a very dangerous period here\nSome of these threads that you are seeing now some of these\nTrends\nToward it radicalized and deeply angry left it's not that all of them are anti fought that enough of them support anti fall that we have a real problem our hands\nOr they\nWon't be able to handle they will not be able to process like normal well behaved adults if they don't at least when one branch of Congress back then or at least get one part of the ah they don't get the house majority that they've been banking or\nThey're going to freak out\nAnd there's enough of them now who really believe that Trump is because the media likes to play this game Trump is a fascist he's basically Hitler my former boss the CIA Mike Hayden thought it'd be funny to tweet out or instructive whatever worthwhile commentary to tweet out photos of Nazi concentration camp and I think that's what Trump is doing at our word\nCory Booker says get up and people's faces Maxine Waters says get up in in other words get up and people said\nProminent Democrat a prominent Democrats across the board\nAre saying well people are angry so I guess they are going to\nDo everything that they can in order to intimidate this is about a gym a nation this is the threat of force is implicit in these mobs the threat of violence is what is behind these people were yelling who are shouting curses\nWe have a man\nSpeaking to a woman and this is just make the rounds last day and I I Can't tell you the exact origins of HIS Video I'm it's was making the rounds on Twitter so\nI I'm just going with what I saw here but it was getting a lot of play it went viral yesterday and we have one woman who I Believe according to what I read the Trump supporter and another person you can just tell was knocked and John we bleep out there's a lot of profanity but we believe we believe that All right okay\nThis is a window into the mind of progressive activists and the left today play clip sixteen black\nIt is\nGoing to be like your husband and I can't wait to hear your voice rang out for him [noise] good [noise] good and might\nBe much of a mind\nThing immigrants with their bullies [noise] but yeah you're\nRight and the great\nThat's how the left thinks these days folks that's a nice little window\nInto the people that think that they should mob politicians at restaurants that they should spit on conservative that rallies that they should start fights and then act like oh it's it's the far right coming for me\nThat's what's going on you you heard that men make fun of domestic abuse your your ... your boyfriend will punch you not like that said that it's good to her husband who died in nine eleven according to the woman in the clip it's good that he died this guy said it's good that he died\nThen refer the NYPD as a bunch of ... I used to work for the YPG I Would oh man I I I Would love to hear this guy say that stuff's so mild colleagues and the until the vision\nHopefully when they were off duty see how that goes for him because the MIT NYPD the largest police department country one of the most affected by the way one of the best anywhere in the world they're a bunch of sodomize or she said\nBecause of course this guy really cares about immigrants here but even so much and then says that this woman's husband who she says died on nine eleven I I don't I don't have background and her but that's what she's saying and he doesn't even blink he just as yeah he'll be rocks and the grey\nNothing is sacred to these people nothing is too low for them their minds have been poisoned by this loop of MSNBC and the young Turks for the young jerks and all the rest of CNN the Washington Post New York times their minds have been poison\nThey think that they're smart when they talk about how the president has to be removed by the twenty Fifth Amendment they think they're savvy when they discuss the coming fascism in this country\nThey're hysterical in Brussels but they're also getting dangerous\nAnd they are really destroying some of what holds us all together in this country rule of law basic respect and decency for a fellow Americans they they don't believe in any that\nThis is what we're up against remember that\nAs we go into these midterms the best repudiation of that ... of a human being that you just heard that audio the ... him and his beliefs is to make sure that the people that he supports an that share his beliefs\nThe Democrats do not get power\nDeny them the thing they seek a ball above all else deny the Democrat status progressive power\nThey're going to kick they're going to screamed are going to go crazier the we have to hold the line\nOr moral nation also ... and the investigation fallout from Elizabeth Warren's nonsense we've got that a more coming up coast to coast when George\n\nI was there a ball field would Stevens college is almost died from a very very angry violent man who was inside and really by rhetoric on the left and this hasn't been reported enough when he came onto the field with a semi automatic weapon barring probably close to two hundred shots at us\nShooting five people almost feeling states really seems like this is for health care he also had a list of conservative legislators Republicans in his pocket but he was willing to\nKill so what happens when when Democrats said get up in their face\nThey need to ... and there are a lot of unstable people out there there are people with anger issues there are people that are prone to violence they might even live next door to you and you don't know where these people are but what we shouldn't do is incite people to violence and there is going to be an assassination if this doesn't ratchet down and I think the other side needs to really calling the rhetoric down\nWhen I pointed out that Senator Rand Paul there said that Hodgkinson the guy who tried to kill as many conservative members of Congress as possible and would have had an October to brave Capitol police officers\nWhen I pointed out on Twitter that that was what Rand Paul said that this is for health care was what the guy was yelling you know what they said to me you don't Baluch jak meeting verified journalists Twitter was going to be with\nHe's lying\nHe's lying I thought we had to believe victims ... what do you mean why would you lie about that why would the press instinctively try to almost defenders Hodgkinson maniac fortunately was shot down when he was trying to do this\nWhat is wrong with that\nBut then again just as I was in the break I see the following the editor in chief of Politico\nJohn Harris in response to a Larry Sabato tweet Larry Sabato writes white nationalist leader wants to take over the GOP and the head of\nPolitical okay which is a booster but just politics man we're just journalists we don't have to be we're not we're not pushing an agenda bull\nJust like CNN bull you want to be independent of the DNC fine just owning okay and then we can fight on a level playing field stop it's I'm just a journalist under the bed garbage\nWhite lie\nBut Harris over at political editor and she pointed out about quote white nationalist leader wants to take over the G O P\nThought that job had been filled oh okay oh he's just Troy saying Trump sang Trump and Ronald Daniel a GOP chairwoman responded this offensive statements in the head of political is another example of why distress in the media is that an all time high she's absolutely right\nWhen you're the head of a pretty\nLarge in terms of readership news website like political and you're holding herself out there is a political journalist and you are making casual jokes about how you think the president is a white nationalist\n... a a neo Nazi is it any surprise\nThat there are people who were chasing Republicans in a restaurant is there any surprise that we have women running for state office in Minnesota being attacked by a maniac physically who's also yelling go kill yourself\nWhen at the very top level of the show called resistance there is no good faith no decency know kindness why wouldn't we expect that have ramifications across decide\nHow they make an argument why don't they try to take on for example oh why was Obama better at being president than Trump is you know why they want to take um an argument because their argument stinks\nBecause they can't have a good one other than Obama's smarter brilliant and great a wonderful that's not stuff that's not things tell me what he\nDid that is better rules detour Trump's racist great such a compelling argument you made\nThey really are\nDon't forget this base near you ended me\nThey think that we are into\nThe courage to face up to like falling markets should Wall Street money trash if you're worried for losing

Want to take your phone away from it but just a brief shining moment we don't want any more of these tweets that anybody ever try that\nKnow and and I don't think I'd be talking to you of it is a that's a way of getting the message look we're fake news everyone's sake\nThere's so much of this information they put a that's my only form of communicating really other than having a press conference every hour but I I really believe I didn't do that Stewart number one I probably wouldn't even\nBe here talking to you but you like it too and I'm sure I Do like it is a form of getting out the truth is\nThey have I mean the mainstream media hates that Trump has this personal information fire hose and he can Toronto any point in time and just let it ...\nThey want to be the gatekeepers you see CNN wants to decide does he get an interview or not you know does this person's message get out there were not same at MSNBC ABC all these different networks that they they want to be the ones that get to form the narrative it's a lot harder for the narrative Trump but no that's not true you guys are liars and tens of millions of people can see it right away\nThat's why they're so upset about this is why they get so angry and that's wild\nLater on I actually got it a little a little tete a tete with a CNN executive today via Twitter who you don't do it takes issue with the fact that I called out that their coverage will be Elizabeth Warren DNA debacle was hysterical and\nHighly partisan and they were trying to at first kinda help or a little bit and then they got annihilated and so then I go I guess maybe this DNA didn't prove or it's just so obvious it's so obvious\nThey pretend that it's not they pretend that ah\nThe president's the problem you see when he called when he talks about fake news now whenever a journalist anywhere in the world is thrown in prison or is killed by some despotic regime it's Trump's full oh isn't that amazing isn't that isn't that cute\nAre all here here's another do you think that if Trump started saying nicer things about the press\nThat they would stop saying that it's just well no of course not because they like this line they they think this is great it can't be just proven it makes the media feel like a bunch of martyrs and they are a bunch of cry babies\nAnd sure enough\nNow they have a president who calls them out and makes
