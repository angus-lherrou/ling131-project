[noise]\nThose responsible will be brought to justice [laughter]\nYeah yeah yeah yeah yeah\nThat's what the vice president says\nDoes that change any of the ... or any of the junior hearing from the media and there's no\nI actually saw someone said today or I forget that the journals another blue check you know Twitter journal person uh say that Trump's statement where he said there's no place for political violence in this country or threats in this country that that was the bare minimum that he said the bare minimum I'm like\nWell does he have to give us an hour long speech on this or what they're going to criticize the matter what he does\nWhether it's a show gay or this or anything they just they hate him they absolutely hate him\nYou know earlier that actually there were just talking about the president's such a liar oh he's such a liar so terrible noticed you know my objections to Obama that I thought he had bad ideas he wasn't nearly as brilliant as the media pretend that he was\nAnd he was arrogant and he was doing bad things from policy level actually don't have any personal beef with Obama like I didn't I didn't know it wasn't about Obama the guy seems like he's a very nice family seems like he's a good dad I mean there there's a lot of stuff actually I look at a bomb us or you know that's\nThat seems admirable what I thought he was a bad president and I disagree with them I didn't hate him though I didn't go to bed and I think all that that that's come Obama wasn't some maniac but that's how they feel about Trump\nAnd now because some maniac somewhere we don't even know why yet but somebody somewhere sent these bombs now we're supposed to believe what Trump is supposed to be muzzle and here's what they were saying about him earlier in the day is liquid for\nI'm Sorry the president flat out lie saying Congress was working on a plan and they were coming back before the election he gets caught the lie he changes his story\nAgain and says we're going to get food eventually the president thinks you're stupid the president thinks people are stupid where officially and parents and in fact France out\nPresident Trump tried to play to his base with outright false if\nHe's not even trying to hide his life anymore he's handled putting all out there in spreading a lot of lines about non white people to all white crowd to make a clown a lot of what the president saying it's just\nNot true the president seems to me in a bit of the fat free frenzy it's frustration and health oxygen ...\n\nThis is a an an article of faith now have you have to say this all the time\nWhen ever asked them what what's the lie what's the really damaging pernicious live what is the lie on the level of if you like your health care plan you can keep it that President Trump has told one that was done with forethought with malice and that had impact on the lives of tens of millions of Americans\nNegative impact what what is the law that winds up with that but that his crowd size was the biggest ever that he's a stable genius\nYou know a lot of the stuff that he says you and I could recognize as him kind of joking around and talking as normal people do\nThere oh he's a liar oh he's lying you know they're they're always always jump right to\nThe worst possible scenario\nThey never get tired of it either oh my gosh you know in the left in the media they they find endless ways\nTo reach a Lebanon the outrage meter ten is not enough eleven the outrage miracles his brother I Know I I just get frustrated with that too it's it's so tiresome and they're all their calls for civility right that they're being made in bad faith they're not calls for civility they're not really\nFrom a lot of these are prominent leftist\nTheir calls for the right to be silent and start getting pummeled again they like the old\nOrder where we sit around and were polite and we can we as conservatives play by the rules and were nice and we get punched in the face and say oh that was nice but I'm going to keep doing what I Do that's what they want us to go back to Trump doesn't play that game\nThey're not saying let's all be good to each other day defend them up and the restaurants we'll talk more about that later they defend these tactics\nThat it's not just that they happened and they say oh well we can't control everyone there favorable to this stuff\n\nAnd now they're saying we all have to be civil and take the temperature down after Eighteen months of propagandize into their base the president's a traitor or sexist a rapist or a you know a racist or everything\nCrazy going to start a war is a fascist say stop they said about President Trump it's it's like nothing I've ever seen in my life it is like nothing I've ever it truly is that there's nothing that even comes close now they're going to be the civility please come on\nWho takes this seriously if people are these people are really in need of reality check really\nGot Joe Scarborough Scarborough if I if I just can't for a minute here\nI don't know Joe Scarborough never met him dumped we care to\nA but this is a guy who was as chummy chummy buddy buddy with the president as you could possibly be during the ... when it really mattered as a journal to be an objective for and I know scarred wasn't opinion guy but you know he's a member of the media and he had an opportunity to speak truth to power and all that but no he wanted to be cozy with power he wanted to be close to power\nAnd now because Trump has snubbed him in Mika a now because Trump is something that's not the two of them he he goes on these anti Trump rage rants and first to him today is on Christ like I mean this is oh here's what's ... play six\nHistory will look back and Americans will look back with shame that we ever had a president like this one a vet turned his back on the most basic\nNot only the most basic American concepts are we defend our borders and and we should defend our borders people should only getting a here legally what Donald Trump's doing is\nNot only anti American\nI Will just say this is a guy that was raised in the Southern Baptist church\nAt least based on\nThe Bible I read the gospels that I read the good Samaritan story that I read\nIn San Christ like\n\nYeah that's right Joe Scarborough is going back to is oh so Christian roots and are citing the Bible to criticized Trump\nI mean this guy has no shame no shame whatsoever I mean he goes over at MSNBC and uh ... that show up for sale in the morning I hear so much blather and so much nonsense and as long as it's anti Trump you know the audiences\nYou it's good to like the that works really it really is an embarrassment but you know people people believe what they want

Jones now he is a a former marine and he was an ... check so he was all about explosive ordnance\nDisposal Johnny Was was wounded in combat in his role as an EEO detect\nAnd he knows everything about these devices how they're built how you tracked them and what they can do a joy agreed to have you on that thank you so much\nFor having me on the day\nOr so from what we know right now let's just go to war what can we what can we say about these devices bunch pipe bombs any signatures any sophistication or lack there are but what's notable you about these bombs\nWell you know I can only go off really the the information would be giving and and the one picture that's out there so I Want to put that out front it's truly speculative or just go do what we see what we hear 'em in the what we saw it looks like a pipe bomb\nIt had some sort of timing device on the outside of it was doing it for both did\nAnd the idea there is this is a functional bomb what you would have the bomb did either once that time or hit a certain time\nA pre determined time in its past life it would turn on a lie or sell the noise and so what you do you take that same signal that same electrical signals and you re route that into a circuit that detonate the bombs so that one normally the light would come on the bond that ... normally the bell would ring when an alarm clock\nThe bond that nature of the other way it could have been used would be to arm it so it was switches of breaking a circuit than in arming a and arming mechanism is another breaking the circuits so circuits still open\nBut once the arming gets closed and the next thing they close is this which will set it off so we know and and the use of timing devices they're used for one or two things either to predict turban when the bomb goes off or to keep yourself as the bomb maker time to get away from it before it's on and so\nIf this bond with the functional device which I have my own doubts that are suspicious about what I could see in that picture\nBut if it's a if it's a functional device and we certainly have to treat it that way\nThen we would call this a time device or out of their time to arm or trying to detonate and being that it was in a field package and there seems to be no other true mechanism of of the nation than when you kind of have to believe from what we can see from that picture that it's a time to detonate device meaning they said\nYou know a certain amount of hours on that timer and when it runs up it was their radically detonate\nNow that's going to be a very I mean I I Would assume Joey you know I mean this is going to be a very\nUh ... uh I don't know how the sloppy way to try to target an individual right I'd be assuming this was actually sent through the mail to just have a timing device on it and you have to be guessing\nWhen it would be you know it sounds like it's more likely could blow up still a risk to people could really could kill somebody who could blow up in the mail processing center in the mail man's hand perhaps or eight on any number of phase is not including the targeted individual\nWell you know it it it becomes one of those talking points where I really need to think through how much information to divulge than in detail to any audience because you just never know who's listening and there are certain things that you know our best are best kept secrets keep us alive or not go into too much detail\nAbout how boundary made about Ninety percent of what you put into a bomb as readily available at Walmart any information on the Internet there's one or two components really one specific part of the bomb that is really hard to make yourself and it's even harder to get a hold of manufactured\nAnd uh and so what we have right now is if this is a fleet of I speak meaning that it\nCould function as as as it appears to\nThen uh then that components within the pie and if they can exploit or a take apart what is there\nTo recover some of those pieces then perhaps there some signatures so specific parts of the pieces they can\nMore easily point it's in the right direction when I Would say or were you really I'm just like an Austin or the shipping of the package if\nYou know the one that we're looking at now seems to be the hand delivered by courier but there's questions about the postage him was that actually put through a a delivery

WHYY in [noise]\nWe'll be hearing you ... all the little league following you are doing this I mean I I must have ten people have been yelled at until they had the leaf restaurants all conservative is that okay with you I don't know I Am okay with Sarah Sanders secretary Nielsen and Mitch McConnell yes\nMitch McConnell is more dangerous salmonella in that restaurant any why Hillary Clinton distraught and I walk up to an hour you know but I\nIt's not clear whether that should never Hillary she leans there's usually being unpleasant\nAnd something being okay I'll shake your protesting something you're disagreeing about your ... ... children from their parents and I went to dinner at a Mexican restaurant I wouldn't ... if I endorsed third terminal\nSo there you have the big separation okay I especially in a day like today where we're going to be\nA lecture by the left about about stability all of a sudden even mind that that exchange that was him talking to girls and show not tonight but last night uh that exchange\nWas between a very senior and trusted Clinton Hillary Clinton aide Felipe rains and of course Tucker\nWho people will say looks like book bucking talk or or people say that I look like Tucker but they don't know if they don't know anything because clearly Tucker looks like me uh but\nThey're having a search engine you noticed that that he makes it clear range makes it clear that to him and this is true of many other Democrats are I Know the harassment\nAnd stocking and mob tactics of the left against politicians are people they don't like that is acceptable they don't say oh\nSorry this is just some older a thing you know this is just some other group that we don't we don't endorse or we're not associated with this isn't representative of us they actually try to justify this behavior\nAnd I keep having to point out to people that the\nThe line between if are at a restaurant and forty people were up in my face and I was with my girlfriend or my spouse or whatever a worry musical family members or friends and people were cursing at me and yelling at me and threatening me\nThe line between that activity and someone getting their nose broken on either by me or buy them right I mean on one side of the other is that line is\nVery thin very small objects as one person who thinks they're going to give you a little shows one person who just crossing easily they're already screaming your space\nThere already yelling at a restaurant there already embarrassing you humiliating you and trying to intimidate you you really think that or for one of them all of a sudden you know give a little shrug it a little portion and things get out of control you know the answer to that\nBut what showing poured ears that the left I you know as soon as those idiots\nWent after Nancy Pelosi I said and every other conservative but I Know and and respect him out and said those people are are more on what they're doing is a disgrace and not only is their behavior wrong but by acting in that way and then they really did the progressive left or to the ... the Democratic party a big favor\nOh by the way they talk specifically about that it rains 'cause they they have to pretend there's some consistency Rangel's say as he did a Carlson oh no that's okay\nWhat did it blows he's okay put Twenty one\nSo is it okay to scream at Nancy Pelosi until she leaves a restaurant and the answer is no it's not okay I've never okay I think what happened that she thought she was fine the other day she was ... kind of a fundraiser and a group\nWas she was with her to do any you don't see anybody up and said Nancy Pelosi I'm going to yell at you until you leave the palm because you have a ... policy I disagree with [noise]\nI think an old person let's say you got to go out and that's not what happened was I just don't do it because they're not ... in the last ...\nLook I think it needs to be done and I appreciate the Tucker set it and you know thank God that people like Doug or have the kind of plot for may do or they can push back on this nonsense conservative we had a political culture and in our political culture in this country is unacceptable to\nYou know surround people when they are engaged in private activity now who say they're in public but I mean they're not they're not out of you know they're not on stage they're not look I think the behavior when they're on stage is bad but it's just it's just different degrees right one thing if you want to make a lot of noise and heck oh people on Capitol Hill\nI think that's ... stupid and you should get arrested but I don't think that it's you know I don't I don't think it's necessarily dangerous to the people writing your Capitol police there and there's you know those cameras there but when you're in a restaurant and you think that you know ... where does that stop\nWhat about waiting for somebody outside their home you know I Wonder would Democrats think about that can forty people wait\nWait outside your apartment in in uh on Capitol Hill in downtown Washington DC if you're a member of the house the Senate and and they can they follow you can they fall over you go you know this whole notion of there in public so they can be a target of or disdain now oh they're in a restaurant I mean I really get angry when I hear every Democrat said things like\n... ... just you know enjoy their frog legs as I sit there at the table well people are losing their health care of and just\nThis childish talking points stupidity you\nKnow you're a lot of the older ... chicken while the poor people of America are suffering ...\nThey they try to create this whole near to justify their whiny childish ... which is really a very\nCommon and very widespread characteristic of\nActivists Democrats their whiny screaming children and they act out and they throw tantrums and then they want the media to tell them that those tantrums are okay and the media does\nAn important political figures I mean as much as you think he's got a leap rains are Ryan represents named the board so this is this is the distinction\nThey're not hiding that they're okay with this behavior not only do they do this stuff and we really don't or at least we rarely our side rarely does they celebrate they endorse when their side is engaged in mob tactics\nAnd they really hope that the American people forget that before election [noise]\nReally interesting study I saw this week about how people don't really trust Facebook that much anymore will that's really not

Fox News President Trump called on the country to come together after a series of packages containing pipe bombs were sent to high ranking Democrat and CNN's New York offices\nThe left realizes that

Democrats in general\nThey are not able to tell the American people what they really think and what they really believe and maintain their electoral prospects you know they're they're the ones you always have to play this game on things like immigration which is why that Obama soundbite where he said you know you can't\nYou can't sneak into this country it's not allowed or we're not going to let people just surge into into this place\nSome people as a I think it was ... at the New York times wrote oh I thought Obama was you know we're so are\nYou know so pro illegal it's like yeah he's lying when he says that he wants to secure the border she can't she can't figure that out apparently\nOh but you but you see this time and again we're the left is just being dishonest about what they really want and um you know by the way this this was new\nYou have ah\nMSNBC where the guy blaming the Reagan Administration but they play quid tend please\nSay that they also need to call out the fair Margaret Traub as normal one other thing I Would add to that with Democrats should it ought to say\nIs that people playing some of these countries are playing some of these countries because of conditions created by Republican foreign policy particularly in the Reagan Administration so we have a problem with those images we can go back over time and see why these countries on the condition that there\nThat's right folks it's American foreign policies fault that Honduras is a a hell of a whole of crime and corruption and violence\nIt's America's fault you see every country anywhere in the world that's in bad shape is somehow awful that's the view of the left and it also informs\nTheir immigration policy don't think that that's just a throw away because the progressive in this country believe that America has only become so rich and powerful on the backs\nOf the third world and essentially the non white regions of the blow that is a widespread left wing beliefs you see it in in uh in academia you see it and media uh this is not unusual at all\nAnd in fact some of the Obama administration approach to foreign policy was also informed by this idea that America is why there was all the bowing and the apology toward you know America has has a lot to apologize for\nAnd the dysfunctions in Central America or somehow according to left is the fault of America and therefore we shouldn't\nYou're saying hold on a second ... you know we we can't force in American taxpayers to subsidize all the dysfunction all the problems in Central America that's not fair they say oh no no no you owe that to them see\nThis is a fascinating and very destructive world you left has but it informs the Democratic party's foreign policy and the basics of it or that anything that we have\nTo do when it comes to immigration what is the weather is taking in refugees are taking in illegals that is going to be exact cost upon the American taxpayer is completely justified because we owed them you see it's our fault that these countries aren't more prosperous are so corrupt\nUm it's it's always our fault and left view and really what it is a globalized victim allergy\nLike that that other countries there people are victims of the United states and therefore the Democrats need to be in charge in this country to make amends for all that victimization I Know it's like we're sitting and and having some kind of a psychiatric session whenever we talk with the Democrats but that's just where they are\nThey have unfortunately embraced than ideology that is detached from

which remember it wouldn't be the instability of a mob it wouldn't be the instability of an entire movement it would just be maybe one wacko\nWho is sending what increasingly looks like a guard bombs\nTo very very prominent Democrats and leftists and\nThey want to lecture all of us and they claim that they're not do it which just goes to show you how much gas lighting goes on in our conversations with the left\nI I Will give you examples of us we will spend a bit of our time this hour working through just how dishonest the left is being with all of this just how delusional they really all\nBut I did want to spend them with you first on what we what we now know about uh about these bombs in fact I could have been a shift here from the attorney general my buddy Jeff Sessions like with a please\n... apartment is responding to the suspicious packages\nThat have been sent to several political leaders and a media outlet in the last last few days yesterday I spoke with FBI

already know this doesn't it doesn't affect my vote doesn't affect my feeling about Trump or the Republican Party or anything else that has nothing to do with safety threat this is one\nVery very stupid and ah and agree\nJust an evil jerk I wanted to use another word but we're on radio oh who is going to spend the rest of his life in prison\nIt's just a question of how soon we put him through that process but the judge bombs that have been found so far that could they have gone off could they have detonated under any circumstances\nThere was a press conference today with the NYPD in fact one of my uh some of my former colleagues were named in the press conference I had a bit of nostalgia\nBut they talked about how the bombs that haven't gone off it kept getting asked the question by the press are they real bombs or the ... the YPG is going to have to say you have to treat these as real threats because just imagine for a moment\nThat the largest police department the country's as no these are these are does and then the next suspicious packages that goes out whether it's by the same person or not but look similar\nPerson opens it up and goes well I Know what to do it and then we have a tragedy\nSomeone loses limbs site maybe dogs from one of these pipe bombs or the NYPD can't take that risk not yet can't say that these bombs wouldn't have gone off under any circumstances but I'm here to tell you that I think\nThat is increasingly likely to be the case\nAnd if that is in fact what's going on here let's just take a step back I Know I'm not supposed to say I know I'm not supposed to go there but then again\nI actually professionally did this on like Ninety percent of the clowns going on MSNBC and CNN to talk about it and in the past when they've tried to tell me if those places what is and it's not real when it comes to terrorism or they have tended to get buck slapped rather hard\nHere's what I see if you were trying to come up\nWith a means to change the entire national conversation away from Kavanaugh which was toxic for Democrats in red states and Democrats in states where Democrats were struggling the Kavanaugh debacle self inflicted wound was toxic\nAnd the caravan making its way up through Mexico the far left activists when the Democratic party loves this story are but the people and places like Indiana and Tennessee and Nevada who are figuring out who to vote for gas what they don't much like the idea that the Democrat Party\nIs effectively an open borders party\nPrivileges certain people from certain places of the world getting around the rest of the immigration system because it benefits the Democrats electoral prospects they don't like that and so if you wanted to switch that narrative\nIf that was the purpose it has been master fully achieved here now is in fact possible\nSome would even say probable I'm I'm not quite there yet I Need I Need more evidence is it possible problem this is one\nIncredibly stupid reckless and a ... and really her doing whatever side he thinks he's on doing tremendous damage to it is it possible that this is somebody who wears a mock a hat and and loves Trump's so much they thought that the way to\nThe way to show support was to violate hundreds of federal statutes threaten people terrified people and in the process put himself in a sure fire\nA position to be spending the rest of his life in federal prison is that possible absolutely that's possible I'm not discounting that at all we may find out that that is the case\nHowever am I willing to discount am I willing to push aside that\nIf this was in fact somebody whose purpose was to change the conversation right before the midterm I don't think anybody believes this is a coincidence in terms of the time and if the purpose was to was to push aside conversations that were damaging to the Democratic and in the process\nMake the anti Trump media seem sympathetic and give them something to talk about that might sway some moderates to their side just in time the election would this be a successful strategy yes I Am talking about a false flag strategy\nI'm not saying it happened I'm saying would these things all be true if this were a false black\nAnswers obviously yes so that's why I'm unwilling to just discount this out of hand and that's why I I refuse to take the position that\nWell because the left has already started not just to blame the right for this but to blame the president of the United states for this\nThat's where I think we have to draw a very hard and fast line the Democrats have created not alone but primarily predominantly they have created this vicious toxic political environment\nThey have never thought for one moment there was anything decent are acceptable about Trump they wanted to remove him from office I even had an author on impeachment on my on my TV show or the week you said yeah this is the first time ever that there's been impeachment talk for a president who had not even been sworn in\nThey have a mass delusion problem they're having a collective nervous breakdown in slow motion over Trump and his movement\nAnd that's why things have become so tense and so nasty and so vicious so would one individual change that dynamic you know\nWe will hold our final conclusions until we have more evidence but in the meantime\nI'm leaving open all reasonable options and some that the Democrats want to shut down or a long way from deserving a jam packed\nShow ... it's not just the bombs that I by the way so uh I I Want you to be sure you stick around we'll talk about Megan Kelly ousted from NBC\nOr what that tells us about the culture right now by the way I don't really have all that much to say about NBC ... and sweat neck referred to deejay for possible conspiracy ally around the cabin all thing we got a lot a lot of stuff\nTo get through so we'll be right back WHYY\n\nDo you have something you want to say but feel you just can't express it especially on today social media perhaps it's because you don't have a safe place where your opinions matter and where they can truly be hurt that's why I'm happy to tell you about a new alternative media site Snoopy dot com\nSnoopy is an unbiased platform that's all about conversation and community Snoopy not only encourages freedom of expression\nYou know when they go low we go [noise] [laughter] they go low\nWe can read it I Will be happy to see the Republicans test of whether or not a mission for a fight on a whole range of issues I suspect they will find I we talked with these folks because they potentially have the best answers so I Know who they're to kick\nSome pretty tough rhetoric there from a bunch of different Democrats now I don't want to be the word police but I just would know that they're the ones who were calling for civility and they act like\nThe Republicans are the ones who are always saying things that are that are syrup they're straight up saying that this Trump's fall by the way it did they jumped over they'd gone beyond saying that the perpetrator is likely a conservative based on the targets to saying that this is from\nTrump's fault or despite the fact that the president has already come out and condemn this whole thing like with ...\nKnown as a nation can succeed that tolerates violence or the threat of violence as a method of political intimidation co workers your or control we all know that\nThere is one way or the ... largest agreements gold peacefully at the ballot box the media also has a responsibility to ...\nA civil town and stop the endless hostility and constant negative and oftentimes false attacks in stores\nNow I I think that the president should be completely allowed to say that but that I think some of the statements that he's made have set the meaty off even more\nBecause they they think they're in charge and they have the power to just construct a narrative here they think that they're allowed to just say the president is the reason this is happening and everyone has to say you know what you're right\nThe media has spoken that's the way it's going to be they they like the John Brennan version of events play six\nUnfortunately I think Donald Trump too often has helped to incite a some of these feelings of\nAnger not by less um when he points to acts of violence or also talks about [noise] you know a swinging at somebody or from the press the media of hoping that this is going to make it clear to him about what he has done as you are to for as far as a lot of this rhetoric\nReally is counterproductive it is on American\n... is on American says the guy who was a senior intelligence officer who without any evidence\nHas accused publicly accused the sitting president of the United states of treason which as we know is not just the crime that is a pro scribes view the constitution itself but is punishable under us federal code by the death penalty or so one would think that John Brennan is not exactly\nThe best person to be carrying the torch of civility now but then again one would be mistaken if one thought that the last ten any decency or any honesty to deal with your sleep range is making a name for himself being the craziest double click with seven\nThis is someone who has a weaponized\nTrump's Twitter feed and made it into a hit list what we've seen to date as someone who whips up the crowd he is addicted to their response and their response they are addicted to his\nUm betrayal and while he might think that he's just putting on the TV all you need is one person who doesn't realize that and one person who thinks it's okay to do this someone tried to murder Iraq and Michelle Obama bill and Hillary Clinton\nThis is not a coincidence\nSo now Trump is responsible for any single individual psychopath in the country that takes his words I mean something there not\nAlso did believe brings forget that just a few weeks ago Donald Trump junior

getting access to snap on they didn't grind up the shards of glass intended to name and kill\nLike who did something else [noise]\nUndermined American values and ... those who dare to question his conduct\nCanada that type of favorites hysteria based on race and religion and political party and it has the potential to lead to what we saw happened yesterday and we don't even know if it's over\nA obvious question is does the president bears some responsibility obviously not for the the bomb making or or the or the recipients\nOf but does he bear responsibility for the tone that allowed it sure sure he does and that's part of the reason why I never endorse them and I've never been personally critical\nOf him but yeah it does bear responsibility for the divisions are he has the biggest megaphones Trump they say is\nNot responsible for the bombs but he is responsible for\nThe bombs\nThat's the formulation that you get here from the anti Trump ... that's really what they're saying I'm In I'm not going to tell you that the reason this happened is Trump I'm just saying that Trump is one of the reasons this happened\nThis is why people despise the press the press deserves to be despised Russia's full of a bunch of self important cry babies and liars obviously not all people I'm In the press technically but a whole vast majority fall into that category\nAnd they have completely jumped the shark here or there not waiting to find out who's responsible for this they're not even putting this on conservative ideology or on the right in general they are going right to the president dishes yet again another attack on the president folks this is trumped arrangements syndrome that we're seeing\nThe president that states is responsible for this guy sending bombs to all these people were so so I just need to understand the president's not allowed to criticize\nRock Obama's presidency not allowed to make fun of Hillary Clinton not allowed to say anything nasty about Eric Holder and it is that now the new standard\nIf President Trump were inciting violence meaning you should be violent against people or here or violent acts you should do then he would be guilty of inciting violence I Know this is the problem with ... you have to talk to them like the first graders\nSo to some of the first graders lifting 'cause you're smarter than lives but that's what you have to do you have to walk them through this\nNone other than a Mr fake tapper himself over CNN Today tweeted out that in response to Sarah Huckabee Sanders saying that the first thing the media did was blamed Trump he said that's not the first thing\nWe evacuated CNN which is true in terrible and CNN should not have had to be evacuated because nobody should have ever threaten them and that's an awful thing but then he went on to say no one blames Trump not one person at CNN [noise] uh no that's not true\nAnd I know which half or would you 'cause he likes this game he'd say no one blames Trump for the bombs oh okay that's right no one thinks that Trump was in the west wing putting together these bombs with his bare hands or whatever okay we're in the east wing no one thinks that what's happening but they're all saying including the president of the CNN network\nThat the environment around all of this\nIs from ... creation Trump's fault and the environment led to the bombing so in essence from does have responsibility for that is what they're saying\nAnd that's exactly what Mika Brzezinski did because I think her audience that's the end at the MSNBC demands it you know the intellectual honesty be damned they simply do not care it does not\nMatter to them that what they are doing is indefensible and that is wrong on so many levels to talk about divisions in this

the next couple of weeks when the elections take place\nAnd the president's going to continue to lay out that case but at the same time we're condemning violence and calling on all Americans to come together\nThere's a difference between I comments made an action taken the president is certainly not responsible for sending suspicious packages to someone no more than Bernie Sanders was responsible for a supporter of his shooting up or Republican baseball field\nThat should be a pretty pretty clear line right\nThe standard here Asian some big shock it's not some huge surprise it's not something that we need to take a step back from an ... hold on a second ...\nHow do we how do we do this how do we deal with this right you are not responsible for what someone else does because of your politics you may be responsible for violence if you're directly incite violence and that's why even with our First Amendment there are\nSome exceptions for incitement to violence right if you're in

say I think we should have lower taxes in this country and then someone hears that and they run down and they light the IRS building on fire you are not responsible for that\nOkay because if that were
