I'm\nWithin reason but I remember the feeling of\nBrock Obama with a a weak economy and I are clearly deficient governing philosophy and foreign policy ... an empty suit administration if there ever was one\nAnd going into his second term after he beat Romney just thinking to myself what is it that so many of my fellow Americans do not understand that I had to wrestle with that or grapple with it\nSo much of it was objects and so much of it was Romney's unwillingness to rise to the kind of fight he was in he didn't really understand Trump understands and he rose to this occasion so to Capitol I was proud of both of them and proud to have defended both of them in this whole process\nBut the biggest takeaway for me from all this is just how insane the left has become\nLess ... has turned into a kind of mass panic a widespread delusion a collective nervous breakdown\nIt's no longer enough for people to disagree with others based on politics they have to shriek into this into the air\nThey have to bang on doors they have to attack old men holding signs they after harassed people in the streets chase them out of restaurants and threatening letters docks members of the Senate threatened to dock their shoulder\nThere\nThis word over the weekend of senators who had been a deluge with threats against themselves against families against grandchildren of senators\nA Fox anchor was stalked into the subway we'll talk later on about that a writer for Stephen Colbert bears crappy late night program tweeted out that she was quote just glad we ruined his life\nAbout Brett Kavanaugh\nYou had protesters clawing like crazed animals at the Supreme Court doors\n\nAnd yes you even had Taylor Swift come out in favor of the Democratic party in Tennessee T swift how could you know she's very shares a vision is something quite different\nOr the left has lost it\nUh they they no longer seek to meet us on a battlefield of ideas we're reason even plays a role nowadays emotion it'd slogans is the mob not just cheering on one side\nBut demanding veal butter ration of the other demanding the arrest of political opponents demand and be harassment of people trying to serve their country people who have served honorably in some cases for decades\nThey don't want to just beat us on the battlefield of ideas they want to be just literally with sticks and fish than rocks\nThey threaten violence because to them ideas that shattered their own sense of their worth and their wellbeing they are triggered by our our thoughts and that triggering they think\nJustifies violent response we saw this in some of the antics of ... over the weekend attacking people on streets acting like the maniacs they are\nAnd we see this from the way that the less reacts to political defeat we want conservatives won the good guys one with capital\nAnd notice there's really not any gloating there's not an endless victory brain going on television there is in the sense of\nNow that we've beat the other side in the war let's go round and bay and that all the survivors were not rubbing their faces in it although a little bit of spike no football perhaps as an order\nBecause to us this was just what shouldn't have been done this was just this was right life goes on\nThere are other battles to fight there are other arguments to be had\nBut also in the conservative mind today in America you can have a separation between who you vote for what policies you support what you what you believe in your politics and who you are in your day to day life\nI don't mean that you don't live your ideals and beliefs but I mean you don't feel the need to old me exist in that fear of what his political\nTo be a good conservative you have to focus on things like treating people with respect acting with honor and decency and kindness things that the left is media tends to sneer at things that pop culture dominated by the left residuals\nBut you realize that you can't be a true conservative without doing those things and it's just so much easier in so much more self gratifying so much more satisfying to the cell\nTo show up and scream about how ... will be the death of millions of women just scream about how the patriarchy is alive and well dressed in stupid costumes and carry idiotic placards and act like the country is falling apart and democracies in peril because\nProcess is still respected in the Senate\nBecause the presumption of innocence is a principle that we have maintained\nUnderstand this if they have gotten away with this plan if the left and managed to sink cabin though it was the beginning of the end of any kind of honest forthright and decent discourse in this country\nBecause anyone who was an effective spokesperson for the other side anybody who was able to wield power and authority on the right and stand up to the progressive project would have been a target for the most vicious smears and character assassination\nAnd there would have been this sense that once the allegation is out there that's all that's required the allegation he's the verdict\nAnd because they were deprived of that secret weapon because the left isn't going to be able to do that they had a complete meltdown click with all of it\n[laughter]\n\n[laughter]\n\n\nWe\nPhone [laughter] [laughter]\n[noise]\n\nThese people are on well\nIt's not just that I think they're wrong that their ideas are bad that they would be destructive to the country where there to be implemented that to give it\nThere's something different now we're not arguing over what the top marginal tax rate should be with the left today\nWe're not arguing over how we should pay for various health care entitlement programs although that's a part of the discussion that's not where the focus of the fight is now the main effort the central argument has to do with whether the left except defeat\nWhether it can handle the fact that it's not always going to get its way and in fact the aid if you will of the progressive left right the ... the part of the mind that is we're instinctive impulses lie\nThe end of the progressive left has become violent and dangerous an unreasonable and perpetually outraged it's just not going to lead to good things for anyone\nIs not going to lead to happy places for this country and I do fear it's only going to get worse because instead of learning

of any corroborating evidence including no evidence from her very best friend was present\nAt the party I could not concluded that Brett Kavanaugh was her assailant\nTrying to have it always and you can't say somebody as credible and then completely question their story he struck a nerve to me and what she said and how she voted because that's political cowardice um\nThat is somebody who is pretending to be a feminist that that had fake feminism\nFake feminism a former Hillary Clinton hack their Psaki said wait is that is she ... her no no I'm Sorry she's a former Obama administration spokesperson for the state department thought she was I'm sure she's rather than going to the notice how quickly they will just attack\nAttack women who do not go along with the left wing feminist agenda\nRight away they'll attack viciously too because when a woman does not go along and really undermined the power structure it's like within the Islamic faith with the radicals if you were an apostate if you had been within the faith and left\nThe hatred that much more because you are more of a danger because the faithful will see or departure and think why did that person do the same is true with radical leftist feminist they see a woman who breaks ranks with them and their response is oh maybe\nMaybe we need well they say we need to destroy his person right away because other women will say hold on a second maybe I can think for myself to maybe there's something else here\nOn and there were there were some people who came through not just Lindsey Graham who I've given lots of props to already on the show there were others\nI gave Jeff Flake a very hard time I think that he gamble with the Kavanaugh nomination by delaying it a week some would say though had he not delayed it would not have had the votes I don't know if that's true or not but it certainly seemed\nLike a a cowardly move at the time to me that said\nWhen push came to shove flake did the right thing here\nAt the moment he had to do it so I'm not saying you know he he's not Spartacus either but he deserves credit mansion in West Virginia\nAlso deserves some credit but let's also keep it real West Virginia is a state where the sentiment was overwhelmingly in favor of Kavanaugh and against this obvious political hit\nCollins from Maine yes I think she did the right thing here I also think that all the radical leftist feminist types calling her terrible names and sending her hateful messages for weeks and weeks trying to intimidate her\nTo threaten her into going along with the leftist feminist agenda I think that didn't help their case\nAnd then that brings me to Murkowski now\nDon't know about wait wait before getting Murkowski\nHiking I Hope I Hope that people in her home state deal a deal her quite a review for what she's already down five points\nUh but I really do hope that they manage to find a way to hold her accountable for what was an unbelievably lame decision um you know North Dakota in should oust high camp at the ... possible moment\nAnd then that leaves us with Murkowski All right now Murkowski is not somebody who's ever been impressive to me at all and I'm not surprised that she she pulled distant and she's not up until twenty twenty or twenty twenty ... twenty twenty two\nUm she's not up for quite a while so her calculation is clearly she can massage this issue later on you know take some heat now and then and then she'll figure it out or take less feed now really Mitchell figure it out later I Hope the American people are accountable\nUm I Hope that the people of Alaska\nThey stand for the you know I'm going to hold my breath and attack you with a ... if you don't agree with me\nAnd they won't even have these so called adults of the Senate or in the media which you know media as much as ... but they wouldn't have them say that they shouldn't do that at least she just dodge the question the answer to this is like you know the answer to if somebody asks you if you're a God you say yes\nYou know maybe that's from the answer to each somebody or should somebody follow the person into a restaurant and harassed them because of their politics and so that has no it is on a quickly without question\nNo but\nShe won't say it because she knows where she to say that you would offend the less it would offend\nThe activists the Emily Retta cows skis and Amy Schumer is than others you love to just pray and you know a list them all I Love the parade around and get arrested by the big mean police and the whole thing this is\nPart of their political culture now the shrill missed the nastiness the shrieking the anger the rage the the public demonstrations of psychological distress that's a defining characteristic on the left no\nRight to have really a a nervous breakdown\nIn public that is what left ism has become and you\nNotice it here and this is we've had all these different examples you know your real Rand Paul have is well rather Rand Paul's wife wrote a letter about how not only was he attacked and almost beaten to death\nBy a lunatic left wing or or who just hated Rand Paul or was it was not some you know neighbor disputed hater rampart tack and from behind them was killed him he had pneumonia he was terrible pain that's after some lunatic left wing Bernie Sanders supporter credit shoot Rand Paul on a baseball diamond in Alexandria\nA Hodgkinson James Hodgkinson the shooter the name you should know the left likes to forget it very conveniently um but you know his wife read about how she gets threats her church child or children get a get threats and prominent Democrats make jokes now they're in the media or in the Democratic party make jokes about the attack\nOn Rand Paul as oh so how funny this is something cute that they should laugh about people are disgusted\nI keep saying they should be ashamed but they they have no honor and so they don't feel anything when their honor is lost it can't be ... based because there's nothing there to begin with that's one of the problems when you're fighting against the left is that they don't they don't feel the loss of honor because they have nothing to begin with\nBut you know Brian kill me is a guy that I I don't I don't know Brian I work in the before I I Know everybody\nIn conservative media at least by reputation if not knowing them through working with them or personally I Know everybody British and Brian is universally considered a by everyone I've ever smoked a really\nNice decent guy whether you like his uh his\nOwner persona or his analysis you that's that's a relative he's a nice guys are supposed to be a really good I don't know of only work them or the other people I could tell your good guy Brian I can only say you know I've heard is really nice guy and I've always going to enjoy my interactions\nEven if he was let's just say he was in Olbermann level jackass but she's not let's just say he was he would not deserve what happened to him over the weekend where he was\nStockton harassed by a couple a left wing 'cause you know are there any other kind these days activists comedians here some of the audio from it play eight\n... where's your accused of sexually harassing Gretchen Carlson [noise]\n[noise] [noise]\nI don't know that there aren't as strong in front of you know what I mean if you want Donald Trump just say\nOr do felt this guy 'cause he's the only person in America that Donald Trump Clinton [noise]\nTrying to get a criminal creator bowed out not\nHeard from and you think about what you're doing it\nNow I don't know those idiots are and when I can tell you when I say this and I say this knowing full well at some point I might have to come on air and explain to you that you know I got into\nA a a scuffle and a lot of these media types you know they\nThey think that there are you know impervious to this kind of thing they think that that's not something to worry about but I Would not deal well with some a\nLeft wing hack following me into the subway look is one thing to wait outside somebody's home and do the ambush interview thing I think that's pretty tasteless I don't like it when conservatives do it either\nI think it's pretty tasteless unless there's a real news reason to do it right unless somebody's refusing to answer questions about something that's really newsworthy it's different in the halls of the Senate it's different in a public space a public building with somebody who's a public official\nThat does you know there's a difference you waiting for waiting for whether it's Mitch McConnell or you know Dianne Feinstein in the whole the Senate building to ask a question versus waiting outside the home\nThat's weird there are boundaries year but this goes even beyond that because not only was there the the ambush interview component of this\nDinner was the following him into the subway so that's really ... now you're not just going up to somebody and they walk past do you leave them alone I think that's aggressive but that's done this is following them down in the subway getting in the same subway car\nPublicly trying to humiliate him and then trying to kind of whip up an angry mob against him in the subway\nCar what if somebody in the subway car you know who heard that Brian kill me there's a racist what if that person down and Brian space and would apply and you know felt threatened what if you shut that person what if the Fighting Sioux what if somebody got really hurt that's not a hard thing\nCreate as a possibility here in your mind because they have these these these more on one of the comedians or creating a combustible situation they are creating a scenario in which would not be difficult for there'd be an escalation of physical violence\nAnd you have to think that when they do this time and again when they create these kinds of situations that so clearly could turn into a violent confrontation", "year": "2018", "show_name": "The Buck Sexton Show", "city": "Springfield", "day": "08"}
