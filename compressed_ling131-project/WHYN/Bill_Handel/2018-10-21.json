look like as of this moment there in really good shape to control the Senate\nAnd a really bad shape to continue their control of the house\nIt was kind of mean [noise] I mean look at the ... dream policies that the left is looking to push in through the Democratic party free healthcare\nSingle payer and I'm Sorry single payer health care free health care free college I'm a repeal the taxes they are looking for an even bigger a infrastructure package than what Donald Trump was even a asking for\nAnd you mentioned health care Medicare for all and twenty Thirteen Bernie Sanders proposed this and got zero cosponsors zero he was the only one who publicly supported now the you look at the top ten CNN has a list of the top ten or ... democratic candidates which by the way will not be enough to ... to cover the field there's going to be a lot more than anything\nUh but I mean everybody with the exception of Joe Biden\nSo I Will not be surprised at all if he comes out and it does endorse Medicare for all all the big names are for it already there are many of them are co sponsors of the bill uh it seems to be this I mean the idea that we in two thousand ten and eleven were being called racist for suggesting what they wanted was single payer\nAnd now here they are ... the entire field is endorsing single payer health care\nI think credible you know we were scare mongers and racist for saying it yeah so I I just want to go through there's there's three stories will go through this tomorrow but I ... I\nWent to ... um Cortez was out of this weekend we have to eliminate the electoral college hey no that is a fundamental um a a a fundamental aspect\nOf what brought the states together in the first place the state said we don't want the big states telling us what we can do and if the big states can control everything well then ... what do we have it\nCan't be that way so we had the electoral college we are one stayed away from losing the electoral college anyway you lose Texas and you have New York California and Texas the rest of the country doesn't matter it will be those three states you lock those three states up and it doesn't matter anymore\nThat's pretty frightening pretty frightening\nSo now we're talking about taking apart the electoral college which would make all of the red states really pretty much in consequential yeah I mean it certainly would change the way the founders thought about the idea of people being elected right I'm going to do is just just appeal to the big cities\nAnd by the way this this uh this is an idea that um and it's not just democratic support for getting rid of the electoral college I Know Trump sports at for example throwing um I I you know I'm not a big fan of the national popular vote or certainly not what our founders had in mind but\nUh there is a there's some contingency on both sides of the aisle that actually believe this is the right way to go which I mean you that gets you just basically a country run by cities I mean as you know it'd be which it may not want that like as a Republican is certainly don't understand why you'd want it but ...\nAgain like it shouldn't be that way ... says you should\nRun themselves in the cities can run whatever they want them and the rural areas can do what they want why do we all have to what they want why do we all have to live under somebody else's thumb\nI don't want to live under a farmer's thumb no farmers should make the although I'd feel better with this than the other way around no ... of the people in farms and farmland trying to dictate rules that are good for them\nBut I also have to be applied to the city it's ridiculous right and it's headlined\nThe house and Senate both exist to give a balance to that so that ... not not one side can tell the truth out\nRight and you know no it's actually it's it's it's goes further than this if you would have if you could er race the mistake of the uh of the progressive under Wilson where they changed the meaning of the Senate\nThe way they got elected yeah it it used to be that the house was the place where the people could move and move quickly so things can be passed\nBecause there was a disaster and things can be passed quickly then the next the the first check on the balance of power the first check on that power\nWas to go through another body that was a lot slower the Senate people are always like parents too slow it was designed to be that way so you go through another body that was much lower but it wasn't just that it was lower\nIt was also supposed to be men or women that were selected by their state legislature now what would that do that would make sure that those guys are beholden to their state\nNot to the rest of the country not figures in national politics for Iraq and I shouldn't care what uh what's his face in New York is says shouldn't care when Hillary Clinton was Senator Barack Obama was center I shouldn't care about that\nBecause they would be focused on their state\nAnd they would be making sure that the federal government would not be eating into the power of their state then it goes to the president and the president is only supposed to veto thing if he\nFinds it unconstitutional now they'll say I think this is unconstitutional but I'll sign it was way no that's the opposite this the opposite way\nYou're supposed to veto it\nNot if you don't like it if you find it unconstitutional\nIt's unconstitutional then it would go to the Supreme Court we've screwed up the balance of power so much and that's why you have this story today\nThe United States Senate is a failed institution you also have this one from Fox the case for abolishing the Supreme Court\nAnd this story the constitution of the United states has failed\nOr you just arguing for king right with these the several stories in a row the mic give you the argument for it came right\nI mean okay really they failed or have we not been using them properly you know it's it's like it's like going out into the woods with a a Swiss army knife\nAnd saying I've been trying to I've been trying to cut down trees and split lumber and this Swiss army knife has failed\n[laughter] or no you're not using it properly that's not what it was meant for and I would also argue the failure part right and you're talking about ... what is basically the biggest success story in global history the United states of America the fact that it has its problems is is well documented but the idea that you'd call it a failure is patently insane insane\nAbsolutely insane All right let's go through a couple of other things how about the Portland mayor who the hell is Ted Wheeler and how did he ever become mayor of Portland or Portland but that's how I I'm Sorry I'm Sorry I'm Sorry\nSo you know the ... the Portland mayor ah refused to let the tops intervene when ... was just directing traffic\nExcuse me ... ... can anybody just get up and start directing traffic in Portland and they just didn't I just go on the street can you imagine what would have happened to us in New York City of you would have started directing traffic oh my gosh you might be disappeared\nI mean especially if it was a union job would be you'd be in the bottom of the river [laughter] what what what laws do you even have in Portland now\nYou can just go direct traffic you can break an old man's window he's driving and he's like no I'm not gun or you're young women they break his window and chased him down\nPolice nothing nothing\nNow I don't know if you saw the uh the mob in yes and I did use the N word gosh\nI don't know if you saw the mob in Portland but they had a a a law and order march ... showed up for the law and order march because they of course in Portland now or the law suit browns shirt stuff started beating\nKicking\nBurning flags whatever\nThat's pretty scary and and the mayor ... released a statement at a press conference where he said I was appalled by what I saw in the video\nBut I support the police's decision not to intervene how how how can you how can you support that decision I I don't I mean I guess the the just the idea of look this is wrong but we want to make it any worse\nHe's trying to make it sound as if um the police this is his angle\nFor the mainstream our police can do no right they they act and they're just thugs they don't act and their do nothing's\nSo they have no way to win it's a great observation there are two political parties

can you be forced to accept property and then the case in a case of a A N good for you by the way of saying no in the case of a\nTime share that's not property that's a liability ... that that's what it is so no you can just simply say uh you know whoever the trustee is say please do not transfer the property to my name I have no interest in being an owner of this property do whatever the hell you want with it but uh I'm done and\nCould they go back to the state somehow\nTheoretically they could but they're not going to they're not going to ... they're not going to see the state uh it's they're going to walk away from it Dr ... thank you very much okay yeah I mean I mean could they go after\nThe state of course for breach of contract or state does the money but then it gets interesting because I I guess theoretically the trustee would have negotiate with the time share company to pay it off and get a get rid of it because\nYou've got the time share company could sue the estate because he's still owes the money dead or not and\nUh but that would stop\nOr the estate from being distributed\nBecause it has to be enough money put into that to cover the cost of a the time share I mean it becomes a mess\nSo timeshare companies normally just walk away or that's it you try to get him to walk away anyway but I mean the bottom line is you're crazy to get into a timeshare that's for starters\nEspecially now with type shares cause they're no longer you know on her own the property it used to be you'd let's say you're at a time share you buy one week writer two weeks or you would

Brennan founder alright what's your question um how do I get my book that you are doing the right\nTo it yeah I think so based on what you said because if he's the one that put it in a counter that if ah it it's\nNot susceptible or it is susceptible to a ring around the counter are all based on mouthwash I mean you you're the one that just described it perfectly hey what do you expect there won't be a bottle of mouthwash\nOn the counter\nWhat ... what did you expect you're the one that put in the wrong material and are there are a now I don't know if you know this but if you go to one of these a marble yards these rock ... yards or counter or manufacturers put encounters there is specifically a anti mouthwash counters that you know that\nI Know they're in there it is and time mouthwash counters\nI just made that up so\n[laughter] uh so it seems\nIt's to me that the argument is normal wear and tear the tenant is never responsible for normal wear and tear and you're going to argue that what you did just put a bounce watch a bottle in their shots like everybody else does and that's your problem and you're still in the small claims court for the Fifteen hundred dollars not that complicated and if I'm a judge I'm going to give it to you\nVery good aren't trying yeah\nNow do you think it'd be easier to go after him or to go after\nThe mouthwash company oh please use the right to go after Proctor and gamble okay do me a favor the dinner mouthwash is so acidic it goes through counters and see what their lawyers are going to say I really like a super that's out at ... ... you're absolutely right\nI couldn't agree with you more so I didn't have to say how stupid that was he beat me to the punch good for him but\nThis is handle on the law coast to coast to you with George Mallory mornings at one of my news radio five sixty W.

I I think it's too easy to argue you're a liar on this one mark 'cause you don't have the have the proof not that you are okay I'm not at all that saying you're a liar although you do sound like one\nA but it's just it's just too easy to uh attack you on this one so argue the fee you obviously you tell a collection easy to go pounds ... pounds sand on this one\nTell them to sue you and uh then you have to defend yourself it'll be a small claims who probably and then you have to worry about your credit being dangerous ... even a disputed has your credit already been attack\nAre probably ... Parker yeah probably will you gotta mess on your hands and there's no there's no good way out of this\nBut my friend I mean half the money to settle it\nWell then maybe you want to pay the other hand it was just negotiate with them and they say I'll give you half the money now\nAre now and but the thing is I I mean at the money more than anybody I wrote or giving them the money or\nCurrent well then you negotiate it on a payment you tell them and go pound sand or you look at your credit you got your choices none of them very good\nUnfortunately are not a good place to me sometimes and I often say this is a everybody looks to the law as an answer and quite often the laws very sloppy\nThat it's not very clean ah for example what's what's clean about the law have you committed a crime yes or no right it's very clean the jury determines yes or the judge determines here's the statute\nYes thirty five miles per hour is law un thirty six or thirty seven boom you violated see that's clean stuff I loaned you a thousand dollars you don't pay me there it is\nNow dogs barking next door because they're too loud and I want a restraining order what does that mean what is too loud it's just a sloppy way of of dealing with things\nAnd this is one of those where the to answer this is just there's nothing clean about it there really isn't so all I can say is I'm Glad it's him and glad it's not me\nThere you go silver lining every moment\nOkay or Alexander Hi Alexander\nHome where he is or what can I Do for you\nOr I had a debt owed to a credit card company fifty nine hundred dollar or judgment was ... years later that judge back this up here at our rates the cancellation of that from the IRS showing Nineteen thousand nine hundred\nOkay when I say I you oh hold on are you a cancellation of debt for Nineteen thousand nine hundred dollars correct so you're saying oh so you're dealing with the IRS that's you're not dealing with the original credit card company you're dealing with the IRS someone ten Ninety nine you for Nineteen thousand dollars is that correct yeah okay so the IRS\nIs now saying you will or you were forgiven this much debt and uh and they got a judgment against you correct no they didn't do they sue you or they just wrote it off\nThe original credit card company I owe Fifteen\nI understand they write it off\nOr I don't know if they did ... were you ever sued or no but there was a judgment so that means you are now that means you were sued okay All right\nAnd so uh you got a judgment against you in a ... it's a little complicated because ah they forgiveness of deadly\nLet me tell you the whole story okay so you can follow it a little bit better be original that fifty nine hunter I received a judgment the Ira I mean the credit card company after giving up years later the IRS\nYeah no I understand sent the IRS a ten Ninety nine on your behalf because lip\nAnd ... for the amount that they fed I ah\nYou said Nineteen thousand dollars\nThe original that fifty nine hundred I think our eyes that they are ah a copy of my credit report showed fifty nine hundred\nAnd it doesn't matter it don't it doesn't matter I don't care and\nRead in the ... and reduced their from I think power than nine hundred back the fifty nine hundred I paid the debt off so I'm aware my question is trends that credit card company and quite at that that from fifty nine at Nineteen nine do I have a record\nYou know because because no because you didn't pay the tax on the Ninety nine you ended up accepting the ten Ninety nine was for the fifty nine hundred dollars that was originally in default the point is there are no they they are ... there are no ... but they reduce city again\nNo not that I'm the Ira is that\nRight but that's the only thing you have is the IRS they already have a judgment they'd given up they're not collecting on the judgment\nSo a credit card company has no records\nNow it's only hurting their gun statute is done\nEven though they play the fifty nine hundred ...\nDoes it matter they and they inflated the fifty nine hundred on the ten Ninety nine Ninety or not on the judgment they issued a ten Ninety nine for Nineteen thousand you got that reduced to the original fifty nine hundred dollar where your damages\nThe question is that the credit card company and play that the original amount\nYes they did four times over yes there is no records I guess the only because you have not been damaged if you want me to go out and dollars when I send you a bill for a hundred thousand dollars and then you end up paying me two thousand dollars I expect it and I accept that\nWell uh I'm I've been damaged Ninety eight thousand dollars no haven't you paint you sounds and\nUh oh\nTalk we went through that over and over and over again I Would have been I wouldn't inflated twenty five\nThousand dollars just because of patients issue good God\nTake me for media yeah they do I guess people take me for a

I was able to walk into the hospital so I'm my name's ... normally ... stays there that was put in such pressure on my brain dark and there was on my bring them mhm that I could not walk I\nCould not pay and I was assuming I'm assuming well uh my guess is a you left your ah neurosurgery ... surgery residency a little bit earlier so you weren't you didn't get board certified\nUm do you have a doctor that will say two things number one I had they taken out the tumor six days before I you would never have had these problems and you would be fine you wouldn't had slurring you wouldn't matter problem there wouldn't be pressure\nI don't know why I call ... ... talk line\nThat won't be in colleges it'll be a it'll be a neurosurgeon who's ... going to make that call and you're gonna have to have that doctors say that and willing to testify to that so that's one issue how about let's start with the second issue I any permanent brain damage any permanent injury neurological injury\nNot that I Know it's\nOkay so what you have is you hear your damages six days of soaring and six days of ... walking around or not walking around thinking you had a stroke okay what what does that work six days of that\nWhen\nI was not able to work\nI mean I got an email you miss six days at work I understand there's some damage as they are not arguing that aren't damages I'm what I'm saying is what do you think that's worth\nI honestly I Know\nYeah yeah I don't either so ah I I think even though there could very well have been malpractice I been there may be an argument that there wasn't we looked and or a doctor could have easily miss that I that's the other defense that uh the first group of doctors said\nBut you're making a lot of medical assumptions here that ah you I don't have the legal right to make that you're going to need some very heavy duty second opinions and it's going to get very ...\nAnd ... and very technical and you can bet the insurance company is going to defend this thing like crazy and you're going to need a top notch medical malpractice surgeon\nWho's payoff will be six days of you walking around like you were slurring and losing six days of work you see the problem\nRight but the continued to this day\nThat's what I asked is do you have any long term problems as a result of what happens and having missed the tumor for six days is that was cause the long term problem\nYeah okay and you know that for a fact as doctors have told you that yeah I mean I'm Still going through chemotherapy I'm not arguing that you would have gone through chemotherapy anyway correct All right\nSo six days is all the difference in the world you'd be jumping you'd be doing a died jumping jacks you'd be flying around and you'd be fine if they had discovered the tumor six days before\nYeah okay I Believe so I well doctor and a ...\nWhere where was your residency in neurosurgery let's go through at because we have to put you on the stand and uh we have to absolutely
