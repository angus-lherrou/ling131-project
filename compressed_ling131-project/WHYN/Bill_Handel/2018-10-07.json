Stein a ... a very interesting guy he's a Harvard PHD in psychology studied under BF Skinner\nOr was the former editor in chief of Psychology Today magazine and by the way and this is very relevant was a Hillary Clinton supporter and twenty sixteen\n... one of the things he did and the twenty sixteen election was he had two thousand people around the country doing Google searches are and they monitored the result of the people were getting this is a very ah you know a clear academic study and and this research was peer reviewed as his other work was\nAnd what came back was that Google was systematically skewing search results in favor of Hillary Clinton\nThey were in other words they were a suppressing negative stories about Hillary in the algorithm and they were pushing them in favor of Donald Trump\nAnd ... point was I actually supported Hillary Clinton thought she was more qualified but the bottom line is a company should not be doing this and it secret you don't know that it's going on nobody's monitoring the results are getting their assuming the results in the list that they are getting is representative of some objective standard\nFrugal is a Google is a verb now they are not an down yes it's a verb auto Google it yes well I'm from Google it and the end the algorithm is giving you the answer that is skewed right that's like going to a dictionary\nThat will always changed the definitions of things but as it applies to whatever's happening in the world yes that's real problem\nNo you're you're exactly right and so in the in the context of cabin on me and I don't know exactly what because that's occurring right real time but the bottom line is there is a history here of Google doing this it was it was leaked um uh a couple of weeks ago Tucker Carlson talked about a ...\nA about these internal emails where you actually had Google engineers saying hey you know what we don't like you know Trump's policy on immigration so we want to sort of a suppress certain stories\nUm this is a thing and Google does it end and here's the the the point that we try to make Glenn in this film and in general the whole conversation that Google wants to have is about fake news and this debate about fake news here's here's the bottom line\nFake news is competitive if you and I are having a disagreement about something I put my fake news story and you say oh yeah I'm going to put my fake news story the pointed it out in the open you have combat and by the way the fake news doesn't really convince anybody\nYou know if you like Hillary Clinton that fake news add that the Russians ran of Jesus and and and Hillary arm wrestling [laughter] probably not going to convince you to vote a different\nWay that wasn't that that wasn't a real armor [laughter]\nBut you know the point is is that that's not going to convince anybody because a confirmation bias you know people tend to look for information they want what Google is doing is different because we don't know what we don't know\nThe question that we should be asking people the Google and Facebook is why will you knock make your algorithm transparent right why we'll you'd I mean and I let me take a quick break and come back\nDo you have an answer\nTheir answer on why they won't make a transparent yes and it's not very good\nAt it is not\nThe name of the documentary is the creepy line review line dot com Peter ... with us and we have a lot to discuss because of the platform ing\nA and kind of a role in from our last conversation about information how do you know that it's true and we'll true information will will actual information\nWill you be allowed to see or keep in the future\nThere's some truth to that but there are a lot of things that they could do to demonstrate um that they're offering a fair product in service to people and here's the thing that they have lied about this before\nYou know ten years ago or so you had other companies like trip advisor and Yelp\nWho were saying that Google was artificially suppressing their rankings in Google in favor of Google owned companies which okay you know Google has the right to do that but here's the thing\nGoogle flat out lied and said absolutely not we don't do that our algorithm is pure it's true the best results or ... or our organically at the top well here's the problem the Federal Trade commission the European Union\nProfessors at Harvard University looked at this and said yes you are fiddling with the algorithm you are screwing these other competitors and you're lying to the point is when Google says you can trust the algorithm you can trust us they've lied before and they're lying now and I think the only question that remains really is how are we going to deal with is\nUm you know there's old story that Henry Kissinger said when he was on the national Security Council\nYou give a president three choices do nothing\nTake my solution or thermonuclear war those are your three choices\nAre in this case it's kind of like that we can do nothing we can try to deal with some sort of the regulatory issues related with Google or we can break up these companies those are the three options that we have and I think we're really at the point of point number three 'cause this is not a monopoly like standard oil\nStandard oil that's going to dominate the all market this is controlling the news flow in the United states\nIs in the end this is in the and Peter ... controlling everything yes Google is ... the most likely company in the America in the American world\nOr to come up with a guy yes who ever who ever gets to a I first\nControls everything there's no way to beat it once you have a guy yes this company is the most likely in the free world to come up with it if we don't have them ... contained in some way or another when they get to a a word toast yes\nYes that's exactly right and here's the thing it's not just Google the company a lot of people don't realize this I didn't realize this if you use safari on your apple product you're actually using the Google algorithm and that is Google information\nUm if you're using if you are using um Yahoo you're using Google\nThe point being Firefox is Google the all these entities are using the Google algorithm so even if you say I Am not going to use Google dot com you're using unless you are making very specific choices for other options if you using any of those others\nGoogle is the one that's dominated by the way Google pays apple\nNine billion dollars a year Google actually pays apple\nTo be the algorithm of choice for safari that's how much they value this information and want to dominate the space\nSo I Want to talk to 'em a little bit about um what can be done um with the algorithm or I'm concerned about some things that I think are really dangerous and the platform ing and the racing voices right because Google thinks\nThat's you know that's that's not right that's eight speech we'll get to that when we come back [noise]\nRan home with your [noise]\nUse radio five sixty WHYY and [noise]\n[laughter] [noise]\n\n[noise]\nThey claimed that kind of an interest wiser is with us a president of government accountability Institute producer of a new documentary that is out you find it at the creepy\nLine dot com um the creepy line and it comes from a\nQuote from the guy who's running the Google but you know we were not going to implant things into your head but we're going to come right up to that creepy line ... terrified beer from somebody who's in charge of Google\nPeter uh I I wanted I Want to talk to you about the platform me\nI Am currently saying to anyone who has a conservative voice let's all get on a single server let's get on to our own platform together we don't have to join business or any but we have to have a protected platform\nBecause I Believe these companies\nAre are going to the platform us one by one\nIs this what you've been doing here yeah and I think you're very smart to do that I think you're very smart to do that because let's step back in first to consider the power of Google and a lot of people don't realize this but it was widely reported in the guardian elsewhere in two thousand nine\nGoogle actually shut down the entire Internet for two hours on a Saturday morning they blacklisted the entire Internet that shows you the ... the scope and the size that Google ... wait a minute I mean it's it's the ... they blacklisted\nThe entire Internet if you go to the guardian WWW yes they shut down the entire Internet a couple of years later they shut down half of Japan's Internet\nOr they said it was sort of an error that they but but the point being the size and the scope of this company is enormous\nAnd a lot of people don't realize even if they're not using a Google product somebody will say why don't use Gmail I'm not worried about Gmail that's fine but here's your company ... you know it may be John Smith at acme incorporated dot com\nBut his acne incorporated email server actually a Google product because if it is golf Google is monitoring and watching what you're doing\nAnd it's part of the data collection they're doing on you a lot of news organizations in the United states use Google we we we highlight in the film for example Robert apps signed this caller who's been critical of Google\nA link to support a Clinton supporter a harbor PHD in psychology\nUm Iran uh did some studies and the Washington Post ran a piece\nAbout could Google swing an election this was back in twenty twelve yeah the next day Robert ... was shot out of Google he could not get on Firefox he could not get any on on any of the uh the Google products they had shut 'em out same thing happened to Jordan Peterson a University of Toronto professor\nWho had taken a position about forced speech if you have on general or gender pronouns the next morning when that went public he was locked out of his Gmail accounts and Google would not let him back into his Gmail account all of his emails his calendars and everything he was blocked from\nThe point being they have a lot of power and you cannot assume that Google is not going to take these actions people will say a lotta times whether a company they want to make their customers happy they are more than a traditional company they say so themselves they view themselves as a company with a mission so here's what\nPeople say when when you know what I use ... well you know Google is monitoring your mail they're not reading my mail actually\nYou are both right and wrong they are not reading your mail however they are analyzing your mail because what they're doing is collecting the information on how people relate to one another how people talk to one another all for their a I research so\nGoogle isn't free right for no reason that's exactly right you you\nAre the product we say what is Google's product you are the product because they are selling information on Glenn Beck or on Peter Schweitzer or on whoever\nAnd more importantly I think they are ... all of look there's that this is just at the beginning let me tell you this boogie story mhm you go to Beijing there are three concentric circles of security in Beijing okay\nThe center is the main city of aging many people it used to look it up for me what are you still how many millions of people are living in

I agree with that I really do mhm\nUh at at basically you're standing up at a table and certainly someone with a dwarf isn't it's not going to be able to reach that although you can put a a a ... certainly put a soap box right under me a someone's feet and that may do it and that would probably work for all of it do they have a duty to\n... to raise or to lower services I don't think so and so I Would argue all you have to do is make reasonable accommodations\nLike a box or Sepp Blatter for him to step on and then running back and forth now he's not gonna be able to run back and forth but here's the course we did what we could unless the law says they absolutely have to accommodate anybody with de da\nTo this college I don't know if it's a public college probably not and for example

dollars that's good news I think yeah that's what I'm looking out for my money and my grandmother and my ... my grandmother now incapacitated at home that they want to put me and my brother on ... ...\nWho was that what your parents and there are still alive yeah OK and it so I'm assuming it's a remarkable trust that your normal everyday trust that they can change things around correct\nYeah OK while they're doing this they cover lawyers that my grandmother's home and a lawyer said that you know you have if they ever have to go to the home that the government because they have so much money to come back she's getting paid for it 'cause she's on Medicare saying that that government could comment on that money\nNo unless she is she a ... is a Shia better fishery of ah the ... of the narrowest\nWith regards to my parents and something what's happened to my parents and they were going to go home every minute ... less than that they can do some type of paperwork that can stop that from happening\nI Would be there or if it would be an ear revoke ... trust\nWhere you're at [laughter]\nWhere are your parents no longer have any control at all to trust to set up and then it's over that's done they just don't own it which means that they don't have assets for the government to grab but if they do go on I think not Medicare uh and I and I don't know what the\nRules of Medicare but they're not going to let you go on the government do and pay for\nFor example a home or to live for folks women with a million dollars in\nThe bank that's just not going to happen now lawyers say that's going to ... thousand dollars to what\nChanged to make a a a ... trust that make it so that they didn't give me the name but I Know that's great anybody's charged Fifteen thousand or so that is crazy you know what\nYeah you'd be crazy for that is trying to find yeah go time to find another way are okay you got from on your website ah yeah you got tons of them mandolin ... trust in a state lawyers times they're not going to charge you Fifteen thousand dollars and if they do\nI'm getting twelve thousand of that\nThat's why I'm looking out for my money\nGood for you good for you ... a little stiff basically taking a trust and making any irrevocably trust a that's not a very big deal at all\nAs the high asked me how you doing yeah yes ma'am what can I Do for you\nTwo part question for you I keep I Am looking for and um I guess now my cat I have to pay your rent also monthly\n... they want to\nWait your cats have to pay rent monthly\nCharge 'em you know there's a deposit\nOh yeah of course that yes\nI Know oh plus five a perk thirty five per cat forty five ... dog a car I'm not an okay um my questionnaire my cat her what her over\nMost now I'm In I'm embarrassed they won't get into that but the animal um [noise] I can I waive the\nOther side that's a good question at work yeah well you're not going to be able to pull it off with two cats I promise you that\nEven if I got the paperwork\nI you know what if you have five cats and they're all service animals you probably could get away with one eye and I'm sure you're stuck and then I don't know if they can still charge you a for the cats\nAre ... you know yeah that I don't know that I don't know but for you arguing the service animal business then I you um you would have no chance they can charge whatever the hell they want pet fees you can charge extra so like the bottom line is that you\nFor one service animal and it's now this is this an emotional service animal or is it a city and emotional support or is it a straight out service animal\nI Know no respect for an emotional\nCello yeah because they are very few seeing eye cats don't they\n[laughter] yeah yeah yeah they're not that they're\nNow I understand right I Want someone wants to ask me about a seeing eye chicken and it wasn't a wasn't the same I said probably not so the quick\nAnswer is I have no idea if\nA money can be charged but if age I Can't it would be under the circumstances and therein lies where the rules are changing rather dramatically because there's a big difference we know train service animal in this emotional

Would I Would sewer small claims court and here I mean it could get medical right at the medical\n... that no it's not even a question of no no it's not even quite sure medical there's nothing to do with it\nShe was hired to do something and the circumstances now make it impossible for her to do her work okay All right so that's the argument saying you hired her and she no longer has the ability to work because your daughter is unable to play\nAnd there is no language of the a non ...\n... a retainer 'cause normally I Would say that\nIf I were representing her you put down there it's non refundable come hell or high water or I get the five thousand dollars then you'd have no place to go but being silent on it you got an argument now she's going to say she's ready willing and able\nTrees are convicted pedophile together for you to I could not remember his name but you have a picture with him with me and the the the area where you can join the euro me and him standing there are the church refusing to identify that pretty\nWe were getting to the point where I was kind of the attorneys and the media and all that out of that I didn't want to buy a landing because it could get a leaked out there I wanted to keep the cleaning the and the short\nMike let me ask a why is it important for the second ... to be identified that's not going to bring that much more value or any more value I'm assuming you have a a lawsuit going or negotiations for money with the church correct\n[noise] well when it got to go into space and part of the money they\nChange their tactic at first they were acting like there were some fear and nine and I said okay well we get to the money um I don't even make that large of a good man I went off you know but the other alter boy with the federal wherever I went with us from an actress to get this\nOver now are you are you doing this without a lawyer by what are you crazy [noise] [noise] well you're craving\nLike what are you what are you doing talking to the Catholic Church the archdiocese about being abused negotiating for a a money settlement and you don't have a lawyer\n[noise] well I wanted closure and I didn't want to put my family and through a years long in a trial and\nThere won't be out there won't be a trial they'll settle they'll settle now but what you want as a lawyer who has experience or several lawyers out there and you can just research them\nWho uh this is what they do they developed an expertise or the archdiocese know who they are\nOr the lawyer will know the value of your case not can probably force the issue of the the force the issue of or the or\nThe identity of the other a priest or whatever reason I don't know if it's the purposes of are you getting closer that you think it's fair and that's been\nGoing there and I and I think it was because they were the cover up that happened [noise] [noise] oh yeah who you're kidding reported of core and of course you know it wasn't like I just brought his charges up out of nowhere\nYeah my ... don't worry about you you have I mean you have a very valid case and then the issue is well let me ask you how important is it let's say everything else is called pathetic let's say are you a settled with uh the archdiocese that you have any reasonable settlement under the circumstances whatever the value is\nA then how important is it for the identity of the second ... cars being molested as being molested mean whether you were molested by one priest Fifteen times or three priests five times or I Would argue it's saying maybe it's not\nMaybe there's a lot more value in terms of the case or having been a molested by two different ... I don't know the answer when how important\nIt was an initially initially when I went to them I just want to know when my memories that come back I dealt with that I got my life back on track everything's going smoothly I married a wonderful woman got custody of my shoulder on everything and\nIt's going great and I didn't want to rock the boat I just want her to get closer I wasn't even asking for money and when I initially went there and they started to push back\nAgain and I understand now and say you when you went through that they're not being cooperative they've gone from gee we care and we feel bad for you to stonewalling it which is a the history of ah the Catholic Church when\nThey're actually a lot more people not they weren't just stone wall and they wanted to get an investigator and ball\nYeah that's what they do I mean my family I get it in my community and got ...\nLet me tell you I I'm a big fan and I always get in trouble for this always and that is I Believe that the arch bishops the bishops the cardinals even the pope's last several folks have covered all of this up and shut all go to jail\nWe have a a a cardinal ... uh Mahoney who used to be the cardinal here in Los Angeles ... and he retired with accolades and he retired uh with the ... an eminent if you will or an imminent reputation he should be in jail\nHe should be in jail for covering up what happened what I Would also here's your choice here's my advice if you're asking I Would get a lawyer that specializes in going after the church they know what all these lawyers incident lakes are the ones I've talked to were the ones I've heard of it I\nActually do care and if it's a question of you need therapy more than you need money or you need both and negotiate with the church that's the way to go\nNow my question is do I get out because obviously with the climate look all these people coming our you know me too yeah yeah actually [noise] and that's actually what would have prevented me from filing in the first place but I didn't want to be involved in the bandwagon\nYou're not going to be on the bandwagon and she was an individual that the right to mediate to get out now the lawyer was how do the lawyer that's why you want a lawyer that's\nWhy you want the lawyer who has experience and we'll sit down and give you all the options and we'll give you the options that makes sense taking into account the value\nOf the case or your particular predicament in terms of your mental health era emotional psychological situation uh these guys know what they're doing you got to go there you actually have to go there and it's easy all you do is throw up\nA ... or some uh search words Catholic Church lawyers um ride\nYeah law firms are suing the church and I I wouldn't put up a church or molestation goes you'll get forty thousand hits on\nNow [laughter] All right out here not ... really quick are what part of it is okay now can I included the death of my mother and\nDon't know I Know no I don't know probably not but I don't know the answer again go to the lawyer they have\nThe expertise alright or he or she or the firm ... it has the expertise and uh let me tell you about a life walk\nLife lock is identity theft protection it's that simple and they have been protecting my identity my entire families identity for over ten years now\nAnd so why Fox has added the protection of Norton Security with life lock does protect your I didn't what Norton Security does\nA so a company or adults is saying we believe we're not breaking any laws because we have that license and now the entire issue is going to be\nIt is so or adults Brussels considered a sex business\nAnd I would argue not I would\nSay just because you have a ... that are perfectly anatomically correct for the soul use of men pleasure in themselves why would you ever consider that\nA sex business I Would argue it say physiological necessity for men to have sex with silicon dolls\n\nI'm not being hired by anybody to make that argument I just want to point that out All right let's go ahead and take some phone calls like Gary you've been at it for awhile thanks for holding what can I Do for you\nOn a bill or we just finished doing our own replicable living trust and I need to transfer my mortgage tree house into the truck and I quit claimed\nHe sure sure it's what you want to do is use a quick claim date\nVery simple yeah just to to say you can just do it yourself you just transfer who owns the property now my wife and I All right so you transfer it from ... to the trust and that's it and then the trust owns it and do the name of the property is now a the name of the trust\nAnd that's the easiest thing in the world I he waited in our ten minutes for that okay it's like I used to work for a station many years ago that the Dodgers were on and\nIt was and they had a sports talk thing because the way it works with professional games or any kind of sports event on radio stations and television stations or for the most part less so is that the actual game is broadcast and then there's the pre game and post game shows that they do\nSo if you're on for example we have the Dodgers here on this station and a Dodger games are all day because it's post game pre game and everybody talks so I remember one sitting in the studio and I was doing some recording and I was listening for a few minutes or to the game\nAnd I walk past and I looked at the screeners the screen which uh that's how phone calls a come in\nA post command screener in this case Sam picks it up asked some questions can be some rules that no one ever pays attention to\nGet to the point I don't go on and on and on ... bill hang up on you of course everybody ignores that so I get to yell at you and then the call was transferred to my computer I have the same screen and then I decide which ones I Want to take and I go through\nIt and depending on what I'm interested in what I think is interesting then uh I take the phone call up\nSo that was a long story to describe what happened next I Am a watching the screen and I notice that I'll never forget this guy named man well and I'm looking at the he'd been on for an hour and forty five minutes waiting to go on the air\nAnd finally\nMan well is a put on the air\nUh okay Manuel ah what do you want to talk about what's\nYour question about the Dodgers all he said was yours and he hung up\nI Love talk radio\nOr you know there's somebody who has a life right oh okay [laughter] All right Sean I Know a might go to you Mike

figure out how to get someone to live up to their their false advertising\n[laughter] she had good luck All right I was just telling me what happened\n[noise] um I had a car that I bought from a dealership and it two years into the leaf they sent me a a written a letter and also emails wanting to buy my car back\nAnd they said they'd give me up to a hundred and ten percent of the appraised value my car no matter if I bought their car and not\nAnd then when I went and good program on it and they have praised the car and we out of the hundred ten percent of the car was an excellent condition\nOr they will give you the deal will give you a hundred percent but you've got about what our cars but in their printed advertising and my emails especially especially that belief that this is the way it raises are paired up are you up to a hundred and ten percent of current market value for your vehicle [noise]\nIn fact we're so interested that we will buy your vehicle back even if you don't buy our\nShowcase so now the issue is the value and you you got him on that All right there's no question that this is what they said ah they're\nOut is up to a hundred and ten percent that's for one or one aspect and connected to that is what is the value of the car or that they're saying it's not that much or they say they're just not ... not buying the car back no matter what\nIt is in their ... by the ... say they did the appraisal on the car so I wouldn't had it appraised by car max and then I came to them and they were the original company deals to show me the car two years or write\nAn are they not recognizing the car ... appraisal or they're just saying we don't care\nYou know there are came higher than ... oh my God okay so so so they ... they printed it out to me and brought it out to me and then\nAnd then I said well what about the hundred ten percent and the guy will I don't know nothing about that three brought the manager out I gave him the document and the email and he goes okay we'll get we'll give you a hundred percent because your car I mean you're ... initially it was ten thousand miles under ... should have been particularly on at least that time\nAnd he goes will give you the deal but you need about what our cars and I and I go at a ... a highlight it and I think I'll go but it says you'll buy micro no matter what buyers or not and I said well what did they just stumbled on themselves\nWell I didn't get mad or anything yeah okay let me let me ask this uh and that is a why wouldn't you buy one of their cars\nOr just in I understand there are a bunch of jerks but if they're willing to give you a hundred and ten percent legitimately and they give you a reasonable deal on one of their cars why wouldn't you jump on it or even though they're watching the lying scum\nOkay I I bought two new cars within a week of each other when I bought the my Chrysler I bought one from across the street from a ... a dealership from them out of that in my truck I drive thirty five thousand dollars a year in my car sits on the garage so I'm sitting there going you know I'm spending over five hundred\nOr you then are you are so are you not going to buy a car then you're just not interested in buying a car period I was just trying to get out of the week\nHuh okay uh and they offered that they're going to buy your car back uh and and they're releasing it too right yeah\nYeah they're listening to you yeah yeah I'm just trying to think they are in breach just one of the damages a and here's\nHere's where I figured out the debt because it's been a year and I've gone through\nAll right no I was OK all I have a a you can sell the car I to anybody else at whatever the value is in the difference is they're responsible for the ten percent\nOkay well the problem was with a hundred and ten percent I Would only had to chop up three hundred bucks on a been out of the least at that point I couldn't sell it for what that hundred ten percent would have been\nWithout you know taking a bigger hit so I've kept the car and I just put it in on a leash so uh what I'm really on the hook for just is eleven payments and car insurance and vehicle registration which is comes to fifty six hundred dollars\nAnd they would have been to like ... and they weren't going to let you out of that and you're but you're not going to replace the car correct right oh okay ah but you [noise]\nWow yeah I'm just trying to think of a of a clever way of doing this without hiring a lawyer and that's the problem with the damages are and how you figure out\nA God ... or the difference is we can try figuring out the damages in small claims court but the problem is going to be that you're on the hook for ah the lease you have to say I wasn't going to buy another car\nAnd the judge is going to say really uh therefore but you could have and you didn't and you turned it in and you took the deal\nAre saying they'll pay you a hundred and ten percent\nI so it's a little bit complicated but whatever your damages are or you can try to take it just small claims court I but that's the only way to go I can think of and just trying to figure out your damages and frankly as I was going through the entire scenario and uh the formula I didn't understand it worth it so ah that works out now isn't it\nThe ... when it comes to math beyond like fifty plus fifty\nOr\nA hundred and why to buy two I have a hard time see how that works Tammy Hi Tammy\nYes good morning they'll yes ma'am\nMy question and I am one of the war on earth ... on a
