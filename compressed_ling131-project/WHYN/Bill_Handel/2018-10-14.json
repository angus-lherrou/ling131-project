I I get a burglary or ... or ... or that or the niche or whatever like that\nSo she clearly has been devastated there's an emotional issue here\nBut how much is that work is pretty speculative and the jury would have to determine that assuming that goes to a jury or the other issue is the contract\nThat she signed and there it is we're not responsible if someone breaks than well she signed it however she signed it while she was burying her son correct and then the argument is goes wait a minute no one in their right mind they don't know what the hell they're signing\nA it so she didn't have the mental capacity at that time\nOr the emotional capacity to know what you assigning there are so I Would argue that\nRight so the point is and what isn't worth it that way so the ... out there uh she's never going to replace the ring itself correct uh so what what is money what would you want\nI think part of it we could I could go or twice a week and just look for learning you know I understand the point is that no cameras or any kind of like a really good for carrying and she says I could and someone could have bought me over the\nHead you know they could have but it's a good order should ah you know in ... they don't necessarily have to have cameras okay uh I don't know if that's reasonable or not and they had they had cameras that would have stopped the the stealing go down it would be exactly who went out there you go back who know so that\nMy question ...

argument and you go in front of a judge and you go your honor here's what happened a B C and D and uh they said we should have filed a police report who help files a room with police report over a stolen sticker\nOn a license plate because once I put the sticker on the license plate like every other human being in the world who pays attention anymore\nLike protect every day\nYeah exactly I think it's an ice rink paying it's a decent decent defence a shirt tell her to a judge 'cause the worst that happens you have to pay for the ticket anyway\nOr or\nI mean that's the worst of it so it it's worth half a day in court and then you get to see traffic court and you get to see these other people come up with the most insane defenses you've ever seen and and the fun one\nWhere ah the people come up and they said you'll see with an explanation as if the judge chairs you're they're guilty or you're not\nSo whenever you see someone guilty with an explanation depending on the judge or if the judge allows the person to explain just to get it off his or her chest the ... the judges eyes roll which is always kind of fun or or the judge will say who cares\nYou know explain it to your pet ... because I don't want to hear it\nSo I Would go down to try it why not\nI I think if you look at it I mean it's it's certainly is why don't you go with what you're saying [noise] this is
