masonry masonry is going to like seeing that ready to go on their books but right now it's not appealing to them because they got too many customers\nAnd not enough time trying to close up yeah yeah and you're and you don't want a job to be rushed to you again you've waited long get the job done right in the spring if the if the roof isn't leaking now um you know let's wait till the spring but get a get a nicely appointed project set up for yourself or the spring\nAnd a and locking up a pretty competitive price now 'cause who knows the way the market's going like we've received three\nRoofing a shingle and accessory price increases in this year absolutely ridiculous and we're expecting to more or by spring so it just that's what's happening folks take advantage sometimes it stay stagnant you don't get any increases for three years\nBut right when they get an opportunity to do so they will so um that's just what we're all working with but hopefully that helps\nIt thank you guy that was really great yeah you're in very informative you guys are always are\nAny any time in college anytime we love to hear from you know we hear from the other side here you know we we want to know what you guys are are are dealing with word gassing because what we're seeing but we're not seeing it from your perspective\nUm so we want the feedback but hold the line with ... will send you out to a three hundred dollar voucher and hopefully that helps you in the future perfect ... pick your eight hundred three three one nine for nine six eight hundred three three one\nNine for nine six now of course the floodgates are open everybody wants to call we got ten minutes less uh we got Paul in Worcester you've got questions about ... on the roof\n... hey good morning or you're doing morning ... uh yeah there's a bunch of Martian bowl on a shingles on the trees and stuff that we're hanging over ... are you sure she'll only like\nSix or seven years old we've got most of the trees and limbs cut back ... what's the what's the best way to remove that Russia Washington or is this some of the trick you guys have\nYet so I'm six or seven years is pretty quick to get that on most shingle should have a fifty year algae resistant ... ... you know Fifteen year algae resistance shingle the certain teaching all does maybe this is a ... for something else but I'm Glad John ...\nIs it black airborne algae or is it the march grown from the north side of the trees\nI'm going to say it won't Boston anything oh\nYeah so that that means you have no no sign on that in the in the trees are hanging over the roof and and they're practically maybe uh three feet away from the top of the roof with the sap from the trees are just saturated that toppled the roof and create in the world than the moisture is just can\nTry and the the the shingle can't dry enough and it's creating\nWell there's there's about three things you can do okay roof is only six seven years I Know that's that's shocking but he ... you must have a lot of trees up there or a you know it was\nIt was the trees were almost planning on\nYeah yeah that that's what I'm saying you you got like coverage like it it can't breath but so so basic basically what you first thing you can start with the good news is that it only being six or seven\nYears old the shingles are really hardy\nSo you got to be careful when you got a twenty year old roof and you do a pressure wash you can really grind out a lot of the grand noodles and and put yourself in worse shape than you are but it only being six years old you can be pretty aggressive with the pressure wash\nAnd and it's not going to just deteriorate you know that quickly when you when you pressure wash it they do have some some light brushes because\nUsually like when it's professionally done they kind of scrape off the boss with with some with some brush which is fine again six seven years in you shouldn't compromise the shingles much\nLincoln's isn't growing on it yet where\nWell you know he doesn't know if he's got that he's not up there looking at but you can also get zinc strips you know the the certainty shingles have copper owl always in the shingles\nUm which keep the acidity stuff from the rain you get those black streaks but this should help you to if you put a couple zinc stripped up by the ridge meant that should help you a little bit I'm just another thing you do to combat it but\nHere's the ... the best answer cut the tree down [laughter]\nNo it's definitely been cut back and ...\nYeah or the branches you know ... or ... or the branches\nAnd I I get the you know we've we've been doing this a long time so we get this a lot and you know of course it's going to continue you know you can pressure wash it and get it out there but if you got that that ... thing in coverage over with the branches it'll it'll\nCome right back or continue yeah Best Buy it or get some Iran and let him breathe a little bit so they have the ... and forget it it's a chemical that you can just spray on your roof and let the nature take take its course and clean it up for you but depending on which wash you have on there\nAnd even even route seven years old you have to be careful scraping off the granular is off the roof or off the main move once you start removing the boss\nYou should have done by professional company this we hear they can warranty the product we also\nAll right well thank you very much\nYeah my pleasure thanks for calling in and again we appreciate the phone call and ah help you out the best we can in the future hold the line Leanne will take area eight hundred three three one nine for nine six eight hundred three three one nine for nine six is number to call get four minutes left plenty of time for callers to call in and what about you know jumping on a ...\nA material there would that work on the roof max the roof max\nYeah I mean so ruined acts as a good product in terms of getting that done there's guarantee of five years of again keeping my never going to tell you that you've got five years left of it's not going to leak right 'cause that's a different scenario but it does give it a little bit of\nHardening of the shingles what does it goes into the shingles themselves in that kind of strengthens it from the inside out so that they don't crack\n... expand the shingle itself\nI Know I don't think it expands that it just kind of\nAbsorb the yeah the ... and to the texture of\nThe show almost like you know you have the um the product that goes into that keeps the the baseball glove with the leather you don't get a kind of softens it right so it's the opposite you don't want it to harden so that it doesn't crackers ... what makes right right right\nSo it keeps it kind of soft and um you know I hesitate to have the roof max discussion because really\nDon't don't fool yourself right roof max is for the client that has the immaculate lawn and his proactive\nAnd changes the oil too often it yes and really and really keeps your your\nYour your roof in tip top shape and you're looking to extend the roof on who it's not for [laughter] and you're listening it's not for the folks that are already have a smashed deteriorated roof that as our should have been replaced ten years ago\nBut that's usually who has interest right because they're doing it for the wrong reasons you know hey it's\nOnly going to cost me a third of the cost of a roof so let's get this done and and go from there we got one call for one more uh one more chance to get another caller and we've got Jim in in the old Jim you got a discussion about a lead I Believe a PA stuff\nRegarding the lead paint certification for run invaders I didn't realize it was not only I mean apparently it's across the board for contractors the lead paint\nCertification requirement by state\nYeah and how one might use that to either you know I didn't want to start start a small business what I find out that I have to go your employees would have to be certified why don't you know why isn't more known about this and and I wouldn't want to use this to either\nAccess you know to get a job or to work with some of these contractors 'cause [noise] truthfully I haven't heard about it\nThough I'm I could I could talk for five hours about this subject and for all we only have a few minutes left but it's a touchy one because really it's a very under the radar thing and if I if I if I'm being completely honest about it I think that it's uh\nUh the reason why you don't hear about it they want all the organizations EPA\nThe states want you to be certified because it kind of targets you quite frankly as a contractor 'em and they want you to have the training ... it's a it's a sad state of affairs but the reality is that if you're not licensed with this stuff\nThen you kind of fly under the radar and it's just the way this enforced as a joke\nThey basically going to look for guys that can afford to get the train and get it done so that you're available to be fined [laughter] it's a I I Can't stand it any other way and they'll sell you on the idea and the classes that hey let's let's get trained so you can win more jobs you're not winning more jobs by having that certification but yes we do have it as a\nAs a requirement 'cause you have to ah when you're of our size but um I I I'm not a big fan of it\nI'm quite frankly and I think that the the learning that takes place in there is not very advanced\nWhile you have to hold a construction supervisors license now to be a lead certified the ... yeah [noise]\nOkay what do you what if if one were to use that and say hey you know you're going to hire\nWell you're you're gonna have to make more money per job you're gonna have to make more money per job because once you get a P P. A. or a certification everything that's tested now has to go through the through the state and having retested after the job is completed\nOh you guys have a ... have a great weekend we'll see we'll see you next week thanks for listening\nA nine hundred million but none of taxes you can only by half the team so no outfielders for you forget about the Yankees they're worth four billion dollars\nYou could um by half of the islands and the British Virgin islands because of the total GDP of the British Virgin islands was about nine hundred million dollars so here seriously what you ought to do if you win the lottery first number one tell nobody\nThat you want not even your spouse I especially your spouse don't tell anyone as soon as you tell anyone everyone's going to know\nAnd that's really scary because not only you're going to be bombarded by requests for money from family and friends but also total strangers your safety is also at risk and I'll talk a little bit more about that in the second so when you win the lottery what you need to do is take that ticket and keep it somewhere safe\nLike a bank safe deposit box no not not under your mattress not somewhere and you know ... my house no\nAntibiotics that deposit box do not signed the ticket not yet\nWhat I Want you to do is to photocopy photocopy both sides and then put it in a safe deposit box then get a lawyer get in the state attorney someone who is expert inexperienced in dealing with wealthy families because guess what you're not willfully\nAnd left the lawyer tell you how you should sign the ticket should use on it in your name only should it be join with your spouse should you put it in a trust should you have an owned by an el ... limited liability company\nYou want to get legal advice tax advice financial advice to you need a lawyer needed a CPA and you need a financial planner\nBecause if you don't handle this correctly you've got to be aware of the studies that have been done on lottery winners there is a preponderance of bankruptcy I mean how can a lottery winner go bankrupt hey Michael Tyson had three hundred million dollars and ended up bankrupt\nPeople think it's a bottomless pit more okay one point six billion there's pretty bottom list but it's not it's only four hundred Ninety two million metal taxes and all of them some\nIt's not a bottomless pit like you think it is and when you start going out a lot of money to family and friends in charities you'd be amazed how fast you can plug for the cash so a lot of lottery winners end up bankrupt they end up divorced they end up with drug and alcohol abuse they end up with suicide\nThey lose their jobs are friends even their family and if you're going to say all of a kid\nOne of my work every day like always now you're not you know why because every time you show up at work all of your co workers are gonna be resentful because they got to be there because they need the money and you don't and they know it and if you're going to go out to lunch and not treat every one\nYou're going to be a pariah so if you think your life is not going to change Oh yes it absolutely will you're going to lose all your friends you're going to be ostracized with family if you don't give them enough money to satisfy what they\nBelieve is how much money you ought to give them\nSo in addition to having a lawyer and an accountant and a financial planner you need a personal security team as well the first thing you gotta do is get out of your house because everybody knows where you live easily do Google your address not only strangers but crux\nMight come and do you harm they might come and challenge threaten your family members in order to extort from you blackmail\nYou so you need to go to an undisclosed location choose a suite at the rich people were me and have a security detail around your your life is going to change in ways you have never thought possible 'cause you need personal security\nAnd when it comes to gifts to families and friends well let's think about this for a minute how much money you're going to give your mom you just netted after tax four hundred and Ninety two million dollars unless you give them a million bucks you ...\nCome on you're going to give her ten million you just got a hundred and Ninety two million dollars how much you given your mom\nHow much you've given your dad how much you've given your brothers and sisters how much you've given your children your grandchildren let's say that you decide to give ten people ten million dollars a piece that is a hundred million dollars guess what you didn't give away a hundred million dollars because when you give\nAway a hundred million dollars you know my friend knock them you have to pay a\nGift tax guess how much the gift tax is forty percent\nWhich means if you give away a hundred million dollars you incur a forty million dollar gift tax now you've just spent a hundred and forty million dollars so of the four hundred and Ninety to the Internet and you just gave away a hundred and forty of it you're now down to three fifty\nWe haven't even talked about charity let alone Bentley's do you see my point my friend you got to recognize that winning the lottery requires a massive change and lifestyle\nMassive calculation and preparation and planning because your relationships are going to change with virtually every one you're not going to be able to trust anyone because they're all going to be wanting to know what you can do for them and whatever you do for them\nAin't going to be enough in their opinion\nLet me give me another reason why I didn't buy a lottery ticket instead of buying a lottery ticket if you were to say take the money you would have spent on three lottery tickets three dollars a day instead of buying a lottery every single day you take that three dollars and you invested into the S. and P. five hundred stock index and you do that for forty five years\nI'm On a bet you'll have more than a million dollars I guess what you'll have won the lottery of course past performances medication future results on the assertion that country's a federal ... and therefore my friend now you know why [noise]\nI didn't buy a lottery ticket\nBecause as I often say to friends and family well okay not friends and family what I often say the enemies may you win the lottery because it's often the worst thing that can never happen to you and I mentioned all of this for one simple reason trying to make you feel better for not having one\nSubject aren't you glad that you didn't win the lottery I thought so that's why I'm here to help you make you feel good and the reason I'm trying to make you feel good is because you probably have been noticing that not only did not win the lottery on Tuesday you saw the stock market meltdown on Wednesday\nAnd you did notice that not only give me your get rich you got a little poorer because of the stock market's performance and we're going to talk about the stock market\nAnd what it means for your investments and what you should do about your investment strategy as a result of the new volatility that we're experiencing in the stock market and the bond market and the real estate market\nAnd the gold market and I'm going to tell you all about it when we come back here on the record and show\nAAA plan

H. Y. N.\n[noise]\n\n\nWalking back to the elements show we invite you to send your questions by audio and that's exactly what George did here says question he sent to ask Greg at ... dot com\nDirect this is George from California\nMy in laws are both over eighty five years old and have an investment balance that likely could pay for a long term care for those is needed\nMy question is should they maintain any stop investment since they could earn over three percent in fun and it is unlikely their life expectancy will expose them to significant inflation risk so Rick what do you think thanks\nSo that's a great question George and a lot of folks faced this question in my older years I'm In my seventies my ... my nineties I have far more money than I Will ever need to spend even if I encourage massive medical costs are long term care costs\nBetween pensions and Social Security and the money I've accumulated over my lifetime I have lots of cash and I'm not spending it because I live kind of frugally\nSo therefore we would argue traditional financial planning strategy would argue that you should place all of that money in very conservative investments you should put the money into bank accounts you should put the money into treasuries you should put the money into guaranteed investments that\nThey might not pay much in interest I'm not only pay one or two or three percent puts so what you don't need to earn high returns it's more important that you have protection of your money than that you try to double your money because doubling it isn't going to change your lifestyle but losing half of it could\nSo traditionally we what are you don't take any more risk than is necessary\nTo achieve your goals but let me turn that inside out and give you\nA different reason why you might want to consider a riskier investment strategy and their strategy that includes investing in stocks to some perhaps even significant degree\nLet's say that you've got a few million dollars saved\nAnd you're hardly touching it and you don't think you'll hardly ever touch any of it because you get plenty of income off of that money you've got plenty of income from pensions and Social Security you only spend a few thousand dollars a month your house is paid for your expenses are low\nAnd you've got this money now ordinarily I Would you know we would say like I said a moment ago\nPut the money into those call today but think about this when you die who gets that money\nI'm willing to assume that you are going to leave that money to your surviving spouse and ultimately to your children and your grandchildren\nIn other words if you have a very high degree of confidence that this money will outlast view and will ultimately be transferred to your kids and grandkids\nYou could argue that that money really isn't yours it's ... and you are merely the steward of that money\nYou're the custodian your the caretaker of that money and if you know that you're going to transfer that money to your children and grandchildren who will use it for their lifestyles and their personal financial needs and the achievement of their financial goals\nWell then maybe we should be investing the money with their goals in mind\nMeaning that if your son or daughter had the million dollars they invested in stocks because they would have a long term time horizon and they would want to earn a return that net of taxes and inflation is growing and real economic terms\nTherefore we could argue you should be investing the money not based on your age\nBut based on ... and if your kids are in their fifties or sixties if your grandkids are in their twenties or thirties then maybe you should invest in a portfolio allocation that mirrors them and not you\nKnow we want to make sure we're not doing so to the point that we are really placing you at financial risk or jeopardy\nBut I think we could strike a healthy balance between protecting you for your lifetime while also having an eye toward the legacy of protecting your children's financial futures as well\nAnd on that basis we could in fact argue that you should have stocks in your portfolio\nTo what degree should it be ten percent of the portfolio fifty percent of the portfolio somewhere in between the only way to know for sure is to meet with us all sit down with one of my colleagues here at the firm\nSo that we can examine the entire family dynamic look at what your true expenses are relative to the income available and the resources\nAnd design what that strategy might be taking into consideration the circumstances with your children and grandchildren so don't automatically assume that the older you get you shouldn't have any money in stocks\nInstead look at it as an intergenerational family dynamic because after all that's exactly\nWhat it is so George thanks so much for your question and if you would like to have this conversation with us you can do so just

managing debt saving money and invest in for the future they both shown some interest but more so my son\nI got a book from the library which my son read the entire thing and when it's very excited when he read something about how to invest you know three thousand dollars from a summer job into Iraq IRA in forty years later it's worth a you know big number it was all excited and told me Dan I'm going to be a millionaire someday so\nI'd like to continue um you know that thirst for knowledge but didn't find anything more at the local library for him to read however I Would also like him to learn more about life general financial realities things such as various bank account savings checking credit unions how to balance a checkbook\nUm various kinds of insurance credit card in credit card debt and then just also investing for the future so I'm Wondering what books or digital media would be uh\nYour retirement account behind millions of Americans when they change jobs it's a very tumultuous part of life isn't it can you imagine\nAnything more stressful there are a few I guess getting married getting divorced having kids\nMoving pretty stressful stuff changing a job that's about as stress that's up there on the list isn't it it's leaving behind what was familiar and moving into something uncertain\n\nAnd moving into something uncertain an unfamiliar lot of hopes a lot of aspirations but is it going to work out and in the midst of all this you're thinking about where you're going not where you are coming from\nAnd so you might not be thinking about your retirement plan at work if you've got a four O. one K. or for three bay or for for the southern plan what whatever the case may be do you realize that you shouldn't always leave the money behind\nYou should really consider taking the money with you and then one of two ways other moving money into your new employers retirement plan or move the money into an IRA on your own\nTo one of the other don't necessarily leave the money dormant in an old employer plan don't cash it out make sure you wait all the options including the cost of the old plan versus Lou plant\nAnd yet according to a new study from the Lloyd as many as forty percent four out of ten Americans to change jobs cash out\nTheir retirement accounts [noise]\nThey cashed out not only incurring taxes but at ten percent iris penalty as well and because they take the money and spend it according to avoid those trigger billions tens of billions\nHundreds of billions of dollars of lost retirement value here's something else it gets even worse a lot of workers have borrowed against their four O. one K. at work have you done that have you taken alone against her four one K. guess what happens when you leave your job\nThat loan is doing payable within Ninety Days\nA lot of folks don't have the money so what do they do they end up defaulting on that loan losing a lot of money paying taxes and penalties\nAnd Deloitte says that the amounts to over two hundred billion dollars in lost retirement value because of those defaults so you need to talk to a financial planner if you are preparing\nTo change jobs why because we can help you not only deal with the retirement account you've got so you don't\nLeave it behind we can also help you in making sure you're handling your new retirement account with your new employer

go you know what that is fair Isaac and company\nFight go is that big organization that produces your credit score\nAnd that has huge implications for everything from how much it costs you to borrow money with interest rates you have to pay but whether or not you can even get that loan cycle scores are often used by landlords and employers to deciding whether they want to rent a house or give you a job\nSo the cycle scores a pretty big deal a lot of folks are unable to borrow money because they're fighting the score is too low and credit card companies banks won't let them any money well\nFight those says they're making a big change the biggest change since the Nineteen nineties this is the biggest change in over Twenty years\nA new scoring system that will take into consideration not how you manage your\nLoans I mean traditionally they want to know did you pedal and back on time what if you don't have any loans they're going to look at how you manage your cash how have you been managing the money in your checking account your savings account your money market account and your bank\nBecause their attitude is if you've got an average balance of at least four hundred bucks you have an overt drawn\nIn at least three months and you move money in and out of the account a lot showing that you're managing the account well your score will now rise it's called the ultra psycho score it's going to be brand new introduced early in twenty Nineteen\nAnd you will even be able to tell them which of your bank account you want them to consider so if you do have a bank account that you kind of blow it on\nThey won't count that one is you've got a bank account you've been managing it properly and that's the one they'll pay attention to fight those says that seven million Americans who have low credit scores will see their credit scores go up\nAs a result of this making it easier for them to qualify for loans this will make it easier for them to buy cars which will enable them to get to a job the the otherwise might not have been able to get to and lifting themselves out of poverty it'll be easier for them to qualify for mortgages so they can enter the world of homeownership\nCreating wealth that ranchers don't have an opportunity to do is easily so it's pretty exciting that fake I was coming up with a new program called the ultra psycho score
