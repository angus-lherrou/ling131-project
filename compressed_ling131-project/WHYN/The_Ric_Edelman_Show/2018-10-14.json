{"month": "10", "state": "MA", "station": "WHYN", "content": "Mold grows inside of it end it if it's not exhausted properly of course sometimes those white flexible to just sitting up in the attic re yet on I mean I'm only found those\nI've I've been in many addicts and I say I say my first question why she all the black mold and all the moisture up in the ... so\nI don't see an exhaust fan event in your bathroom oh we just got to vent it into the act I says I Know that I Know I can see that yeah and here's the reason why I can visually see it because of this black mold on your on your raft\nAnd I found water or a almost a two cups of water inside of one of those flexible pipes are sitting in the ... when vertical you up and then it came down and had a little s in it right and lo and behold there was water sitting in and that's what was dripping\nAnd causing a leak inside of their house and they said jeez we don't understand where the stain is coming from and when I showed it to him they couldn't believe it\nRight the the the best players from a to B is a direct point yeah what is nowhere where there was no I'm a ... or ... or a the\nFewer and fewer bends and turns the better but ended and another in another thing\nWhen you when you in your bathroom and you got to exhaust fan on let it run for an extra Fifteen twenty minutes you know go get dressed and go back to the bathroom and shut it off if you shut it off the minute you get out the bathroom the moisture is trapped in into into the flux too\nYes and so you have to leave it running but now believe it or not John ... the new technology of today is that the fan will continue to run even after you shut it off\nOkay and now the new technology of the bathroom fans have moisture readers and even the new technology of today considering that you're now you're houses more tight\nNow they're actually having a very low am bridge and its exchanging the air in and out of your house so it's actually sucking air out and it's and it's actually helping\nPeople and their rights and so is this going to around ... also sucking Aaron in\nAnd of course exchanging the heat you know and that's what it's doing and so again um there's a lot of new technology that goes into bathroom fans and most people don't know about\nRight and if you gotta if and if you're buying the bathroom fan measures the square the cubic footage of the bathroom not per square footage of the bathroom the superhero allow enough of a yeah preached to let that he he scape right\nSo you know this is um something that uh most people when they're out there and they're thinking of all I Need a new fan in the bathroom\nFor ... they don't need a he's a great topic this time of year yeah it is when your clothes in your house up in your ceilings it up for the winter\nOnly putting driveway markers down yeah you're [laughter] you're getting the snow blower ready right you know like\nA you know those those are a article on the news this morning where you can buy\nIn a ... a ... year exchanges of filter and they deliver it to you once a month or once every two months or so you so you can change it automatically without thinking about changing it it will come in the mail you know it's just like a\nHuge razor blades just like just like anything you know a mail service\nUh they have that they have that on on line though yeah\nThey do yeah and also it John it's amazing that this stuff that you think you knew and now they keep coming up with a better mouse trap and yet\nNo offense to that myself there you know I've got to make sure I don't insult any mice so it has to be careful I don't want to anyway so yeah there's there's always a better way of creating something you know this is a ... ventilation insulation and we in in a sense the show's been about ventilation\nSite you think about it because we are venting your bathroom were venting your roof were venting your dryer yes no\nMoisture that's inside your house is not a good thing so now the winter the summertime here we've these humidifier in your basement John yes okay where'd the moisture go did you put did you have to pick it up every time an empty and put it in the bank or you have it automatically draining out\nWell I have I I don't have that much moisture in my ... my basement\nSo it's not something that's turned on and off all the time so you know it's it's a it's not a finished basement it yes is it how to start a\nJob for me per se but I Do have my air conditioning my my air conditioning is affected by it I'll yeah okay so so these are things that are very important that if if the do you live fire shuts off the demystify shuts off that means it needs to be ...\nYeah and that's it and so there are people out there that do it themselves they have to take care of it and they they you know they emptied out themselves and there's other people that have a program that\nAnd then of course now you have um the perimeter what what did they call the skeptics is not my God I Can't even French drink French dreams and then you have the uh you know the water basements systems you know what I mean so you know you have all these different type of things that prevent water and moisture and everything else from going wrong you know\nSo that's a it it's it's funny how we had this topic grow into the ventilation insulation in moisture of your home you know now next thing you know the someone won't talk about gutters\nGutters and want to do you eat a lot of talking about guns no gutters is not fun you know I don't like to ... go to the gutters and then the next week or so gutters will be a a an issue [laughter] people sending them out [laughter]\nWe're gonna have to have a show and gutters next week I think maybe if you want a topic what would you like\nUm just to reiterate some of the people that have been making comments on Facebook of course is that at again\nIs seeing how the Panasonic units are usually the best ones to buy and I totally would agree with that the Panasonic whisper quiet fans are nothing but the best in what are using their sorry a pair of socks send the check to Sandra's REO impacts and police and more than happy to take your check so we'll do that was that the split units him\nWell the Panasonic unit as a manufacturer that makes um different types of fans were going to do all different kinds of things so\nIn other words unless you had a one hundred percent stock portfolio your performance wasn't going to be as good as that since Nineteen twenty six according to but it's an associate the average annual return of the U.S and the five hundred and the Dow Jones industrial average is about ten percent per year that's assuming\nThat you had a portfolio that consisted of nothing button that\nNow who on earth is going to put a hundred percent of their life savings into the stock market\nI wouldn't I don't think you would either because although the stock market has been historically the best performing asset class we also know it's a very volatile outside class remember two thousand eight\nOf course you do and that's the problem is that we don't want to expose ourselves to the possibility of suffering\nMassive losses in a very rapid pace and that's why you only have part of your money in the stock market so up until Wednesday people have been saying\nHow on a I'm a I'm annoyed that I'm not doing as well as the stock market\nHow come I don't have all my money and the stock market because the more diversified my portfolio is no worse it's been doing relative to the stock market because it's been the u._s. stock market that has been out performing everything else\nOf course that's what they were saying up until Wednesday on Wednesday everybody started changing their tune to\nBoy am I really I don't have all of my money and the stock\nMarket boy I'm really glad I have a highly diversified portfolio boy am I glad I have money and investments other than\nThe stock market see my point in other words just because the given an asset classes performing well and even\nMight be performing better than alternatives doesn't mean that you ditch the alternatives instead we have to recognize that every dog has its day at any given moment fortunes can change as we saw was striking evidence on Wednesday and Thursday when the Dow fell Thirteen hundred points\nThis is why you don't place all your money into stocks\nAnd it even goes beyond that because what Wednesday and Thursday demonstrated for us with something else that's really fascinating\nYou all know it's been going on with General Electric right\nWe've been talking about gee for a few times throughout the year because this company which was at one point one of the biggest companies in America and one of the best performing companies in America certainly one of the oldest companies in America\nHas been doing terribly over the past several years the stock was down forty percent over the past year\nGE he was kicked out of the Dow Jones industrial average earlier this year wow really awful so far this year gee is still in the ... five hundred but its stock performance in the U.S and the five hundred year to date through Tuesday\nRanked at the four hundred and Ninety six best\nStock yeah out of the five hundred ... came in at four hundred and Ninety six only for stocks were worse\nThan gee you're the date but as of Wednesday for the past week jeeze stock performance is now number one [laughter]\nIn other words nobody wanted to own Ga all year long because of all the terrible things that have been happening in that company but suddenly with the stock market dropping so much on Wednesday\nCompared to everything else GE did fabulous and became the number one performing stock for the week through\nTuesday of this past week I mean this is why you really can't\nTry to decide what's gonna happen next is you're probably going to blow it in fact it wasn't the just the G anyone from among the worst two of the very best for the weekend and Tuesday if you look at what's been going on in all of the death filed the top ten percent of all stocks compared to the worst ten percent of all stocks there has been a complete flip flop\nYear to date the three best performing stocks of the U.S and the five hundred were advanced micro devices\nA bio med and Netflix they were the three best performing stocks of the year but now as of Wednesday they fell to number three hundred and Ninety three number four hundred and eighty one and number four hundred and forty three respectively\nThey went from being the three best\nTo for the past week as a third Tuesday among the very worst in the marketplace there has been a complete flip flop\nAs a result of the changing of fortunes as of Wednesday the very best performing stocks have become the very worst and many of the very worst have become among the very best this according to analysis published in the wall Street Journal on Thursday\nSo what we have to recognize is that all of this is fleeting the ability to make an investment decision based on how things have performed in the past well that's just a suckers bat and therefore my message she was very simple number one\nLet's not get overly anxious and fixated on point declines in the Dow Jones industrial average number two this is an argument a reinforcement for why you need to maintain a diversified portfolio based on your goals and objectives and number three to maintain your focus\nOn those goals and objectives if your goals and objectives have not changed if your personal circumstances have not changed\nIf your attitude about risk has not changed than there is absolutely positively no reason for you to be making any change in your investment strategy\nThe fact that the stock market had a lousy day one day this past week is not enough itself enough of a reason to make a change in the portfolio now I'm not suggesting that we aren't going to see continued volatility in the market my point is very simply\nCan't draw a conclusion one way or the other nor should we attempt to make a prediction about what's going to happen next instead look at the economic fundamentals unemployment is at the lowest level in this\nTrey since Nineteen sixty nine wage growth is at its highest level over the last ten years\nThe economy is still hunting along just fine and on that basis the argument for staying fully invested in a diversified portfolio remains completely\nIntact and so if you're upset about it if you're watching the news and worried about what you're seeing stopped watching the news it doesn't mean you should change your investments that means you should change the channel that's the most effective advice I can give you on the show today I Want you to stay with us because if you're still struggling\nOn what you should be doing with your investments I have the number one piece of advice\nAnd I'm going to tell you what it is when we come back here on the Rick element show\nSo if you're struggling not knowing what you ought to be doing I'm going to tell you exactly what you should do\nAnd you're not going to stay with us from

[noise]\nFall back to the program Rick Edelman here things\nThe age of financial advisors in this country according to a new industry survey from practical perspectives more than half of the nation's advisors will be gone within ten years\nAccording to all the latest industry research the average advisor is in their late fifties early sixties in fact there are more financial advisors in this country who are eighty that and who are thirty\nThis is an aging industry\nA lot of young folks don't want to get into the investment management business because of its negative reputation and concerns over not being able to make a whole lot of money at it they're going into other businesses like investment banking or law or accounting where they think there's better career opportunities for them\nThere aren't a lot of young folks in this business so the average advisor in this industry is older so I Want to ask you the question is you're focusing on your retirement have you given any thought your your advisers retirement because according to some industry statistics\nHalf of all advisors in this nation will be gone within ten years they will have quit or\nRetired is that possibly your advisor and if so what happens to you and your account\nIs even if you retire you need to continue having your money managed right well not just a retirement but through your entire life\nIf your advisors not going to be around who do you turn to you want to make sure your advisor as part of a team part of an organization that has stability but it's going to be here long term to provide the continuity and consistency of the advice of services you've grown to expect\nFrom your advisor so one of the things we love best about are from here at home in financial we've got a hundred and sixty advisors in forty three officers nationwide we work collectively as a team so no one client is dependent on any one individual for the advice and services and quality that they're receiving\nAnd that's what we would recommend for you as well have a conversation with your advisor about their career\nExpectations and plans and make sure their plan is in your best interest\nI'm Rick Adelman you're listening to the truth about money triple a plan wreck online at ... dot com click that red button schedule a call\nCan tell us the day in time you want us to call you know voice mail no some tax will make it simple and easy for you to get the answers and information you need for your personal finances [noise]\nBy doing that by Rick free guy portfolio selection at ... dot com [noise]\nYou're thinking about retirement Social Security pension investments will you have enough income to enjoy yourself and well your income last for the rest of your life\nHi I'm Rick Edelman now you can find out if your savings and investments can generate the retirement income you need the income you expect for your entire retirement and you can find out for free without free retirement review\nYes you can get a free retirement review from one of the experience financial planners ...

on news radio five sixty WHYY end [noise]\nWe're taking telephone calls here on the record on show heading out to Troy, Michigan polls on the line how you doing fall\nOn my question is about the option of taking a a on some ... ... and given the opportunity to take all your input on it\nSo ah the question is whether you take the lump sum a or a series of monthly checks for as long as you live and uh it's it's an important question isn't it because once you give them your answer you're like\nStuck with it forever [laughter] so that's it uh yeah it's like they're no reduce no do overs and such like that and that's why it's pretty vexing for a lot of folks\nThe good news is this it is straight math in other words we simply want to look at\nHow much money they're going to offer you on a monthly basis versus if we take the lump sum\nPay any taxes associated with that invest the rest how much income can we reasonably expect to produce from a an investment we make with that lump sum and is that money going to be equal to what you would have gotten from the pension\nSo the good news is all requires is a bit of math and I can tell you this usually\nWhen we do that math for our clients the answer is take the lump sum and invest it on your own to produce your own monthly income usually not always but usually that is the more\nCost effective more economic uh the the superior answer given the two choices now I say usually and here's one big case where it's\nUsually not true of great Australian our federal employees and the reason is that in some pensions\nThe pension amount you receive will grow over time they will actually increase the amount of income you're receiving sort of like Social Security increases the sheer they just announced that there will be a\nVery small Social Security increase for folks mostly about thirty or forty bucks for most Social Security beneficiaries\nUm so if you have a pension where where the monthly income you're receiving will rise annually than a clearly that are in most cases is the better choice but most pensions don't do that most pensions it's a fixed amount\nWhatever they're giving you one day one is the same you're going to get ten years from now Twenty years from now Thirty years from now and that's a big reason for choosing the lump sum over the monthly pension because when you take the monthly pension\nThere are several pieces of fine print\nNumber one is I just said that amount will not rise which means overtime inflation will take its toll on the value of that monthly check\nThe the ability to buy goods and services diminishes because those costs rise but the check your receiving doesn't second is that when you die that pension benefits stops are you married Paul\nNo single okay so it's not an issue for you if you don't have a spouse or partner you don't have to worry about that but for people who are married to have a partner a vet pension check stops when they die and that leaves a huge crisis for their surviving spouse\nOr so that's a consideration a that's not a problem for you so not as big a deal another major one his lack of liquidity once you take the monthly check that's all you ever get as a monthly check if you ever need access to the big bucket of money it's not available to you whereas if you take the lump sum now invested and generate your own income\nYou can increase that income whenever you want to keep pace with inflation you can reduce it you can start it stop it if you need a lump sum it's available to you you have greater flexibility and when you die whatever you didn't spend stays there for your heirs\nSo the lump sum has greater flexibility that is often superior to taking the pension benefit but here's one final point in favor of the pension\nYou don't have to worry about your own habits in other words some folks if they are given a lump sum\nWill blow the cash and they will discover at some point that the money was spent on vacations and on jewelry on on big screen TVs on lottery tickets and beer and they have nothing to show for it in ten years and now they're in trouble whereas if they had taken the monthly check\nThey can be pretty confident that they will get another monthly check next month like Social Security checks and so they can protect themselves from their own\nA tendency to get my meaning so you have to know your salary you have to know can you be trusted to receive this lump sum manage it permanently properly for your own personal benefit or will you be your own worst enemy\nCarrie thanks for your question uh yes you can reasonably expect that further increases in interest rates will create further declines in the value of bombs now a couple of caviar to this number one yes the markets\nAnticipate\nActions by the government in other words if it is clear if the government has sent messages which they sometimes do that they are going to do things the market's doing dissipate that and they adjust\nSecurities prices based on that\nIn other words this is called a leading economic indicator and that's what the financial markets are they are leading indicators in other words they are pricing securities today based on what they think is going to happen as opposed to a lagging indicator\nThat occurs when prices are based on what already happened so the market as a leading indicator not a lagging indicator so yes to some degree prices are based on what everybody collectively things is going to happen but having said that\nWe are never really shore truly what is going to happen or when so while many people believe that the fed will continue to raise rates nobody's really sure when the fed will raise rates next or by how much and therefore bond prices are not fully\nBaked end on that answer so for that reason you can expect that there will be further declines in the bond market if there are further increases in interest rates second\nBonds react differently to interest rate increases depending on the maturity date the duration of the bond a thirty year bond will have a much bigger decline than a thirty day bond\nThat makes sense the longer the duration the longer the maturity date the greater the swing and value due to changes in interest rates so if you're fearful\nA much lower cost than traditional whole life insurance and the people who bought these policies back in the eighties and nineties will remember interest rates were back then\nInterest rates were much higher and the insurance companies were assuming that they were going to continue to earn those high interest rates and that's why they were able to charge very low costs for the policies well guess what those high interest rates have come down the policy costs have gone up\nAnd the people who bought those policies back in the eighties and nineties while they're now in retirement there now in their seventies and eighties and nineties and they are getting notices that the cost of their insurance is rising\nTo the point where people can't afford the policies anymore so just about the time they are getting nearer to their date of death\nThey have to cancel the policies because they can't afford them anymore and all the money they've spent for all of these decades is no poof it's gone so if you own a universal life insurance policy different from whole life different from term life if you own a universal\nLife insurance policy and you are struggling to figure out what to do with it can you afford to keep it ... you have available to you\nGive us a call we may very well be able to help you with that so called us a AAA to plan wreck if you have a universal life insurance contract and you're struggling about what to do with it\nYou know there's other news and the ah world of fraud a are paid just came out with a a an amazing survey result\nYou know you have an online account right you have more than one you've got a bunch of them so just pick your most frequent online account put that in your head for a minute right you know what a count you have on line that you use more than anything else and you have a password don't you on that account\nDo you use that same password on more than one account according to ... research half of all Americans do half of us have the same password across multiple online accounts\nThat's dangerous because of a crook gets a hold of one they can therefore use it to open lots of others of your accounts\nHalf of Americans have found fraudulent charges on their credit or debit card but only fourteen percent of order the credit freeze on their credit report so if you haven't frozen your credit report you can now do it for free as of last month the federal government says it's now free for you to freeze your credit report\nSo you need to take a look at this also keep in mind that\nUsing a debit card\nDoes not protect you from fraud the same way as a credit card does you know if you let's say you use a credit card and you get ripped off someone steals your card or someone makes a fraudulent purchases or you use your card yourself with a vendor doesn't deliver the goods right and you just you know you you just\nCharged hundreds even thousands of dollars and you got nothing to show for it under federal law you're only liable\nFor the first fifty bucks\nAs long as you notify the vendor and the credit card company right away like I think it's within forty eight hours\nYou're liability is only fifty dollars\nBut that's not true if you use a debit card if you use a debit card you owned a total liability for fraudulent charge so you need to be aware of this fact something you'd be three simple steps number one\nPut a freeze on your credit report number to\nSet up online access for all of your financial accounts why because if you don't set up online access for your accounts a crook might do it in your place so you need to do it first and three\nI Know it's a nuisance and it's a pain but create a separate password for each of your accounts if you will engage in it in this way you will do a lot to reducing the risk\nThat your accounts will get hacked\nAnd you know what else is happening in the world of Wall Street annuity sales are growing\nEspecially among why our houses and independent broker dealers it's interesting but I knew what he sales have been dropping for the past couple of years why suddenly you're indexed annuity sales rising you know why because the department of labor's rule that was prohibiting these products\nWent away the court to overturn the department of labor's rules regarding the fiduciary standard that were hired\nWall Street to act in the best interests of their clients that rule went away and while the rule was about to be implemented there was a reduction in the sale of indexed annuity products but now suddenly with the rule gone\nYou know with the guard no longer guarding the hen house of boxes moving back on in independent broker dealer sub so two point six billion dollars worth of indexed annuities in just the second quarter of this year overall annuity sales are up Eighteen percent from a year ago\nBecause the rule doesn't exist meanwhile the SEC is creating its own best interests rule to replace the department of labor's ruled that the court threw away but an organization called the plain language group says the FCC has proposed rule is written at the fourteenth\nGrade level the average adult reads at the eighth grade level they say that there's a problem with the way the information is laid out cost and fees don't appear until the second page bullets on the left side of the page don't have the same type of information was both on the right side of the page there's a lot of industry jargon\nIn other words the FCC's proposal could probably use\nSome improvement so you gotta watch out as an organization that you're dealing with acting in your best interests and are they doing so because it's the right thing to do are they doing so only because of regulator says they gotta Merrill Lynch which originally said they would conform to what is your standard has reintroduced\nCommissions into retirement account so has commonwealth financial and J. P. Morgan they originally said they would ban commissions and retirement accounts they now have changed their mind why because the rule in a way you want to make sure your financial advisors looking out

action I mean the stock market back then was at fourteen thousand before the crisis\nUh today the Dallas pushing twenty five thousand housing prices back you know seven weren't as high as they are today in major markets so shouldn't people actually be better off today now that we've had an extra ten years of savings on top of it and yet you're saying that's not really true in a lot of cases\n... stock market the people who hold stocks or the people in the high end conference so if you look at the top third and yes they have equity holdings and they have a their stock values have gained and\nTheir stock of Italian um but for the bottom two thirds of households ... really don't hold very much stocks and I think the housing a story is yes for almost back to where it was our our data trick two thousand sixteen and hadn't quite gotten back to the off\nPeak of the bubble a by two thousand sixteen but the house is a really high on the couch and she didn't know at Boston New York and California and and not so high in between and not even high in all parts of California\nAnd this is I think the point that a lot of folks really don't fully comprehend them and we see this every day and our financial planning practice that\nAlthough it's true that people who own stocks and oh seven had they held through today they'd be a lot better off\nThe first fact as you point out as most people did known stocks at all second those many of those who did hold stocks in those seven panicked and nine sold at the low or near it and so they're kind of frozen in time there are ... are pretty much were they were even though we're ten years later\nThey haven't enjoyed the run up in value because they didn't hold on to their investments are having continue to add to their investments and so they are still stuck where they were ten years ago\nThat that's a lot of people lost their jobs ... ah two thousand seven in two thousand nine and had to turn to their four one K. and other retirement holdings to make ends meet during that period\nSo even if I hadn't panicked events just demanded that they withdraw their money well on marriage issues medical issues other family issues they just didn't have the luxury of holding on to their investments\nSo that means people are now in a conundrum because here we are ten years later everyone's ten years older retirement is ten years closer\nAnd they might not have the retirement savings account values today that they had hoped they would have by now that's forcing people to work longer but is that as viable or an answer as you might hope\nSo I'm at great fan of people working longer I think it's the most powerful lever Pete that people can control and a half", "show_name": "The Ric Edelman Show", "year": "2018", "city":
