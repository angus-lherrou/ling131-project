I don't see no water I don't see no water on my floor underneath the floor it's underneath the sub floor it's under these are are they going to the triple ... for it it\nIt could be under the multiple layers so John and this particular case we ripped out all the cabinet it's our intention was to rip the for off the vinyl off and what we found underneath that was the ... I'm a quarter inch laminate okay inches ... which is the low on just to have the\nVinyl which ... if you use in something don't use ... but use finished three H pie\nDough no wage on it was vinyl so all it was to create a of a level surface to surface because they had vinyl underneath that right so then underneath that vinyl then you had the plywood which was the original for when he was a three aids or actually half inch plywood\nUnderneath that was the sub before which was sub par substandard and that was mould and mildew infested but you couldn't see any of this because in the basement they put a sheet rock ceiling across the top\nSo you couldn't see what was going on underneath the for when you when you pulled up that sheet underneath you saw all of the mold underneath the only thing that the ... there was a finished basement there was a finished basement so of course in the finished basement they had insulation yes which held\nAll the moisture so is is that a good\nThing or that I Am I'm I'm a I'm a big fan of never putting up drywall and your ceiling in your basement never what about inflation in the rafters if you have insulation on the walls you don't need it on the raft of or excuse me on the ceiling um yeah my fingers because the between the\nFirst and the second for the uh you don't need it now sound proofing\nYeah so that when people walk across the floor upstairs or when you're down stairs in your basement watching a movie so there's a reason for that because it creates the sound barrier to try to muscle the noise if you're wide screen TV that you're building your man cave off\nYou know and you're going to start out bickers in stereos and bar and I'm Sorry\nIs it sounds as a soundproof insulation of ... an hour value insulation\nYes who does sound proving we'll give you our value as well\nUm you know you can you can use all of the different ... you know reasoning for sound proofing and of course with a hard five eats board and use it actually believe it or not a double five eight ... you can actually create even more sound proof in your own house insulation\nDouble five eats that can create a huge sound proving effective if you're doing um for example home theater systems where you have to create and if you turn that volume up\nThat's going to reverberate right through the entire house so depending on where you position this again anyone could put in a sixty five inch television yes but if you don't know how that television is going to interact with the speakers the wiring\nThe rooms next door that's where the biggest problem comes\nWhen the ... while the vibration and the act when in or what not out of the sound system\nSo I had I'll give you a perfect example I had met with a husband and wife they wanted to finish their basement and the husband says I Want the television right here and of course I looked at this then I said OK you put the television there\nWho's going to watch TV says I'm going to come watch every single football game and she goes I'm not going to be there I'm going to bed I don't care her bedroom was right above the television\nAnd when I said to him he's got to turn the volume\nUp because you know most of us men are deaf and we don't hear right right okay so guess what she's like oh you're not putting the television they're moving across the room and of course it was nowhere near and made any kind of sense but it but she says if you don't sound proof it\nI don't want it and that automatically change the entire scope because it they didn't take into consideration all of the other things that go wrong\nIn the house we got and that's what we got to deal with\nWe got five minutes left to show give us a call an eight hundred three three one Ninety four Ninety six eight hundred three three one nine four nights and we gave\nA potpourri of information today you know hey we're here I'm here for the next two more weeks yes so if you have any questions you can Texas you can email us at each other\nIs this and maintain a highly diversified investment portfolio last week I talked about the fact that highly diversified portfolio doesn't guarantee against lawsuits that doesn't mean you're going to always have above average returns in fact it's probably going to mean you're going to get kind of average return to fats how you've invested\nAnd this year in particular as a kind of a wacky year because although\nValue stocks normally do better than growth stocks that's not the case this year although foreign stocks usually do better than us stocks that's not the case this year and so\nWe also find that that energy stocks are down gold stocks a gold itself is down\nA so we were finding that a diversified portfolio isn't performing the way that the ordinarily you might assume it would or at least based history would suggest to us that uh that it would in fact we're seeing highly concentrated investment results\nSix stocks in the U.S and the five hundred have accounted for forty percent of the total profits this year in the U.S and pay six out of five hundred\nAre you able to pick the fix that matter oh can I and that's kind of the dilemma and this is why we maintain our position\nAnd why we continue to recommend for you on this radio show that you should invest in the diversified fashion and one of the best ways to do that is using exchange traded funds\nThese eat ts are relatively new they've only been around a couple of decades compared to mutual funds that have been around since the Nineteen twenties\nAnd each he asks are simply a cheaper version of an antiquated retail mutual fund they generally you know you don't have to pay commissions to buy them there are very low expenses there is also generally very low turnover which means the annual tax liability is very low\nAnd each year we believe simply offer a better alternative in many cases for many investors and as evidence of this I think I you know I've been promoting and ... I don't know what Fifteen Years and we are in fact finding that back in a wage\nThat was about a half a trillion invested in each yes that was you know ten years ago today it's not half a trillion it's three point four trillion dollars that investors have placed into ATF\nAnd that is exciting it shows that hey you're getting the message that's that's really fabulous you're paying attention to diversification you're paying attention to investment costs are and you're staying up to date with the investment opportunities which maybe aren't the same as what you grow up with and what you were familiar with\nWhat you've accepted the need to adapt and stay current with the marketplace so I think that's a really very exciting\nOr is it\nBecause if we take a look at data that has just come out from a a recent survey\nBack ten years ago to the credit crisis of two thousand eight you know it's great that each shift the sky rocketed in in value from five hundred billion to three point four trillion you know part of that as market appreciation of course but a big part of it is your contributions in the ATF says well\nBut not everybody's been\nTaking advantage of that and I'm not just saying that they're not taking advantage of ATF themselves they're not taking advantage of investing at all\nTen years after the crisis we discover according to this latest survey research that twenty seven percent of Americans stopped saving for retirement they stopped contributing\nTo their four one K. entirely they were so spooked by two thousand eight they lost so much money so rapidly\nThat scared them out of the markets apparently for ever twenty seven percent one out of four Americans no longer saving for their future and fourteen percent have continued to save what they're doing so in\nCash oh my goodness so instead of\nWatching their investments triple and values since two thousand nine I mean that's what the stock market has done its tripled in value instead they've been earning less than one percent a year because that's what you know bank accounts have been paying over the last ten years zero point nothing\nOnly ten percent of people in the survey said they invest more today than they were in two thousand eight two thirds are saving less today than they were\nAnd almost eighty percent say they can't explain what happened in the financial crisis they don't get it they don't understand what occurred\nAnd so it's no wonder that Seventy eight percent trust Wall Street less than they did in two thousand eight and only forty one percent say they feel fully recovered financially\nIn the face of an economic expansion unraveled in American history with the stock market tripling and values since the steps of two thousand nine\nThe majority of Americans still say\nThat they earn behind where they were ten years ago and you know what the biggest crisis is about all of that\nEverybody's ten years older everybody's ten years closer to retirement and that's the big problem and just permeates through out American society regardless of age group according to another survey forty six percent of millennials\nSaid they believed that they need at least a thousand dollars to start investing Seventeen percent say they think they need at least ten thousand dollars to start investing\nThat's simply true anymore due to advanced technology you can invest\nIt you can open an account with a dollar not a thousand not ten thousand now I'm not suggesting you should necessarily do that before you joined your retirement plan to work before you pay off credit card debt or before you Bill cash reserves but the point is it doesn't take a lot of money anymore to build investments\nAnd oh by the way\nA lot of parents are are not saving a lot either it's not just the millennials but the millennials parents that aren't saving a lot and you know one big reason for that\nI'm going to tell you when we come back here on the Rick Adelman show I'm going to tell you\nWhat it is that parents are spending five hundred billion dollars on every single year and no it's not their kids who are on the playground K. through twelve ... it's not raising children that are that parents are spending a lot of money on\nIt something else and I'm going to tell you what it is when we come back on the program Steve you can figure it out before we\nReturn and we're going to tackle that in a whole lot of other fascinating information including the latest investment opportunities you probably always wished you could get a pizza but never had the opportunity to\nBe amazed at some opportunities out there and some threats\nStay with us for more here on the record woman show triple late plan wreck on line at rice element [noise]\nNow perfect time to talk with us about a mortgage loan\nMany options to consider will find you a loan that is right for\nCall today and get started\nOf time on an ...\nWeek nights starting at seven on news radio five sixty W.

money that parents are spending on their kids who are in their twenties and thirties\nAnd how it's impacting the parent's ability to save for their own retirement and how kids are now recognizing that they're struggling with\nTheir own personal finances but it's not just the parents are damaging their own financial security for the benefit of their kids and that their kids are scared that they're not going to be able to accumulate enough money on their own\nThere's another survey that shows the reversal of this then it's going back up line sixty four percent of teenagers according to a new survey by junior achievement sixty four percent of teenagers\nAre concerned about their parent's ability to retire\nSo in other words mom and dad you're doing a great job doing whatever it takes to support your children\nAnd you know what your children know it even to the point that your teenagers are worried about your financial future\nAnd what's really so fascinating about this whole thing is that even though sixty four percent of teens two thirds are worried about their parents preparedness for retirement\nSixty nine percent of teenagers say they know little or nothing about financial planning well actually I think they know a lot more than they realize if they're worried about their parent's ability to save for retirement and their parents ability to in fact retire in financial comfort in security\nWell that's what financial planning is all about and teenagers are looking at you mom and dad\nAnd they're worried about you first of all I think there's something a little bit wrong with our country of teenagers are worrying about their parents' financial security but that's a whole another conversation but here's the problem\nTeenagers in fact as we pointed out earlier on the program today they know very little about personal finance one third of teenagers according to the survey by junior achievement one third of teenagers I Hope you're sitting down for this\nAnd if you're driving the car you might want to pull over as I give you this assisting\nOne third of teenagers believe they will need less than five thousand dollars in order to retire [noise]\nOh my goodness gracious they think they're going to need five grand or less in order to retire\nA hello I'm so clearly kids have no reasonable conception of what life costs they don't understand how expensive car czar or houses or food or health insurance\nThey have no clue and you know why because mom and dad you haven't told them I think\nSo my recommendation my advice for you mom and dad is next time you sit down to pay your bills have your teenager sit along side you have them write the checks on your behalf out of your checking account when you're balancing your checkbook letting them participate\nIn games with them when Dick Cheney go talking about investments include them in the conversation\nYour kids are worried about this and maybe they don't need to be as worried\nYou know kids are grown up with a lot of stress and strife they've got challenges dealing with issues you and I never had to deal with when we were growing up school shootings and and massive drug epidemics and oh my goodness gracious the whole political environment and yet the last thing we need to do is to pile on with them worried about your\nRetirement security so I think the time has come to eliminate that last taboo in American society you know we're willing to talk politics with our kids ruined a sock religion with our kids were willing to talk sex with our kids it's time we started talking about money\nWith our kids as well\nHey let's go to our asks Rick segments as you know You're welcome to send me your questions in an audio file just use your smartphone to record your own voice send it to me by email to ...\nAt ... dot com we had two questions this week on the very same subject which is kind of weird but here's the first one from caster you remember him he's from Brazil you call this a couple of weeks ago there was a castor has to say\nHer acres Custer against from Brazil you seemed a little bit surprised with affects that to your show was listening to all sides of the U.S but I think you're insured that because of course I don't pay much attention when they talk about for one case Roth IRAs and stuff like that because\nThe roads here are totally different but I Do for her opinion when it comes to principals like financial responsibility a diversification editor location\nDollar cost averaging or in my case ... and my question is about one of those general principles budget\nIf I'm not mistaken you said here answer shows at budgeting is not a very good use of so much time but we'll take a look at my case for instance I have two daughters one is eight years old all the run this two years old the youngest one would go to a private school next year just like the oldest\nSo far as being able to save a little more literal above twenty percent of my income but was this extra ... if I don't make adjustments or want to be able to save as much and I'm going to be saving about tough as much of what an saving\nAnd I'd like to avoid it with an ...\nAn starting to work on my budget for just south of Nineteen so I can see where it can cut the expense of my income is pretty much in study I can do much about it\nThese are called required minimum distribution the IRS tells you how much you must withdraw there is a minimum amount you must withdraw and it's required hence the name R. M. G. required minimum distribution\nWhen you begin to do it you have a choice\nYou can take the money is a single lump sum once a year or you can take the money during the year whenever you feel like it or you can do it systematically such as taking the same amount of money every month like clockwork so you get a monthly check out of your account just like you would get a Social Security check\nIt doesn't really matter Chet how you do it provided\nYou do it consistently in other words if you're going to receive a monthly check every December which you said you were doing fine go ahead and do that your dollar cost averaging in reverse you're making withdrawal every December and you'll do that for the rest of your life\nIf you wanted to do it on a more frequent basis instead of one check once a year you take twelve checks once a month that's fine to do it however you wish just make sure that whatever you choose you maintain on a consistent basis that's how you will generate the best value\nFrom a reverse dollar cost averaging perspective this way you get the average cost of the withdrawals based on the values of the accounts at the time what I'm more concerned about\nIs not so much whether you do it once a year or once a month I I'm really not worried about that so much the difference isn't that huge the bigger concern I have\nIs whether you're doing it in conform ... with the IRS rules as I mentioned if you don't do it correctly you could pay a fifty percent penalty\nAnd what do I need by doing it correctly well if you have multiple retirement accounts which most people do they've got an IRA\nMaybe his name another IRA and her name the guide retirement accounts from several multiple employers in the past\nThe IRS generally says we only care about the total dollar value of the accounts but we separately care if any of those accounts\nWere for a one case in other words you can't take money from an IRA that was meant to be withdrawn from a four O. one K. even though you might have taken the proper amount failing to take it from the proper accounts\nCreates the penalty problem here's another concern the IRS calculation is not based on the date of the withdraw this is a big mistake that people often make especially if you're withdrawing the money\nOnce every month the IRS doesn't face the calculation on when you withdraw the money they base the calculation on the value of the town on the prior December thirty one\nSo based on that you might accidentally withdraw two little\nThis raises the question will the insurance company be able to honor the obligations that the company itself was not able to do\nI'm going to give you the advice that I've been giving you for years if you work for an employer that promises you a pension you need to assume that the pension doesn't exist\nDon't assume that hey I got a pension and therefore don't have to say for my future wrong\nDon't assume your employer will honor its obligations don't assume you'll get as much money as they are promising don't assume you'll get money for as long as they're promising\nYou need to save for retirement as though the pension doesn't exist fabulous great if you do end up getting the pension good for you nobody ever yelled at me because they ended up saving too much money you know what I'm saying so\nBe careful it's really the simple answer whether you worked for a state or local government whether you worked for a union dare I even say you worked for the federal government you need to assume\nThat these entities will struggle to meet their financial obligations obligations they took decades ago under a very different economic environment in this nation are very different workplace environment than we have today\nAre and if you have questions about your pension if you have questions about when to start your pension if you're being offered a buyout by your employer should you take it\nIf you're wondering should you start your pension benefits and when you do you take a single life only should you do a joint a life with your spouse should you do a term certain benefit how should you take your pension it's a one time only decision once you make the decision you can't ever change it it's a big deal in other words\n... let us help you you've never face this before but hey we have lots of times let us help you like we've helped a lot of folks just like you call us a triple late plan wreck don't go the pension decision alone policy triple eight Seventy five to sixty seven forty two let\nMe change subjects here I'm I'm broadcasting as I mentioned to you from San Francisco I'm excited to be here and guess what San Francisco is the home of the headquarters\nIs Fargo and so we can't have a edition of the show go by without talking about the latest of Wells Fargo\nTheir chief financial officer John ... said this past week that he expects business loans commercial real estate and commercial and industrial and stuff all\nTotal loans were down three billion dollars compared to prior quarter\nWhy it looks like a lot of people are unwilling to do business with Wells Fargo can't say I blame us regulators have just now rejected Wells Fargo does plan to repay customers who were pushed into buying unnecessary auto insurance\nRegulators are saying the bank must do more to make sure it's find every driver who was affected by this the consumer financial Protection Bureau to see if you ... and the office of the comptroller of the currency the euro cc\nThey say they need more assurances for most Fargo that they're going to do everything they need to find and repay everyone who was overcharged\nWells Fargo was doing was saying to people who got car loans that in order to get the car loan you must buy auto insurance from us even though people already had auto insurance elsewhere and then Wells Fargo devastated their bank accounts in order to get the payment when people couldn't pay the auto loans Wells Fargo in some cases\nCharge overdraft fees damage their credit and even in some cases repossessed their vehicles\nAccording to the ... being the OCC this could involve six hundred thousand drivers last year Wells Fargo said it would take sixty four million dollars to pay everybody back but lawyers representing the drivers say that's way too low a number\nMeanwhile the Justice Department is probing whether employees committed fraud and Wells Fargo spanking you that they want to know the Justice Department if management prompted employees to improperly alter add information of people's accounts the Justice Department wonders if there's a pattern of unethical and\nPotentially fraudulent employee behavior tied to management pressure\nWell along the way Wells Fargo has suspended two executives of federal probe in the purchase of low income housing tax credit is behind it a senior VP and another V. paid the Justice Department is investigating whether the bankers colluded with developers to submit low ball bids on tax credits\nWells Fargo by the way is the largest purchaser nine billion over the last five years of this tax credits and it's not just those two are VPs that have been suspended wells has fired or suspended a dozen other employees at Wells Fargo securities\nAlleging that these individuals charged meals to the company improperly we're talking nine analysts and others from New York San Francisco in Charlotte think about that New York San Francisco and Charlotte\nThree incredibly different locations geographically suggesting this is a system white issue not something isolated\nDo a local office will do to all the above Wells Fargo says they're going to cut staff ten percent over the next three years\nAnd is it any wonder that according to a new survey Wells Fargo staff or more miserable than at any time in the past three years employee satisfaction has weakened staff confidence in the firm's business outlook has dropped to the lowest level

get your benefits or is it is true in a ... is advancing advantageous in the meantime or after full retirement age at least your\nBenefits go eight percent tax free uh where where else can I get ... percent tax free virtually guaranteed unless the government failed that's a good a good thing and even if you do not live long enough what seems to be a concern of many people\nAre tourists have as much a crude benefit as if you had taken Social Security at sixty two uh if you do wait until toward Seventy or Seventy you're surviving spouse will get a much larger monthly benefit after you are no longer able to collect them\nI think you're raising really too too very important points Donald I'm really glad you did you get it and that's great are a lot of folks really don't the one thing I
