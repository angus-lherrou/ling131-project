phones are ringing today in didn't it might\nBe the attorney general's office are looking at me but that ... you know by the way that was another joke just to those that understand humor yeah sarcasm ... self deprecating yeah things like that\nAll of that above well you know John some people don't have a sense of humor anymore have you noticed that everybody's too politically correct I Know I Know\n\nThat Dan has the question in Middlebury how are you Dan ... good morning I listen to your show all the time of great show well we're really sorry that it does come in good at the insane asylum ranks [laughter]\nThe that was another joke now that said he's going to hang up then how can we do our when\nI heard you talking about a replacement doors than we are looking at getting a a service to replace a door for entry into our garage at the previous one that's Twenty one years old the jam as you talked about this morning as writing at the bottom\nAnd always that door still is getting a little soft and you\nKnow I did talk to the Thurmond true a distributor in our area and uh got prices for getting one but I Need one put it\n[noise] okay well we can do to me to be with the ... was it was that exist indoors steel door\nExisting door was a thermometer door I just had a a ... a jam\nFinger joined the gym and and it's in a garage in the back of the house probably ... percent of the house in the front of the house okay in the water in the snow when when he plows Denise no blows and it just sits there in the gym and it just goes to the survey disintegrates now did you order the door by the way\nNo okay so yes we can come out there and we can take a look at it we can give you the options of styles and the pricing\nAnd we can get it installed for you no problem\nWith the thermal to say to you a damn when you when you called the manufacturers rep\nWell at a store here that sells the mill work and stuff like that and uh that math okay they said that they gave me a price on on ordering\nThe door from sort of a truce directly I liked the door itself is just the jam rotted out give them a shameless plug what was the name of the store you remember a yeah I I sorry I just can't\nPull it out yeah you see he had some ... you know ... it it just like John at home and themselves they don't want to say but you know any if you buy from a quality distributor quality place that's going to order the door it's going to be manufactured and it's going to take two weeks to three weeks to get in that's what you're looking for\nUm you don't want to buy a door that doesn't have a composite Jim Wright and into a composite still because you'll end up having the problem again\nNow it's the door to his garage is that an important or John yes yes it is and the reason is very simple because everyone doesn't pay attention to that during the the even the burglar will try to break through that door because most people\n... fortify their front door and their back door they don't always fortified the garage door which is something that's very good so Dan\nAbsolutely would love to come out there who will get your name and information and will ah will take a look at it for you is there anything else are we going to\nHave dinner or you do it yourself and you look into an ...\nTo install the John well hear him earlier he said he ... someone to install it\nYeah I I wouldn't be able to do it myself I Do have a neighbor who can who can do that but he's so busy with other\nThings you know they'll do it will do it right on John Will personally come out and do what do you think I can personally come out there and look at that book and we're the most important part most of the garage door as well\nAs measuring it costs a lot of 'em are sixty in that seminal I mean ... you know that the ... ... you know some of the eight inch or\nOf them are in Middlebury by the way it's central Massachusetts than what you get out there seven eight and ... lives depended on the house is no it's true by the way it in the doors now not tying up their most people make the biggest mistake\nOh yeah they measured and I think it was seven inches but I'm\nOK okay and how old's the house a then Twenty one I saw so it's up it's up to alright code\nWill will come out there and we'll see you how's that Dan okay that's a good thing or hang on one eight hundred\nThree three one nine for nine six again one eight hundred three three one nine for nine six if you do have a project that you're thinking about\nAnd you know you got we're talking about doors and security and things like that so we want to make sure that you're thinking of safety now let me remind you of something else you go out and buy a lock and you've got a key how many of us loser keys\nHow many of us has kids that lose the keys how many of us if you lost a key and you can't find the key you can't get into your house so there are things that are programmable\nThat you you do a little punch code you could change the codes that anytime there's stuff that links to your phone believe it or not those program absolutely fabulous would you recommend them\nIt'll be ... yes yes now do you have to do you have to change the whole door locks no you don't it fits right in the same hole it fits right there it's all internally\nThe evidence and data which says that the U.S and the five hundred as average ten percent a year since Nineteen twenty six doesn't include fees\nBecause you can't buy an index you can buy an index fund\nBut the fund is going to have expenses which means you're not going to earn ten you're going to earn ten minus the costs so if you have a diversified portfolio as the Ohio public employees' retirement system does they're projecting seven point two percent a year\nSo we need to keep this in mind for two reasons number one to make sure that your expectations are reasonable and realistic and number two to make sure that you recognize\nThat this is a long term projection and at any given moment this month's performance the last quarter\nThe year to date the past one or three years anything can happen in that short a period Ohio isn't suggesting that that's the rate of return that they're going to hit in twenty Eighteen they're not suggesting that is the return they got in the third quarter of the year or year to date they're saying that over the long term they're\nExpecting targeting\nAn assumption of seven point two percent and oh by the way\nThat's before fees because you know Ohio doesn't pay the kinds of fees retail investors had 'cause you don't have a hundred billion to invest and we all know that people will invest a hundred billion don't pay the costs that retail investors who have one million or one hundred thousand or ten grand et cetera et cetera get my point\nNow let me take another step for\nWhen you are making your investments\nWhich investments is it your assuming are going to perform well because a lot of investors think that the key to generating successful returns is by picking the white investments in other words they're Thirteen thousand\nMutual funds out there which one are you going to pick well\nLet's look at it this way according to temper on in twenty twelve this is six years ago there were five hundred and Ninety us stock mutual funds that beat the S. and P. five hundred\nThat year only five hundred and Ninety out of the thousands of mutual funds that exists only five hundred and Ninety of them be the S. and P. five hundred so I Want to ask you the question do you think you could pick\nThe fund that's going to beat the overall market first of all the odds are probably not since such a few number did that in the first place but let's assume that you manage to successfully pick one of the best funds of the year good for you\nFive hundred Ninety of them in twenty twelve over those five hundred Ninety Gino how many of them beat the market again the following year in twenty Thirteen\nHundred and forty two of the five hundred and Ninety who did it in twenty twelve only a hundred and forty of 'em did it again the next year and of those hundred and forty how many of them did it again in twenty four team only twenty two\nAnd a twenty two only three of them did it in twenty Fifteen and all of the three only one of them did it in twenty sixteen in other words of the entire universe\nOf stock mutual funds over the ... of them that exist over the five year period from twenty twelve to twenty sixteen only on\nThe the us and the five hundred every year for five years in a\nRow one out of thousands sell less you again do you think you can pick the funds that are going to outperform the market I don't think so\nI don't think we can do it in our firm we don't even try instead what we do is provide passive\nInvestment approaches for our clients instead of trying to beat the market we're trying to provide the returns of the market minus fees and taxes and expenses associated with the investing exercise and guess what\nIf you're investing in that kind of a pattern you're not trying to beat the market you're trying not to get beaten\nBy taxes and inflation so that your money is earning a competitive right of return which should be sufficient to enable you to achieve your financial goals and objectives and that's really the point it's not about beating the market it's about achieving your goals think about it this way two thousand eight\nIn two thousand eight the S. and P. five hundred stock index fell thirty six percent\nSo if you picked an above average fund a fund that beat the market instead of losing thirty six maybe you lost thirty two is that like you know any consolation of any crime [laughter]\nHey you know hey I think we should be feeling really good we didn't lose thirty six percent of our money we only lost thirty two percent of our money you see my point meaning the markets and that's the goal that's not you should be trying to accomplish what you should be trying to accomplish\nIs making sure you are long term\nFinancial goals and objectives are met and to that and I'm going to cite a new study that just came out that shows that forty percent of middle class Americans forty percent are facing poverty\nIn retirement [noise]\nForty percent nearly three quarters of American workers say that they are\nGoing to have to work past traditional retirement age because they don't have sufficient money saved and invested so instead of saying the key to my financial future is beating the market\nOn the key to your financial future is making sure you have sufficient money saved on a regular basis and that the money you're saving is earning a competitive return if not buying a lottery ticket and hope you get rich quick\nJoining the latest hot fad getting into what's hot and avoid and what's not that's not the key to achieving your long term financial goals our goal here for you is to make sure you are not among that forty percent of the middle class who's facing poverty\nIn retirement your financial future is much more up to you than it is up to the markets and if you're not sure if you're saving enough if you're not sure whether you're saving and the right way if you're not sure you're saving and investing strategy is designed to get you where you are trying to go\nWell that's why your call us AAA plan wreck we've been doing

hundred thousand jobs in less than a decade that'd be a very and he said quote it was all caused\nBy the ability to apply technology to processes and capabilities unquote\nHe says are twenty six million of the banks customers that are using the mobile banking that therefore they don't need any human interaction artificial intelligence and robotic process or use of allowed the firm to cut out eighty four thousand work hours a year you only work two thousand hours a year they've just cut out eighty four thousand\nHours a year you do the math\nHe said the bank had too many managers about thirty thousand of them and so he fired a third of them over just the last couple of years is it any wonder then according to Gallup only forty eight percent of the American public has a lot of

in I've try our new nine green we ... we were yeah ground\nZero week nights at ten on news radio five sixty WHYY in\nThe late ... those people that don't have enough in there on finances to retire and this must be a sixteen year old he quote expert I sixty four I'm lost a tremendous amount of money during in the market my husband who passed away\nOn had hatched by and I'll make a choice to say that I had nothing other than my Social Security and I am against it before you think jak\nEconomic should work until there Saturday because the guy in there\nTo provide money for their retirement is\nYou know I'm not saying I can recall hearing number one\nNumber two the other thing that could be considered in one's life on\nThem their finances is the quality of their lives and many times working can be very exhausting um for people that are stepping day and um and Seventy five I mean I think that it's an incredibly\nUm thoughtless comment she has made on this show this morning and I'm horrified that he is agreeing with everything she has to say why don't we get to where Ninety or until we die maybe that's the thing to do that with that is now worried with our finances\nSo I'm Sorry that she saw said but it's not my fault that her husband lost all of his money and the two thousand a credit crisis by investing in hedge funds and it's not my fault that she's not finding herself and retirement with nothing but Social Security\nAnd so when we say that given that situation you really don't have much of a choice but to continue working I I guess all I can say is well maybe the truth hurts\nUm and maybe this is why we need to plan butter and we need to more effectively get professional financial advice before throwing all of her life savings in the hedge funds just in time for the biggest market melt down in our entire lives\nI feel badly for her but I have a feeling that I'm just the messenger reflecting on the severity of her personal situation\nUm but here's another voicemail but I got and this boys you might\nRecall hearing before but listen\nI'm calling to say that I listen to their work at home and tell us quite a while\nAnd I decided I Would never invest and him or his company he goes on at knocks him about a simple answer that take three minutes he takes Fifteen minutes and keeps repeating themselves\nLike he has our time is he no longer a good example of like clear swift thinking it's boring now that it takes up most of the show was stupid questions that she doesn't stop answering he needs a little help\nI think she too old to keep going on with the show it's become very boring let's talk about the financial crisis this week instead of going on and on\nAbout stupid questions\nHe needs some help himself to fix his show I don't feel that I'm a psychologist several have my friends have listened to feel the same way he just wanders all over the place like a loss soldier\nSo the fascinating thing that voice might be familiar to you because nearly seven years ago in January of twenty twelve she contacted me for the first time and here's what she said back then\n[noise] I'm a college and to listen to this maniac on the radio where\nHe goes on and on wham waves heck a maniac planting you can ask if man in the psychiatric is not going to hang individual\nIn there and have a life ended on it\nI Am actually wait I aged out of cash in on them and it's crazy renting get him somehow and shame on hand by God man\nNow what was fascinating here is look I I I don't know if I'm really doing anything wrong at all because she's still listening to the show so obviously I'm doing something right to get her to keep tuning in and I'm not quite sure what a psychologist will be recommending psychiatric help or she should be recommending psychological help but anyway\nUh it just it just shows to go you not everybody's a fan of the ... so I don't know maybe I should have you know some regrets of how a man on the show why don't but I'll tell you who does have a regret Suzie\nOrman has a regret she says that she has a major money related regret that back in Nineteen Ninety seven she bought five thousand dollars worth of Amazon's stock and sold that just a few years later is she still\nThe interest in principle from the securities because some of the investors\nThe interest in other investors want the principal or a different time periods so they\nTake these treasuries and they strip out the interest giving them to one investor and another investor against the principal back at maturity and historical strips and so Wall Street invents lots of products like this they invented lions liquid yield option notes\nUh they've got tigers treasury interest grand tour receipts there are page after the income generators but no nobody on Wall street has ever created a bear because you know that's Wall Street doesn't like bears um we like balls but I don't think anybody ever invented a security called a bull\nUm but anyway I digress so\nLet me ask you the question before I described for you whether you should be investing in a strip or investing in a tip a treasury inflation protected security oh tell me what it is you're trying to accomplish\nA I guess what I'm trying to accomplish is that I have quite a few CDs right now which are destroying regular interests and what I wanted to do is take out enough money where I don't go over the limit that up my Medicare\nPayments every year mhm with increases\nAnd I know it could go to somewhere around a hundred and eighty thousand dollars in income and I like to do that only by drawing down on my Ira between me and the wife and I don't want to have any additional interest or I did I had the you know be\nPaying to stay in other words what I read there is that they do is take you don't have to report that to the state\nOr hang on hang on hang on I think you might be focusing on the wrong thing here it sounds like you're focusing on trying to avoid additional taxes additional Medicare expenses\nWhat I'm more concerned about is do you have sufficient income to sustain your lifestyle and will you have sufficient income to sustain your lifestyle over the rest of your combined lifetimes of you and your wife that's much more important issue isn't it\nYeah so have you done an analysis to determine that\nI had a really done it out but I think I probably have enough money stashed away that probably going to be an off whether or not you know depending on how long outlive naturally and how long to wipe it\nSo I think it would make sense to do that calculation uh let me just do a real quick back of the neck enough or what's the total amount of money that you and your wife have between savings accounts investment accounts retirement accounts IRAs et cetera add it all up what's it worth\nA probably a couple of ...\nAnd how much money do you and your wife spend on a monthly basis\nOh probably three thousand bucks maybe\nTotal all in all expenses\nAre yet probably about three grand aren't\nThen I Would agree with you based on two million dollars in savings and investments and only spending thirty six grand a year and we haven't even talked about Social Security yeah I Would agree with your urine find economic shape\nWhich means you don't need to be taking a lot of investment risk\nAnd therefore I don't think you need to be getting terribly exotic with your investment strategy I mean although it's possible that you might get a higher return from a treasury strip or a a inflation protected bond\nA relative to a bank CD I don't know if the differences all that worthwhile relative to the complexity the securities\nAnd the lack of certainty you have about them and understanding of how they work compared to ordinary bank CDs the difference in the yields is not going to be all that significant and I don't think material enough for you to bother doing something different\n[noise] All right I was wondering if it would have any effect\nI don't think it's going to be material enough that this was based on a thirty second conversation I'm having with you if we delved deeper\nOr I could certainly argue that all of the choices you've mentioned are paying very low rates of interest in today's economy as you know and there are other strategies that are worth considering that can dramatically improve the potential for higher rates of return\nIs it necessary in your case not really not relative to the amount of money you've got and the amount of income you need not really necessary is it perhaps desirable well maybe that's up to you\nUh so I could argue that you should meet with one of my colleagues we have an office in Cherry Hill not far from you and mount Laurel where we could go into all of this detail and show you the alternatives that are available to you but that's entirely up to you if you just kept doing what you're doing\nFinancially speaking I think you and your wife would be fine\nOkay okay over there in Cherry Hill New Jersey right\nYes it is and if you like I'll put you on hold and get your phone number will connect you with our colleagues in a Cherry Hill and ah go from there okay that'd be fine\nAlright Neal I really appreciate your phone call thank you so very much you can do it Neal dead and call triple each plan record it's really important that you put your investment strategy and the proper context why bother adding complexity to your life tax complication to your life\nGetting into securities you not really familiar with are accustomed to win the material differences in results are really not going to be there when\nIn fact you might need to be addressing a totally different question instead which is am I going to be able to sustain my current lifestyle for as long as I in my spouse may live that the more important fundamental question and you want to make sure you have that answer nailed down first\nThanks so much for your phone call you know I'm really glad to see folks so intently focused on retirement and engaging in planning will you have enough money that's really the key question isn't it I mean if you were Bill Gates I don't think you care very much\nWarren Buffet I don't think he really needs is Social Security check right so for them it's not a big deal for you and me so how do you know if you're going to have enough\nI Want you to find

Parkland mass shooting this Paul however was taken this month and it's right before an upcoming midterm election and the poll suggests gun control is favored way more by democratic voters them\nRepublican and people can't stop talking about Kanye West and east visit to President Trump in the oval office last week I miss the philosophical point see a made he was asked about gun

endowments and family offices are not yet making this available to the retail investor people like you and me\nBut fidelity has been working on this for the past five years they've been doing it quietly without any fanfare or publicity they have one hundred employees working on this and according to Abby Johnson the c._e._o. of civility she said this past week quote\nOur goal is to make digitally native assets such as bitcoin more accessible to investors unquote so why are people like David Swenson and huge organizations like fidelity announcing involvement\nIn the block chain and crypto world and why should you care it's because this fundamental technology has the potential according to the bank of England to completely transform the financial services industry\nSee we operate right now from an economic perspective we operate on they trust basis when you when gates\nIn a transaction when you buy any goods or services from anybody else you're trusting that they're going to honor their end of the bargain when you buy a house you know it takes three months right from the time you sign the contract of the time you close\nIt takes three months you have to do a search to verify the deed right you go to a title company and you've got to make sure that the seller really does on the house that the dean of the house is legitimate\nAnd that title search exists because well you don't trust the cellar and so you spend months and you spend thousands of dollars in a title search and you buy\nMortgage insurance you you buy insurance on the\nDeed in case something goes wrong it at the time it adds money it doesn't do any real good doesn't increase the value of the house for example\nWhile the block chain isn't authentication process it replaces the trust process with authentication under the block chained using this technologically on the Internet\nThe only way the seller can sell you the house is if they do in fact owned the deed and once they do the transaction on the Internet there's no need for title insurance so the transaction can occur much faster and at much lower cost and into lemonade the middleman\nAnd there's no way the transaction can be changed altered duplicated or delete it and this authentication process radically\nAnd rapidly makes improvements in the financial services sector let me give you one illustration\nIf you want to wire money overseas you've got to spend about eight percent in wire transfer fees and it takes five days for the money to show up and the other country\nBut if you do this with bitcoin you can do it in about ten minutes and it's virtually free so a company like Western Union\nIs now under threat because they're no longer needed so when you were lemonade the trust and replace it with authentication you wouldn't lemonade the middleman you no longer need that trust company you know the longer need that title service company and as a result\nSomeone's out of work so the middle man\nCould be disrupted as a result of the block chain and the technological improvements the ability to do transactions faster and cheaper with greater safety and confidence is why David Swenson has made his announcement of putting money\nFrom the yelling download fund into bitcoin and the ... and ... has just announced that they're engaging in this as well they're not the only ones pi Wu si is announced a new partnership that is designed to build confidence and trust in crypto and usher in the next one hundred million\nUsers of crypto assets such as bitcoin ... light Corning ripple and hundreds of other crypto assets that are available\nPeter you see is going to recommend standards for transparency governance security risk management to help shape industry practices in Switzerland their federal regulator has now issued a license to a crypto currency investment fund the primary stock exchange in Switzerland is developing a block chain powered trading platform\nThat will allow traditional financial assets to trends business and creating liquidity for institutional investors [noise]\nThere's a new thing called the universal protocol alliance it's a coalition of leading watching operations that is creating a fully transparent digital asset that is collateralized to US dollars they're calling it a stable coin one of the big concerns people have had about the coin\nAnd other crypto assets is that the volatility as massive well if you have a stable coin something that is tied to the U.S dollar it's designed to solve that problem is it any wonder that there's now an escrow company in California that now I'll let you buy a home using bitcoin\nAnd the block chain which is the technology that allows bitcoin to operate is now being used in voting in West Virginia they allowed\nMilitary members who are West Virginia residents who are serving overseas to use the block chain to vote they did it there the first state to have allowed it and they did it in the primaries this past may and they say they're now going to allow it to be used in the November elections\nFor some of the residents in West Virginia by using the block chain there can be no voter fraud\nAnd that's the whole point is that it allows a hack proof means of logging transactions in this case votes\nAnd West Virginia is proving to be a pilot for the entire country it's quite possible as I predicted in my book the truth about your future that the twenty twenty presidential election will be done on the block chain meaning you won't have to go to a voting booth\nTo cast your vote you'll do it using your smartphone\nPretty exciting stuff on the other hand there are still worries about what's going on the FCC\nAnd the CFCC that's the commodity futures trading commission live issued alerts warning investors to watch out for frauds because there are some crooks claiming that they have FCC or CFCC approval for their block chain and they point investments and they are fraudulent\nYou need to make sure that you are being very very careful because it's still the wild west in fact the international Monetary Fund has warned of new vulnerabilities in the international financial system because of the rapid growth of bitcoin and other crypto assets\nSo is this a time for you to invest in this stuff like David Swenson has\nI don't think so I don't think it's ready for main street yet\nBut the day may come and the need for you to become aware and informed and educated is right now and that's our job for you here on this program is to make sure you're aware of the

given segment of the stock market starts to perform well especially if it's new and different\nThat's when the fraudsters come out the FCC has now charged an investment fund in Texas with defrauding investments they made false promises of massive returns in cannabis related businesses\nThe FCC says green view investment partners and its founder Michael Cohn\nUsed misleading marketing materials to raise over three million dollars from investors\nThe guy hired salespeople to make cold calls were promising twenty four percent annual returns and guess what\nThe guy used an alias to hide prior criminal convictions he lied about having a former agent from the DEA on staff and he lied about having a long term record of profitability by investing in cannabis related businesses\nThe guy in fact actually has no track record the company sold investment of four hundred thousand dollars has yet to produce a single nickel in profits and the guy guess what he spent investors money on designer clothing and luxury cars yeah somebody got high\nBut it wasn't the investors in fact the only question you can ask the investors about making their wrestling was already on drugs\nStay away from high fashion sales pitch is based on getting high with investments were taking telephone calls here on the wreck idleman show heading off the valley college in New York Welcome to the program Greg how are you\nHigh wreck I thank you for taking my call um my wife and I have a six month old baby girl she is our first one\nUh she has already accumulated around five thousand dollars in cash\nFrom ... first of all on your daughter's arrival and she's already got five grand\nYes yes a\nVery proud of that I'm\nCurrently we have the money just sitting in a custodial a savings account so my question would be is should we leave the funds in that same thing Cal or treat moving into a five twenty nine plan\nWhich we are already contributing fifty dollars per month or should we invested in the market\nOr wherever whoa whoa whoa we've we've just covered two very different questions here I don't want to make sure that we separate them because that's key the first question is when are we going to use the money\nIn other words are we going to use the money for diapers we're going to use the money for preschool we're going to use the money for ... we're going to use the money for\nTheir first car we're going to use the money for college or are we going to use the money for them buying a home in their thirties or going to use the money for their retirement so what would you tell me is the expected use and timing of the use of that money\nI'm this would be a more in the long term so we would say a college\nOkay so we've got Eighteen years before we're going to use the money\nAnd theoretically it might not even be Eighteen years it might be twenty four years because you don't necessarily have to use the money in their freshman year daughter's freshman year of college you might use the money and your daughters senior year of college and the average kid today\nTake six years to get a college degree so the money might be able to remain invested not just for Eighteen years maybe for twenty four years\nSo good that gives us a a good a basis for the conversation because\nThe timeframe is what determines how the money should be invested in other words if you had told me you're going to use the money for diapers or a ... in three years my answer would be leave the money in cash leave the money in a bank account a CD a money market fund a savings account checking account something\nA U.S Monday treasury bills something very safe very liquid very available something that wouldn't be subject to market gyrations because I'm a short period of time who knows what could happen I mean look at two thousand me write it took years\nFor the markets to recover from the debacle of two thousand me so if you're dealing with a short term time horizon you can only choose or something very safe like cash\nOr cash equivalence but if you have a longer term ... as you suggested Eighteen to twenty four years now it can take a much different point of view since Nineteen twenty six according to an associates and no Fifteen year period or longer has stocks ended lower than when they started\nTake any period you want since Nineteen twenty six any here as a starting point go Fifteen Years later the market was always higher so if you're telling me we've got Eighteen years maybe twenty four years to go\nThat gives us a very high degree of confidence of course I have to stress as you well know the past performance is no guarantee of future results in the assertion that country's a federal sense right we know that\nBut it's the only thing we have to go on so we can with a pretty high degree of confidence say that if I've got a Fifteen or Eighteen or twenty four year time horizon putting a hundred percent of the money into stocks makes a great deal of sense and so that's what I Would recommend for the account for your daughter\nNow your daughter's not allowed to own an account she's a minor minors can't own assets you as the parents have to create a custodial account on behalf of
