I don't understand what the argument\nIs here yeah this was hired expert is like you know Christine Blasey Ford taking their own polygraph and then releasing the result she hired this guy so what's the lie\nRight well she she's talking about the lies about like Donald Trump but she's uh what else is she saying he no he cheats that's another thing she everybody's cheating I mean she's the cheater here right she cheated us she cheated on her way up the uh the academic a totem pole\n[laughter] I mean I think I think the holy already of your longtime mascot being fully exposed to the world is going to lose your mind she has been completely exposed fully understand playing of the evidence here and there are\nNo idea I get it in my column believe believe in my column today was a list with ward and is still a fake Indian I understand that I'm just saying I'm just talking about how the mainstream media is trying to portray it you know and by the way here's one we this is the first\nWeek in the in the series we all know why real Donald Trump makes creepy physical threats about the rice I mean I think we would know about these creepy physical threats that we\nDo [laughter] that's one good thing you can always um fact check their crazed claims about about Trump I'm with the question what do we know about this if it were true [laughter]\nHow about this one how about this when I answered you missed the singer mixed races or or a cat um your word winning presentation this is the second way bottom line my heritage played no role in my hiring ever the Boston Globe reviewed all the evidence\nWell if that's the case the Chinese are showing\n'em in their lawsuit against Harvard I'm eternally black students and absolutely Native Americans should because Harvard isn't doing affirmative action writes if it didn't play a role\nYeah you know that's that's the another irony here to get it hasn't gotten much play but the she released this this ah fabricated a DNA test on the same day that the trial against\nHer former employer began in federal court here in\nBoston you know I mean it's it's rather ironic isn't it I mean she she's ... she's running a scam\nAnd at Harvard has been running a scam for all these years I mean hard at Harvard you know harbored this a century ago Harvard was discriminating against Jews for the same reason to discriminate against Asians because they were doing too well you know and they didn't want to win\nAnd so nothing has really changed their has it\nBut the weird thing about this is I mean normally the massive double standards you get on the left it will be um no it's okay for a governor of a state to um have state employees bring a low level employee to his hotel room dropped his pants and take his it that's on sexual harassment at all and then\nWhen one Brett Kavanaugh was drunk and freshman in college he dropped his\nUm and I ever recovered memory of it Thirty years later so one is is taken 'em no up ... ... that's nothing but recovered memory of cabinet dropping expanses of drunk I'll treasure knew that the rape that's\nUsually there you know they're they're they're ten years separating these things are at least a few years the strange thing about affirmative action flash Pocahontas is\nSimultaneously these organizations like the New York times with Jason Blair um Harvard with Elizabeth Warren they brag and bragging brag about affirmative action we have lots of affirmative action just apply and look at all the diversity and we're going to pick people on the basis of diversity will discriminate against white people don't worry\nUm and then when they won one when we find out that one person in order to take advantage of affirmative action um for Native Americans what are you talking about I mean it's multi fits that one sentence to the next as opposed to two\nCompletely separate separate instances here at Harvard bragged about Elizabeth Warren being a Native American diversity diversity\nAnd how much he says is loose number for this number helped me get a job however\nNo she was she must have been\nStruck there at the University of Texas law school which is about law school from what I understand but she was an instructor\nAt ... or University of Pennsylvania so she suddenly decides in the mid eighties the list yourself as a minority and appears in this these minority guide books which are basically used as hiring guides to while you know do away with your diversity problem if you're the dean of the law school\nAnd all of us right she's she's working at first at the University of Pennsylvania and then at the Harvard University law school and she and she wants us to believe that it had and the ... because she's been cleared by the Boston Globe which right\nIt's just like Jason Blair they that times bragged and brag them brag\nI'm about their affirmative action program to bring in black reporters and then up to that turns out Jason Blair is making everything up and what you were talking about well if they're not doing this then they're not doing affirmative action I don't think they they act like they can give preference is on the basis of race\nAnd and no one else is allowed to notice that that's what they're doing as their bragging about\nIt and then she's she's got different stores where she said I I put down but I was a Native American because I wanted to get invited to the launches of\nThe nation from that was the\nOne one thousand twenty and one one thousand twenty fourth\nIndian and they'll try out that shows recipe and now she\nSays I'm ...

S. so they bust it not only taken a bribe he's lied about the bribe\nCriminal prosecution was decline the senior FBI official resigned from the FBI during the office of inspector general investigation\nSo in other words this guy to lied about a crime he had committed and he's allowed to retire with a full pension and they don't even name them in the in the press release\nAs opposed to General Michael Flynn who actually serve the country not just himself\nAnd he did the lie about any crime and the FBI didn't even think you lie to begin with when they first interviewing him\nAnd he had you know he's not going to go to prison they just keep postponing the sentencing but he was convicted of a felony and he's had to worry about this for a year and he's had to sell one of his houses the pay is legal expenses but\nHe worked for Donald Trump any crossed Obama so his life had to be destroyed and this guy's a crooked gee man nothing happens to him\nWell he's going to retire he's going to get his pension and then he'll be a former F senior FBI official and you can consult with companies and make another hundred two hundred grand a year\nRight and and just like we told you last week Lois Lerner the ... the crooked the Internal Revenue service or a high ranking official who who took the Fifth Amendment when she was asked about going after the Tea Party for political reasons to protect the Obama administration in the run up to the ... election\nShe just bought a house\nOn Nantucket Nantucket former home of John Kerry all we're all the beautiful people live along with Martha's Vineyard it's a a it's a ... it's one of the most the posh resort islands in the United states she spent\nOne point nine million ballots she should be in prison and she she kept her pension and she she now is retired and living on Nantucket isn't that nice\nAid for four or five hundred forty to forty two in the halls of justice the only justice is in the halls as a as we as we all would say and it's it's certainly true or John your next ... go ahead John\nHey how are you doing good I'm\nEnjoying listening to you were talking about in India and my brother in law is great grandmother was full blooded\nCherokee yeah and it comes down at twelve and a half percent uh he was allowed to join the trap fairly [laughter] as I'm going to participate in any of a a gambling money they cut it off [laughter] at twenty five percent\nOh I don't you hate it when that [laughter] yeah or a\nWar and we're really in trouble [laughter] trying to show the shape that\nFive hundred that's one eight hundred two six seven sixty five hundred\nSecurity officers ... financial ... and that kind of I offered to diminish agreed I registered in ethnic ...\nHave you seen the skillings and sons fleet of trucks on the road this is how we are are you ready for better water pressure and water quality or is it time to put your irrigation system on your own well skillings and sons has a\nFleet of trucks an expert technicians to get the job done right the first time for over forty years skillings and sons have been deep trust the water professionals learn more about water\nWage why in traffic days to Ninety One westbound after exit three towards exit one he's found your clear right now ... when north and south not too bad moving through downtown Springfield pike smoothies found a west bound between ... to wait\nYou're clear on three Ninety One fifty seven eastbound smooth approaching the rotary objects turns it with your on time traffic\nIs Robin from Jonesboro may this is rod in Grand Cayman Cayman Island this is Laura ... says this is how we ... shells\n\nPaid for for five hundred a forty to forty two\nThat's a toll free number of the highway car show five oh wait says when I go to the doctor's office I bring the heroin yeah usually I usually go to the barber shop I urge I just go to this so long hair salon where it's cheaper than the barbershop sixty bucks\nThat's what I usually take the if I go on Saturday I bring the wall Street Journal the weekend review section and the and the Herald than the post the New York post those are those are the three papers I get\nAid for four five hundred forty to forty two that's the toll free number of the highway car show let's play a couple of more uh cuts here um\nIf you want to why if you're wondering what the Democrats are planning to do if they reclaimed the U.S house of representatives I Jackie Speier from California uh spelled out last night for state\nAnd your party leader and a half half the philosophy is that if the Democrats take back the house which is looking more likely according to the momentum currently in all the numbers that are are lining up\nAt the first thing or order a business that they can make sure you get a handle on the president's tax return can't they made a priority I think the number one I'm Dale that she may in fact contemplate in St myself is that for every candidate running for the president say\nTwenty ... Twenty years of income tax return that's where we shouldn't be again that's\nThe first priority when they get into in in it to the control of the house by the way I'm not sure they're going to take over the house I mean then again that's just that's that's all left media spent a few weeks ago where they were going to get the Senate and the house now it's now it's down to the house\nAnd uh you know we talked about the civility you know they're sending a that they're sending these letters with white powder in them too was Senator Susan Collins house they're uh they're chasing Ted Cruz out of restaurants or Sarah Huckabee Sanders\nA Lindsey Graham would like to talk about the uh the the the resistance and how their civility that they share a when a when they deal with uh when they run into Republicans cuts sex\nJudge Kavanaugh represent the best in our legal community was treated like garbage despicable and I hope they pay a price has been on you know people have no seriously yes Batman\nNice huh\nNo but of course they don't care about that supposedly supposedly spit it a Democrat that would be that you think that'd be a big story a real real big story\nAid for four or five hundred forty to forty two\nSo here David gregory you know where he's the a bust out a former anchor of uh meet the press fired for crappy ratings his wife is a is a big lawyer a defense lawyer D.C she represented all of a\nHillary's age during the espionage investigation two years ago she she got a ball cleared because she's a deep state member\nSo what David gregory now works at the at the Clinton news network and uh so listen to who he's comparing the president to win a relation in a really regards to this a murder of the Saudi in a you stumble cut night\nBut he's also a such a loose talk or I mean he just says what pops into his line not thinking that is the president United States you don't want to play this notion that there were row killers like he's you know O. J. Simpson talking about tracking down the ... we'll killers and that murder trial I mean if\nThat's just absurd and then later in the day he was much more measured when people talk to him and said no this is where we are and so the problem is that people are listening to the president around the world and I think for a president\nWho has said disingenuous lay in my judgment when he talks about the\nThe journalist Amy enemy of the people this is actually a time when an American leader has to stand up and say this is a journalist working for the Washington Post in America with a great\n... so\nThe ... speaking carelessly if he's comparing the president's OJ Simpson with when OJ Simpson said he was looking for the murderers he was the murder so is is he saying that actually\nI've been pretty people are so so it was David gregory suggesting that actually the Saudi journalist though worked for the Washington Post was actually murdered by a Donald Trump that he somehow snuck overdosed on board job or a you know talk about careless a careless\nConversation or rhetoric aid for four or five hundred forty to forty two how you want to hear the ah this is a a ... out in Arizona comparing Arizona too well Lindsey low head cut eleven\nAnd what's happening in Arizona and and the good way to get a good way we're gonna we're gonna be low here in the famous\n\nThing I think still out there is the fact that she took\nThose two positions at University of Pennsylvania and Harvard claiming Native American heritage when she\nBack then didn't even try to prove any ancestry and it never really felt the need to do that or apologize for it um and ultimately you know again uses a system that she says is rigged against people in the rate that for ourselves so she can get these high paying jobs that other a minority hires should have been qualified for it\nWe we uh had the grace to perform and masterpiece theater reading the tweets chi issue to six fifty nine until eight fourteen last night there were twenty six of them altogether so she was in a tweet approximately every three minutes\nAnd they were they were a very a very emotional very oh almost to the point of the arrangement and I I think ah I I I think this really backfired on her didn't it I mean didn't she think this was going to put the issue to rest then and it it it's a it's started a dumpster fire for her\n[noise] well I mean she's always had the Boston Globe they're trying to provide cover for the you know weight that she got those jobs and the dancers ancestry claims I'm obviously she decided to go out on her own and and put that video out there and again a very quickly we come to find out that I guess most north Americans have I guess more\nNative American potential uh heritage and she says based on on those results which is pretty pretty wild but again or you don't hurt her time in office as a senator for Massachusetts has been marked by doing very little for our state mostly spending time campaigning around the country and I think\nOr attempt to put this information out on Monday was to try to cover it for a Washington Post article that come out the day before that explaining just how extensive she's been working\nTo run for president in twenty twenty I mean she spent half\nA million dollars on a donations to campaign around the country for Democrats you as you know going out there to Ohio gone to other states campaigning for democratic candidates for the last a year plus a she was in Georgia and uh just last week for governors Kennedy and she was in\nPennsylvania and Colorado or strike a Pennsylvania and ah Oklahoma excuse me her home state um\nAbout a week or two before uh when I was up and launched with a gas um mine explosion victims so but she's made it very clear she's running for the White House and twenty twenty and I think this was an attempt to try to\nDivert away from the fact that uh that's out there and ah\nYou know I think people in Massachusetts are aware of that they know she has no intention of being a senator that she doesn't want to be our center and uh I'm looking forward to the debate on friday and making sure that we really highlight the what's going on\nHave you taken a DNA test\n[laughter] don't have an alley I uh I don't feel the need to and I I mean not that I wouldn't not that it wouldn't be proud of of any heritage it determines but I don't feel the need to try to apply for any uh special consideration for anything I own a small business\nKind of fun though you know that's that's the only word I was making no interest in it gives you something to look forward to for a couple of weeks waiting for like Lindsey Graham was saying you know you get you know you're wondering what it's going to be and how it's going to turn out and\nYou know I ... I think for most people would probably turns out the way they thought it was there was it was going to but that's that's all he so you know what she's gonna do Jeff she's just gonna she she's going to basically ignore you\nI mean she's gonna she's ... she is going to do here at the Donald Trump just like with the tweets last night there was nothing about you and the tweets a it was all about Donald Trump\nLet's say what are you what are you going to do what you just talks about Donald Trump\nWell and I'm looking forward to talking about that because\nFirst of all everything he promised on the campaign trail he's delivered I mean our economy right now and that's just ... people haven't noticed is on fire we've got three point five percent unemployment leading the country right now unemployment in the country as\nA three point eight percent the lowest it's been and fifty years we've got more people working in our state more people making more money to wage increases have gone up about three percent of all this\nAnd that is given a new tax revenue to ... much one point two billion dollars so uh the economy's doing well internationally\nLook at North Korea a year ago they were threatening our allies now they're\nThinking about doing an Olympics with South Korea I mean that's how\nDifferent are things are there and I'd say the trade deals have been incredibly effective a European Union renegotiated there's with us followed quickly by Canada and Mexico\nAnd I think China is feeling the pain right now and I think a lick our stock market rallied again today showing that the all the effort to uh make trade more equitable uh internationally is working so everything's working out of favor and if if a\nA Senator Warren wants to bring up what's going on with the president I she's bringing up a successful track record in my opinion\nDo you think do you think she used the uh the the so called Native American heritage do was to get into those those are two and your positions with the ivy league law schools\nWell I Know that she lists yourself in what's a national directory out of college law school is um and when she lets yourself for that that\nBasically becomes kind of a hiring book for college at University of Pennsylvania in fact they listed her as a white originally and she requested to have a change to Native Americans so um then she got the Harvard job\nAnd after she got the ... D listed from that\nA national directory as Native American so it seems like there was a clear intent on her part to utilize that that claim to benefit herself with her career although she completely denies that and look I I think she's gonna have to answer for that but she uh I think she tried with that video I don't think it worked\nOr stories keep changing you know she said originally she uh you know she lifted herself as minority of Harvard because you want it to get invited to lunch is now she talks about her ... her matriarch whenever they are in our family dying and she wants to she wanted to preserve their legacy I don't know how that has\nYou know suddenly changing your ethnic group how does that preserved the legacy of The Elders and your family I mean none of this stuff makes any sense you know and but it's it's it's like sir Walter Scott said you know a a what a tangled Web we wouldn't first we practice to the city\nYou've and now she's now she caught\nAnd by the way I mean the secretary of state for the Cherokee Nation and said that first of all DNA tests are are found upon as they used for determining whether or not you have Native American heritage to begin with a you have to be active in the in the culture you have to\nUh you know I think have some family members that you can identify specifically is Native American uh and so\n... what she's been cleaning for so long is clearly a appropriation cultural appropriation to benefit herself on but you know again Democrats in this country seem to be able to say whatever they want with no penalty I mean a senator Rosen up\nA Blumenthal I mean in a down in ah Connecticut saying that he was a Vietnam veteran I guess there's no repercussions when you lie about your background\nMenendez of New Jersey you know the look of that ad that's running against him about the you know the Obama Justice department said he was ah he he was a patronizing a underage prostitutes in the Dominican Republic\nAnd he says he says no it's not a you know it I mean the the Dems now we're spending three million to what to save his seat where are you getting any money from the from the ... the national a Senate committee Jeff\nWell at this point you know I think they're still taking a wait and see how there were three weeks away but I think that um you know what we've been doing is basically focused on our ground game here in Massachusetts and that's the same ground game that help us when into doesn't fourteen about the question that nobody thought we were going to when we were outspent by millions of dollars the grain does is it seems like Elizabeth line is\nReally overlooking his race I mean if you drive around the state and look at the lawn signs you know we pretty much out number her\nQuite a bit and I think that shows that we've been we've been talking to people and she seems to be really more focused on making that presidential run and you know if the other thing too is the comments she made most recently whether it was a that the criminal justice system is racist from front to back that journey a you know the endorsement of the\nBoston police union that um there's never a rose to Republicans are you a U.S Senate before and uh you know it's\nIt's the police to who we ran into in a in a ah Winchester the other day yeah they I mean you've got some of the police indoor Smith\nWas ... police or you know yeah definitely um ... it's it's something that you know normally would go without saying when you make a comment like that is if you're a little bit worn that police would do that but I think they also do my track record has been\nA to support law enforcement and the state and they also know that if I get into the Senate that I might give\nMassachusetts and and the citizen six years of actually focusing on that she she already wants to take the next two years off and make a run for the White House I mean it couldn't be any clear I think for people out there that that this raises about someone who cares about Massachusetts versus someone who really cares more about running for the White House\nSo where where do people go if they want to get involved in your campaign to read more about your work donate money or whatever well where should they go\nThey should go to a deal for Senate dot com G.
