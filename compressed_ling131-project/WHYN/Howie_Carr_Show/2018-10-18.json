Court very quickly\nBut it's a it's a it's extremely interesting case and uh one of the people who's written written extensively on it is a Stuart Taylor junior he's the author or one of the co authors of mismatch how affirmative action hurt students it's intended to help and why universities won't admit it\nAnd you wrote he's got the uh the cover story in the Weekly Standard this week

dry but it's a it's something that affects every body a store Taylor thanks for being with us here on the highway car show\nThanks for having me nice to be with you\nWhile he I think I think the take away so far and then a lot of this has been has come out in the uh the filings over the course of the the discovery process is that if if it was just based on a academic test scores\nThe Asian American percentage of the ... of the freshman class at Harvard would be forty three percent and the African American percentage of the freshman class would be less than one person is that correct\nThat's correct that was in my article about a week ago and it came out a gab liquid after the first time of the trial yesterday I think yeah\nAnd I and so how how does hard right away\nAnd this one of the surprises is that it was sitting there and a public document in the court has since June fifteenth and not one\nNewspaper the United states or magazine that I'm aware of saw fit to

a\nScam which is what it is and and Elizabeth Warren is the is the poster child for the whole thing and ... and this is how clueless she is you know she uh she uh I I Know I this is not a surprise I guess but she has no loyalty to to the institution but that\nPropelled her into this position of national prominence even more than the University of Pennsylvania are you know she scammed them with a

I'm picking them even more credit Joe for for\nVis a vis a self immolation apparently I was involved in it she didn't want me being a me outing her so she decided to out herself I mean that's a pathetic excuse but that's that's\nBut she's reduced to now she says she's\nJust an hour [laughter] power of how he cars that you brought that\nThis and and the funny thing is you know and I think maybe the president had a little bit to do with it I don't want to take all your\nI I don't know I must share the credit yes with someone else of yours\nBut then again I don't know who is that by using many people on on on the Democratic side but who sends out twenty six tweets\nDirected the president and a very short period of time and one after the other she seemed unhinged I think the guy who could be Trump or the girl that could be Trump is the type of person that doesn't take\nThe bait from him and tries to out Trump Trump because whenever we've seen that happen whether it be Marco Rubio during the primaries or Jeb Bush would they get taken out of their element and their personality and they try to out Trump Trump it blows up spectacularly so whether it's her or Korea hair or Cory Booker\nKamala Harris that's not the type of person who could really challenge shut for twenty twenty it'll be somebody who is just more measured\nAnd centrists and just kind of dismissed as ... any personal bar from Trump like yeah I'm just going to concentrate on the issues that matter the American people and she has shown already that she is not ready for twenty twenty if that's the way she's going to act on Twitter which was like a lunatic\nRank right John Cherokee Nation sent out that the excoriated press release about about six o'clock Seventy two hours ago and and less than an hour later she went on this whether a rage\nAnd and your rights she seemed demented in my my favorite of the twenty six or twenty twenty six weeks that she sent out in Seventy four minutes was\nHe's a bully and he scares very easy and I'm thinking to myself talking about so he scares very easy this is your ...\nIn in an hour you're the one who's coming across as a as as petrified to mortified here you know she she gave away the game and and\nIn our media as you will that such a great job political maybe I Want to narrow it down to that I still think local news always New York I think they do an excellent job but that's another conversation for another time but the fact that when this first came out and you see all the headlines\nStrong evidence proof that she is Native American they jumped to the narrative they want it before they really looked at what the study was including the Boston Globe by the way which as you know had to make not one but two corrections on simple that\nSuch a big story like this you think they checked that part out a little bit better but no it's a matter of being first instead of accurate and everybody followed suit to Stacy Elizabeth Warren has been to ... and then once Cherokee Nation came out that was the big big turning point then suddenly now you don't hear much about the story anymore\nLet's put it this way how it'll play little games with the show and the other foot\nDonald Trump lives about his heritage says he's a Native American so he can get into the University of Pennsylvania do you think that story would have gone away the way this one has abide by Thursday if you said that on Monday no the apocalypse will be upon us and ... and the end and basically that the planet we're just running into a big bowl of lava that what it would be the end\nSo yeah and that's the funny part about this right to be mockery ... ridicule instead it's been kind of muted for the most part except from conservative media and that's why there is a good counter balance with our media now which Twenty years ago we did not have\nYeah I I I said my column the next day I sent a memo to the Boston Globe fake news is tough bake math is tougher\nIt really is and it's just uh\nI really I really have enjoyed the whole story but listen there there's other news breaking that you wanted to talk about like this I Elle magazine ah when we tell us about what's going on with them\nElle magazine Halley puts out a tweet saying that Kim ... Kanye West been married for a couple of years I Believe they have two children together or they are getting a divorce right and you see this and it's not like it's from the onion and it's not like it's from a a typical type of\nPublication where he is a question that the L Magazine but you think I guess as the nine right I mean it's basically a fashion magazine\nAnd then they probably want to have a story like that and then sure enough you click on it\nAnd it's a register to vote page in other words\nThey tag line fake news you could go to a page and vote and it's just so funny that they pick the two people that do celebrities that have actually shown they support the president and that that's that's the couple that's divorced thing so\nAgain our media so completely ... has no stop awareness when they do this stuff how much it hurts the profession and every day you could come up with at least one example and the ... the editor at large at CNN we found that he says oh this is brilliant oh really\nOh really it really had to put out fake headlines that you're actually in door thing this\nI I don't even know what to say anymore out as a media reporter I Can't even be shocked because it happened so often a nun by the whole thing I mean I'm sure you weren't there was a radio host\nThen that's what that's what Mussolini used to say you know he was a tabloid editor before he got into politics and and you know his his owners would that that's the turn on a dime they go from being right wing left wing\nAnd he said as long as it's entertaining nobody cares you know as long as you're right if entertaining headlines it doesn't really matter in I mean we've come full circle a hundred years later and that's the that's the attitude and they're gone back to when you do Mussolini days\nIt seems that way I wasn't around for that unfortunately I Believe you call that sophomore year but may I wasn't around [laughter] anyway just\nHaving some fun but yeah look you look at the last couple of weeks and you look at the way the Kavanaugh hearing recovered and just how horribly that whole thing was presented and the boomerang effect it's had on Democrats in terms of Republican Tuesday has now going through the roof from veterans suddenly you're saying it's a real momentum behind the ...\nAnd then you see Elizabeth Warren and and this stunt which at least for two or three days again galvanized the ... to say we got to get out to the polls so I think October has gotten very bad for Democrats I'm not saying they don't take back the house I think I would've said it was Ninety percent that even three weeks ago I think it's a toss up not quite frankly and they'll probably gain seats\nIn the set of what I thought that that was even in jeopardy\nYeah you you know and another thing we just we we just had a guy on talking about the the the Harvard race discrimination suit which is a big I'm very very big case\nAnd Elizabeth Warren dropped her quote unquote bombshell about which is another just another affirmative action scam\nThe same day that this case began in in us federal district court shooting so she doesn't care she ... she doesn't care about anyone else about her you know her institution they gave her her ... she just drags them into this uh to the dumpster fire that she's created for herself\nYou know it's it's really it really is amazing the way the the news cycle works now nobody cares about anything else but themselves\nAnd and here's the thing it's not like Republicans are are mocking Elizabeth Warren and saying what are you doing Jim Messina who was President Obama's campaign manager in two thousand twelve even says\nDemocrats can focus what what what was she thinking base and I don't have it in front of me yeah paraphrasing it what what are you doing this is the stupidest thing now three weeks before the midterm you had to put this out\nAnd no one cares about your twenty twenty Rodney in January when you're when you're thinking about doing it now I get everybody not just not being self aware it's selfish on her part\nAnd it's a shame that the Boston Globe just can't say you know I'd be screwed this up and and not one writer they're not one op ed can go out just challenging or on this I it's sad really I mean when you rather be a contrarian than than just be part of an echo chamber disagrees with everything and everybody in our media is so afraid now not giving comfort food to what they think their audiences want to hear\nInstead of what they should here and they're all cowards basically that that's a shame\nJoe we do have fun with the with these people are never going to realize is it's fun being a reporter it's fun you know going on digging up news and and no one you gotta buy yourself and it's a scoop and you you know it makes you look really like a cool guy\nAs opposed to just being another another person in the ah the amen choruses Pat Buchanan used to call in on whatever side you're on you know\nYeah I had I had I had a lot of respect for unfair I did with with that Harvey Weinstein thing the way he went about it and went to another case when I mean if you set it up and go with like clearly did\nAnd then during the justice Cabot offing I gotta tell ya you know when he came out that second accuser and there was almost no verification around it back there was no verification around that that was a story about how Kavanaugh exposed himself during a dorm party at Yale you know\nYears ago but then they couldn't find one person to corroborate it ah that that was very unfair all like and it seemed very politically motivated I'm like he's a boy I really thought there was hope we are\nFor us down his goals same as yours defeat Elizabeth more\nReal proven track

I was a Abraham Lincoln's first big speech when he was just twenty eight years old\nAnd he was talking about the mob violence and ah you know his his comments I they're they're pretty basic\nYou know if you study history that you know this but he he put it very well been some uh they've been the lynching of five gamblers believe it or not and Vicksburg, Mississippi were trying to clean up the pharaoh dealers and these guys put up a fight and they Lynch them and then\nThey had a they that Lynch day a black a burned to death of a black guy in St Louis who was murdered by a white a\nPillar of the community so call and so he's talking about Abraham Lincoln talking about how you know that gamblers art much good in this the black guy was a murderer but you know you don't want mob violence in it and it really applies for what's going on with these Democrat mocks\nMainly white Democrats is that at in Arkansas said may these white Democrat mobs\nThis what Abraham Lincoln said an Eighteen thirty\nEight when men take it take it in their heads today\nTo hang gamblers or burn murderers they should recollect that in the confusion usually attending such transactions they will be as likely the hangar burn someone who was neither a gambler nor murder as want a whiz\nAnd an acting upon the example they set the mob of tomorrow may and probably will\nHang or burn some of them by the very same mistake and not only so the innocent boats would never set their faces against violations of laws in every shape like with the guilt the fall victims to the ravages of Bob law\nAnd bus it goes on step by step till all the walls erected for the defense of the persons and property of individuals are trotting down in this regard\nBut all this even is not the full extent of the evil\nBy such examples I instances of the perpetrators of such acts going on punished by law Allison spirit are encouraged to become lawless in practice and having been used to know restraint but dread of punishment they've become absolutely unrestrained\nThat sums it up that sums it up and\nThe problem here you know you know and the these Democrats you know whether it's the guy tearing down the Ted Cruz signs in in Houston\nOr the or or the Soros guy Willie Stark who by the way they're not calling him Wilfrid stark anymore the calling them might START I guess they they saw was a little too much to be named Willie Stark the guy uh\nAll in all the king's men\nThe guy he was fired today by Soros he's a he's just a thug who moves around the country beating up a Republicans mainly women\nOr you know he him or the the uh the the the bugs that attacked the uh\nRepublican candidates for a state rep and Minnesota I mean this been going on for a long long\nTime now and they they don't care that the Democrats don't care they they they don't think it's ever going to come back to haunt them\nJust like you know all these legacies at Harvard you know the people who the the the ... the white people they don't think they're ever going to be discriminated against like the like the Asians or the or the poor white people\nYou know oh we'll always have money will always get taken care of daddy can all would pay Turks and all was called the deans and get in get my kid\nIn the Harvard they don't understand that you know what if one person or one group\nIs discriminated against or a were punished without due process then everybody is in danger\nAnd uh they they that's\nWhat makes these people so scary and that's why they have to be defeated\nSix oh three says granny Warren is the leader of the absolutely unrestrained yeah I mean granny Warren thought nothing what happened to her that she ... you know what that's a good example\nThey can't do it to me I can do it to them you know I can go out and demand that the president of Wells Fargo be fired which by the way I agree with her on but she she thinks she she used to always been able to dish it out", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Howie Carr Show", "city": "Springfield", "day": "18"}
