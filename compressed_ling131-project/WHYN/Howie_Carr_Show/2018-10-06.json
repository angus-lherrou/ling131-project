Rolling Stone story about UVA we add mattress girl at Columbia\nI'm there for the hell aboard Halliburton ... in Iraq who allegedly gang rapes Jamie Lee Jones and put her in a shipping container all of these for one hundred percent believed by um Democrats they brought in Jamie Lee Jones to to the Senate passed a law in her honor\nUm she was on you know good morning America believed every place you went by the Democrats on the media\nUm I Can't think of one where where it was actually true they have a very bad record on this now it's down to groping\nI'm an allegation of groping with no corroborating witnesses the witnesses\nThe the accuser named all deny being there I have been either but then you got your body so they have to get into the farting jokes on any time he ever drank

wins the lord for best trolling of liberal [laughter]\nDon't you don't you know ... this is really moving in the same direction as the Russia probe because there is there is no more Russia and the Russia probe right and the groping use going away now we're coming into the ... is he did he lie to the Senate when he just said he liked to be here when he loved to be here\nAnd now we're now we're even moving on beyond that to his being teaspoons charged with being belligerent\n'em and all this from a party that defended I'm a rapist Bill Clinton um while he was governor not not not even you know back when he was Fifteen Years old based on a recovered memory I'm as governor within it out to Paula Jones\nAnd can only seem to have this going on simultaneously with Keith Ellison a Democrat member of Congress\nOn his mistress who called nine one one at the time claiming that he beat her and it was not a peep about that\nYeah I Know and and women do not deserve to be believed\nAnd ... what about the charges against Senator Robert Menendez of New Jersey and I'm Talking about the corruption charges unplugging right off the charges in the Daily Caller a couple of years ago about what he was doing down on those Dominican vacations but the ophthalmologist from West Palm was providing for a mug route us in return for bringing his\nHis mistress was into the country with a green cards you know you know that\nMuch I think is admitted the only thing that was um [noise] disputed what was the\nThe prostitutes and the child sex but as for being as Mr says out although on the media may not care but it's starting to look like the voters may care I mean incumbent oughta when especially a Democrat in a very liberal state like New Jersey but I just saw some polls showing\nHis Republican opponent is in a dead heat with him\nNow he may end up winning in the end but that's quite a statement to have an incumbent Democrat in New Hampshire\nNeed ... seats are in New Jersey even having to think about his reelection\nRight so so today a and you saw the president of the er at the trade press conference of course they weren't actually been preyed yeah they just want and you knew you knew you were just watching it to see the first question would not be about parade or about this great victory\nWould be about Brett Kavanaugh's or how many beers ... the ah the keg party at the deep house in a you know in Nineteen eighty three and and\nBut I'm actually glad it sorry go ahead\nWith what he says so so then that ... ... ... says did you watch the thing\nThat you know I've seen some Democratic senators and some pretty compromising position you know to go when they get about ice skill you know and uh so so now the left to say is he trying to blackmail our steamed the Y. makers they're they're angry but we have\nI'm really glad they did ask about Kavanaugh's job I was thinking of treating out but I was busy I'm ... I Hope Republicans are watching this is how it's done\nI was so happy when he turned it back on the Democrats and when asked for specific oh he gave specifics he gave a specific set out on you know mile Austria senator from Connecticut Senator Blumenthal a lying about his Vietnam service for four hours\nAnd and die holding\nHolding this woman's account for for for what two months that seriously\nShe took it um he actually went through the these scandals involving the Democrats and that is what the Republicans should do every time turn it right back on these guys because what they have done oh my gosh if only the worst they could be accused of it is\nA a recovered memory thirty six years later that they groups are girl and at at Fifteen Years old\nBut this is another thing be uh the the uh presses or why is he so obsessed with the fact that Richard Blumenthal told the few white lies about his Vietnam service\nIt you know the white\nLies oh my gosh going on and on about his service and then nailed dead to write that was only because I'm One of my my my favorite ... no ours Republican consultants that Blumenthal even won that election he collapsed and the polls but\nNo shame [laughter] don't we don't I don't laugh and joke of it I mean it really is horrible\nThings can happen and Clinton did I say okay you can carry about rape or not care about rape I happen to think it's a serious crime but you can't pretend to care about re enlist sons any while you're in defending Bill Clinton\nTeddy Kennedy and pretending they they really are familiar with rape statistics and don't know that white men are the least rape you we've ever had right\nAnd and how about Joe Kennedy the third my congressman he he tweeted out the week before he said well you know the

charged with a burglar rising a campus building on the uh University of Texas El Paso campus and he said it was a it was a college prank but the thing is he wasn't in in in a college student at the time\nI'd said sounds just like a a just like a regular run of the mill burglary to me\nAs as a Brett Kavanaugh ever been charged with a burglary ... does the sports columnist for USA Today think that

you're seeing the vitamin D revolution the vitamin D error is officially started in the impact is going to be unprecedented what's really going on here\nWell let me tell you it's just a little bit about how I got into this because I think it'll give some information about how the people\nAbout ... years ago I realized that vitamin D was going to revolutionize medical care the reason I came to that conclusion is because I realized that virtually all Americans are vitamin D deficient when we follow doctor's advice and our government's advice and we started putting on the phone blocking staying out of the fund it had\nTremendous effect on the vitamin D levels in our blood\nSo I started a non profit the vitamin D counsel on there you can read more information than you can possibly remember\nAll about vitamin D and I also realize that the amount of vitamin D Americans were taking whether it be in their multi vitamins are trying to drink milk was pretty much irrelevant the amount is so low it had no effect on vitamin D blood levels\nAnd when I realized that it literally changed my life and then\nThe last year so I realize that to work fully to optimally work vitamin D needs a number of coke factors it needs vitamin K to ... vitamin K one but the more expensive vitamin K to\nIt needs for on it needs magnesium it need sink and we'll talk about all these secondly I realize there's a difference between having vitamin D on the shelf and people can buy it or\nIf you use fans are open doors and windows and keep your car out of the living room\nA safety message from the

Richards from his father you inherited money\nAnd then here's a quote I mean a lot of this a lot of this story by the way is a is a critique of of the New York journalist who covered Donald Trump including the New York times\nI built what I built myself Mr Trump has said a narrative that was long amplified by off incredulous coverage for news organizations including the New York times\n\n[noise] of course the story of how Donald Trump got rich cannot be reduced to handouts from his father but that's what we've done in the headline we've reduced it the handouts from his father because that's all anyone's gonna read no who's ... who's got time to read all this\nThey say that a Trump by the time he was three years old was making two hundred thousand dollars a year as part of Fred Trump's effort to hand is money down well pretty good for a three year old\n... ah you know there are guys that have have their the guys in the long form a junior in Boston who as soon as their son his board they signed him up for the longshoremen view so we can you know even if the kid as an infant isn't getting paid he's at least on the seniority\nI mean isn't isn't that something that's traditionally done you try to help out your offspring\nMe this is actually especially to avoid the death tax yeah\n\nAcross the decades aged and a better by less than aggressive journalism we're back to this again I just you know I kept a got time to read the whole thing ate it at a better by less than aggressive journalism Mr Trump has made sure his financial history would be sensationalized\nFar more than ... so there are there it is it for four or five hundred forty to forty two I uh I Hope but Trump makes a trip to North Dakota just like you did to West Virginia I think he's already made a trip to North Dakota has an ... I'm pretty sure he has\nIf he's got ... if if if if he's ten points up I mean he may make one more trip just to make sure it's in the back but I mean ten points is that's that's pretty good margin over a a over a ... senator at this break eight four for five hundred the forty to forty to\nRecall what they what they will take a call Tom your next with highway cargo had a\nLong time listener thanks how are we have two questions one sexual assaults a terrible thing but all people have do you do now is made the accusation and it's almost as bad into didn't vote grab an accusation and also Blumenthal who ... to judge him\nWell but Booker Blumenthal has ever been accused of sexual harassment I mean he made up that story about being in Vietnam but Booker yeah Booker has admitted he wrote a column for the uh Stanford newspaper when he was out there\nIn Palo Alto as an undergraduate saying that he had rubbed a woman at the age of Fifteen yeah I Know ... so that always said should if someone in the intro was saying\nIf you harassed a woman in high school your wife should be ruined I mean what about what about Cory Booker he admits it Kevin Kevin model denies it Corey balloons admitted it\nRight or is it a judge him at all so long ago didn't make a sexual out is Asian but also it is the one that won in fabricated his ah getting on do you know go ahead and call him wrong so\nRight keep going I agree I agree what about ...
