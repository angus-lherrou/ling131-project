A. Z. E. L. O. at\nThe last time we were talking about Emily ... when she said that she wished that there would be a national a natural disaster because it would be advantageous for the Democrats\nReally okay well she also said that she she also uh lives in New haven I guess and she pointed out that she that she thought that he should not be confirmed so this is how this this is how a a unbiased a reporter

so much more that will hire from the Democratic process and prevent a more equal society this is what she said and now she's reporting on this guy that she thinks should that she faces a despicable human being\nSo the New York times issues a note about this\nEmily bass a lawn is a writer for the New York times magazine who occasionally writes\nOp eds for the opinion section she is not newsroom reporter her role in this story was to help colleagues in the news room gather public documents New Haven where Emily is based\nIn retrospect editors should have used a newsroom reporter for that assignment\nIs Jason Blair still around is about to be clear the story is straightforward fact\nBased and uh you know in other words it's not like most of our stories this story as fact based you can trust us all the news that fits the print\nIs there any other example of the New York times reporting out a story where the individual wasn't charged with just interviewed by police\nYeah and we fully

the way it's it was such a big deal they took the guy to the hospital and again no one's ... no one that you know it doesn't really\nWho I guess was the probably the star of the Yale team that year

a different way bill because if he's really drinking this much it might cut into his life expectancy I mean there is a lifetime appointment you know Amy Coney Barrett is probably going to live longer than Brett Kavanaugh\nYeah that's right that's right you know and you know the way hospitals in the medical\nProfession or go and they're kind of going PC like the American bar association so they probably wouldn't\nTry to rush to get them a liver transplant like they did for Mickey Mantle when when he had a problem\nRight anyway back to this letter from a bit new will take some calls that aid for four or five hundred forty to forty two so this is a Grassley is writing the Coons foggy morning about how ridiculous this letter that he said it was from this uh this guy who created a TV show in which people strip while dancing to their favorite music\nThis allegation says Senator Grassley has all the makings of a tabloid headlines but there's just one problem the accuser really admit to having no evidence whatsoever that judge Kavanaugh even attended this party rather than provide even circumstantial evidence of\nJudge Kavanaugh's attendance the advisor provide some investigative advice he proposes that someone search judge Kavanaugh's calendars the very same calendars that your colleagues ... dismissed and derided with regard to Dr Ford's allegations\nTo determine whether he attended a fraternity party at some point in Nineteen eighty seven or Nineteen eighty eight and that's at\nAll he alleges that he once witness a salacious party at a house owned by judge Kavanaugh's undergraduate fraternity he'd been separately advises us to obtain and search judge Kavanaugh's calendars did the term\nDetermine if he attended\nWraps up Senator Grassley in this letter to senator cones we've reached a new level of absurdity with this allegation there was no evidence the judge Kavanaugh with anywhere near this party or had anything to do with it at all in fact the only person we can be sure attended the party was the accuser himself\nThe loan connection between judge Kavanaugh and the events described by the accuser is that as an undergraduate judge Kaplan I was a member of the fraternity that hosted the party\nThe purpose of this allegation is plain to smear judge Kavanaugh's name again by associating him with the party's host this guilt by association tactic is the basis form of political attack and deserves unqualified condemnation\n\nAid for four or five hundred forty to forty two are on our local news last night the the NC State assistant professor this is
