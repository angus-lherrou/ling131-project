great great grandmother\nAnd it's odd that you would be an Indian because she was married to a guy named William Crawford was a member of the Tennessee militia that rounded up Cherokees\nFrom their family homes in the southeastern United States and hurting them in the government ... and what was then called Ross's Landing\nWhich is now Chattanooga, Tennessee that was what a trail of tears started in the thirty seven so he was he so he was one of the white man who racially cleanse\nThe uh the the southeast United States and then he married an Indian does that make sense this is from a Breitbart by the way\nThey also did they also did some research or about some of her other ancestors in the in the old Indian Territory Oklahoma and uh I think her great grandfather was a a was he was ... he was a\nSharp shooting you might say and according to a newspaper account from Nineteen hundred or Nineteen oh one\nI ... a drunken Choctaw Indian beat his son severely and uh the the grandfather came upon the beating going on in the ... tried to stop the Indian and the Indian jumped on a horse\nAnd was riding away and so a lizard with Warren's pop Paul Paul I don't know if I don't know great great grandfather whatever\nPulled out his God or his rifle I get I guess was a rifle and he got and the Indian down was ... who the fleeing drunken Choctaw\nAnd they the story said the the Indian was in the hospital a local hospital in critical condition after he got shot by Elizabeth Warren so these are these are the these [laughter]\nThese are her her and says I'm not saying that you you know the uh the shooting was unjustified he almost killed the uh the the other the kid but\nStill I mean now she's telling us She's a ... she was a victim of this terrible a racism\nIn a ... and her her parents were a victim of the terrible racism and I again we've we've gone over this a million times but it's always knew their their new people that are listening and and watching\nNow ... ... one of her stories is that a is that her parents had to a low in the Nineteen thirties and Depression era era\nOklahoma because there was a such a endemic racism against Native Americans that and ah her her uh her paternal ancestors didn't want a their son or father being ... and indeed\nAnd that that they had to is low ... to ... uh to to ah you know to have true love like Romeo and Juliet\nAnd somebody went back in twenty twelve and check out the clip the newspapers the weekly newspapers in this town where they live\nIn rural Oklahoma and what really happened was that it was everybody was dirt poor gospel you know the the uh the Joe ... the grapes of wrath et cetera everybody was broke\nThey had no money for a a honeymoon or anything like that so they just jumped in their car the to love birds and they drop to the nearest town went into biggest Protestant Church the wouldn't church\nAnd uh got married and then they drove back to their own home town and had the reception that

lives would buy spread what am I made up and he makes me want to ...\n... do you want to offer an apology I I Want to know what I said there was a lie I\nI don't know the first one nobody I Do how many copies of how well Joe cookbook I've sold for her over the years since her cookbook gets royalties still in Palo Alto\nYou know when you go to are we going to put out this kind of fake a DNA test and and claimed that you're really are at Cherokee I mean don't you want to\nCheck this with the Cherokee Nation you for you to with me just to prevent this kind of pull back the just the issues that they've just announced her basically where do you just you just figure at\nThe Boston Globe's never going to report what the Cherokee Nation says they're gonna they're gonna cover this up for me there are they you know they've been covering this stuff up again remember\nBack in two thousand twelve the New England historical genealogical society was asked to take a look at her her background and see if they could discover any\nNative Americans in her family tree and this is like the the premier a genealogical rope and the whole country\nThey they totally drew a blank and they announced it they they didn't try to cover it up or anything like that and uh the Harold my newspaper in the all the other media outlets ran but the New England a story on genealogical site couldn't find anything\nIn the globe just kept running for weeks that the the New England or historical genealogical so I said there was I mean they just made it up\nThey just made it up they don't care\nThat this ... this is how they operate eight four for five hundred forty to forty two that is the toll free number of the highway car show if you if you want to join us now and the weirdest\nThing how we are just just looking at the home page of the Boston Globe and they haven't updated their story include the statement from\nThe Cherokee Nation funny funny thing\nThey're still reeling from the series of corrections they've had issue on their fuzzy math you know\nAnd again they they just they they they put out the fake statistics but she was really one that she might be one thirty second India and then there was no less than one five hundred and twelve Indian\nAnd that was that was bogus ... that was bogus per se correct that half of it and then they had to correct the whole thing the whole statement that she's actually at most one sixty fourth Indian at most leisure own\nStatistics or her own DNA quote unquote test for some lab that we don't even know where it is and their fudging the numbers anyway\nSo I mean this it's totally meaningless and then they come up and they the numbers are meaningless to begin with and they and they ... they fudge him and that don't change it into law after every moon bad in the country has said well she proof she was in India\nNo no she didn't prove she was an Indian not at all Ted your next ... go ahead Ted\nYeah somewhat related to the Elizabeth Warren matter of the Harvard chase relating to the discrimination against Asians yes uh endeavor mission practice I Associated Press just came out with an article about\nAnd a half an hour ago and the title says Harvard\nAll one race can only help or harm applicants chances now that the greater more often but I mean correct me if I'm wrong but if you're if you're helping someone based on race have to be hurting somebody else right\nWell if there's if there's to say two thousand slots in each class that is a finite number right Ted so for every person you if every person you accept that's that is at least one person in probably ten at Harvard or five that aren't going to get in right\nAt the math as far as I'm concerned yeah no it's it's ridiculous thanks for the call I\nAte for four or five hundred forty to forty two or five void says can you explain why this doesn't prove she's an Indian how we yeah\nUnder tribal laws under the bureau of Indian affairs under the Cherokee nation's own statement\nThis proves she's not in India and if you look at the fine print of the DNA report in their own words they use the Peruvian Colombian Mexican DNA so if anything it proves that her ancestor six generations ago was Peruvian Colombian or Mexican\nYeah she she claimed that that that she was a victim or her mother was a victim of discrimination\nAnd that you have a high cheekbones because she was an idiot how could how can you have ... how can you have Indian ah physical characteristics which she claimed she did if you're only one one thousand India\nIs everything she said about her heritage is a lie and that includes the hand and the B and if you if you if you don't want to accept that then uh you know you're you're in for another a rude surprise at the polls if not in twenty eight teams certainly in twenty twenty\nRob your next with highway car go ahead Rob\nHi uh I I\nThink it's a really only only hurts their claim this is the most ridiculous thing I've ever heard it it I Can't believe that\nYou know she this has got to hurt this makes it more of a fraud\nThan we thought she was and I talked to my eighty four year old mother this morning and she was all that gets you read the Boston Globe and she's she's got to be frozen in the last decade\nI my great great grandfather was a a whole bunch of ... that makes me less than a sick I have no title than any one
