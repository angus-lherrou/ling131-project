{"month": "10", "state": "MA", "station": "WHYN", "content": "Analyze all of the slides and looked at everything from all of us rosy as hard so we can clearly saying you know the Elvis Presley did not die of any sort of heart related in a um affliction\n[noise] now as for FDR or he was sixty three and I mentioned you know that was pretty good age for Nineteen forty five today that's\nFairly young uh but just because he he surpass the average lifespan I don't think it was as low as forty nine back then but I mean George Washington you know lived to be in ... I Believe in his seventies or Thomas Jefferson and so forth that that that doesn't disprove that he may have been pointing obviously\nYeah I Would say read the book check it out give it a shot I think it's better than you might think it would be um the Elvis spoke to some people they deal with different different parts in time and um you know I spent ten years researching all this stuff and you know FDR not quite that much for sure\nBut um there's this information and the book is is pretty compelling I Would check it out\n[noise] uh Easter the Rockies Martha is in Gulfport, Mississippi Maher said good morning welcome to coast\nTank a rancher thank you for taking my call my play the idea that had been ... originally made their money to pay this fine trade them for a day or wet I'm more a humane way to make money and the ...\nAh started out our lighting houses with kerosene but boy that combat stumble engine that guy's a gasoline like a byproduct then they can and they ran they got down nice guy that I never have no idea how the relatives out well and they\nHave a clue as to how they make their money ran tonight\n[noise] well I Know that\nI I yeah I Do actually and the tour guide at the Roosevelt mansion mentioned this they were actually in the timber business so I was told\n'em and they were dealing with timber in a in the United states and they also we're dealing with similar in South America so that's where allegedly there and when he came from and if I'm proven wrong then so be it that's what I was told uh at the Roosevelt mansion and they were very good at manipulating the stock market just like the Kennedys were\nSo I mean you're dealing with the stock market was not as big as it is today and they were only a handful of major players back then you know in today you know the world is on our stock market other countries are in the New York stock exchange back then it really wasn't that way so\nA handful of players could really influence things they can create the peaks and valleys in the market so when you have the money to start with and you can you you can influence where the bottom is and you know where the top as you can make a fortune pretty quickly and Joe Kennedy did the same thing this is why\nWhen a after they made their money they shut the door so no one else could do that and they started the actually see the security Exchange Commission and FDR actually put\nJoe Kennedy in charge of it\nBecause according to FDR quote unquote effects accrue to crush across\n[laughter] really interesting stuff so that's what I Know about that I mean if there's more information out there I Love to hear it but their their their money came from Denver\nA and also I Would I Would imagine I'm you know it's an old it's an old east coast family ah probably it's all money so you know just kind of a ... to me elation of wealth over generations compound interest um that sort of thing when you have all money\nI'd also hurt and I don't know if this is true but that that um that's FDR's mother the Delano side of the family\nHad made their money during the opium wars as well so I'm sure there was a lot of a lot of those they used to call them the Boston brain in those very wealthy east coast families\nAnd I think a lot of them were involved in the east India company a and a lot of that was the opium trade so there may be on that as well\nYeah I heard that about the Delano family as well there is so much information out there I mean I spent so much time digging and digging these guys are never written a book on let me tell you what if I was paid a penny an hour\nI'd be lucky [laughter] by the time you research and dig and dig and dig because if you attach her name 'til you want to be as best they can you know for them as far as like the I I still\nGet fascinated by stuff somebody will call in and say hey did you notice\nIs a a Russian collusion\nInvestigation and then you know at that point I was just kind of like the getting to check out and move on to the other ... TV viewing or I forget what I was doing but I quit there's only so much I can take and then he ... he started going after a her telling her you know he he she wasn't the president and he was\nAnd it was it was good but you know again it's it's it's just so much\nFake news out there so then we have a the story or the the walking the anticipated trial Harvard University is accused of a racist discrimination against ah the admission of Asian Americans just like a century ago they were\nA discriminating against the admission of Jews because they were doing too well on the admissions in the admissions process just like the Asians are now\nSo you know things changed Democrats never really changed you know it's a it's it's they they train their a racist or\nAttacks are different groups but the ... is always kind of the city but we're not going to even get into that that I Will get into that later in the week this was the beginning of the trial today at the district court house that are all in Boston\nBut the big story today is that a Elizabeth Warren has released what she claims this or a DNA test and she's claiming\nThat it proves that she's a Native American in reality a claim she's it proves that she's not a Native American so the the fake news Boston Globe a you know they were the I mean they just have so many fake news stories and their past my kid even I don't have time\nTo even a lay it all out for you but just lay out of my article Jason Blair Patricia Smith Kevin ... those are a few of their fake news reporters column this over the years people that have been busted for uh making stuff up\nThey uh they they made up stories about the ... they said us soldiers were raping women in Iraq during the first Gulf War it turned out it was a porn movie still\nThey said Ted Kennedy was turning his life around over and over again that turn out to be a law I mean it just goes it it never ends\nSo today they put out a story Elizabeth Warren has new evidence proving that she's one between one thirty second and won five hundred and twelve\nHindi Native American\nAnd then you read down into the story\nThey didn't they they ... they included ... anyone who has it Mexican Mexican DNA Peruvian DNA Colombian DNA so in other words for ... Native American it it it could be Hispanic so her name but she she can change your name from Elizabeth\nWarren to Elizabethan till Warren like the a bust out the Texas Senate candidate was pretending she's pretending to be an Indian and he's pretending to be Hispanic\nSo my question is if you are one sixty fourth Asian is that enough for Harvard to discriminate against you\nRight I Will but anyway listen so here it is\nSo so then I bought like an hour after they post the story they say a correction um the range isn't from one thirty second to five hundred won five hundred and twelve that's from one thirty second to one one thousand and twenty four\nAnd so again I'm not a I'm I'm not very good at math\nBut I said to myself well if the if the upper range is false that does it the bottom range have to be false to I mean it's not like basic\nMath\nBut the you know so we ... we started referring to it as one sixty fourth and a Breitbart News started referring to what his one sixty fourth but the globe kept running with it because\nThey want to allow all the moon bats they put their Facebook paste postings up saying that it's one third that she's she's got evidence such as it is claiming that she's one thirty second\nBut it was false so finally about a half hour ago they posted a second correction saying but at at most she is one\nSixty fourth India\nOr Native American or non white and of course here's the thing\nThe average\nWhite America and the average American of European descent has more Native American blood than she apparently but she is claiming to be in India and she is claiming that she has a right to a to a forgotten and affirmative action position first at the University of Pennsylvania and then at Harvard University law school\nAnd of course we have powwow child or cook\nWhat the one fifty five Elizabeth Warren she's a member of she's a Cherokee according to this was before the Cherokee and her uh her she's got several recipes in here they're all lifted from various places my favorite is called on what's with crab meat which lifted from uh New York times French cookbook\nAll right uh\n[laughter] you know this is this is just such a such a crock and it's so classic of the Democrat Party and the mainstream media the print fake news and then correct the fake those after the uh after\nThe lives have gone around the world and are are already posted and so tonight I guarantee you if you go to the the usual left wing cable news cast they will still be repeating ally\nWhich is already a been retracted by the uh additional fake news outlet to report it the Boston Globe that she's one thirty second India\nBut you know what it doesn't even matter if she's one thirty second Indian that's not good enough the claimed to be an Indian\nWhether it's a bureau of Indian affairs standards whether it's the tribal role she she claims she's part Cherokee part Delaware\nThat's not good enough she's not in India if they if they were printing truthful headlines in the in the op left media the headline would say\nWhite woman's DNA test proves she's white woman\nOr a DNA test confirm Elizabeth Warren\nFate is a fake ending 'cause that's what she is she's a fake Indian\nDidn't the ... some a text there says didn't the Cherokee Nation state that on our ancestry and could not find any connection yes of course yeah she's a she's a fried she's a fraud and now they're saying that the oh she's she's proven that she's in ...\nShe is she's proven she's proven she's ... and and we don't even know where this DNA test was non\nShe gave it to some uh Stanford University professor who is a a I guess he's a biochemist he's not even a geneticist these of I think a biophysicist and ... he they let him do the ...\nNo one's ... who's believing all these tests that these Democrats are putting up now you know I mean the ah Christine Blasey Ford's a test\nOr you know ... and indeed the recovered memories of all these other people I mean they've they've kind of a reduced the credibility of ah of people like this in this uh in in this political party thanks for the call Joanne\nEight five five eight four four excuse me five hundred forty to forty two um highway car [noise]\nWhy\nWhy why are you finding\nWays why why\nWhy why aren't you bring my way why [noise]\nLive broken Matthews brothers [noise]\nEight four for five hundred forty to forty two\nSo so they're reporting that hurt her ancestor has ah that hurt\nPossible Indian ancestor even though women never claimed to be India has a a woman named ... see Sarah Smith\nHer great great great grandmother\nAnd it's odd that you would be an Indian because she was married to a guy named William Crawford\nWas a member of the Tennessee militia\nThat rounded up Cherokees from their family homes and the southeastern United States and hurting them in the government ... what was then called Ross is landing\nWhich is now Chattanooga, Tennessee that was what a trail of tears started in a the thirty seven so he was he so he was one of the white man who racially cleanse\nThe uh the the southeast United States and then he married an Indian is that makes sense\nThis is from up right part by the way they also did they also did some research or about some of her other ancestors in the in the old Indian Territory Oklahoma and uh I think her great grandfather\nWas a a was he was ... it was a\nSharp shooting you might say and according to a newspaper account from Nineteen hundred or Nineteen oh one\nI ... a drunken Choctaw Indian beat his son severely and uh the the grandfather came upon the beating going on and the price price to stop the Indian and the Indian jumped on a horse\nAnd was riding away and so a lizard with Warren's paw paw paw I don't know if I don't know great great grandfather whatever pulled out his gun or his rifle I get I used was a rifle\nAnd he got and the Indian down was ... who the fleeing drunken Choctaw and they the story said the the Indian was in the hospital a local hospital in critical condition after he got shot by Elizabeth Warren so these are these are the these [laughter]\nThese are her her ancestor I'm not saying that you you know that uh the shooting was unjustified almost killed yet the the other the kid but\nStill I mean now she's telling us She's a ... she was a victim of this terrible um racism in uh in in her her parents were a victim of a terrible racism and again we've we've gone over this a million times but it's always knew their their new people that are listening and and watching\nNow ... ... one of her stories is that the ... is that her parents had to load up in the Nineteen thirties Depression era era\nOklahoma because there was a such a endemic racism against Native Americans it\nAnd ah her her uh her paternal ancestors didn't want a their son or father marrying and indeed and that that they had to is low to uh to to ah you know to have true love like Romeo and Juliet\nAnd somebody went back in twenty twelve and checked out the clip the newspapers the weekly newspapers in this town where they live in rural Oklahoma and what really happened was that it was everybody was dirt poor gospel you know the the uh\nThe Joe ... grapes of wrath et cetera everybody was broke they had no money for a a honeymoon or anything like that so they just jumped in their car that to love birds and they drove to the nearest town went into biggest Protestant Church that wouldn't church\nAnd uh it got married and then they drove back to their own home town and had the reception that night now does that sound to you like and elope\nNo of course there was no low but it's just more more jai just like her her stories about growing up on the jacket or ragged depending on which adjective she wants to use edge of the middle class\nJagger ragged edge of the middle class by your own account other account she had the family had three cars when she was a senior in high school in Nineteen sixty five three cars\nNineteen sixty five not too many families on the Jagger ragged edge of the middle class or anywhere else had three cars in the United states of America\nAid for four or five hundred forty to forty two\nUm six one seven says weren't as more Native American than Sean King is African American that's not saying a lot though you know I don't think that's a a a good defense for a a for a fake
