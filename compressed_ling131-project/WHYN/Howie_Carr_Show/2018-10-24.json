forty to forty two graves where you got\nAs far as the pipe bomb go Twitter has been a crazy place today I think than Shapiro put it best when he said in these situations it's ideal to wait until we have the information because people on both sides are saying things that they really have no idea and\nThose teachers don't age while you might have another day and Trump's America right or on the other hand like this is a huge conspiracy theory this is a false flag\nWell they were actual bomb according to a lot of the news sources so it wasn't really a false flag either way the point is they were sent\n'em [noise] but yeah it is a little strange that it's all Democrats and I guess the return address is Debbie Wasserman Schultz is offices are where officers are located not saying like the ... hour discussing it you can put your return label anywhere so\nYou know that doesn't really seem to either she's a weird situation I Am I'm honestly how we most surprised\nThat we don't know who it is yet because I thought I was kind of always been a few hours\nI Know but I feel like with these things it takes even less time than that and\nI we don't have to find the Unabomber yeah I've watched I actually told Steve I watched the ... like I was saying we're not race probably knows more about the Unabomber than you do there is enough like showing the Unabomber it is so good at the eight episodes so interesting had no idea I didn't know anything about it going into it so I really enjoyed it\nTook four days to find the Muslim terrorists above the marathon\nI Know but all I'm saying is nowadays is surveillance cameras\nAnd it's also a lot easier because the bombs then go off and I think if there's any evidence leading back to whoever built them it'll be an attack\nRight and see like you said it's a it was a Korea right so it's not like they were males there was a what career career career I'm so they know they they should be able to actually be like a peanut trail\nEven ... they would have had to sign in at the building\nI think we're in a time period that if you're if it's ever going to be a fast way to figure this out it will be right now because we have so much technology that I Would have thought so it's kind of in the trial and I was like I'm In a way I'm going to wait I'm going to wait because I Would have obviously put in into but I'm Glad I didn't wait any longer still they're still very unsure\nAnd there's not a lot of people talking about the ISIS flag that was on one of the pipe bombs\nYeah use by that I mean I don't I don't know I did that they've kind of remind me of the Parkland shooting thing where he had like a magnet hat on and an ISIS flag and you know you don't want to jump towards anything because it can sometimes I think they just purposely do stuff like that and these people but anyway\nUh their news um [noise]\nSo everyone's come out and said that it's bad pen from they've all condemned it um but of course there are still being blamed that their rhetoric that it's leading to that I'm In other news of rhetoric Megan Kelly didn't\nEric Holder say something a couple of days ago but kicking people when they were down\nYeah and Hillary Clinton said about a week ago that we couldn't be civil with each other\nUntil they get the majority back so we're we can't act like adults until we're back in control until then we'll just have trial was tempered that for like two years old\nRight I just I just keep thinking of the secret service um that must be a crazy\nJob especially in a day like today or any of the mail carrier was drawn cases father released a statement\nI met you Steve I'm like yeah it's scary for people like Hillary Clinton and Obama who know that these were getting delivered to them but if I was a mailman I Will be in shock all day I think I Would just carrying a device that could've exploded\nWell I mean if I'm the courier and some guy shows up and he's like I needed to deliver to CNN and I see John Brennan's name on it from Debbie Wasserman Schultz I'm like nah nah nah nah nobody else yeah we should John Brennan but does she work for CNN or MSNBC contributor yeah so they they remain was spill\nIn Florida was spelled wrong Florida was spelled where it was is spelled floor it's you know [noise] I hate to point the fingers but I think most deplorable know how to spell Florida Brennan to I'm going to say but Florida especially\nI mean there was no denying when you watched people on CNN outside you know delivering the news from their cell phones on the sidewalk there was a real sense of joy that this I I hate to say they were excited babies I think\nYou for you is the word you're looking for a you know oddly you know when I received real death threats from real killers I didn't feel you for you\nYeah I I didn't feel like total panic but I felt like ... lightly alarmed yeah I was a yeah I Would slightly ... it was concerning yeah I was a jumping up and down with joy like the CNN anchors were\nYeah we want to say and that obviously we did this is a horrible thing if they really don't know what what will even if they're not real bombs it's horrible yeah and then there are not getting their right and I mean it just it seems to me like they were so excited to shift the story from anything else to\nWe are the victims now the Trump cause the print the enemy of the people now we're getting bomb

activists are doing this for Skilling the surge and the ... in the polls are due to the left side of hinged behavior or the left us are doing this on the road to show the Republicans are is on the here and just as they are or worse\nQuestion that answers itself that's it I don't know the answers itself six oh three but it's a very good question\nYou get a statement from Jeff Zucker president of CNN quote there is a total and complete lack of understanding at the White House about the seriousness of their continued attacks on the media the president and especially the White House press secretary should understand their words matter that's far they've shown no comprehension of at\n\nThat\nTime that was really stupid thing what will re mature don't drink\nEvery time this happened what no matter what happens to\nPoliticians and people in power should come out and say there are crazy people in the world that has nothing to do with than it has nothing to do with that\nAnd then when this happened we wouldn't have to do this every single time but each argument negate the south because there's so much what about a minute we'll remember the softball field remembered it guaranteed most of them are liberal people doing it to Republican but still it's when it happened people just acknowledge that sometimes people\nSome people it's not about ... what is really happening\nRight but it all on things happen no I'm\nSaying is no matter what happens if someone takes it to the level of violence you go from political too crazy town so we can all just acknowledge it some people are not

Rosenstein in order to placate them agreed to a point Mueller as special counsel real and that calm them down that is what he doesn't\nWant to talk about under oath\nSo I correct me if I'm wrong but McCabe becomes the acting director when Colombia's fired I mean isn't this call looking a gift horse in the mouth I mean don't you say\nThat I you know okay I'm going to say I'm going to say that I'm sad he's gone but I'm now the boss this is a good this is a break for me now why would why now angry\nBecause he knows that he can never survive this\n... remember this was all being done to protect them because they had all as you know corrupt late exonerated Hillary Clinton right\nAnd during the ... and during and after the campaign during transition they had decided that they were going to overthrow the president of the United states\nThat's why the head of the NSA Mike Rogers went to see the president after the election Trump Tower and told him\nRight holds him exactly and told him about what had occurred with the illegals spine end with the illegal use of fires that information raw intelligence that are too on masks people so\nAnd that's where that's where he lived in the ... move the transition team out of Trump Tower down to the golf club in New Jersey\nThe very next day after he met with Rogers he moved and now here's here's something else this is really fascinating the committee has also been told that missed\nThis is great stuff Ash Carter remember Ash Carter is that is the secretary men's writer nobody right he was from him I tell you I Believe yes\nAsh Ash Carter and\nAnd James Clapper went to the president when they found out that Rogers had gone to the ... the court and advised them of all this illegal activity Ash Carter and Clapper went to the president and demanded that Rogers be fired and you know what that here\nYou know but I also have all these guys are\nAll man this is this gets better Brock Obama\nIs no dummy he said it ain't gonna happen we're not firing Rogers he's going to retire soon if we fire him now the whole thing will blow up and of course by that time Rogers had already told the five to court about all the illegal\nWhy isn't fight why why isn't the Pfizer court doing anything I mean you know even if a judge is part of the day if say they did wonder if they did\nThey did what they know listen you're never going to do with the\nSize of course does but here's what they did Rosemary Collyer wrote that very famous opinion on October the twenty six excuse me April twenty six two thousand Seventeen\nRemember this is after the election the president's been inaugurated right Rogers has gone to see the president Rogers has gone to the fire the court call your rights this amazing opinion one hundred page opinion in which seems lays out cold how the FBI and the NSA people illegally game\nIntercept information from five ... and other parts of the intercept to government\nContractors right you know who the government contractors were fusion GPS government ...\nWhat I you know what they're worth three names that are blacked out of her opinion and one of them is fusion GPS listen she mailed them the five the court nailed them and that the guy who was who work for for the attorney general of the United states\nWho it that you know that it with Loretta Lynch his name was John Carlin\nAnd he was the head of the national security division which is responsible\nFor the violence on the size it to go he was one of the worst ones to go right\nHe he resigned right he resigned shortly before ... wrote her opinion let me say this is never going to go away no matter what anybody thinks this even the idiot like Jeff Sessions is not going to be able to cover this up\nWhat happens if the Democrats regain control of the house though\nWell that's where the president's replacement of sessions and Rosenstein becomes absolutely central however\nI think Chuck Grassley a and and now I'm Lindsey Graham Lindsey Graham has dug in I think he will take over the investigation from the house in the in the Senate Judiciary committee and God help\nThe people in the Justice Department if if if Lindsey Graham takes over this investigation which he will if the if the if the Republicans lose the house everything will be shifted to Lindsey Graham\nYou think Glenn Simpsons go into prison\nI Do I Do and how do you uh if ... if it may be necessary to immunize\nHim in order to a certain government officials are but um that's a higher price you know I'm ... yeah but you know the one thing you can't immunize them from

you're pushed into a one hundred percent government run program where you have no choice\nGood luck trying to get a doctor's appointment or and and if you're a senior uh and you're paying your Medicare premiums are going to go through the roof\nRobot tried ... I in Vermont tried this Bruce they couldn't do it California tried it they couldn't do it two very different states in every way possible and ah they they totally struck out trying to do this why why would it be part of this Medicare for all its I mean it's totally ... how come you can't call 'em out on this\nWell we have been doing that and that that we focused on that in the debate Sally in in our adds a but remember polo shirt and Maxine\nWaters and all these other folks are pouring millions and millions of dollars there appear to hide you know his socialist you know radical policies\nAre and ah we're we're pushing back against that ah it's a close race we're going to win this thing but we've got to get everybody out to the polls so we don't have a a a radical like this representing the second district to make\nIt looks like a Sean ... pretty good shape I mean you should be able to I Would think you should be able to hang on you're not going to get a a you know we'll waive turn out like you do you do in a presidential election that seems like it'd be easier for you to get reelected this year than in twenty six feet\n[noise] [noise] well there's so much money that's come into your hobby that's the problem or in what\nOh there was a course trying to do is I behind ... money and in full enough people appear to uh\nUh to when we don't think that's going to happen I'm committed and that that's not going to happen we're meeting with hundreds of people on the ground every day and we got a heck of a lot of support and I think when it comes to Sean moody who's running for governor another business professional I'm a business professional I spent thirty five years creating jobs\nIn my opponent has absolutely zero experience creating jobs and I'm On top of that yeah it's a horrible record\nUh when it comes to the second amendment where I've repeatedly or stood up for a Second Amendment rights and Jared Golden is not\nThat should be enough to win right there the second district of Maine should not I mean everybody's everybody's got a gun right\nAh yeah it's a very big deal up here and I'm the only candidate who is repeatedly stood up for a Second Amendment rights and your golden has a duty rating and an F rating let you know the n._r._a. and the gun owners in Maine but I'll tell you another thing that's really important is our economy\nIs doing better all the time we are at two point seven percent\nUnemployment in the state of Maine we have a more jobs than we have folks are able to fill those jobs we've got to continue to go forward and continue to improve our economy\nNot go back in the kitchen even examples on the ballot how you won't believe this uh on the first question on the on on the ballot first referendum question is do you want to add three point eight percentage points to are already high state income tax\nUh and uh that would put her uh almost at eleven percent double what the Massachusetts' highest rate is and Jared Golden is the only\nVisible political figure up here that supports including among\nThe folks running for governor he would put us in the hole in the heck would come up to me and and start a small business or move up here if you got to pay eleven percent almost ... percent a personal income tax rate or ah or for small businesses it's a crazy idea of ever seen in my life but that's the difference\nYou ... percent income tax rate eleven percent right now it's\n... well right now at seven point one five you add three point eight to it it's ten point nine five percent that's what golden support\nWell to be clear it was it that that taxes only apply to millionaires and billionaires like basically people making more than a hundred and twenty thousand dollars [laughter]\nYou're right that that's the ultimate Trojan Horse so we we dodged the bullet down here in Massachusetts on that they wanted to put the millionaires tax and we all know what's going to be like on people making forty fifty thousand bucks a year if that pushed to throw it will be the same thing in Maine it's ridiculous ... by about\n... well they go and what happens if you're running a small business Holly and you know when you're at that level and\nMy gosh and all of a sudden you've got to pay that raiders there to reinvest in your company okay we got some really good stuff that's happening up here this morning I was up at old Tom ... just north of Bangor they've got a milk has been shut\nDown for three years they're reopening the male with a huge new investment the same folks that bought the paper mill over in ... it's gonna be a hundred new jobs highly over an old town\nGreat paying jobs with benefits engineering jobs as well blue collar jobs\nThe economy has got to continue to go forward that's why I've worked so hard to lower rates rats red tape and fair trade deals in my opponent has zero experience in that area was it Jack up taxes and throw everybody into a one hundred percent run government bureaucracy when it comes to health care\nSo if you if you want higher taxes crappy health insurance and no guns\nVote for golden that's correct that's your at someone like that [laughter] if you want someone who spent a lifetime creating jobs growing the economy\nYou weren't lower taxes less red tape a more opportunities I stand up for your Second Amendment rights are and you want to drive down the cost of health insurance without everyone being pushed into a government bureaucracy ... jacket right\nAll right Bruce thanks for being with us we appreciate it and good luck will talk to you
