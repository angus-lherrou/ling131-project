word last week we need transparency we need a complete investigation now now apparently the FBI investigation such as it is is near completion and Dianne Feinstein doesn't want it released\nGo figure go figure\nAnd now it turns out that uh the the the Senate the chairman of the judiciary a Chuck Grassley is a is asking for more I'd documents from uh from Christine Blasey Ford\nHe wants to know uh what what the story is what the polygraph test that she said she didn't know anything about polygraph test now or ex boyfriend is a sad and under pains in penalties of perjury but she a coach\nOne of her ah very best friends in life a woman named Monica McLean and how to do well on a polygraph best he's also a Chuck Grassley asking for her a therapy records\nYou know she says that she she first the reveal the uh the details of this a traumatic assault that she suffered at the hands of somebody\nTo watch to her therapist and she she uh she released the notes apparently from the therapist she got 'em from the therapist and gave him to the Washington Post so now Chuck Grassley wants to study them or as investigators do from the Senate Judiciary committee\nAnd Christine\nBlasey Ford's attorneys who ... at least one of whom is in the employee of uh George Soros on a\nOn at least one gig that she has Debra cats there were ... she's refusing to turn over the the therapist notes\nSo\nSo Grassley I don't think he wants to subpoena them I don't even know the I guess he has the power to subpoena them but I don't I don't think he wants to subpoena them but I you know ... she says there too\nPersonal the turnover well wait a second they weren't too personal to turn over to a newspaper\nBut now that you've had accused the guy of uh trying to rape you basically you don't want to turn them over to ... to the body that's investigating him how does that work I don't I don't quite get\nIt for four or five hundred forty to forty two and she doesn't want to talk about the polygraphs because she set under oh she knows uh have you this is what the lawyer let me read you the transcript there this is the lawyer from Arizona believe that the Republicans brought in the female attorney\nHad have you ever given tips for advice to somebody who was looking to take a polygraph test never lawyer have you ever had discussions with anyone beside your attorneys on how to take a\nPolygraph board never\nAnd her her ex boyfriend says that's not the case so\nHer lawyers just send a letter to a Senator Grassley that says that they're uh they're willing to turn over the documents the FBI about the polygraph and about her therapy notes uh but the FBI hasn't asked\nWhat what about Grassley what what what is the what does he chopped liver that the Senate Judiciary committee the FBI isn't\nGoing to vote on a on Brett Kavanaugh's confirmation the members of the Senate Judiciary committee and the rest of the Senate are\nThey don't have ... they they don't have it yeah\nEight for four or five hundred forty to forty two\nThis is a a ... and and Seventy one says how are these lunatics allowed in the buildings near the senators that's a very good question to you heard the herd Mitch McConnell saying earlier today said that we're not going to be intimidated by these a screaming Herod ends\nYou know are just totally range the women are in many of them probably in the employee of a Soros or people like him\nAnd none of them have ... none of them seem to have jobs or should I say this is their job\nIs uh is is just the engaging in a left wing mosques flash mobs or whatever you want to call up\nAnd a ... at and meanwhile the uh the the uh the press wing of the Democratic party just continues to run with these uh unsubstantiated the allegations just throwing everything up against the wall and seeing what sticks in so far nothing has stack\nAnd stock and the the more they throw up there and it doesn't stick the the more hysterical they become just like the women in the uh in the hallways ah you\nKnow shrieking at these US Senators eight four for five hundred forty to forty two\nSo [laughter]\nIt's it's really a ... it's really interesting I Hope the FBI isn't planning to was slow walk this thing you know I Hope they are going to try to watch I Try to complete their their appointed rounds\nYou know what let's get this let's get Brett Kavanaugh on to the Supreme Court and then we can get back to ah ... you know releasing the price of documents firing Rod Rosenstein and getting about the uh the nation's business\nThan the business

be concerned because ah you know what always happens when in the in these kinds of situations is\nThe original oppressor group they eventually be oppressors get tired of oppressing them and they move

I never liked it and read that I Am really a reluctant to read very much like a play by how I'd be reluctant to tweet it out or your or to put on a link you know I Know it's it's just so so graphic and so hard but I can read the uh\nThe the uh the get the page one here I Am a transgender woman being told by spa\nOwner than I Am a man and therefore she will not provide same services to me because I Am a man and not a woman\nBut yet he says later on in the complaint or she says or whatever as says that ah that he still has male genitalia\nBut he says he's a woman so he should be so the the the female or workers at the spa should provide him with a Brazilian just like they would for a woman\nThat's right but that that is how this law works out is that the definition of gender identity in Massachusetts law as extremely broad and fake and it doesn't require surgery as in this case she does know surgery doesn't require hormones that doctors a diagnosis it doesn't even require consistency\nSo he could walk into the place the next day and say yeah I actually am a man a today I'm all requires is they sincerely held gender identity\nThat's it so to a ripe for abuse and that's one of our real concerns about what this law\nYeah I told her this is this ... this is from the complaint I told her my body has started to change considerably colon my skin is softer a\nHormonal hair hairs do not grow back as fast and the hairs themselves have become softer and fine and my breasts are just starting to develop in my hips and bought or changing too\nYeah so I think the males on is on estrogen but he's still again as intact male genitalia which the women at the spa do not want to have to interact with but here you have\nA man a biological anatomical chromosomal man uh using this law to try and force women to touch just in a town actually is I think you've seen probably later on they complain his demands are that\nHe gets to select the ah the one of his choice to do this procedure to him if the owner herself won't do it\nAnd he said he says here they see that's the owner has damn near Mason she has taken my dignity from ... and has left me on whole\nRight I I she's left me on hold so what what's going to happen now now what is the one of the possible penalties against the uh ... if they're found guilty of a disorder may run against this a transgender\nI mean if if this if there were repeated violations like this let's say a he was turned away three times for three or four men were turned away it could be up to fifty thousand dollars or a year in jail but these are pretty extreme penalties\nYear in jail\nIs there because this is this is built on existing civil rights laws so they added to gender identity along with you know race sex religion and things like that so they're very stringent penalties and the same would be true if I as a father if I'm waiting at the local Y. for my ... year old daughter to come out of the\nLocker room 'cause she's changing over after swim lessons and I see a guy start to go into the women's locker room and I say excuse me starting an aged away from it to my daughter comes out\nI Would be in violation than just the same way\nAnd could face those kind of penalties were speaking most people don't know\nWe're speaking the Andrew back with from the Massachusetts family Institute which is a pushing this vote no one question three which would repeal this law ... so ... well before this law was passed two years ago would would would this guy had been able to ah to complain a and get the attention of the attorney general\nNo he wouldn't I mean this is that this fall as a public accommodation and you you did have people filing successfully claims for gender identity discrimination or under sex discrimination that was included under our state\nHuman rights commission masters Michigan's discrimination they have that same ... vomiting restoration did that gender identity and put under sex discrimination bought under Massachusetts law it is not a lawful sex discrimination to treat men and women differently in certain circumstances like bathroom slaughter and showers and I would assume Brazilian waxes\nSo you would not be able to do this but the vast majority of ... of\nUm examples that you hear from the other side from the U.S on three campaign have already been covered under Massachusetts law for years\nAnd what's interesting about this case is that the attorney who helped this man filed a claim is the co chair of the yes on three campaign Mason done\nSo they know exactly what this law does and they want to do that they want to use this law to force women to touch men's genitals because in their mind that man is on identifies as is a woman because of his identity\nSo why people want to learn more about the question three and your organization where should they go\nSure of it a website called keep em a safe dot ORG keep em a safe dot org and we've got all kinds of examples their people say that there haven't been any problems with this law there's all\nKinds of examples on the website of men abusing access to women's private space is to take advantage of those when you were trying to stop is this the most egregious\nExample of what's going on under the law [noise]\nIt's definitely the it's one that I didn't even anticipate and I've been working on this issue for years now and I did not see this coming which means who knows what else is coming if this law repealed\nAll right so the vote is uh the voters November sex that is it's the statewide vote and I I I see that that they're claiming that they're way ahead the yes people are way ahead but I Do think that's true\nNo I mean if you look at the question for that it it just asked people if they want to remove antidiscrimination laws\nAnd all I see okay\nSo but when you asked actually tell people what the law does that involves men gaining access to women you know private space is a those numbers change very quickly\nAll righty a Andrew back with a mask family Institute a thank you for being with us and thanks for explaining this and like I said usually I'd say we are going to post
