rape there was a really stupid word to use that are really I mean I I Know that can leave your PC on this one well\nI I hate when people use the word except for an actual mean\nIt's well I mean there there is there ... there was an archaic meaning if you look up the dictionary archaic meaning old fashioned like rape and pillage rape and pillage the rape of say binds that means carrying off the say by women\nBut it's but the the the meaning now is sexually violated and he didn't say they sexually violated us he said they raped us\nYeah I I Know I Know we ended up and that's the I just I just don't know why you're you're dealt with a hundred percent on his side I mean ... can be avoided a headache if you just used a different word OK but to suspend him and take away money for men for this well he he is a pretty rotten\nOh well yeah OK so this is work hiring was not worthy environment you sucks I'm just I I well I'm not saying I don't\nThink he should be suspended for the one game but

it's got a I mean as long as his first name is Richard we might as well make it illiterate right Ben main deck I daresay the next time but the president mentions a senator Blumenthal he will he will added his remarks and make him the name\nThat and every reporter and the press corps will go by is he's calling him denying deck [laughter] that'll though he is that it is that is that racist\n[laughter] yeah you know and and again I think I think Trump should also point out to ... and you know he ... he just keeps saying you know they they finally had to admit it's fun day\nIt was so bad this lying and ... and it was so widespread he did it everywhere he went in Connecticut talking about coming back to from Vietnam and being spat upon\nThat finally he was called out by the New York times the New York bleeping times\nThat's that's how bad does it have to be for the New York times to call somebody out\nAnyway aid for four or five hundred forty to forty two for one three says it's time for the FBI to reopen the Hillary investigation yeah that'll be the day remembered Trump's Trump said I decided to move on it wasn't good for the country may maybe he should reconsider that as well\nBut anyway this this is really outrageous what's going on now with a Brett Kavanaugh I mean it you know once he's on the court\nIf he gets on the court I I Hope he gets on the court I'm not sure even now but once he gets on the court or if he gets on the court this will seem more like a\nLike a botched joke by the Democrats it's just so outrageous what's going on here they it's it's like the Russia investigation okay everybody knows I busted joke\n[laughter] the\nThe Russia investigation what was the last time they actually mentioned Russia it's been a long time hasn't it I'm not even sure what the may major allegations talking points et cetera are in the Russian investigation anymore and even though the Brett Kavanaugh\nSo called investigation is only been going on for a month or a couple of months I mean they've already moved away from the initial allegations again where I mean we're not talking seriously anymore\nAbout attacks on a on\nChristine Blasey Ford or any other woman now the allegation is\nHe's a he's a heavier drinkers then he said that he didn't actually he should be brought up on charges of lying under oath to the Senate Judiciary committee because he said he liked the beer when actually he loves beer\nAnd eat a little eddies any is not a guy he he he doesn't just get sleepy when he drinks he fought he passes out you'll notice he said he got sleeping when he drank main again\nYou know human beings right that's the that's the the effect of alcohol a depressant on a human being\nIn the ... you get sleepy you fall asleep eventually if you drink enough\nEven Ted Kennedy even Ted Kennedy\nThat's why he needed to do other things other than great so that he could stay awake to drink\nMore what Ted Kennedy would think about this ongoing attempt to to have prohibition of straws wouldn't require him to have new new ... new twenty dollar bills in his possession at all times anyway\nThis is how outrageous it got though this this weekend the u._s._a. today never great newspaper\nBut it was it was somewhat respectable and it's a day now which is as bad as the New York daily news I mean that there's not even the ... there's never the New York times as bad as it is might occasionally break a story\nThe the Washington Post that good work on the ... a rape case back in the day\nBut what is USA Today ever done\nIn terms of any\nKind of journalism mean breaking stole it important news stories it's never done anything\nIt just comes to your when your when you were to marry a hotel or Hyatt hotel on a business trip you wake up in the morning and you go outside to go down to the continental breakfast and your trip over the paper that has been left for free outside your door that's that's USA Today\nThan it used to be that they had later scores than the national newspapers but that does it but now that you have a cell phone\n... what does it matter if they have later scores of the if they have the west coast games in the in the final additions and I don't even think they have the I don't even think they have all all of us have the final a final west coast games or the Monday Night football score\nBut anyway over the weekend they have a they have a sports columnist named Eric Brady that's Eric with a K this is what he wrote\nI mean the how low can these people go I Want you to think about this before I read this to you\nThe U.S Senate may yet confirm Kavanaugh to the Supreme Court but he should stay off basketball courts for now when kids are around the nation is deeply divided sometimes would feel I feel like we don't agree on anything anymore\nBut credibly accused sex offenders should not coach youth basketball girls or boys without deeper investigation can't we all agree on that\nHow how twisted you have to be the right that and and and how how the brave new his editors have to be to let that Ron credibly accused\nThere's there's there's no one supporting any of these stories\n\nBut the Yale expose exposure story the New York times wouldn't touch that story they said they couldn't they they interviewed dozens of people no one no one back that up the gang rape story that was put out by the creepy born lawyer that's even more preposterous\nThis is Mollie Hemingway and the federal is the article which was illustrated with a picture of Kavanaugh and one of the girls basketball team see coaches has since been dramatically revised\nApparently editors at USA Today belatedly realize the calling a human being a pedophile with perhaps precisely zero actual evidence of any sexual propriety was indefensible\nBut this is what this is what they're up against you you know\nRussia said this before and I think he's right but the the sports media is even more detached from reality than the the political press corps\nYou know at least a few not an effort declining percentage of people on in the uh Washington press corps have actually covered the real world you know they've actually\nBeen outside the beltway but the sports media it's it's all jocks ... and ah and licks settling and a sucking up the athletes and ah ended and they they want to be PC they want\nThey want to do you think what Brian James is impressed with this yeah I I don't something tells me he's not\nWho who maybe Colin Kaepernick but as we as we now know I mean what is the ... Smith said he doesn't even think Colin Kaepernick wants to come back to football anymore 'cause you're making too much money as a spokesman for Nike\nWho's who's impressed with this credibly accused he calls Brett Kavanaugh credibly accused sex offender\nWhat do you have to do to get to get Sean by\nBy respectable people and if either credible accusations and what are incredible accusations\nYeah ...
