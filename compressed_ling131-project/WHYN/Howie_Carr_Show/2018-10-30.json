aliens but children a burst tourists and\nAnyone born on our soil and I think it's a great idea to get this going create a case of course you know if he writes an executive order on this there's going to be\nImmediate lawsuit right and then it'll go before the court and they can decide\nShould just like there was a ... maybe a lawsuit on the ... of these so called the Muslim ban which were really wasn't a Muslim ban but the you know ultimately I didn't take all that long for the Supreme Court to uphold a uphold his right to to issue that travel ban right\nThat's exactly right and and so now instead you know we can all get off in a bar stools and make legal arguments instead of just you know arguing about it and it's a real problem\nMore than three hundred thousand babies born to illegal aliens in our country every year and there are tens of thousands of birth tourism\nCitizenship created all the time these people they go back to their countries they you know they they're kids may or may not ever come to live in the United states they may join ISIS\nThey may uh you know come here for school and then they have kids who maybe have no ties to the United states plus as you mentioned in the ticket to qualifying for welfare\nIn the United states if you're illegal alien parents you have a kid here all of a sudden your kid get Medicaid you get public housing money get access to food stamps and all kinds of\nYou know I I remember a program I remember\nReading about this uh you know thirty thirty five years ago they were saying that you know a ... women are teenagers we get pregnant in Mexico and then they would somehow get across the border into Texas when there were eight or eight and a half months pregnant give birth to a kid and then they'd never have to work together day in their lives that they'd be all set up with this\nAnd I thought it was just the you know a handful of people doing this for like you say it's it's not a handful it's hundreds of thousands a year\nOr doing this tell us about a birth Torah some you know again a lot of people don't don't read the newspapers as carefully as they used to they may not know about this uh this amazing scammed but it's going on with ah people flying into the country to give birth\nYes at the big thing with a Chinese with Russians Turks\nLebanese Koreans are they there are businesses set up to ... where women have to come here for a couple of months have a baby\nThey ... they stay long enough for the state department to process their babies passport application and then they go home with a U.S citizen child and\nThat child can come back anytime\nAnd go to school here or you know live here and sponsor the parents for ... for a green card and ultimately citizenship later in life not all of them do come back what many people don't realize is if if they never come back\nThat birth tourism baby get to pass on US citizenship to their kids\nAnd then we're responsible for the citizens overseas I had a friend who was a consular officer in Lebanon and said you would not believe all the people here who carry us passport\nAnd they're pretty sketchy involved in you know terrorist organizations and so on they don't love America they just want the court and there was this case recently in uh queens about this\nSimply say will still get the help you need\nSure maybe it's overkill maybe you don't need to be ready for every worst case scenario but that's what makes simply safe home security system so great it is always ready simply say could cost an arm and a leg but it doesn't instead they only charge you what's fair twenty four seven professional security monitoring is just fourteen Ninety nine a month\nThere are no contracts in hidden fees I recommend simply safe to

I forget his name ah he would come in with Lyme poor lime on the body to to ah ... you know make the a flush the ... the generate very quickly\nAnd then they would have ah Kevin Weeks digging a hole to put a man it was an assembly line Michelle\nI end up and down the right and so they're so believe me I don't think anyone shutting any tangible Whitey Bulger's that but I think the bigger question cats one that ran Shay brought up to me today as luck would dare think Whitey Bolger was saying the wrong things about the wrong people\nI mean Tom on ... how is it that this guy gets moved and he should be in the administrative process of being you know logged into this new president and suddenly and Gen pop and no one sees it when three big\n... ah cons we'll knowledge and the only place that doesn't have cameras and the whole gal pop area I mean none of this make that\nWas in ... passed away from the ... minute he went to prison\nI I heard he was in a solitary down and Sumpter bill a ... a Florida since March\nIsn't that because he was looking up at the female nurse well and that started um\nYeah well they they moved him they moved him from from Tucson I think he was having such ... with a counselor or a psychologist I I was never really clear on what he was doing with her you know but the but anyway you know who these people who are these three cons I mean was it just doesn't seem like a law that arms\nBut I think I I Know none of those confirmed and and I think you know the people obviously the FBI launch investigation but I think it's worth noting I think you and I note that did you see who got tend to have a pen shortly after his conviction alongside Cadillac Frank climate this year\nWho the Luca all we'd it\nOh Paul ... okay Paul ... was the uh\nHe was he's sixty three he's a he's a carpenter something up in Burlington he was the one who assisted a Cadillac break so let me son Frank junior in er in murdering ah ah the sorrow the a nightclub owner whose whose body was buried down in Providence we ... we\n... we didn't get there but what what what do you think well\nInto things I Know that Cadillac bank who we know is enough to hang on it but who got brought up on these murder charges as co defendant Polytech a Cadillac spanking and\nAnd Whitey there's no love lost ... with dementia on the stand you can't point out who Cadillac Frank is I mean you think even the aging FBI rats are all like now they're all going to get revenge on each other\nWell and you know the thing is a ... a woman who was Whitey Bulger's partner and that's the that's the guy who was the boyfriend of the two young women the twenty six year old woman that Whitey strangled a ... was the main witness against Cadillac Frank and Paul ...\nAnd so All right so ... so you say ... is in the prison and now\nNow leading hurting her to do with it I don't have that I Know they don't interesting to note it\nBut now the partner of the main witness against ... has been beaten to death in the prison so I mean we don't have any conclusions that those are fat\n[laughter] though the facts [laughter] so the fact so Cadillac fans ... murder committed by Frankie junior we believe a gets happens to be in the exact same prison where the fed thought it would be a good idea to transfer Whitey\nYeah and and as I said ... is a mere sixty three years old in in ... in my arms to me that makes him that kid you know he's the he's\nThe leader who who dug plenty that nice guy that was the nickname that no one had ever before yeah yeah until the ... trial\nYeah exactly that was a that was that was the same then by the way for those of you who not they're not uh that uh conversing with this mob stuff uh the the best thing that the Cadillac Frank's lawyer rusty boozing did was he cuts the for me Whitey Bulger's partners to admit that he was involved in\nUpwards of fifty to sixty murders fifty to sixty\nSo corrupt this is a ... it's pretty amazing ... and why the\nWay it is amazing why now you know let's end with this is exactly how why did bother should have gone out it is it seems that a lot of money now we don't have to keep them alive on life support in federal prison yeah\nIt is this is what he always feared was that he would be ah he he would be a discovered is a rat and\nAnd he wouldn't be whacked out by his uh his gang land associates and uh you know what's better late than never in my opinion\nOn what you want an hour an hour ago and I mean this is a guy who deserved exactly what he got the only thing that would have been better if they go Jody guy then is key to get justice for Deborah hot the and I'm Steve existed Deborah Davis\nAnd ... and ... and Billy Johnson and but the two ... that he killed who by the way it happened to be brothers in law of of his girlfriend Catherine Greg how weird is that you know uh\nAnd then Brian ... who is just some milk but wanted to get out of some trouble and uh they ... you know the corrupt candler gave him up and then like Donahue died and the results I mean that's the body up the body the body and these people right away to get it I got out I think it's a gesture award and\nPeople like a ... beret I mean Bucky bird was beaten to death is just a burglar they just want to steal some money from him and his sons end up killing themselves\nYou know I mean the the the the death toll every ... goes down beyond the people they actually killed two generations of of people's lives destroyed devastated by you know losing they're losing their\nRelatives male and female alike\nAnd and this and and I was about all the White House\nWhile everybody goes to this hour letter that's still haunt me I didn't get entered into evidence but about how she did is our own new that guy like within a whack 'em and I wrote a letter to his ...\nYeah and that's about all the time I mean that guy turned into he he talked about how we became you know it was very problematic and it's like you said the collateral damage as an Olympic right there\nIn the sorrow at one of the sorrow sons was was killed the on one twenty eight right after a ... right after they found the body or right before they found the body when they were looking for it\nRead it's just it's just horrible what he did and and the drugs and all in all the young women that he raped and the and probably young boys to me he was just that he was a monster a monster\nHe was a ... he really was a monster and the fact that he was protected all that time it's almost wink wink nod nod at least if I didn't go on protecting the Savage whole rent is you know evil and your name\nRight right you know they know if they look the other way does anyone really care if they're going to be questions raised\nI I I I ... I don't think you are I don't I don't see any I don't see anybody posting on the Internet she felt say Whitey hey we're not we're going to get to the bottom of this I think we've got\nNo no no [laughter]\nBut ... ... feet congratulations on breaking a big story today about the Whitey Bulger's murder in the federal prison in West Virginia thanks for being with us from our car\nWas going to\nHave you noticed your parents are becoming hard of hearing and saying what did you say go to hearing held dot\nCom and used for Motown way to get ... a registered hearing aids for Seventy five dollars down in ... dollars a month or the hearing how\nHis name is Jeff deal and he's running for US Senate\nHis goals the same as yours seeds Elizabeth Warren\nJeffs real a proven track record of saving hardworking families here in Massachusetts money like defeating the two billion dollar gas tax I met Jeff deal is the only candidate Democrat or Republican to fight against sanctuary city he supports building the wall\nAnd proudly stand with her I say to defend the border and the rule of law just deal is the only candidate indoors Massachusetts law enforcement Elizabeth Warren on the other hand\nHolds a law enforcement racist and seems more concerned with running for president instead of getting anything done for us if we're going to defeat Elizabeth Warren leading real on Tuesday November sick\nAnd so uh and and so a slide in total that pat says to Kevin White the mayor ... says what's the source of a belly Bulger's power at the state house the Senate president Kevin White looks at a ... look at you like when you asked a stupid question\nI think he goes with the shores sheepish power my brother threatened to kill you Chris you shouldn't be nothing but nice that me was that\nYes the yes Bob Crane one time the same question the state treasurer Bob Crane was a friend I I wouldn't tell the story except cranes that ... like to be friendly with Billy Bolger\nCraig get he said what's the source of his power to get crushed light and I had Bob ... looked at Chris lied and said what's the source of his power he takes his uh takes his hand and puts his finger to his head and then with his middle finger pulls the trigger just that's the source of this power what do you think the source of his power is\nAnd this is a this this is what's this was the end\nOf an era I mean the theory and that in many ways you know when he went on the lam and then when he was when we picked up in Santa Monica in two thousand eleven when he was convicted in two thousand Thirteen but this is really the uh this is really the end of an era\nAnd um you know what I again I I I'm not that I'm not going to pretend that you know that the astronaut\nFor whom the bell tolls at pulse for all of us you know I'm happy about this I'm Glad he's that he he wanted to kill me he wanted to why he wanted him to in various ways he wanted to kill trooper John said he wanted to kill Chris lied they want to kill step all ranks did kill ...

H. Y. N. [noise]\nLive from them Matthews brothers [noise]\nBack to the highly car show everybody this is Steve Roberts and now he's executive producer filling in for him he's\nHe's he's taken a slide on his own show to go beyond Fox News and and try and sell some books as it's the most highly thing ever to leave your show for another [laughter] but he's pretty much been doing it all day during the commercial breaks she's been flipping out into the hallways to do interviews with the various TV personalities and you know his\nHis daughter texted me earlier and said hey can you can you tell me what TV programs how he's going to be on today\nSo I can watch them and I said uh all of them are so if you're if you're looking to have a little bit more highly car and your life tuned in to Fox News' Martha my column today at seven thirty seven thirty five around that area he'll be talking about the ... the late James Whitey Bolger\nAnd I know we've been talking about him all day and if you want to call in and you want to you know ... take a a victory dance so uh over the dead da da da da da Silva ... for four or five hundred and forty to forty two\nBut I wanted to touch on a piece that you know this is this is I think a a feel good piece a that will give him and maybe a little bit of hope for the Democratic republic we have here and this is a New Yorker magazine\nAnd it's called twelve young people on why they probably won't vote and it's just about one of the funniest things that I've read all day and it\nAh I have to say a number of these people are from Massachusetts but that should not be a surprise that some of these confused young people who don't know whether or not they're going to vote this year for Massachusetts but so they they in their own words are described to this a New Yorker journalist or I guess there's a couple of them why they're not voting and I just wanted to read a little bit of these and again this is a\nA young people speaking with the New Yorker magazine about why they're probably not going to vote and you know if we'd had more time to repair this grace the sort of an excellent masterpiece theater how we might have to have you read a couple of these uh after the break\nNow but this is Samantha age twenty two from old bridge New Jersey she was voted in twenty sixteen\n[noise] going into the election I was so proud to be in this country at this moment so proud to be voting for Hillary Clinton I had my Clinton sweat shirt on all day I was on Twitter telling people that if they didn't go vote they were dead to me like the whole thing my faith in the whole system was crushed pretty quickly\nBut there's still a lot of powerful people especially in the Democratic party that are centrists and that's just a little frustrating when it comes time to stand up to this president and the policies he's trying to pass like the Kavanaugh saying I get that there's a minority and that it was an uphill battle but I just feel like there wasn't any big in a fight put up to that\nAs a as Samantha age twenty two old brand new Jersey She feels like there are too many centrists and the Democrat Party really where all of a centrist and the Democrat Party because I haven't found them and they didn't put up a tough enough fight against Kavanaugh\nI mean they had Michael I cook up gang rape allegations they they were they were submitting into the Senate record an allegation from Julie sweat neck\nThat he he was running train frequently on like ten occasions that's not fighting hard enough Samantha what else should they have done should they have like physically physically ill Brett Kavanaugh 'cause that's just about the next step that's a that's the next step that they could have taken to prevent them from being on the Supreme Court\nAh and then she goes on full disclosure I have a ballot sitting at home and twenty sixteen I voted absentee and I just marked off send me a a mail in ballot for every election I don't really get that argument that it's really hard like it's not that hard\nShe's still a a uncertain whether or not she's going to vote or the next one is\nA wreath age twenty three from Hudson, Ohio has never voted twenty three years old has never voted I'm not sure whether race is a guy name or a girl named\nUh he says he says she says I never felt certain enough to vote but I'm a political science student and the talk of voting is really big in my circle of friends in twenty sixteen I almost did of course\nI'm not a big fan of Trump but I didn't know if Trump was going to be a flash in the pan or I just didn't know what to do I didn't want to help something that might end up being wrong\nSo it's a very good portrait of a millennial voters just completely wracked with indecision and again this is the reason why I say this is the feel good story of the day is because these people probably aren't voting\nAnd you know I'm of a mind that the fewer people we have voting the better off we all are especially these idiots like what MTV comes out and does this rock the vote campaign like I don't want the lowest common denominator voting like just like\nTen or Fifteen Percent of the country was voting I feel like it would be a lot better off but I Know that that would be like an elitist attitude but you know I don't care it's true\nOr so this again is ... I was particularly interested in voting and twenty sixteen because Donald Trump is so stupid it drove me up a wall he knew way less about government that I Do\nThis is the this is the twenty three year old ... student who's never voted before says he he knows a lot more about government than the current president United States he goes on\nI have ADHD it makes it hard for me to do certain tasks or the payoff is far off in the future abstract I don't find it intrinsically motivational the amount of work logically isn't that much filled form mail it go to a specific place on a specific day but those kinds of tasks can be hard for me to do if I'm not enthusiastic about it\nThat's kind of a problem with social attitudes around you know it's your civic duty to vote\nI once told a co worker I didn't vote and she said that's really irresponsible in this judgmental voice you can't build policy around calling people irresponsible you need to make people enthusiastic and engaged I mean you can tell he has ADHD definitely not lying about that he just jumped around in his explanation judgmental co workers are going to make them vote and\nHe goes on the motivation is about the actual value my vote has it's more like a theoretical signaling value if that's the case I Would rather signal that Democrats should have more progressive candidates rather than assuming that everyone in the left will automatically vote for the candidates Iran\nSo [laughter] this guy a racist sending a message to the Democrat Party that they need to be more progressive by a not voting for Democrats ... let me let me know that turns out raise", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Howie Carr Show", "city": "Springfield", "day": "30"}
