hundred seven three six three three three\nAnd you have to use or they don't use Native American DNA to check against that they use ... billion Colombian and Mexican\n... I liked the Peruvian part because remember George Zimmerman the guy who shot Trayvon Martin he was ... his mother was Peruvian and as far as the mainstream media was concerned he was a hunky he was a crack up\nHe was missed the trolley he was the man\nSo now though they're using this uh this uh Columbia and Peruvian Mexican a DNA because they say there's not enough but the the the bottom line here is that under bureau of Indian affairs standard she couldn't get a card\nRight that's a that's a federal regulation under the bylaws of all the Indian nations that she claims to be a a ... be a member of our claims to be a a tribesmen up or whatever you call it she she's not and indeed\nShe's a white woman\nAnd Harvard University describes her in Nineteen Ninety seven when they were trying to wiggle out from under some discrimination or allegations they described her as a woman of color is she is is she a woman\nOf color no she's not a woman of color air go she's a fake Andy\nAnd you know you want to talk about it we're not going to be talking about a much today I was planning to earlier but we'll get to it later in the wake it's going to go on for a while this is the day of the opening arguments or the ... I don't know if it's jury selection are opening arguments in the Harvard University case the Asian students against the Harvard University case\nAnd they're they're accusing Harvard of ah the endemic racism in ah in passing over a\nQualified Asian Americans and the admissions process to\nTo admit less qualified blacks and Hispanics\nAnd of course this has been going on for a hundred years a hundred years ago it was a juice that were being passed over now it's Asian Americans but it's the same it's the same game and so now now we have this this other a racist scheme that was going on to to uh\nTo to uh identify Elizabeth Warren as a as a woman of color and so they're so but you know this is not\nFor you and me this is not for people who follow\nThe news and who have jobs this is for the red journalists Democrats operatives with press passes\nIn the major media that's who this is for so they can say well there is this study and then they'll never they'll never mentioned that the study proves that she's not in India there there is a study that's all that matters so\nSo ... this is good but what's in the studies is going down the ... into the black hole of memory\nAnd I actually the the globe has been trying to rehabilitate her uh her her phoney baloney or ethnic heritage now for well they they did it from day one remember when the six years ago the New England historical and Jeannie a logical society was asked to check her out\nAnd they said they could find no evidence of any ... any ah Native American heritage in her background and\nSo the globe just pretend that but the society had found out that there was they just kept report it they they ... society said there is no evidence the globe reporter for two or three weeks that they had discovered evidence is that because that's that's the way the globe operates\nI mean she is in the Senate seat once held by Ted Kennedy and every six year\nAt this time it would be running stories Senator Kennedy turning his life around Senator Kennedy is ... drink Senator Kennedy's on time this is the same thing it's just a different listen with war has taken the test\nThis with Warren his part Indian okay one one thousand twelve Indian but she's part Indian she's not telling a lie\nHow about you releases or DNA how can we how much he tells us where the past was taken\nHow much it takes a real uh a test like your meat thing I've taken my best you know I told you what what's at my desk fifty three percent Irish forty seven percent English he got I got the results my heritage DNA that's where it came from\nWhy why is this a big secret but uh you know who conducted this past\nNine seven eight as this she she never said she was one hundred percent Indian she said that her mom was so obviously Native American that are racist paternal grandparents wouldn't allow them to marry that is going to be like at least fifty percent\nRight and that was that was all be asked to\nThat was I mean all this stuff is six years old I mean you may have forgotten that I I was involved in the the whole an ... of her for ... that the city but what happened was was the depression Oklahoma the dust bowl\nSo there was no money\nSo she ... her parents want to get married so they got but they got no do\nSo they get in their flavor or their Model T whatever was and they they drive over to the next town to the biggest Protestant Church in the town and they get married on a Saturday afternoon then they drive back to the town they live in Lakewood hadn't five ten miles away\nAnd they have a reception that night now does that sound to you like in a low but now\nBoston Globe is finally issued a second correction to the story a correction due to a mass air a story about Elizabeth Warren misstated the ancestry percentage of a potential six intense generation relative the generational range based on the ancestor that the ...\nIdentified suggest she's between one sixty fourth in one one thousand and twenty four Native American\nI mean I just was telling you that before the correction I mean Breitbart been run with that for hours at because you know I get I'm no I'm no math genius I'm no whiz I'll tell you that but I could do basic math\nBecause I'm not trying to lie to ya like the Boston Globe where you put that out for me what's the ... give me the first correction and the second correction I'm going to put both of them in my column for the Morrow\n[laughter]\nOne sixty four percent ... excuse me one one sixty fourth that's the that's the high end spectrum the average\nAmerican according

continue with his offer because she's got a pool that she has a good heavy percentage of of India then\nNo so this is this is the fake news media said that he made the offer if you look at the full contact somebody at the rally to his campaigning against it would be so easy here's what I Would do and he runs through like a potential ... that offer you never made the offer\nRight but even if he if he made the offer Jim this proves to me again she's not in India\nBut highly highly I remember six seven years ago whatever when she said poppy whoever\nPop up when he said it went\nTo the other community and then you know because they didn't believe in an interracial type a marriage is whatever you want to call this right you know so it's\nIt's like it should only like three steps away grand

had the documents from the University of Pennsylvania where she changed her racial\nRacial classification from white two woman to see color whatever the hell what ... what the hell is color main by the way\nIt for four or five hundred and forty two forty to hear about this\nDuring an interview with the globe published last month Warren explained that she identified herself as Native American in the late eighties and early nineties as many of the matriarch of her family were dying and she began to feel that her family stories of history will be some salt if my when my\nI think of an attorney

way why [noise]\nLive from them Matthews brothers [noise]\nA poor for five hundred forty to forty two\nSays this is great eight [laughter] [laughter] I I think\nTo legally claim Native American ancestry you got to be at least one one thirty one thirty second but I don't even think that works a you know you can legally claim it\nBut that doesn't mean you're going to get back to be I a card that doesn't mean you can be in the ... and the the\nTribal roles you know you're supposed to be honest I think what's called the laws list you don't have an ancestor of the dog was you're out it's it's a ... it's a closed club I mean you know and I got no problem with that said they they they were oppressed they they they lost their land\nBut I mean that's what makes it even more appalling and upward that she tried to commit this kind of ethnic fraud with no no basis in reality\nYeah it's it's also just so weird that\nShe would continue this\nAnd like Blumenthal is a liar but at least when Trump makes a jab at him and kind of died off afterwards because he's not like actually I was there at one point at some point you just have to say you know why I lied and own it and then and then ... then again it's not dead if you\nIf you're like little technically I didn't lie\nYeah I mean bookers not good Cory Booker is claiming there'd be Spartacus anymore but she basically went up today and said I'm drawn to mull let's let's get Jay from Chelsea he's on fire today\nBut it's true I Know and when you really think about it okay so she has maybe according to this guy whoever he is\nSome tiny tiny percentage does that mean that she should be ... because if that's the new standards and kids applying for school everyone to check off\nIt they're Hispanic or that they are black and you really can't get mad at them because Elizabeth Warren who is probably going to run for president did it oh she's running and the media to plotting her for it like you were so proud of her she is a tiny tiny tiny tiny percent Pocahontas no she's not\nSo I Want to see what I'm looking forward to seeing her FCC report I Want to see where the expenditure is paying for this test how much do you think they paid for the test\nI'm Wondering how they want more than we pay for our sins let me put it that well if the guy did it for free than he it's a kind of ... and supposedly he didn't know that he was testing Elizabeth Warren a spit\nRye right we believe that too mhm\nWhen she called them up she was so smart and proud of her south set of president Ali says ... my mother a liar but what you're saying she was telling the truth\nIs that yes there is absolutely chance that millions of years ago there was someone your family may may happen Native American maybe potentially\nAnd and oh by the way the woman the woman that they're linking linking him to is this woman uh they oversee Sara Smith Crawford now there is no evidence that she ever claim to be in a in a Native American and and oh by the way she married a guy\nBy the name of a William J Crawford do you know when William J Crawford's\nJob was it was the Tennessee militia you know what the tendency militia was into when the Eighteen thirties we're into what rounding up Cherokee and hurting them on the trail of tears up Oklahoma\nLast year she was really the child like among the UN to calculate\nIt's worse than that I mean it's like you know she was the child of a slave and a member of the Ku Klux Klan yeah according to her according to ...\nTestimony crazy max and her father's parents must have had such antennas up to know that the person their son was marrying had such distant maybe Native American like what did they maybe\nJust like to point it was like one five hundred well yeah so the SOS boy I mean you talk about the you know they're talking about gay Darby that was what do these people had Indians are yeah\nThey could they could spot it man\nIf it's a lot of from mile away and I think so boy and the big picture thing was even without the Indian thing she still alluded to communist\nYeah being fought I Can't believe she even brought it up it's so bizarre and and speaking of um Native American the song half breed I have decided that I Will be share for Halloween\nThat the results are in my results are in and I'm going to be here so that's that and speaking of myself\nI'm thirty nine percent much older than you know the the song would have been nearly as good if it was\nOne for Britain to hate the word I don't think that's one would have made the top forty nobody\nWanted to be around because I was one one thousand ever percentage Native American maybe they could see it on my face kind of sort of ...\nYeah you just ... she's Peruvian or Colombian or ... so you need to start going or send you reach affected\nIt so I prefer Elizabeth though\nBut really though I mean compared to her I Am so west Asian it's crazy like I I should be the head of ... three percent ... point nine percent I'm ... how many times did that hurt so\nBad like one one one one twenty fifth one ... ... yeah I'm as opposed to one one thousand twenty fourth\nI'm a real woman of color and not that we can you know we're we're not comparing it on the totem pole but I'm just saying that technically I Am very much west Asian and I carry a proudly and I'm going to start checking boxes left and right\nHave you submitted any recipes to west Asian cookbooks\nAnd no but I'm going to um in other news just briefly and then we can get back to some of the cuts of Elizabeth Warren um I Know this is going to be if such interest you got ...\nNo such a thing about the marvel and do nothing\n'em but also that means her dad is gonna be a grandfather so he's going to be all over the news again a gag me with a spin who's the father\nDoes or does that move him up on the ah on on the waiting list for a new liver [laughter]\nOh how we got dark\nUm but that's OK so this is Elizabeth Warren thing obviously took up a lot of the news cycle today just took over\nBut there was a lot of fake news this weekend and I think I'm going to judge these quickly so that throughout the show you might forget you can address and now NBC issues correction after Trump's Robert elite comment this was a big one is actually got a lot of coverage mostly because it was so taken out of\nOr is Elizabeth Warren up there with them now\nI Know Spartacus isn't at five percent which is extremely low but I think\nJoe Biden is number one believe it or not a thirty three percent so you have Joe Biden who claimed to be a Welsh coal miner\nIs going to be debating a guy who claims to be a a a gladiator from ancient times ... and they're going to be debating someone who's still claiming to be a fake Andy yeah\nModerated by a guy who claimed he saw dead bodies floating by when he was ... hopefully I mean if we really just want to make a full circle\nFor four five hundred forty to forty two I'm highway car\nDo drugs but we'll be back after this\nHave you noticed your parents are becoming hard of hearing and saying what did you say go to your health\nCollege football\nRead by the\nWay while yes [noise]\n\nThis is Jay and hang on

Oh yes\nYou have to have to be in that yeah yeah and it's just like the other part of it is that when they run because all these it's not so much like Donald Trump where\nYou're running because you think you could do a good job they all just want to be president really badly like Spartacus you can see it and those eyes every time you\nVideos I've selected and you can read my daily blog it's All right they're just waiting for you to click at W. H. Y. N. dot com use radio five six years\nFly in and nobody which way and if she Springfield\nBut the big story today is that Elizabeth Warren has released what she claims is ... DNA tests and she's claiming\nThat it it proves that she's a Native American in reality a claim she's it proves that she's not a Native American so the the fake news Boston Globe a you know they were the\nI mean they just have so many fake news stories in the past I Can't even I don't have time to even lay it all out for you but\nJust lay out of my article Jason Blair Patricia Smith Kevin ... those are a few of their fake news reporters columnist over the years people that have been busted for uh making stuff up\nThey are they they made up stories about the ... they said us soldiers raping women in Iraq during the first Gulf War turned out it was a porn movie\nStill they said Ted Kennedy was turning his life around over and over again that turn out to be a lot I mean it just goes it it it never ends so today they put out a story Elizabeth Warren has\nNew evidence proving that she's one between one thirty second and won five hundred and twelve\n... Native American and then you're you read down into the story they didn't they they ... they included in anyone who has it Mexican Mexican DNA Peruvian DNA Colombian DNA\nSo in other words for ... Native American it it it could be Hispanic so her name but she she can change your name from Elizabeth\nWarren to Elizabethan war like the a bust out the Texas Senate candidate was pretending she's pretending to be an Indian and he's pretending to be Hispanic\nSo my question is if you were one sixty fourth Asian is that enough for Harvard to discriminate against you\nRight I Will but anyway listen so here it is so so then I buy like an hour after they post the story they say a correction um the range isn't from one thirty second to five hundred won five hundred and twelve debts from one thirty second to one one thousand and twenty four\nAnd so again I'm not a I'm I'm not very good at math but I said to myself well if the if the upper range is faults that does it the ... range have to be false to I mean it's not like basic\nBut the you know so we used to I we started refer to it as one sixty fourth and Breitbart News started referring to what his one sixty fourth but the globe kept running with it because\nThey want to allow all the moon bats that put their Facebook page postings up saying that it's one third but she's she's got evidence such as it is claiming that she's one thirty second\nBut it was false so finally about a half hour ago they posted a second correction saying but at at most she is one\nSixty fourth India\nOr native America or non white and of course here's the thing the average\nWhite America and the average American of European descent has more Native American blood than she apparently but she's claiming to be an indie\nAnd she's claiming that she has a right to uh to have forgotten and affirmative action position first at the University of Pennsylvania and then at Harvard University law school\nAnd of course we have powwow child or cook\nWhat the one fifty five Elizabeth Warren she's a member of she's a Cherokee according to this was\nThe Cherokee and her uh her her she's got several recipes that here they're all lifted from various places my favorite is called on what with crab meat which lifted from New York Times spreads cookbook\nAll right uh\nYou know this is this is just such a such a crock ... and it's so classic of the Democratic party and the mainstream media the print fake news and then correct the fake those after the uh after\nThe lives have gone around the world and are are already posted and so tonight I guarantee you if you go to the usual left wing cable news cast they will still be repeating ally\nWhich is already a been retracted by the uh additional fake news outlets reported the Boston Globe that she's one thirty second India but you know what it doesn't even matter if she's one thirty second Indian ... good enough to claim to be an Indian\nWhether it's a bureau of Indian affairs standards whether it's the tribal role she she claims she's part Cherokee part Delaware that's not good enough she's my in India\nIf they if they were printing truthful headlines in the in the top left media the headline would say white woman's DNA test proves she's white woman\nFor DNA tests confirm Elizabeth Warren they it's a fake ending 'cause that's what she is she's a fake India\nDidn't the ... some a text there says didn't the Cherokee Nation state that done her ancestry and could not find any connection yes of course yeah she's a she's a fraud she's a fraud and now they're saying but the oh she's she's proven that she's in ...\nShe she's proven she's proven she's ... and we don't even know where this DNA test was done\nShe gave it to some uh Stanford University professor who's a a I guess he's a biochemist he's not even a geneticist these of I think a biophysicist\nAnd ... they let him do the analysis the quote unquote analysis of the DNA and he's at USC given her this ah
