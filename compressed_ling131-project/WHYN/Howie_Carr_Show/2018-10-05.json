you how many of you have ever made up your mind on who to vote for based on a TV ad\nI never have\nNow I don't watch local TV that much but I Know that I Am not\nA good example of a cross section of the country a lot of people watch local TV and as such are inundated with political ads and we keep hearing people are tired of them but they keep running them because of the political consultants believed that they work\nBut this is an area where I don't have a lot in common with with the people in this regard and it\nIt leads to being a constant frustration for me I Am never influenced by the money spent on the campaign particularly campaign ads it and that doesn't affect me I Know who I'm going to vote for before I see an ad and there's not an ad in the world that's going to make me change my mind\n\nBut I have to keep in mind how rare that is most people watch local TV they can avoid all those ads and a lot of people are not immersed than this stuff like I Am and maybe you too and so they are influenced by these ads I have to keep reminding myself\nThat these ads and the the spending\nOf a voluminous amounts of money does matter\nI just I have a tough time I see how people who pay attention to things could even think about voting Democrat right now I I books I really mean it I think\nGiven what we've seen since Trump was elected a Democrat Party and the deep state deserve the biggest electoral landslide loss ever this country needs to rise up and reject these people\nI Know their voters are not going to reject them but\nI don't believe that the majority I think these people need to be skunk their behavior\nIs in terms of decency common decency these people must not be rewarded for what they're doing destroying people destroying institutions destroying concepts in our rule of law\nI shudder to think of them being rewarded for this stuff\nYou know it used to be you know the economy was great just by living through it but now you apparently have to be told that it's good\nYou have to be watching TV and then somebody on TV has to tell you the economy's good then you have to believe it\nWell I remember a time where when the economy was roaring along and people were doing well you didn't need to be told you know it\nBut now we got the Democratic party out there saying it's not a great economy tax cuts are ruining everything [noise]\nAnd some don't cost believe this stuff\n\nYou you reject what you're living and believe what you're being told by people [noise] so I just I Am I have yet to be influenced by a political ad now I realize I'm very firm in like convictions and I know what I Believe but there's not an ad in the world is going to change my mind\nAbout a candidate one other thing I get along the lines of what are the Democrats going to do if Kavanaugh gets confirmed I told you they're going to double down and they're going to keep harassing and they're not going to stop trying to get rid of this guy I have just a little bit of anecdotal evidence to back it up\nI have a tweet here actually to promote a woman who works at the nation\nShe is a ... journal is no she was she does there but the nation as a over left\nMagazine her tweet her name is Annie shields I'll go ahead and make her famous I Am starting a national at democratic socialist working group\nThe followed Jeff Flake around do every restaurant cafe store et cetera he goes to for the rest of his life and yell at them\nYou want to see the mob outside Susan Collins is office right now\nIn in a set of building were offices and then any shields as next week if people like flake knew that they would get yelled at for the rest of their lives maybe they would act right\nShe sounds like everybody's first ex wife\nIf they knew they would get yelled at for the rest of their lives and maybe they would act right these people are going to get hounded I think they're going to get out of no matter what they do if they're not Democrats they're going to get out of no matter what they do man up back after this\nMakes it easy [noise] August Russia only I\nDon't want to own a night\nMy friends there is a national mortgage company that's offering a better approach it's Americans financing your company of helpful mortgage consultants or salary base there not commission based and that's important because it allows your goals to always be first\nWith American financing it earned them an a plus rating with better Business Bureau and thousands of positive customer reviews if you're a homeowner your house is more than just the place you live it's an incredibly valuable financial assets\nNow you're like me acquired equities since by and you're home so why not use it\nRefinanced to excess cash for a whole remodeled project or spend less on interest when you're ready to refinance make the call to American financing the number's eight hundred seven nine five twelve ten that's eight hundred seven nine five twelve ten an\nAwfully collection\nWould be Jeff Merkley of\nWord sad time ... we had seen as far as health interest groups with ...\nInto a frenzy by spreading misrepresentation and outright\nFalsehoods about judge Kavanaugh's judicial record\nOver the top rhetoric and distortion up his record and testimony edits first scaring\nProduce short lived capitalized which also did buy two hours later continued to live on and be spread through social media\nInterest groups have fall has spent an unprecedented amount of dark money opposed in this nomination\nOur Supreme Court confirmation process has been steady decline for more than Thirty years one can only hope\nThat the cabin a nomination is where the press said pets finally hit\nAgainst this backdrop that ended up winning the Senate or to the side what the Constitution's to advice and consent duty name\nInformed by Alexander Hamilton federalist seventies that I have been ... the main learn to read another list forever scratching\nConsiderate nominees philosophy\nWhereas my duty yet says senator is to focus on that nominees qualifications as long as that nominees philosophy is within the main stream of judicial thought\nI have always supposed ... has spurred judicial nominees\nWith respect to their personal views or politics but I fully expect them to be able to put aside any and all personal preferences in deciding the case and say come before them\nI never considered the president's the density or hard and when the value waiting Supreme Court nomination as the result\nI voted in favor of justices Roberts and Alito Hoover nominated by President Bush justices soda my or end its cage and forward nominated by President Obama\nAnd justice Gorsuch who was nominated by President Trump\nSo I began my valuation of judge Kavanaugh's nomination\nBy reviewing his twelve year record on the DC circuit court of appeals including his more than three hundred opinions\nAnd his many speeches and law review article on the beer so keen and Germany and now here's from the non partisan congressional Research Service freaks me many times each week\nAnd it says to me in the value waiting the judges extensive record\nI met with judge Kavanaugh for more than two hours in my uh as I listen carefully to the testimony ethics committee hearing\nI spoke with people who knew him personally such as ... civil rights and many out there\nAnd I talked to when judge cabinet or a second time by phone for another hour\nTo ask him very specific additional questions I also have met with thousands to my constituents both the advocates and many opponents regarding judge Kavanaugh\nOne concern that I frequently heard was set the judge would be likely to eliminate the Affordable CARE Act vital protections for people with ... conditions\nI voted like Raleigh with ... contention in it just sent in seven sky the holder judge Kavanaugh rejected that challenged to be a ca\nOn narrow purchase he drove grounds per serving a lot and fall many experts\nFrom it sounds like a senator who's just upon your Justice Roberts' opinion I forget\nBut I don't want to go to a break all we know for sure\nYeah me too Steve center has wrapped up cabinets approach toward the doctrine aspect may happen show is narrow very happy wind up part of the statute is challenged on constitutional\nGrounds he has argued for separating the in Balad clause as ... as possible while allowing the overall law to remain in cat\nFence was his approach in his dissent in a case that involved a challenge to the structure of the consumer financial Protection Bureau in his than jets cabinet I argued for quote severing any problematic portion\nWells and leaving the remainder intact and quote given the current challenge is to be a CIA proponents including by cell about\nProtections for people with preexisting conditions should want to adjust his who would take just this kind of approach\nAnother version that I heard often is that judge Kavanaugh I cannot be trusted if a case involving alleged wrongdoing by the president were to come up before the court\nSaid basis for this attack human seems to be two fold\nFirst judge Kavanaugh has written that he believes that Congress should enact legislation\nYeah I think we're going to take a break and this was I I thought this would be a brief speech but she she's writing from LA clear out All right we're going to take a break and we'll be right back to ... an hour or how\nOkay we'll have to take a heartbreak I I don't know I that's a good chance I think she'll still be speaking when we\nCome back from the five minute by
