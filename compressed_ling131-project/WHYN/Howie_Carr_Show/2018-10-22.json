pretty much\nKnow the president is very bad but the principal advantage the Democratic party has is the Republican Party why on earth would you not have your opponents\nVote on something you know this is massively wildly popular I'm an utterly implausible reality TV star was just elected president of the United states on the slogan build the wall we know the voters really really want this and we know\nThe Democrats are going to vote against it should we keep bringing up bills to make them vote against it\nAnd I don't know let's push tax cuts and move the embassy um no they're they're just beyond redemption we thought watching the campaign that Trump was something different but wow it's been two years ah haven't even broken ground on a wall e's ... rip painted some fences um so yeah you\nKnow I mean I say our van I mean there are millions\nSays do he ... he he says he's going to do I don't think he's got to be choice now and then you know I mean he's he he let this thing you're right he let it get away from him\nBut now he's got to do something I mean the end and again if he if he does something is going to be like the Cuban missile crisis I think you know when the JFK ah\nYou know was defied expectations and the ... the Democrats the better because I mean this is the I mean this is a more serious matter ... when you think about it than the missile crisis I mean that was over rated emergency when you look back on it but\nThis is Kay was totally hoodwinked it's worth mentioning or or historically mind that but I mean this is not everything they wanted out of

forty years an election major mid term election will not always be ten days away\nThat's why we wanted a wall\nUm Trump will not always be president that's why we wanted a wall or\nIt's just it's an

the ... in the intro her lie and then the the actual statement that she made last summer we'll play that in a little while\nBut she also said something about this specifically the or the Boston office the uh the the ice agents working in Massachusetts and again\nThey uh they they have a terrible uh a burden to bear not just rounding up these illegal alien criminals but they're they're often times are stopped\nBy court personnel they go to court to pick somebody up who's been arrested\nEdited and at least one or at least one or two cases that have been documented by ice they've been they've been stopped for picking them up by court personnel while the illegal alien a drug dealer or domestic abuse or escapes off the back door the court house sits on imaginable even five or ten years

a bright go ahead\nAnd went right here in Massachusetts going after people show up to testify in a trial when they threaten people several they won't report crimes when women are ... important to mask the being framed someone in their family or one of their neighbors will be picked up I I\nThink anybody anything from that's fine but we need is a system that makes us safer putting consistent with our family\nIs there any truth to what she said five lions\n[noise] while I get I get the ... in the year that I didn't hear any measure\nThat categorically tell you that we don't go and arrest people\nAt court houses that are testifying crime number one\nIf we're if we're at the courthouse which we do daily remake arrest all over the state\nOr individuals that are carrying a court that of criminals if they're they're just so that you're there for criminals um the the comment that really struck me the harder it is at the end when she said about when the freight report domestic violence I Would tell US Senator or anyone who had asked us it's completely the opposite\nWith the state and the London speaking with us not being able to arrest people in a local agency not being a honor dictators\nWe hear from more victims as to why I Can't remember who the person\nOr why they were released back I think they're more afraid of the fact that not that they're illegal the fact that we can't do our job because they get right release right back to the community but we had a chance to get rid of them but those same offenders go back and repeat the cycle of violence when it comes to domestic violence\nI should explain the lung decision for the state or listeners and viewers of the lung decision was by the highest court in Massachusetts Supreme judicial court\nSaid that a lot local law enforcement couldn't a honor and ice that pain or if they had a criminal law and it wasn't involving this uh illegal alien Cambodian drug addict named Lon\nWho was caught free and then a couple of weeks later he was a re arrested\nAnd charged with beating an elderly woman in a wheelchair and stealing twenty five hundred dollars from her\nIn order to buy more drugs and that I mean that's when you're that's a large degree when your problem started right I mean that that you would like to tell people about what happened when you guys went to was the new the courthouse just west of Boston thought\nWe had an back um it was just a couple of years ago when an individual that what was the newer driver that had raped obese\nEach student Boston and although I'll tell you about the college students and oh yeah she was doing the responsible thing will take an overhaul\nUm and then\nShe's raised by Hoover driver bills from the Dominican Republic and instead of being turned over to us though he ... you know he would stand trial he would face of crimes he was released out of the court and we never saw it again any subsequently right back to the Dominican Dominican Republic\nAnd you you asked them to hold at it and then there was the case in Quincy an African who are raped a woman and ... and you guys went to pick him up correct\nCorrect we went to um\nPick him up as well or he was from Donna and he was released um there was a ... or the the energy just wasn't on it or this play and that subject or to fly back to God or the next day\nAnd everybody was pointing the finger at each other the clerk or the judge and the sheriff and everybody was trying to blame each other for a ticket for him getting loose so uh what is it uh so so what you're saying is that since this a lung decision by the Supreme judicial court\nYou've had more women calling and saying why why didn't you pick up this guy who attacked me he's back out on the street now when I'm a I'm petrified of

for five hundred forty to forty two that is the toll free number about how we car show up to like to join us here this afternoon every weekday afternoon\nAs you know a a ... a bay grunt mob is winding its way through Mexico headed for the U.S border and the president Donald Trump has said he's going to stop them today he uh I guess I don't know if he said this in March before he got on the plane the Houston\nOr he tweeted out he ... he challenged the uh the media to take the cameras inside the caravan and see if they can find some gang bangers some MS Thirteen members or some middle Easterners because again we know we know a lot of MS Thirteen gang bangers got in through the last a surge\nOf unaccompanied children the Texas a public safety department has a has documented and we know that a lot of um mid eastern for potential terrorists have been arrested recently in Guatemala was in the major newspaper down there the president of the country announced it\nSo joining us now on the line is a Jessica Vaughan from the center for Immigration Studies a and we just wanted to ask her\nJessica what what should the president do next how can how can we stop this a mob but this this mob particularly before the midterms in ... and all these future mobs from a breaking into the country and invading it and trying to fundamentally transform it is a Brock Obama\nCheered them on what you do\nWell there are a number of things he could do he didn't leaning on these other government to enforce their own immigration laws that shit how but yeah we can't wait for other countries to on yeah save us from caravan that we have to take that in cases like that one of the options he had that just simply\nClose the border it's an extreme option diet you know if I Am a mob of four thousand people is hell bent on testing our sovereignty that's what we're gonna have to do and it can be done and then you know short hurt business for some people but it hurts our\nCommunity than the rest of the country where these people are struggling not to stop them so that's one option the other thing is is it in and started that would be simply\nTelling these people know you don't get to apply for asylum here because you come right through a thousand\nPer thousand miles throughout the country that has offered us island do you have no basis for making that claim here on the other thing is that yeah we simply couldn't I you know just but I\nReally I hold the line with the help of military an additional border patrol agent like her mother\nHow 'bout how 'bout I'd been suggested this all day I read it on power line block dot com\nWhy don't the under the U.S constitution the president has the power in the case of a rebellion or an invasion to was suspended habeas corpus I due process I mean ... and just declare basically a state of national emergency because of an invasion I mean this is an invasion is it not\nWell it sure feels like wind when you have people waving the Honduran flag and scrambling to barricade I you know between Guatemala and Mexico\nAnd looting ... comedy looting grocery stores\nOn their way north I mean these are not people who were planning to contribute anything to the U.S economy obviously they're criminals\nI well many of them are and certainly entering illegally\nA crime and the president does have the authority under the Constitution's Claire that any alien that he feels a would be a threat to the United states\nFrom anywhere can be barred entry just like with the travel ban it's the same um statutory basis as the travel ban\nAnd which of course has now been held up in court you know approved by the Supreme Court though that's a and authority he has and that would be the basis for simply shutting down the places where these people will try to enter\nA and the president also has the authority in crisis two deputy by state and local law enforcement agencies and I have a feeling\nThat Texas at least would be quite happy to um help with its resources because they've been doing it for years now already at their own expense\nGot into a big Texas will be in ... Texas has been moving the national guard down I heard the lieutenant Governor Dan Patrick on another show earlier today saying that they were moving troops into position but I I mean I don't think that they have the same powers that are that are the regular army or the border patrol what have you know\nThat's right only the border patrol can make immigration arrests but we don't you don't actually want to make him here where\nWe want to keep them out and through Humphrey we don't we don't want them to do something about suspending ... corpus I mean that way you can keep the these these gang of immigration advocates lawyers\nYou know from my ... you know ... you're the one of the ... the uh the process is an old the appeals process isn't over until the alien Windsor that's so true I mean we got to keep them on the other side we gotta keep 'em on the other side of the border\nYou know to prevent them from getting inside because once they're inside I mean they're going to be our responsibility for the next I God only knows how many generations will be paying for everything\nFor the rest of their lives in our no question about it once once people get and it's game over I'm just and the problem is is this is what happened with the caravan in the spring is that most of them got in and I'm surprised it took so long for another one to form\nUm so that's why we need really from and forceful measures now\nAnd we can explain it to the New York times later", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Howie Carr Show", "city": "Springfield", "day": "22"}
