I was in the ... for years but um that's the way I kind of saw this little girl was had a chance during this being\nCrashing into words and splits breaking and I'm not working out on your words or the fear of the show I walked into the building and you know it's there was no roof wandering anymore\nBut something told me to go out and around back and we're not we're not in a while back I caught a glimpse of an Indian just standing ...\nBut\nDidn't think anything of it and it's just kind of like ... ripples or ways yeah\nYeah my ... and he just well I think he may have seen a skin Walker you know I don't know what is that well I I skipped locker is actually an old Native American led and then I wrote about it in my last book\nUm and skin locker is actually the growth of the shopping\nAt the legend tell when you see an animal that has as their it human ... that is a scandal Walker\nBut they are the coast of the Shannon there are evil [laughter] I'm just warning you that's what the ... and in my book I have a story about the skin locker the devil had mountain which is right outside of Denver out there are hundreds of report back on the pioneers were there and the west the west bank mining dumb\nThese days and so and let me just go over a few things here uh uh the the latest or the latest developments here in the in the\nKavanaugh aftermath Susan Collins cabinet vote sparks calls to boycott main products tourism\nWell I'm Glad to know that that means I saw I saw a bag of a main potatoes market basket on a on a Saturday or the mail room managers likes to buy a handful of a potatoes were buying bags now main the main potatoes if this boycott is going on\nOr do you ever hear of an actor and comedian named John ... sang\nDoesn't have an accent radio show he's just one of these caustic condescending lips but call I'm an actor and comedian that that explains why I've never heard of them yeah exactly he's if he unless he has a show in the seventies on seven\nOh I think I think he has like an hour long accent radio program which nobody lifts and he just says snarky liberal things on social really you know what the number one\nShow on XM Radio is by the way it's Fox News channel\nIt's not it's not John snarky boggles saying\nAnyway here's what he said to ... to to what Susan Collins dear Susan Collins I really struggled with this but my tourist dollars just voted against ever visiting main while you remain in office and so now he uh now he's now he's deleted that we went over so big\nYeah I'm guessing a vis boycott of Maine products has brought to you by all the people who moved out of the United states after Trump was elected right\nJohn tests are who own six restaurants in Texas and there is opening a seafood restaurant in California told the newspaper he'll look elsewhere for hundreds of thousands of dollars\nWorth of seafood that he buys annually for may good luck getting all those good New Mexico lobsters you know John tests are going to have a fundraiser for a ... before he gets his ass kicked\nIn four weeks by Ted Cruz by the way so this is a this this is what the this is the fourth of boycott may just what I think of a boycott of man [laughter]\nJane Mayer Ronan Farrow ran with having a hit piece in the New Yorker to show pattern of behavior a pattern\nOf behavior so so in other words they knew that they couldn't find anybody the backup this woman ... story which he couldn't remember 'cause she was so loaded and she she had to talk to her lawyer before she could even come out with some kind of a memory gaps about what a cabinet had allegedly done but they want it to show the pattern\nOf behavior I\nThought you know a few ... if you'd try to say there was just another story and one of the papers today in LA there are ... there are a sheriff's deputies are being accused of stopping Latino Z\n\nIt's called racial profile right\nBecause there's a pattern of behavior the deputies or say so what is the difference between a pattern of behavior for ah for Brett\nKavanaugh odd that you think which it turns out it's not even true and a pattern of behavior for us stopping drivers are stopping anybody because you suspect that uh they're they're uh they're engaged in the various activities\nSo that Ronan Farrow he's shot we're going to need a new poll question or a Steve someone just ... yeah\nThey are one of our other questions was will be ah well the teacher in Minnesota or be fired or resign and I said no\nThis is the uh this is the teacher or she's in rows amount which is I guess near Minneapolis rose mount educator this is the headline in the uh the Minneapolis Red Star Tribune as they call it out there a rose mount educator on leave after tweeting kill Kavanaugh\n\nArose out special education teacher has been pet placed on paid administrative leave after posting a tweet Saturday that appeared to call for the killing of new Supreme Court justice Brett Kavanaugh it appeared here's what it said so who knows that's by the way I spelled W H O s ...\nWho's\nDid she go to college by the way they wouldn't have any information that you go to college with Christine Blasey Ford at my alma mater\nSo who's going to take one for the team and kill Kavanaugh so that it appears that she was calling for someone to kill a cabinet because you use the words kill Kavanaugh in there\nBut so are we I was I was expecting but she was just going to claim that uh you know she was suffering some kind of breakdown and would have to undergo two hours of counseling before she could return to the classroom\nBut apparently she resigns so we're gonna have to come up with a new question\nAnd a John Heinz Iraq or is on the show sometimes for power line blog or he says I'm so old I can remember when teachers knew how to spell [laughter] [laughter] yeah you are showing your age their job and when you talk about that who's going to\nHere say a poll question uh this is a CNN of all Paul's by twenty eight points independents approve of a Democrat Kavanaugh tactics independent voters are expressing overwhelming disapproval of the way the Democrats handled Kavanaugh's confirmation fight\nThe or the G O P didn't fare much better oh how how can that be fifty five thirty five disapprove that's that's Ida okay it is a CNN poll\nAid for four or five hundred forty to forty two did you hear about the Facebook executive is getting his name is ...\nAnd uh he's apparently a long time he's in he's based in DC I guess he's basically a lobbyist for a Facebook and he's a longtime friend of a Brett Kavanaugh go probably going back to the Bush White House days and uh so he ... he decided to come as a as as a as a supporter of Kavanaugh\nAnd if you even think about like um a in a restaurant you know people no choice prime select right all that is is a marveling sports how fat that we get that animal that there's no like how tender or was it what the taste like all the matters is putting fattening\nBut turns out in the fifties and sixties and seventies and up until today people care a lot about eating cheaply this this taste better way better\nWay better you know it's like yeah I I read the copy and I say I don't know if my people killed ought to be healthier but they they are concerned that pace\nThe taste is incredible um yeah so grass fed basically the animal just lived on grass for his entire life I'm going back to your question\nThe challenges this country is set up for a couple of things one nobody cares about the farmer anymore to um everyone's trying to get the cheapest price possible to you I'm basically\nFeeding an animal grass takes a lot of time uh and the system is set up to incentivize the farmers to get rid of the cat right it's actually kind of crazy like even down to the phones so\nFormer gets alone to take the cow between six months in Eighteen months that loan expires at Eighteen months which means they have that cow has to trade hands they can't really to Cal and we're talking about how there were thousands of dollars yeah you're talking about\nSo as long as the other thing I Want to get through 'cause we don't have that\nMuch so I didn't I didn't ... Australia but over\nBut it's good it's really it's really good be ... but I Wonder also mentioned ... when you go to ... dot com you get all the stakes that you can only get at restaurants yeah get them at supermarket like uh like I was mentioning earlier hanger stick yep hanger stick by Kevin why can't get a hanger stake except that what your body\nSwells so we well we do is we ship a month's supply of meat directly to your door and it's a beef chicken or pork\nAnd because we have frozen product our products has frozen which we think is way more convenient for the customer and better quality um we're able to do things like the hanger stick whereas a grocery store would not want to carry that hangar steak we to specialty item right exactly I so they don't want to take that risk whereas we will\nOkay so you so you can get all different kinds of steaks and where what is the address again it's puts your box dot com slash Howie slash how well you know get your twenty bucks off the first box ... also get your ... by the way the bacon is fantastic well\nYeah I Will say that I'm just as briefly we we all we do have a domestic program or trying to grow it um the biggest challenge is finding the right partners who are not cutting corners for what's happening to\nRead [laughter] you're okay but I just the fact is though wherever it comes from it's really really good bike yeah as we focus on\nAnalysts Roseanne show dubbed the counting hairs next week and will be available on Hulu on Seventy over on Amazon Prime season three uh mister robot drop this week\nAlso Mad Men creator Matthew weird new show though Romanoff kicks off on the movies that you can fire up monsters all twenty tens dental Donnie ... the Daniel tiger movies the horror comedies slice and more streaming edition and I heart radio\n\nYou by the way from the why\nWhy why why don't we [noise]\nLive from them Matthews brothers [noise]\nA four for five hundred forty to forty two that is the toll free number about how we car show if you'd like to join us that's the number and the next to Mike and everybody else from up with your box not um this was a great you know to find out about this you won't regret ordering\nSome of the firm up with her box dot com slash how we got some ... extra stuff he worked for\nFive hundred forty to forty two\nYou have a Dell Monica by the way the medical costs yes they do this and that's like\nA a question of the tax line joining us now is Bill O'Reilly and uh you know Bill O'Reilly from the Fox news channel ah once upon a time and he's the author of many best selling books he's got a new book out just for a Christmas season the killing the ss the hunt for the worst war criminals in history\nBill O'Reilly thanks for being with us here on the highway car show\nDogs around me back Carl how you doing man\nPretty good pretty good before we get to the park I got to ask you what your take on the uh the the cabinet or a confirmation I mean this was a a this was a new low in ugliness wasn't it in American politics\nBrutal awful um and I hope we have some follow the investigations I mean I really like to know um who leaked the letter from Christine forward to the press who did that apparently Dr Ford did not want to become public\nSo who leaked it is only a few people added a congresswoman and California Dianne Feinstein I'm so that shouldn't be too hard to find out who lead that and I think everybody should know\nAnd also the FBI to follow up on 'em you know threats\nA finances behind demonstrators who are now a costing people in restaurants in elevators they're being paid the same people that attacked me a couple of years ago are involved with this cabinet thing same groups and they're being paid they're funded I'd like the FBI to look into that\nBecause you don't want dangerous and that's threatening\nYou know I I mentioned this a couple of times the last couple of days the wall Street Journal reported yesterday that\nThey knew it was great wasn't worried article that was\nThe woman who yeah ... the woman who accosted just like in the elevator that friday and uh on on in the capital is paid a hundred and Seventy seven thousand dollars a year by a plus a\nBonus yeah she gets a ...
