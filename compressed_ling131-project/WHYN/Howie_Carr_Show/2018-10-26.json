gets more in welfare than it pays in tax I should say this for next week you realize these this is the congressional budget office numbers more than half\nOf Americans receive more in some kind of government transfer payment Medicare Medicaid food stamp Social Security then they pay in federal taxes more than half one thing that this explains why so many people don't think tax cuts are a big

not going to be in favor of tax cuts all we've got half\nOver half of America gets more and welfare than they pay in taxes\nThey're going to understand here that tax cuts and I remember all the news stories about how the Republican tax cut bill didn't end up being that big a boon\nFor the Republicans in polling that that's a major shift just since the Nineteen eighties there was a huge win win for Republicans back in the eighties and I think it still is to a certain extent but\nNot as big Frank in ah in New Baltimore Welcome sir you're Nextel up\nA rash thanks for taking my call you about

and or a he there's other people that are helping to ah do\nAll send all those things across the country which would be my last point is that if there's anybody that thinks that man could have been initiated and follow through with all those mail bombs across the country on his own I think are delusional\nAnd that that that ban was just just a a shut up just to a so CNN and MS LSD could ah swallow it and they did hook line and sinker\nSo when you say when you said do do you mean that the Democrats or somebody found this guy and are setting him up and he doesn't have any idea what just

I don't know what the problem was never been made clear so they sent him down to ... Florida\nWhich is the biggest mentioned last night it's the biggest prison in the bureau of prisons or a group of penitentiaries the federal pads and so just this week they said to him away from ... to Oklahoma City and there's a and it looks like\nHe is a he is on his last leg she's eighty nine years old he has a uh he's had a heart condition for at least twenty five years even before he went on the lam in the early Nineteen nineties\nSo we're going to say so what we're going to do is how long has he got left that's the question here we're going to do a ... we're going to do with death pool here and uh so we're asking\nWe're asking people to pick a date and whoever is closest to the ... when he expires when your your typical prize copyright man wrapped man\nThere it is here to this is a book about the trial and you also give you will give you the full but all of all the books I published myself will give me a copy of rifle but that's his partner Stevie Fleming who's also locked up for life and we'll give you a copy of plug ugly too which is sort of the a a a scrap book as I call it of organized crime in Boston\nSo whoever picks the date closest that he expires will when the uh the three bucks and by the way if you want to get a these two bucks rat man the rifleman and\nWhat really happened about the Trump campaign they're all available for their Seventy dollars worth of books almost\nFor a fourteen Ninety five right now because we're trying to make room for our new book Kennedy Babylon volume two\nSo order order this weekend there all autographed for fourteen Ninety five rat man rifleman and what really happened where you can order the new book that's coming in the final edits this weekend Kennedy babble on volume two a century of scandal in depravity\nBut anyway we're gonna we're gonna take the calls and what I thought yesterday and I think I said this was that I thought he was on on route to aid to another prison in the prison I thought he was on route to as a Springfield, Missouri that's a that's a federal prison a medical facility\nAnd that's where some of the uh ... some of why these are old buddies that have ah\nShed their mortal coil like his old buddy the Choctaw kid who was an old bank robber they work together on Alcatraz\nAnd Larry ... who was a mafia guy who was originally from ... in the south than the later later lifted Jay ... at swamps got\nBut he he died there as well and so I thought maybe they were moving up to a to Springfield, Missouri but that's where all prisoners go to die they're bored more of them in the federal system\nAnd the globe actually the the Herald said maybe they're going to let them die in Oklahoma City and I talked to a fat I Know today or a former fed and he thinks he thinks he's going to die in Oklahoma City too but he may be at such tough shape that he's not even going to\nFind your your bias in the past year I've just give it away inside information ... tried I'm trying to let people make an informed decision that's all I mean I you know you could [laughter] nobody knows what anyone's going to die for goodness sake\nI'm just saying it's it may not be law that's ... that's ...
