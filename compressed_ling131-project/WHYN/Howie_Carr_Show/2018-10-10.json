Know what happened to be\nBut I don't think she hosted it I think she open at but she didn't she didn't she wasn't a host I don't believe it says lead Taylor ... when the show but also I mean there's no denying that tell her side does have a massive audience especially among young people but the point is that they move causation\nI don't know I mean they said in one day the registration went up and I don't think it I don't think it proves that like things are going to change in her favor necessarily but\nJust getting a I'm just getting messages Michael ... you know that's all we know it's

Boston in the Nineteen seventies Nineteen eighties I covered the Seabrook anti nuclear demonstrations New Hampshire I covered some of the anti busing riots I saw I saw people chased down by mobs they've got kicked the few times myself but but you know\nIt was like it was always in neighborhoods or or uh you know a at a a at a at a at a construction site or something like\nThat mean that what made what happened last weekend a little different\nWas that they were inside the Capitol they weren't they weren't inside we're trying to get inside the Supreme Court building I mean they weren't this was really really disturbing iPhone\nEven though there were only a handful of them and they they appeared more ominous on TV I think that they did a person because you get when you took the when they took the wide shot back\nFrom the Supreme Court like when the vice president was leaving\nThe the capital or wherever he was I mean there were only a couple of hundred of them but still it it was bad\nAnd the fact that the these people are paid protesters too\nBut there that there are fabulously wealthy people the source of the American by the way or what what what what country is he a citizen of George Soros I was gonna say fabulously wealthy Americans but I'm not sure sources in America\nSpiers in America and that\nI think he has a citizenship in Hungary America and uh the u._k.\nOh three countries and thought I thought to was the max he's a citizen of the world valley OK okay he's a citizen of the world that's good to know\nBut so they're paying these people to disrupt civic institutions that are centuries old institutions that have served the people in this country very well\nAnd and and now you have people who\nOstensibly are law abiding citizens you have the you have this guy Eric Holder I meet again he's a a corrupt\nA banana republic official or he was the attorney general under a Obama\nHe was he ... he he helped arrange pardons when Bill Clinton was leaving office in disgrace for some of the sleazy is people on the planet he was held in contempt of Congress you know obviously it's a very ... shady dodgy character\nBut I mean he's still he's talking about running for president I mean he's on the heels of the dodgy lawyers wing of the Democrat Party he'll be running against Michael ... and that that crowd I guess\n'cause we're going to be like twenty thirty of them running so you got holder\nIs talking about how you need to use violence against protesters and again I can remember this guy ran that totally ... administration he refused to prosecute Black Panthers he said he's not going to go after people like him\nHe uh he's he he was held in contempt of Congress you know for lying about fast and furious\nThe uh the the gun running operation so I mean he's just he's a complete the ... he's a complete moral ethical cipher but it's still pretty amazing I mean considering that let me ask you this John Mitchell\nRichard Nixon's attorney general his former law partner at New York he went to prison for Watergate crimes do you think John Mitchell whatever say what I'm worth the cut we're about to play of Eric Holder cut twelve\nIs time for us as Democrats [noise] to be as tough as they are\nDedicated as they are to be committed as they are very shallow is this is all over my wife like really high which will scare me [laughter]\nFamily says if you don't when they go low we\nMay go low we can [noise]\n\nWas the Democratic party\nMember when Trump you're the rallies used to say go get them out of here you know these demonstrators get them outta here get them out of here and everybody say he's inciting mob violence what the hell was that\nI mean again grant that he's with a bunch of people who have trust funds and legacies of these people have a you know they they they they got nothing but ... and their lunches stomped on the that's the kind of people that go to those events with Eric Holder but\nStill I mean he's in his inciting violence kicking people what what happened to me if I if I was on your mind you know rent right now we're in a national network what if I said\nYou know what there's a demonstration down a down in front of the state house let's go now to check everybody kicked the people who are demonstrating I'd be in big trouble I'm just glad\nThe new Democratic Party has just as many guns as the old Democratic Party\nWhich is not exactly [laughter] yeah\nI I mean it's I I don't I don't quite get that either crutch like there's always talking about that I mean they did they really want to be talking about picking up a gun when they they don't have any guns I mean I'm not and again I'm not saying I Want anybody pick 'em up guns so you got the let's let's go to Mazie Hirono\nI mean\nYou know\nThere was really a race to the bottom not just in rhetoric but also when Ike you in the Democratic party Mazie Hirono\nIs about three cheeseburgers short of a Happy Meal pack you know I'd be she's just listen to this okay play a cut number\nA president and Republicans what they're saying is that democratic protesters are quote an angry mob and we don't want to ask you about it is you know it is one thing to protest at the Supreme Court to do it at the Capitol that's been done for for generations and frankly since it out of the country\nIt's another thing to run senators out of restaurants go to their homes is that going too far\nI think that it just means that there are a lot of people who are very very much I'm motivated about what is going on because what might happen\nWith having a ton of every any kind of fair path that have let them if I look at them with ... after that the ... case for\nWhy they have asked lifeline identify we don't want to hear from you too if we have to hear from you what is that ... hearing of that going on if no restaurants path but this is what happens hail and they\nBecause they look at why ... and all that and this is like that coming forth in our country that's a tremendous divisiveness in our country but this is the kind of a activism that occur than people make their own decision that\nShe said they're motivated was that guy Hodgkinson motivated when he uh when when he fired the Rand Paul say fired two hundred rounds of ammunition this is a this is a motivated Democrats\nTrying to kill Republicans and then what's the what's the guy who assaulted Rand Paul a few months later in the in in Newport, Kentucky was he motivated\nThinking about this Rand Paul is the is the United states senator he's a he's a practicing physician not ophthalmologist his father was a ... was a congressman a candidate for president\nAnd this guy last year got shot at and he got almost beaten to death I mean if a guy like Rand Paul is not safe and and read what was he doing\nWas he involved in some kind of ah you know shady activities he was he was at a baseball practice and he was raking leaves any was attacked\nAnd this this they say the N o Mazie Hirono can say is that they are our people are motivated this is what happens is is activism she says yeah yeah this is a this is the face of democracy yeah yeah it's pretty scary

now\nAh the deputy attorney general uh he was supposed to appear before the group of Republican congressman from the intelligence and you're just Sherry committees to answer questions about his ah\nHis effort to his suggestion that he wear a wire to white and trap the president and the saying something that they could use is a trip wire to invoke the twenty Fifth Amendment to remove him from office\nHe said it was he was joking but now the various ah\nVarious people who heard him talking about it afterwards heard mention it I said no he wasn't joking so he was supposed to testify tomorrow but now congressman Jim Jordan was one of the leaders of this this group of people that Republicans Freedom Caucus types from the intelligence judiciary committee's\nHe says uh Rosen's a redacted

swine\nEric Holder just said he wants to kick protesters\nOkay is is this violence is this violent rhetoric is I still don't understand violin speech like his his words are somehow inflicting damage like physical harm on people\nAnd and by the way you know all the\nViolence that the Trump rallies two years ago\nDidn't turn out\nThanks to project maritime us that the Democrats admitted that they were inciting with paid mobs of protesters to go in there and to provoke violence to get on camera eight four for five hundred forty to forty two\nCaroline you're next with highway cargo had

protesters had gone into the Senate gallery when they were voting on Elena Kagan or Sonia Sotomayor and it started screaming and yelling like like the uh the heritage that on Saturday afternoon\nThey they would have said it was an assault on democracy they would have said that you know it was a a ... that these people should be locked up for for five or ten years\nWell ... that's been on TV lately

heat now to get me to the segment you want to get a little brief synopsis\nWe have a a a marvelous thing one of the great great things that was passed in the last Twenty years by a Democrat legislature they got tired of people complaining about how people don't pay their fair share of taxes so finally we just are up to his they said okay you want to pay your fair share we're going to give you an option\nIs only two states in the union that give you the option on the on the tax return for the state to pay a higher rate\nOf Arkansas and Massachusetts so literally dozens of people say of the millions of taxpayers in the commonwealth of Massachusetts take advantage of this one of whom it doesn't happen to be Elizabeth Warren\nWho makes millions of dollars of her she she she was making four hundred thousand is a professor at Harvard\nThen she got elected to the Senate and all of a sudden she's making over a million a million and a half dollars a year\nBut she never checked the box grace until this year and what what's what's going on with Elizabeth Warren this year the way that you might check the box in and decided to pay a higher rate instead of five percent I point eight five percent white what do you think the difference was this year\nShe's trying to break that glass ceiling that Hillary bonk your head off of and then fell back down\nThat's a good guess grace but the reality is she's running for reelection this year a challenge to run for president so she figured she'd better do the PC thing\nThat's so great Smith now glass ceiling running for president\nHillary ran for president he used to hate now she'll be porn and right now [laughter] okay anyway back to um oh I just want to say about that ... that's why I don't do my own taxes 'cause if I did my taxes a match to pay check that box by accident and they ended up paying like hassle\nLoud do your attack if then if you tax guy somebody check that\nBox for you race you would have a lawsuit on their hands I mean there will be tripled damages 'cause that's like a let's say you make I don't know what you make but you it's one percent of your income is gone because of would be gone because\nBut like for her when she checks it it's one percent of her income\nYeah it's an extra one percent oh an ex so like over the last ten years we figured it out by not checking that box she had saved fifty thousand dollars that was fifty thousand dollars that could have gone to illegal aliens to building and blow transgender bathrooms and and the ... the crumbling infrastructure\nCrumbling infrastructure I'm just so hung up on the shoulder money bags currently has her own accountant do or taxes he's my parents' accountant that's what I was gonna say I knew that you can do that\nI mean it's the one thing that I think it's good that I'm not doing my own taxes like I don't think my parents are like do your own grace I think they're kinda happy that someone else has that under control anyway back to hate now\nSo how he wrote that piece and I read some comments and throughout these comments Steve feel free to play the messages and the order that there and because we do have tons of hate 'em and some of that it's really\nDark winter the one hand it did anybody suggested that I have my facts wrong in Moscow on\nPeople were more suggesting that you are overlooking Donald Trump tax issues and only picking on all of the\nMore than Donald Trump ever called for a a marginal income tax rate of he refuses say how high she's they've they've asked what's your what do you want\nYou you talked about these problems that the Republicans get back to people what do you want us to the top tax rate fifty percent sixty percent Seventy percent and she never answers Donald Trump that's the difference\nYeah I get what you're saying you know what I mean it's like oh a lot of hypocrites saying oh well you didn't say after and help us clean up\nAnd then I'm like oh well I didn't I didn't offered to you I never wanted to and then one person arranged for the place to be cleaned up and didn't say after that's like a weird now do you but you know what I mean what does he he's also not called for people to release their tax returns yeah yeah\nAnyway so here's a ...\nAnd they also didn't take the ...

I actually\nHave a cold outside of the communist regime into sewing and I mean I don't eat\nIt guy heading in that direction and what I think one other thing that that it they have a book and then as

they're you know fifty sixty Seventy eighty eighty million people killed\nAnd you know you want to talk about a terrible uh another terrible policy of the Chinese Communist government or how about the one child policy for all for all those years they were trying to get a a a a a handle on the population increases so they they said you could only have one child\nSo you could you could imagine what
