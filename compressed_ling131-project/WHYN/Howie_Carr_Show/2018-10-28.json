I never thought about that they'll just now\nYou know she she was lucky but the thing wasn't held in life ... ...\nI Wonder do you want ... do you think she could name of it on the western most county of Massachusetts\nWell Bob Robert Bea rice couldn't when I asked him about sixty what we're seeing whenever it was one of two thousand two sixteen years ago you couldn't I asked him I just I just that just came up with it you know I just said what other what what's the west or most county in Massachusetts\nNow and I bought her thinking that the you know Massachusetts has a west coast\nI mean so even if even if we did have a west coast you know there's a there's a whole other like fourth of the state beyond the Connecticut River you know I Know there's a lot of people living up there compared to here but it's geographically speaking it's a huge chunk of the state she had no idea that it without their\nCourse\nShe didn't she had a she had a couple of memory failings do during the debate but let's let's go on race where\nFew stories on that or not the debate although you do have plenty of sound highly if you want to get to it or not do it but I start with the Cory Booker story 'cause that broke this weekend and I don't know if you read it how we I've read I read a word but it was yeah foreign pages\nAnd I watch them gladiator movies\nI like the second page um before I realized that before I ... I don't know if it's clear to everyone who the man throughout or does he just\nRoll I thought it was clear I thought it was very clear but some of the left these are claiming they didn't understand I although I hear that it was like oh you know which\nI fully believe on that whole thing where he says you know I'm not trying to claim that Cory Booker is gay I'm just saying that he you\nKnow the guy said that he thought that he he he although he was gay he said that his experience with straight men was they didn't care who they got well you know\nYeah right and and but that's\nYou know that may be true for like people like Jack Kennedy according to what people say but I don't I don't think that applies to most most complete heterosexual males [noise]\nRight well I don't want to go any further yeah I think you've covered it good enough ... [laughter] I think we all get what you're saying mark says you know what her favorite Elvis Presley song soldier was with word what burn in love\nYou know at ... pre Springsteen science now burned in the usa Byrne\nThat's [laughter] good excellent\n[laughter] um so it's interesting though this story was not and I know this is Elaine wave gauging it but I always try to figure out what people my age are paying attention to by looking at the moment on Twitter because that's usually what ever is trending in the world\nAnd when I saw the Cory Booker tweet from someone else I was like oh this is definitely going to be one of the moment because this is big news it was really know where\nIt really did not get that much traction\nWas 'cause there's bigger Cory Booker Kamala Harris you introduce her plan to give everybody five hundred dollars or Cory Booker has got a new plan out a ... that would give low income people in some instances up to fifty thousand dollars\nYes senator Cory Booker it's introducing a bill aimed at closing that gap his idea is to give lower income kids a sizable nest egg nearly fifty thousand dollars in some cases that they could use for wealth building purchases like a down payment on a house or college tuition\nEven using the brown I could eat all around me\nBaby bonds can I get a baby von identify as a baby and when I went to bind and beat the opportunity accounts when theoretically make sure all children have significant assets when they enter adulthood rather than just those who groping lost their homes\nBasically all the kids who get these are going to be able to invest it on his hours carbon credits\nBut back to the sexual assault\nCan we give all the ... the kids in the the mob that's coming north can we give them the money now so that they they don't they don't if they could stop looting the food stores that they're passing by and the\nThe ... well they should probably get more than that they should\nGet out on clouded later about okay let's go Bob the the the big red walk\nOkay [noise] um but back to that Cory Booker straight really quick I Cory Booker basically this guy said he works for him he thought he was he Cory Booker was his hero\nUm he was clearly disillusioned once this happened um he was in the bathroom Cory Booker knock you don't want her favorite stuff will song is what burned to be wild who very good burn I'm Cory Booker knocked in the bathroom door and\nIt's like hey what's going on and then pushed him inside\nThat he used the Larry Craig wind is there a piece of toilet paper here I'd like to pick up off or was that the what what senator", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Howie Carr Show", "city": "Springfield", "day": "28"}
