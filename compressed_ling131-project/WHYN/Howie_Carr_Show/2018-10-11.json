use their word you're using it against him that he can't\nHe can't go out and be part of the public debate or have an opinion or talk to the president because he struggled at so instead they're using

he's going against the grain\nWhat would happen to a Republican who called the Kanye West but so good negro\nUh I I think you I think I think that that the bigger thing was that it was black people

look in his face like oh look at the white guy's face you can't believe we're talking like this when really the white guy and and he was the same guy who was in all the mob clips calling it a model

it's LeBron James and then if you say anything bad about him you're a racist but let's play that clip again to remind people of how awful this was yesterday\nWas what happens when they grow don't read 'em and and we have this now and now Donald Trump is going to use it in for it and he's going to have somebody who can stand with my pictures [noise]\nThis look at us God\nBless and black folks are about to trade Kanye West and the racial draft okay they've had it with him and he's an attention war like the president he's all of a sudden now that the the models spokes person he is he's the token negro of the of the Trump Administration\nYeah so they wouldn't get older that guy feeling with CNN and find a a black person speak for thirty million other black you know are there any white people that can speak for all the white people in the country\nAnd you know I've never really thought like when when a white person screws up I've never thought like men we're going to trade them away to another race but [laughter] which were white people kit disowned their own everything everything Kanye West\nIs saying is confirmed by his critics\nYeah I I really think that is the biggest point they may have had a little bit of a chance of getting him back had they not completely insulted him and and and insulted his intelligence and his mental state it's who you know\nLike if I had an opinion and you guys just ridiculed me for it I'd be like well what's wrong with you people are feeling for being that there are so scared\nThey're so incredibly scared of a different opinion of someone shaking up the norm and they're proving it because every time he opens his mouth\nThey're only way to counteract it to say oh it's so sad he's really disturbed which by the way it is an interesting

told them I Try to learn from watching Democrats like last week with a Elizabeth Warren when she got busted by us for you know writing off the fifty thousand dollars worth of used clothes and then

one and then as he's leaving he's hugging the reporter he talking like Jonathan Karl all these guys and it's true one of his things that he says and I'm not saying he constantly sounds like perfectly you know\nHe points to always come across perfectly which neither do mine but one of the things he always said to lead with love and I think that actually is very powerful because they want to hate him and Everytime they hate on him he doesn't get him angry he comes back and says things like I understand where you're coming from I get\nThat when you have your you have your rights to freedom of

Shi who you guys heard in the opening because they don't know ... and they're not going to say that to me\nYou know though I I understand why Trump was giving him the option of having his picture taken with them because sometimes especially in these days of social media pictures can come back to haunt you as Steven I proved today with the governor of Massachusetts the now with David a mayor Boyd mayor of Fall River\nRepublican to fight against sanctuary city and she supports building the wall and proudly stand with our ice ages as they defend the border and the rule of law just feel is the only candidate in ...

for four five hundred forty to forty to jog your next with highway car go ahead John\nHey good afternoon alley or back from a back on the economy just to think sure a truck\nTrump's instinct on this I I've been doing this for a long time I've been in the business for Thirty years now Trump's instinct on this call you at the fed is correct for this reason\nEven though rates are relatively low the amount of debt system isn't wasn't absolve in two thousand eight it was just moved around the government took a lot on it\nAnd the second point is you know same thing the ... budget academics pals a good guy but\nI don't think the fats missed all three of the last financial crisis and since that that has gone up a lot globally small changes that race can have huge impacts on the economy in the stock market and so I think Trump's instinct on this is dead right\nWell I mean so you're saying it's a ah it's it's a set up or they just best play in their hand\nI don't think it's a set there there there are a couple of members the fat I Am trying to think there's a woman on there is blond hair and it used to work for Hillary she's a real moon bat and she she was giving money even though she was a little out Steve could probably look it up wisely or something or other\nNow I think I think they don't really they rely on these academic models to model the economy and they got it wrong and two thousand with the Internet bubble they got it wrong in two thousand eight they were paid at least warned about the mortgage crisis year after year after year\nI mean he adds to the Senate and they're going to get out senator ... new to warn them about that and the Democrats said it was racist to try to walk cracked down on the uh uh on the uh\nThe the high risk loans that were being made to to homeowners and uh yeah I mean that was that seems like that was a totally preventable crash two thousand eight wasn't it\nIt it was they were born look I mean Iran mortgage money for years and we saw in two thousand three what was going on you know and I was a city at the time we uh we learned our management to it but when you're given free money out of this with the Democrats are good at nobody wants to hear the consequences of the free money\nSo yeah that was preventable But Trump's instinct telling you what he's dead right on this call them out\nBecause people say to me well race really three percent there were five or six percent during the you know you know six or seven before the crash then\nIt's not the rate it's the total ... debt in the system so even though rates are lower the interest ... it's just math ... turbines math and so uh I'm not saying there's going to be an immediate crash but the academics that run the fat and they're all academics\nThey really don't get it and uh and so I think Trump is Trump's instinct on that she doesn't just come up with this for a political ploy you know\nI think that right on this and I tell you that\nYou know this was one of the things that Democrats are are still really a angry about the fact that the Obama just cratered the economy's so bad and there was eight years of malaise and then as soon as Trump got in\nThe economy started coming back and and you know remember the a rubber the fake headlines of a big headline it was a front fake front page of the globe ran\nFrom the they said they ... this nightmare scenario if Trump was elected in one of the big a big parts of their big news front page that they put out in the spring of twenty six but he was\nA Trump or lack the markets crash and so of course the markets\nHave been an all time high and it really bugs up and that's why you see that's one of the things they ... what are their recurring themes that the bits that that somehow this is Obama's economy\nThe fact that you know the unemployment rates are at historic lows among the most the demographic groups\nThe fact that ah they're more people working today in the United states than at any time in history of the country\nAnd it just really really bugs of and that's why they keep saying it's Obama set in motion and he's not getting the credit he deserves\nSo is now so if if Obama last week there were complaining but Obama wasn't getting the credit for that he deserved that so I guess this means that\nThings couldn't have changed that much in a week so he must be responsible for the fact that the Dow Jones industrial average has lost fourteen hundred points almost the last two days right\nRight no that's not right oh okay okay\nI got it now if if something good happens it's Obama's fault if something bad happens it's to Obama's credit I should say something bad happens it must be a Trump's wall so this is this is the Trump crash\nI can see I can see the the postings on the newspaper or a Facebook message boards now I I think the correct terminology is Trump's slump\nFrom are you happy now Trump skins takes out your guy because she's got her on the orange man

President Trump was on the phone with the host and he\nWas asked about Eric Holder's remarks about kicking Republicans cuts fifty\nYou'd better be careful what he's wishing for that I can tell you better be careful what he's wish to discuss things safe and for him to make him to make a statement of like that is a very dangerous tape and you know they talk about\nUs we are exactly opposite you know the rally is where they send people I I heard somebody yesterday on your show actually talking about my rallies\nThat my rallies or really calm and and well run and and packed with people we

and then they just do the Democrat since or a sudden they came from all over and we'd have protesters and I would say is that it wasn't so successful for those protesters\nBut they have to be careful

I'll tell you Jared Golden is so radical Holly he believes in sanctuary cities\nAre you ready for this or getting a little boy he thinks it's a great idea\nTo allow welfare dollars taxpayer welfare dollars to buy booze uh cigarettes\nLaw that's a great idea yourself out of jail Mike how about how to spruce come on we got to throw\nThat out on the sanctuary cities welfare dollars will boost he also supports an organization that thinks you hope you sit down with everybody in order to make it now now that thinks that we should outlaw or the ability to buy home heating oil gasoline and diesel\nWhale yeah exactly that's the point that's how radical this valley is here in the legislature he voted one hundred percent of the time\nAgainst us small business is one hundred percent\nWhat does he does he want to use for ah for heating heating everybody home during the ... on a whim males\nI don't know I put that to these people are he's yeah he graduated from college I don't know I I think seven eight years ago I don't know what he does I either part time legislator last few years and it got a two part time job most people get out of school they have a career I don't know what he does\nA but I'll tell you his views his positions are so extreme in other words lay out\nAh he thinks it's a great idea to have a one hundred percent one hundred percent government takeover of healthcare costs thirty two trillion dollars double everybody's taxes and by the way if you have private insurance through your employer it's cancelled and everybody's pushed into a one hundred percent government controls\nSo in other words it as as Brock Obama would say everybody has bad apple plant so he wants to push you went through a rotten apple plan\nWell yeah I mean look look at it this way you've probably seen this recently uh Canada\nWhere the population of about one tenth the size of America has a waiting list now of folks trying to get health care services uh one million people just pass one million people weightless and the average amount of time in Canada is now five months\nTo get some sort of necessary medical a treatment or you know five months but we wouldn't stand for that but if you push everybody in this one hundred percent government run health care program that doubles your taxes and costs thirty two trillion bucks good luck\nTrying to get a doctor's

everybody you know government run program where you have no choice and and the cars go through the roof\nI support our small businesses are I think it's a good idea by the way to use welfare dollars oh for for for for food on the table and clothing not for alcohol I also think it's a great idea\nTo have work requirements if you apply for welfare and none of you know if you have any disabilities yourself of course they're not if you're pregnant or small kids and he didn't like that idea you watch these welfare dollars instead circuit boards and alcohol and\nLaw you don't want to you don't

I haven't seen any ads like this have have you seen any on TV that are up I think there have\nBeen a few uh I have to say it in full disclosure that I don't watch a lot of a lot of Massachusetts telling\nNor do I [laughter] but I I think that I see I see a few ads every once in a while and there are there are a referendum campaigns that are going on right now in the in the commonwealth\nEspecially a question one which is this involves nurses but I haven't noticed that so far is this is this a real is this going to be a real problem or can can you get around it by just by just you know having a not mentioning candidates may\nWell you can do that uh you know and I think that's that's getting it sort of the heart of what the problem is you know the ads that that my client wants to run you know they're not they're not trying to get anyone elected what they want to do is encourage people to to look at any issue policy in this case you know tax sites and uh\nYou know the what the legislatures decided to pay itself and you know to to encourage engagement between us citizens and their legislators in fact they want to run this in a district in Massachusetts where the senator who's being named doesn't even have an opponent in the election\nSo it it's it's factually untrue to say at least that eats ads are actually connected in any way to electoral activity this is just standard discussion of political issues\nSo we'll we'll is a Willis prohibition against the against running a basically adds without a disclaimer well this also apply to unions are just a or just the to a private entities\nI Believe I Believe it applies to anyone who isn't a party or a political committee or you know one of these or an entity that does exist to to affect the outcomes of elections", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Howie Carr Show", "city": "Springfield", "day": "11"}
