that's what\nI heard it all that\nThen decided to buy like oh no no I'm not a it's an old player only on like thirty and his wife had enough we've had a we get the picture\nYeah he also had um which is becoming has really big line or is that everyone should remember how the recovery started and that was with the Obama administration\nAnd the other so bad that we elect the Trump\nThat so in in in that sense he is\nThe father of the economic well walked in office ten years ago\nWe were in the middle of the worst economic crisis for a lot of times that was the last time but the other party was

allow people to pour into the United states undetected undocumented unchecked and circumventing the line a fee for waiting patiently diligently unlawfully does become immigrants in this country\nI'm Glad you brought this up Steve because I've been noticing um with this whole caravan conversation that's happening now in the news the new word is\nJoke he stoking the fear of his base\nYes you're right I mean what's striking here is the economy strong unemployment is low but instead of talking about his achievements these days the president really is leaning into this message of fear of his closing argument focuses on stoking fears of illegal immigration\nWell it's hard to use the word weaponize when they're burning American flags and I know that they're going to be armed by MS Thirteen as soon as they get there you know so I mean ... ... even for the low info voters weaponize is not going to work\nIn this rather is making a rallying cry head of the midterm elections firing of his face was false claims and by calling it a national emergency they don't think it's a national\nEmergency but seeing that burning American flags how did you hear about um the the apron yes she got caught on video or this\nIs the Democratic candidate for governor of Georgia\nSo it's very interesting right now because all of these videos are coming out about these people these candidates and\nWas this a video or is this just still this just still photo in the news either evidence I mean it's yeah it's been controversial\nAnd she also said which we never got to a couple of weeks ago that the blue wave with made up of all sorts of different people including illegals people who aren't here legally I'm\nSo I don't know these people have so many skeletons in their closet [laughter] this is just the beginning the blue wave is really dwindling\nStacey Abrams did she go to Yale Law\nSchool says you don't have enough of our yard [noise]\nI work hard here have you worked in the mirror lately when you see your smile what do you think\nLike most people you probably wish you had a wider the rich people weren't so workers and then you think ... those problems will take years it might cost you more than you could afford\nWell I've got good news for you you can have a perfect smile was just revisits the doctor how perfect miles in Nashua New Hampshire using state of the art cosmetic

... even by pro vague rent a illegal alien newspapers like the Washington Post are saying they they only want to come over here for\nA job so that there is that they're trying to get to the United states they claim I don't think a lot of them are really looking for jobs judging by what happens when they get here but they say they're looking for jobs but that doesn't give you the right to seek asylum or refugee status in a country just because you're looking for work\nIf you are looking for work so I I don't I don't understand why or why they're getting any kind of benefit of the doubt I mean I Know they're trying to embarrass Trump\nAnd you know this is the latest thing but the Democrats have no real issues to run on they've uh they've struck out with everything whether it's ah the twenty Fifth Amendment a Russian collusion\nOf the volume of its claws are Brett Kavanaugh or ... you know everything\nIt's it's all they they've struck out the economy is in is in good shape where people are working than ever before the uh the the roles of a food stamp recipients are down\nThe ... even the number of people on a on SSI has has decreased not not a lot but I no one ever thought that would any decrease was ever going to be possible\nAnd now the economy is so good even people on SSI are are getting off the couch some of them a small percentage so the Democrats are reduced to accusing him of trying to soak up here oh and ...\nI I still do get this whole show ... who who was ... where do you go in the morning to get a cup of coffee or buy a newspaper carton of milk\nIs anybody talking about this Trump is talking about it he just now wait enemy said that it was one of the worst cover ups in the history of cover ups it is\nBut the fact is\nAs Pat Buchanan pointed out his column this morning this guy was not an American\nHe was not killed in America and he was not killed by Americans\nSo you know again it's too bad that the Saudis acted in this uh in this terrible fashion and and now they're being called out by a guy who who also has blood on his hands the guy that runs turkey\nAnd in this case okay he's he's wearing a white hat but he's he's not he's locked clean he says dirtiest the Saudis\nAnd so I just I don't know I find it hard to get really worked up about it that much I mean I I certainly don't want to want us to ... to to do anything rash well that seems to be what the what the uh the the Democrats slash media are calling for\nYou know they they want they want some kind of payback who whoever heard of this guy I never did I I don't ...
