there and it's at and you know I think the Kanye West thing\nHard to say that that they're more unhinged from one day\nIt's the next 'cause we you know when it started almost two years ago now after the election you thought eventually they'll they'll\nCalmed down eventually they'll just get over it they'll just say you know what your when ... don't you learn that pretty early in life but they've come to the conclusion these people they're so privileged they're so entitled to Democrats\nThat they don't believe they should ever lose again and so therefore they have to\nTurn over the table I mean they're playing cards and they get a crappy hand they get you know that you can do about the card they get a bunch of tools in threes they're looking at it they don't just decide to get through the hand or just toss it in\nThere playing poker or whatever they turned over the table they they they won't play unless they can win and and if you happen to get a better hand than they do they want to kill you\nOr at least destroy your life\nDid you read the piece of vox today arguing for a abolishing the Supreme Court\nAbolishing not we're not going to stuffing anymore we've gotten we've gone from the Supreme Court is settled law it's a wonderful ... it's the ultimate institution to we have to pack the Supreme Court to now less than a week later we now have to abolish the Supreme Court is\nTotally get rid of inflate also has a competing piece arguing that uh we need to do away with the Senate [laughter]\n\nI've argued for getting rid of the Massachusetts state Senate I I I you know they they're ... they're been years when the U.S attorney's office was on the verge of doing away with the state Senate and but but that was to be a grand juries and indictments and you know the u._s. criminal code\nThey want to get rid of the U.S Senate okay Hi or maybe we should go back to allowing the legislatures to elect the senators would that be better would they like that more\nAbsolutely I Would like that more I mean this is apparently apparently this\nPopular election thing that we started at what a hundred and two years ago I think the first uh\nThe first popular election of senators weren't until a Nineteen sixty at least they weren't in Massachusetts maybe maybe you were allowed to earlier I don't know I don't think you were I think yeah I don't think ... is one of the progressive amendments right so they ... the constitutional amendment was passed I think it was it was passed in Congress in Nineteen Thirteen\nAnd it took a couple of years to get through in the first the first Senate elections popular elections were Nineteen sixty\nCabot Lodge defeated a honey Fitz Massachusetts was a much closer election than it would have been in the legislature only won by like sixty thousand votes was a it was a another indication that times were they were a change in Massachusetts\nSo\nIt's a so Democrats might someone says Democrats might quote Jesus turning tax tables over in the temple to uh justify their violence\nYeah but I thought a you know I thought judges were ah you know where their spiritual leaders you know they're not they're not money changers are they you know we were just it seems like just a week or so ago judges are the most wonderful ... that Sonia Sotomayor Elena\nKagan Ruth Bader Ginsburg I mean these are the most wonderful people in the world now they now what are they going to do is Elena Kagan going to be sitting there in the in the ... first session on Monday morning waiting for a case\n[laughter] I'd love to see that aid for four five hundred a forty to forty two nine nine nine\nOne seven says I'm all in on abolishing the Senate and the Supreme Court I say let bond lemon and a lot some a lot I'll decide what's best for us\nWe I liked that bond lemon you know this guy is there anything this guy can't do now we can commune with the dead\nHe he knows the way he he you know I mean he doesn't even need to like get a a an essay odds go under a crystal ball or anything he just he knows the Kanye what Kanye West mother would be rolling over in Iraq I\nMean you drink enough to ... you can commune with the debt\nI guess I get it now where is where is Kanye West's mothers shade she is she in the black hole with the Malaysian jak where where does she where does she hang up her her hate or spirit\nBut you know the thing is [laughter] [laughter]\nAnother call I thought that I thought you're opening today how he was a clip from the rec room scene in one flew over the cuckoo's nest it didn't seem that way then that\nThey but the thing is they they don't accept the fact that there are\nFair contests\nIn life whether it's for you know selling a product they're a A R track and field or a or political of that and sometimes you win and sometimes you lose but what they're saying is any event but they lose anything they lose\nIs fixed the person who defeated them is evil and must be at the very least have their lives destroyed their livelihoods destroyed probably in prison and maybe even bird at the stake\nThe only way to fight white supremacy and the Patriot act the way\nI guess I guess but\nBut you know we're all going to die we're all gonna die you\nYou perhaps you didn't notice it until Donald Trump was elected we were all going to live forever but Sarah Silverman a and alleged comedian ... by

thirty six\nYou're talking about Chelsea Handler\nI'm Talking about Sarah Silverman and some guy I never heard of named Ben ... or something who wants to I I just I was just looking at it when I was in the car that I went over written by collapse\nChelsea Handler had a a great a great joke about Lindsey Graham being gay\nGet it because he is being gay is a bad thing now I guess\nWhy are they for two weeks running I guess it's been a big ah it's been a recurring theme on Saturday Night live\nI thought this would I I felt homophobia was a bad thing\n... so now so we are all these people now are they against transgender bathrooms to\nKnow homophobia is only allowed in service to making fun of Republicans oh okay it's okay to joke that Trump and ... out of that's funny but you can't say like oh you're you're shirts gay that would be hates me\nSo so it's bad that they say Lindsey Graham the senator from South Carolina is\nGay that's OK to say that\nBut if you object to a sex offender male

calm click odds for\n'em before I get to CNN and John Lennon who I Am completely disgusted with as I was just talking to how we about during the break I Want to read this story it just stumbled across from the a P which you know if the a P is they used to be\nConsidered pretty down in the middle\nKey word does Russia which state controlled media yes so now they're ... they're just is left is any anyone else so you know if they're writing this that things are looking pretty bad for the blue wave this was the title can we talk Trump's riding high and he's got a lot to say\nSo basically the entire article which I suggest everyone read and just talking about how Trump is doing these rallies every night he hasn't had a bad story and a couple and what he considers he hasn't had a bad story in a week I mean there has been story about him but nothing that really is bothering him\nAnd he's getting all amped up from these rallies he's taking questions he's letting people in air force one he's taking so many questions that it says\nThis is a quote it said any other questions Trump asked to stunned silence the reporters can't come up with questions out they complain so much that you know he's not having enough\nProbably young fallback questions like are you still getting two scoops of ice cream Emery ... what happened to the wash the Martin Luther King\n... one of his guys that I think he's having a lot of fun right now\nHe's had a couple of successes recently and now he's just really riding this high and it seems like it's working and the more ... ... women by the you know\nThe more he the more questions he take like that that was one of the most amazing things as a couple of weeks ago when he was just taking question after question and then Jim Acosta was like do monster I'm when I'm done if you'll take a question from a female colleague of mine and he just looked at him and goes\nWhat what is he talking about like healthy questions or anybody any station like he doesn't care now because you know what you're more cost this race he uses the\nOh he is a day and capital the yeah he's a showboat to either show horse like there's nothing really to his questions you just as there he's there for Jim Costa he's not there to actually get anything done\nAnd I I Want to know what are people at CNN when Jim does this does his routine in the White House press briefing to there's a good job job that was great thanks for taking a stab\nI Know it's so bizarre and I just think that um it it it is true what they said that it it knew a lot of danger you know he could you could you could be cut out\nAt any moment for the weekly like him he really is and physical dangerous if breeze going home over\nThey say about when I'm Sean Spicer was the press secretary they they would say oh my God you've got to get him out of their ... best messenger and I do think Sarah Huckabee Sanders on a daily basis doesn't amazing job but that is really the truth is that when he gets out there and answer those questions\nHe just has a way of he can respond to things so quickly and he throws these people back on their heels and so I don't know about the blue wave but if things keep going the way they're going fingers crossed it's looking pretty good for Republicans why is why is Trump give you an interview sixty minutes so what's the\nWord of it there is part of him that ... that enjoys you know the liberal media right yeah I mean he talks with the New York times quite a bit as much as he's called at the failing New York times says it's fake news\nSaid he's talking to was we fall who's you know the Republican on the as as it were on on sixty minutes but still I mean what's the I just don't get the the upside of though\nNow what I Want to talk about is CNN I did something today for the first time that I've never done before I issued a complaint to CNN\n'cause actually filed a complaint is that what what their ... their feedback page I looked it up I said CNN feedback and they said hey like here's the feedback he'll live below the voice and so we did have a\nFile grace your complaint is holding the trash kid wanders yes\nBut I just wanted them to know that I Am disgusted absolutely disgusted with Don Lemon I watch tennis entire morning I had to look at all um clips of him from last night\nJust so condescending rolling his eyes to anyone who disagrees with them than ... mother would be rolling in our grade just so rude and\nI mean I'm Still not over the whole token negro thing that was a couple of days ago and so I just had to write it I said this is disgusting um do you guys should make an issue an apology and isn't helping any one he's just a man expressing his opinion and using his mental illness as some sort of stigma to get him to say what you want is not right\nI think if you had a flood on CNN he'd get better ratings but Don Lemon\nOh my God I think if I had one we had one and only one governor would get better ratings\nNobody ... nobody on bats channel has it he raving\nAnd you know what he does okay so I decided this morning there's a lot of anchors and pundits and stuff like I Can't stand how you know you go through stages sometimes they'll come in and I'll say like Jim Costa is the worst John Lennon may be the worst ever because this is what he doesn't someone disagrees then ... and you can play this clip later on because we don't have time and now\nYou've been crappy quarterbacks occasionally have a good game you know maybe ... how can you say that one is better than no other oh no it looked like\nHe went like this from Steve ... is making points against him during while he the guy was talking\nThis is Don limited sneeze finish\nThe finish all my thoughts nice finish I Can't I Can't [noise] well the guy was talking he's the worst of all time he's the ... [noise]\nBut at the business a long time life there for that\n[noise] it was just so removed from our [laughter]\nMuch beyond us her last has not want to watch more enjoyable experience it makes you self conscious you rode your confidence in causes you to wait ... years of your life trying to hide camouflage and generally obsess over the condition in short it pretty much socks until you call this the front O'Hare respiration\nThe complete we turn your wife around with a high GPA procedure whether you were looking to fill in your hair Weiner reverse years of your last doctor Chris China's the news team but these the final hair restoration will create a result will be a transformative experience the result of my I G the procedure was quite remarkable I now have for Ficre here\nSo I could even aware it a bit longer with the ... the final difference balding hair loss are no option but no matter where you are in New England they used to funnel hair restoration is just a short drive away Paul bow and get a free I drink tea consultation plush financing is available with payments as low as one hundred Nineteen dollars\nTune in every Saturday morning at seven thirty for a new dot coms wellness show learn how to bring out your natural beauty with advanced skin and relaxation techniques they'll have desk speakers to touch on other topics that affect everyday lives it off for tips on how to take care of yourself that Saturday mornings at seven thirty\nIn any way voyage and the Haitian why visit big wide\nKnow I you're you're right I mean we you know it's like they keep saying well let's say an unwritten pact or you know paragraph forty three of the house intelligence committee airports but we're not what we know what that's about that's about this guy Michael suspend the Democrat hack\nIs the one who had like on all the information that the FBI used when they they went to get the warrant to survey on Carter Page I mean we know we're ... we're asking them to read back at this point right\nYeah and and I think what the president is doing and uh I understand it and while I have is the same sense of frustration you do um I ... and he's allowing people to bury themselves um he now has Rosenstein completely compromised\nAnd remember Rosenstein can't be fired before the election that's politically impossible sessions are clearly is gone after the election is monumental late incompetent and useless Rosenstein remains potentially dangerous for the president\nBecause you get you gotta remember Rosenstein is a liar he's a corrupt politically corrupt officials who was involved at a minimum\nAnd an absolutely unconstitutional discussion with McCain and others about possibly using the twenty Fifth Amendment and wearing a wire so what do you do if Rosenstein\nYou leave them in Trump's world you leave him there you let them suffer you let them have to deal with Muller who by the way if you haven't noticed\nIs completely out of business when you are a special counsel [laughter] and you you know that you cannot indict the president because hey there is no crime and be the Justice Department would not allow it under their own rules but more important than that not only is there no crime\nNot not only is there no crime\nBut he is now decided\nTo accept written answers to questions that he wants to pose to the president about Russian collusion now if I'm a prosecutor\nThey I never want written answers you get that in debt positions in in rock a tourist in civil cases right but from the beginning Muller and this is the big story this week it got lost and everything else Muller is accepting written answers to questions about collusion and no questions about firing comb it\nHe has given up on the obstruction issue because there is not because the president fire call me because he has the constitutional authority to do so so what's he left with this B.

irreparable injury of continued unemployment and the harm associated with the deprivation of his personal effects\nI keep coming back to the same question I've been asking for a few years now what ever happened to the fourteenth amendment equal protection under the law so in other words Betty\nIf you're a bomb you don't have to pay your parking tickets if you're not a bomb you don't have to pay

all\n\nIt's unclear he says the the the bomb he's again who I think the question here that the Texas route who pay for the bombs lawyer the bomb is claiming it is unconstitutional to seize property for failure to pay a fine but the owner cannot afford\nWeight so it so [laughter]\nYeah I I judge I Can't afford it I Can't afford the library says I oh ten bucks I Can't afford to pay ten bucks\nMan that's\nTheir that's it see this is why you need federal judges who are say\nAnd you know I'm not saying all Obama federal judges are insane you know there was judged Casper at the at the Whitey Bolger trial they they were you know why they put me on the the serial killer the gangster put me on the on his witness list because he wanted to keep me out because he hates me\nAnd uh you know I was afraid that are being an Obama appointee she might go along with that but she didn't she she just said this is ridiculous let let Mr car back into the courtroom thank you judge Casper but I mean on the other hand you get a lot of these type of insane decisions from these Obama\nAid for four five hundred forty to forty two ah Murray your next with highway cargo had my re\nDoing very good how are

to me they brought to justice and put my hand or\n... ... college educated white women and the Seventy one says are there are few\nCollege educated white women what you have this white women with and that college eight four for five hundred forty to forty two\nBy the way a to a seven says I'm not sure if you've heard the news but the New York times just wrote a story about Maine Republican candidate for governor Sean moody and an alleged sex discrimination case in two thousand six\nYeah that's that's more jive apparently he you know the guy who ran a he runs a big auto parts company and it's we as a lot of female employees so this\nWoman's left or to have a kid and then she came back and she wasn't doing very well so she lost her job for for whatever reason so she sued and you know rather than go through you know spend tens of thousands of dollars in legal bills a lot of times uh employers just saddle up\nAnd you sign a a a a a confidentiality agreement so it's not it's not a quiz felt like he was grabbing her or anything she he claims that she she didn't do her job after she had the kid\nAnd so she said I Want a you know I Want some money so we gave her some money to go away and she signed a confidentiality agreement but guess what\nSean ... the Republican candidate for governor has had the polls\nThat is the weirdest thing that this didn't come out in any of his previous campaigns yeah strange time if you had the U.S happened that this happened\nTwelve years ago this happened twelve years ago in both sleuths at the New York times has\nSomehow were able to on earth these ah these nuggets of information by the way she opens herself and so he can't Sean moody can't comment because he too was bound by the the confidentiality agreement and being a Republican he has to\nObserve the the the contract because he's required to under the law but ... ...\nAh you know he has integrity to yeah he's a guy who won the ... what's his name on something he follows that\nThis is just this is complete jive let's uh you know let's go after\nThe the real uh the the real events that happened like ah like the the Senate candidate in Arizona saying that everybody in her home state is crazy and that the Arizona is the meth lab of democracy aid for four or five hundred the forty to forty to Jim your next with highway car go ahead Jim\nHey it's actually can I Do an alley good thank you for a\nLong time listener got introduced to my dad I had two questions or you're not really a lot of down on it I'm a millennial I serve if Adam and political seen like\nA lot more than I ever have I have two questions I Know there's something in the founding fathers writing that talks about not being Slater influenced by entertainers\nAnd I just sort of thinking on the philosophical principle could expand on that and maybe you know what the court it\nNo I don't doubt for Bill you're with that I heard\nSomewhere I second but it is that what exactly is the fight like what is going on with this whole thing I understand what happened with Kavanaugh but I don't know\nWhy I say is the ... it's ... it it refers to the foreign intelligence surveillance court\nAnd these scores were set up in the uh the Nineteen seventies and they they they weren't used all that often I think until after uh nine eleven\nBut what you do is you have the government goes in it's a secret court and the the the the judges on their federal judges and they're winded by the uh the chief justice of the U.S Supreme Court in this case Roberts\nAnd ah so they hear the these are secret there it's a secret court and they go in and image you're only supposed to use the court if you if you you can't if if you'd be giving away a ... impact counter intelligence a\nState secrets national security uh\nQuestions would be raised if you went into an open court like a U.S district court and so the these are these are it's a secret it's a secret court and so the thing is in a secret court obviously a guy like Carter Page who gets surveilled\nHe he doesn't get a get notification that there are about the surveillance so you have to you have to have\nHonesty\nBy the prosecutors by the federal government because otherwise it could be ... the process could be totally abused at what happened here Tim\nIs that a is that the or the FBI the corrupt FBI the corrupt Justice Department the corrupt Obama administration was taking a it was taking campaign smear material for Hillary Clinton and going to the cord\nAnd telling the court but it but they but this was a real intelligence rather than just a made up nonsense paid for by Hillary Clinton\nAnd the and again because it was a secret court there was no pushback\nFrom any defense witnesses are defense attorneys and that that's where the that's that's how this terrible abuses occurred\nJeeze holy crap so why aren't people in jail on I Know that sounds silly but like what what is the process like people live give us the like millennials people new to this thing can you give us specific\nYeah where people have been caught in lies and\nYet we don't know well I mean they ... they well they ... we know they've been caught in lies on this Carter Page that's what that's just what Joe diGenova the former U.S attorney was saying but Carter Page they they they went into in October of two thousand sixteen using these Clinton\nCampaign documents totally concocted fabricated and pretended that they were raw intelligence they didn't tell the judge but they ... that you know where these uh where are these allegations had come from and then they renewed\nThe or the war and there was only for Ninety Days they renewed it three times three times in the last renewal was signed by Rod Rosenstein\nAnd he claims that they didn't tell him the the the spokes are you know they you know whatever you want to call the FBI agents but but they weren't ... that they were using Clinton campaign document [noise] believe him I Do

don't know the state of the sausage is again a failure on my part not to do my research but anyway ... pm he asks her she said yes just give me a little bit of time and that's when he decided to throw the remaining sausages at his mother striking her in the right guy but good this is what he said when the police came\nThat offended stated that he got mad so he threw the remaining sausages that her because she bumped him in the kitchen oh so she started it yes he ... he added that he did nothing wrong and said that he would not have pasta sauce just at his mother had she just apologized and said
