are short Halloween so I Want to we wanted to do a little more widely stuff today will do other stuff obviously as well and uh but I but I Do want to that there are more Whitey a stories to to share with you today and\nI'm going to tell you a Halloween story from from Whitey Bolger was this was probably about I don't know close to thirty year maybe more than Thirty years ago now was in the Nineteen eighties\nThey were burying bodies at a at at this house I think it was on the east third straight\nAnd I was ... it was owned by one of the brothers of a gang member in the the brother didn't know that they were burying the bodies in the house but he but they were in the basement\nAnd so\nHe decided to sell the house so this is when the Whitey and Steve you weren't making like a million bucks when the Jo Marie would bring in a load of marijuana boatload of marijuana at the Boston Harbor\nSo\nThey are so this guy decides to sell the house and instead of instead of the spring and for like probably a hundred thousand two hundred thousand maybe I don't pops three hundred thousand to buy the house even though they got even though they're rolling and cash they say no we're not going to spend the money we don't need that house\nSo they they said we're going to dig up the bodies move the body's power straight\nFor the the parking lot it's not a parking lot anymore but it used to be a parking lot across the street from a Florian hall\nAnd so they told the Kevin Weeks and pat needed they got they got the body and you know what you know how Bones Are you know after a while you know change when you think of chicken bones or something you know you've got all these little bones that come apart sustain hate to say I hate to be so\nWant but it's it's the same with human bones you got all these little balls they fall apart up a little bones in your ear to I don't know where they're just all over the place but anyway they\nSo they they make a weeks and uh and need dig up these bodies and they're having to sift through the dirt what can through what can for the little bones to make sure they get all the bones before they moved the bodies\nSo they they pick up all the ... they dig up to three bodies and they put them in bags and then they tell me to get lost 'cause they don't trust me they think you either that they don't want 'em knowing where the bodies are so white he's already dug a big hole that they're going to bury a man down on ... street in Dorchester and so he goes they go down there\nAnd it's dark and it's Halloween and so they give they give Kevin Weeks AKA Kevin squeaks ... eight two weeks at a machine gun and they say you ... you stand here and guard that make sure nothing happens while we're uh we're\nRe entering these bones of our victims\nAnd so this guy pulls up in a car you know the you know Halloween everybody's going to parties right to drink and everything it's my time so this guy pulls up and he's just got to take a leak so he he gets out of the car and they all fall to the ground and you know Whitey and Steve you were in the hall and or weeks is up closer to the street\nAnd the guy comes it gets out of his car relieves himself and it gets back in the car\nAnd drives away Whitey jumps up after the guys gone\nAnd runs to weeks grabbed the gun starts yelling at\nFighting to show that\nWe had plenty of climate not hall\n\nThat's my that's my trick or treat story to begin the show by the way you're going to keep your lights off a tonight as for how we cart Halloween tradition no I keep the lights on I just I

I was diagnosed with you I was glad that you brought up Linda SARS sore and I think a lot of people still have forgotten this woman they only see her occasionally she appears at these rallies and\nTalks about the you know we've got to a overcome Islamophobia and all this but why don't you tell people this this woman that appears at these rallies with a Elizabeth Warren what she is all about\nWell into service or is somebody who um you know comes from the middle east is I'm\nA believer a firm believer in ... which as I think many people know really subjugate swimming in a way that I don't think even Elizabeth Warren would say is right but for some reason she works marches arm in arm with her at rallies or especially the one at the cabinet or in a anti Kevin ...\nBut all in this story is probably one of the most noted anti Semite\nIn the United states she's anti American and here's Elizabeth Warren a\nHappily sharing a microphone with her against Kavanaugh just a few weeks ago and she won't even acknowledge that she herself is aligned yourself with somebody who does not have American interests at heart so I think you know with Elizabeth Warren it's so hypocritical she talks about\nUm the evils of the president and anybody associated with him and meanwhile she has coated with people that you know I don't think normally we would want to associate themselves with and and at the same time into the discussion of civility is out there as well and you know Senator Warren has talked about you know having\nScience a scientist or whatever doctors cut open you know a Republican body she's talked about how Republicans want blood from the American people when they're trying to fix health care so you know getting a senator wind up what she does does what she says who she associates with questionable but she has allergies at these debates\n... let's go back to shore real law for a moment doesn't it make a homosexuality a capital crime um you could be executed in countries that have ... you wouldn't gauging the homosexual activity I Believe I Believe that you can also of your hand dropped off for shoplifting to how does how does she used to\nStand on the chopping your hand buffer shoplifting or a part of a surreal law\nWell look she through due process and presumption of innocence out the window with Brett Kavanaugh so I suppose civil rights for her optional I mean I I I guess it must be the new philosophy for the Democrat or progressive wing of the Democratic party\nYou know did you see how she will you obviously saw it I mean I can can you believe how she she couldn't even answer the question you know you'd think she would be able to like a Bill Clinton tap dance around there when she gets called out on this uh this report of an ethics violation but she just those ... she can't she she can't even put together a coherent\nSentence let's listen a let's listen to the cuts you got it there they've ...\nOkay I Want the cut of her uh her talking about the um\nUh about uh the uh ...\nYeah the fun ... cut cut cut\nTo one of the thing that really we found out recently I think is pretty unconscionable and the fact that Senator Warren\nWas fundraising illegally using the vote on test is Kevin ... confirmation vote to try to raise money for her campaign that just came out\nYou know that's something that you cannot be dealing first of all when we're having a national discussion about the Supreme Court is trying to find ways off it but you did and it turns out it illegal [noise]\nCan I say no go ahead please yeah question here I I hear it's their tails a statement about how wrong it was the way that Dr foreign was treated but I don't remember Mr Dale speaking up when Donald Trump made fun of her\nI don't remember Mr Dale speaking out pointing Republican or actually ... threat to Kavanaugh's nomination I I may have just missed it but I\nI don't remember I you know that's because one I don't look for every opportunity to try to grandstand now I didn't want to call you responding to the mayor of some herbal Somerville making a pretty negative statement this last week but the fact of the matter is\nThat was such an intense moment in our country's history as far as trying to deal\nWith presumption of innocence the cornerstone of our legal system and you were willing to throw it right out the window because you were part of the Senate Democrats who are trying to score political points by using poor Dr forward testimony as a way to drag down a man without any corroborating evidence so\nSo I don't think I quite understand the answer\nSo she's the but then what happens is the uh I guess it's a ... ad Harding says what about those these ... these charges against you and then she starts doing the humble nominate I liked what she calls to the ram rotted through the nomination\nThey they had a vote on it it's a vote that called for by the constitution the constitution doesn't say the Senate show ram ride through the press ... I mean this is ridiculous it's you're right we all rhetoric ...\nYeah we was seven FBI or you know investigations into the nominee meanwhile you know health care for CARE Act was ran right a truly nobody even reading the bill before they uh they passed it it's a lot I mean you know really hurt\nHer perspective of history and what happens on and on the Capitol Hill is pretty selective when it comes to what Democrats or Republicans do I think a lot of people got you know judge justice Kevin ... over the weeks at the hearings that's a lot of bologna but of course she was trying to divert away from the fact that she you know potentially has a broken the law\nYou know I I think we uh we see from these debates why when she set up our wrote the legislation setting up the consumer finance protection board the senators didn't want her to take it over they got to know or a little better and uh they didn't want anything to do with her and I now I think the ... Massachusetts are learning the same thing\nYeah how it is that they weren't on that real quick isn't the first debate I brought up the fact that you know she's so anti lobbyist I mean if you listen to her rant about lobbyists you'd think that you know they're they're\nRadioactive the fact of the matter she met with forty seven lobbyist when they were setting up the consumer financial Protection Bureau and she ended up hiring one of them to run this thing so I mean you know here's this person said one thing going in there That's Elizabeth went to a tea\nYes a and All right Jeff we'll be speaking to you before the election thank you for a ... thanks for Russ going on a speaking with us here on the highway car show yeah that's represents steel aid for four or five hundred forty to forty two I'm highway car\nYou're going going going going going for dinner\nOr a car\nIf I were brought to buy a new book from a Massachusetts made it the electrician from Walter ... addict blowing up Irish Catholic at Nineteen seventies blue collar Boston electrician now an Amazon dot com also available at\n... electrician thoughtful\nLet's be honest here last is not one of life's more enjoyable experience it's it makes you self conscious you rode your confidence in causes you to wait ... years of your life trying to hide camouflage and generally obsess over the condition in short it pretty much socks\nUntil you called based upon O'Hare respiration and make complete we turn your wife around with a high GPA procedure whether you were looking to fill in your hairline reverse years of your last doctor Chris sinus and his team at least a final hair respiration will create a result\nThere will be a transformative experience the result of my I G the procedure was quite remarkable I now have for Ficre here\nSo I could even where it a bit longer with the peace the final difference balding hair loss are now optional it no matter where you are in New England\nConvicted not hit man Freddie gas has reportedly a suspect in the death of Whitey Bolger yesterday at a federal prison in West Virginia chaos formerly a blast Springfield and serving a life sentence in connection with the two thousand three murder of Springfield my boss and an associate at the duck boat parade held to\nStay in Boston for the world series champion red Sox\nFrom the Clinton bill roofing signing and windows weather center at will be partly to mostly cloudy tonight they'll they'll around fifty rain early that afternoon showers Thursday high fifty six\nFor details on these and other stories that do to W.
