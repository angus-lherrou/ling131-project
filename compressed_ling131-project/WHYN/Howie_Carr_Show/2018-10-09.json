I mean I'm not saying that I'm ... I'm just saying there's a lot of weird weird leap going on ... from signing\nA bit of trouble back here well I think the the thing that was crazy to me it was all of the never Trump or is in the in the moon bats trying to find some like proximity reason why she left like oh you didn't like the way he talked about Brett Kavanaugh last night didn't like the ... or she didn't like the confirmation hearings or\nShe disagrees with the trade policy or there's something that she disagrees with\nWhen according to reports they've been talking about this for months now and it's just now become announced\nRight I I Know it's a ... yeah this is I mean again they're they're just fantasizing\nI mean it is a little odd though then it comes before midterms what'd you typically expect something like this to be announced after midterms livelihood unless there's some other you know act in the play\nWhat it's like a it's like Rosenstein wasn't fired yesterday you know because the midterms are coming up and they don't want any distractions uh uh you know although you know they're all these rumors going around that there's big announcements coming down with the president's supposed to have an announcement tonight right some kind of big announcement\nI Hope it's a I Hope you are talking about releasing the uh the unwritten pact that are Feisal applications and everything else I mean I Know I'm obsessed with this thing but\nI saw some of the VIPs are here to there they're hoping for that as well I just I Want to get this stuff out I I'm just I'm just still appalled by this whole thing and and you know a lot of people are so there's one that's another conspiracy theory that's going around\nIs that uh is the Trump took Rosenstein or excuse me his new name as redacted Stein\nA took a deputy attorney general rod redacted Stein down to where land though with him so that he could like you know just have them in one place on air force one\nAnd just tell them look you know I I could blow all you guys up you know all I have to do is sign one quarter ... uh you know releasing all these forms and you're all I don't know if you're going to prison but you're all going to be totally humiliated totally disgraced even even in the uh it in the ... media they'll they they have to be shocked by\nThese multiple violations of everybody's civil rights\nAnd so I'm going to just uh I Am going to keep you guys at the arms length and I got this hanging over your head and I'm not going to do anything right now now I have been a ... here here's my conspiracy theory\nOh boy he took him on the air force one because\nAs he was concerned after the election that Trump Tower was bugged or not but but surveilled because in fact it was I think how about this he he brought Rosenstein on the air force one because he knew air force one was an odd\nOr surveilled the skiff yeah yeah and also it also was rows and rows were back then Stein\nWas he ousted was he was he frisked before he went\nOn I mean again I mean Trump does want to bring stop and frisk back to Chicago so why not bring it back to air force one\nI think he needed war there I think you need more with dealing with redacted Stein than you do a you know in the loop you know I mean he ... he's on the record we have the fact that he said he claims it was a joke but he's never denied that he that he said to some of the other a corrupt or hacks\nIn the FBI and the de OJ that he would be willing to wear a wire against the president of the United States isn't that isn't that something this guy is the deputy attorney general and you still have to keep him around after ... we really are in uncharted waters here as far as the United states of America goes I mean right now\nYou know were riding the tiger and it's it's it's working out for us but this is dangerous you know when you when you have slime like redacted Stein\nAnd everybody in the mainstream media and every elder dams on the Senate Judiciary committee\nThis is a really really something to meanwhile is a is a six one seven points out a CNN has run another story on the presidential uh Jetta Talia today they so they are back to Stormy Daniels does this mean that a Michael lab and that he is going to be rehabilitated\nOr they this desperate that they have to bring by Michael ... after you know they've spent the last forty eight hours blaming him for the fact that they weren't able to succeed in uh in burning Brett Kavanaugh at the stake\nTo be fair I think Michael have and then he could get better ratings and Don Lemon [laughter] than much\nYeah I mean none of them I I mean they're all they're all terrible though there are terrible as someone says give Elizabeth Warren the ambassador shipped to the un I who who wouldn't want to I mean I guess I guess some people have made something of it that wasn't Daniel Patrick Moynihan the ambassador to the un I mean he made something out of and he got elected to the Senate\nIt is technically a cabinet level position yeah the key word is technically you know it's [noise] I just uh I I mean there's there's no ... ag secretary but it's in there yeah\nI uh uh uh five oh wait I Want Trump to kick pen soft ticketed run Haley as BP at twenty twenty\nNow you never get you to get kicked off the ticket as BP you've you've got to be some knocked like Henry Wallace at forty four or you have to be on the verge of indictment like LBJ and sixty three and that's you know that's\nThere's a good chance he was going to be thrown off the off the ticket at sixty four but
