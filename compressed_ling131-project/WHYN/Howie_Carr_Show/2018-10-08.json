citizen you learn something from reading history makes you a better citizen a better voter but\nSometimes I think to myself as I'm reading history I'd say I know this is really an interesting moment but I Wish I could I could have been at or I Wish I could see a a I Wish I could have you had a live camera there to\nTo observe what happened so\nI was thinking about that on Saturday afternoon watching the voted the Senate like you know we do is go how it was going down fifty to forty eight but still I wanted to watch it\nAnd then I heard the shrieking star the ... the hideous horrible\nYelling by the females who would invaded the these these insane people it was like it was like from ... or an insane asylum this mansion\n[noise]\nWas\n[laughter] it was it was amazing\nAnd then I thought to myself\nHow how much different is this than the Salem witch trials they're they're ... they're talking about they're calling him a rape but\nHe's not as much of a rapist there's those twenty women and I guess they shoot a man or two but the ... the women they executed in Salem and sixteen Ninety two or which is\nI mean just because somebody says you're a rapist just because somebody says your which doesn't make your which are rapists and by the way nobody ever said Brett Kavanaugh was a rapist\nWell sweat Nick that before she pulled back\nBy the you know nobody credibly accused him of doing anything other than I don't well I don't even want to get into it it's just ridiculous\nSo\nThey this was what this is what the Democrats have been reduced to an end by the way another thing I and again I don't I'm not going to I'm not going to criticize the a ... a box or anybody else for going with the demonstrators outside\nBut it was not like that was the that was not the march on Washington\nThat was not even a roe v Wade ... march or that was not even the women's march after Trump was in ... they ... when they pulled back and then a wide shot\nThere were about two hundred people there and I ... that's the number I read in the uh in in the paper since then the reports two hundred people if ... grace and I had that many quote unquote demonstrators in West Springfield on uh\nOn friday it ... the dealership\nYou know two hundred people is not a lot when you when you figure was a national thing I mean it was a good turnout at West Springfield but it wasn't such a good turnout after it's been wall to wall coverage for ah for all these uh weeks\nAnd the other thing is to they are in in large measure paid protesters there's ... there's a great column in the wall Street Journal about it today by a by this woman I think I think her name as a Asra Nomani I think she's the one who was run out of Georgetown by that not a\nFemale counter intelligence protester who says the cheese a who's who says that you want it to cash straight the Republican senators castrated them\n... you know they burned the which is at stake I think Castro ration is right up there were burning somebody at the stake isn't it that's what these people are reduced to and here's another thing too\nWhenever an institution goes against them they you know they don't just pick themselves up and say this well we got to do the red Sox lost the other night right so let's say you know what we got to do better\nTonight in Yankee Stadium we had to make sure that David pricing start that last game if there is the last game you know ... they're trying to make the corrections to wed with the less now\nThey don't want to make any corrections whenever they lose the first thing is to abolish whatever institution they weren't the fate of that\nDo you remember two years ago less than two years ago\nThey were talking about the Democrats lock on the electoral college remember that how many stories that you read about that but a million right there was one everywhere\nAnd although all left media then what happened to who lost the election what was the next step abolish the electoral college abolished the electoral college so now they have lost\nControl for the first time probably sixty Seventy years they have lost a liberal or ... liberal slash wishy majority on the Supreme Court\nWhat is the solution pack but courts act the court's FDR\nTried that eighty years ago and he was stopped in his tracks by conservative Democrats in large measure and Republicans but there aren't any more conservative Democrats so now this isn't this has got to be one of the things is like open borders are abolish ice I mean it's up to me to think about it\nEven two or three months to three days ago actually nobody would've ever ... or or rationally said let's let's packed\nThe Supreme Court let's expand the Supreme Court so we can take it over but that's the that's the liberals new care here's another thing here's another thing they they're talking about\nAll of these Republican judges a lot of them were appointed by\nPresident who lost the vote\nOf course not that the Democrats had a majority of votes themselves but they lost the popular vote but that's not the way the president is elected so all these so whenever whenever I've talked about electing judges or ah or other people\nAll of us have talked about electing judges so we can do away with the Timothy feelings you know Timothy feeling would be defeated for reelection if he ran in Massachusetts the superior court judges let all these criminals go and try to\n[noise] they always say you can elect judges\nSo now though the now the New York times and the Washington Post are both complaining that the majority of judges have been appointed by Republican presidents and at the end up most of the end that most of the votes for Kavanaugh came from states with fewer people than the states the senators were voting against them like California\nNew York so because they lost this latest\nConfirmation they want a number one pack the Supreme Court expand the number of uh justices in other words I'm using the old thirties FDR terminology packed the Supreme Court and they and they're saying they're complaining about how Supreme Court justices are selected\nThis is just these people are out of control and Trump was right to call 'em out the other night as arsonist and saying that you don't give you don't give our son is a book a matches\nYou turn over a control of the government to these people they are it's pretty clear they want to make sure that nobody ever ever has a chance\nTo ... to win another election to put them out of business or to try to put them out of business\nAnd the the they this is why this is this is such a I mean it's not overstating it to say this is such an important midterm election looks like the Republicans are okay in the Senate but again you know that you know the cliche has been overused the last few few days moving the goalpost\nYou know they say okay we've lost the seven ... remember the last week they were going to win the Senate now they okay we're going to lose the Senate but\nWe're going to really have a blue wave of the house I explain that one to me are the ... so you're gonna are you gonna have a different electorate voting in the house selection says most of the Senate elections if you if you're going to have if you have problems in the Senate I'm going to guess she got problems in the house to or vice
