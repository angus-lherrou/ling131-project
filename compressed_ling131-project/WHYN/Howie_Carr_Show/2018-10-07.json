there's another story in North Dakota\nHeidi Heitkamp is is running or\nReelection she's a Democrat and uh she is she is now down ten points to her Republican challenger who's a congressman and you know North Dakota is one of those states\nThat only ... they have so few people that they only have one Congress but so the congressman also like the senator represents the entire state and he's running ahead of her and she's she's pretty much on the she's pretty much gonna have to vote against Kavanaugh's confirmation\nAnd are they the percentage of people in North Dakota want Kavanaugh confirmed is even a greater than in\nWest Virginia meanwhile Mitch McConnell was badgered at the at the Reagan National airport yesterday by anti Kavanaugh activists that just happened to be a TV crew working with them\nUm they they said that he was pro ray and the are the people who were heckling him were identified as Tracy quarter\nThe center for popular democracies quote unquote racial justice campaign director and Nina ... positive women networks USA's positive women's network usa whatever that is executive director\nEight for four or five hundred forty to forty two last night as you know the uh the the prosecutor from Arizona who ask the questions in the morning of a of a\nChristine Blasey Ford the female prosecutor from Arizona she issued a report to the Senate Republicans pointing out all the holes in the the testimony of ah Christine Blasey Ford\nBroadcast news networks last night a continued to hammer away at the sexual assault allegations using the seventh FBI inquiry into Kavanaugh's pass this latest news for however\nThey devoted only a miniscule portion of the cabinet coverage to the memo that was released a by sex crimes prosecutor Rachel Mitchell\nAnd of course again that was a it was a pretty thorough I'd I'd be bunk of many of her rock claims\nWe've actually got a new allegation and how it what's that there was a party at a frat after Kavanaugh had graduated that included sex acts with a stripper yes and there's no evidence that Kavanaugh was there or that he was a participant but senator Coons has decided before the allegations to Grassley anyways okay\nSo Grassley basically just send them back a letter that said you believe that they may\nYeah so this is this is like the one in uh in Rhode Island where he he had a judge or were charged with rape being a woman on a boat in Newport Harbor and or at Sheldon Whitehouse went running with that to uh to to Lindsey Graham\nValley it was a grassy rights we've reached a new level of absurdity with this allegation there's no evidence that judge Kavanaugh was anywhere near the party or had anything to do with it at all in fact the only person we can be sure attended the party with the accuser himself\n... and there's another one to hear I I Can't even I I Can't even find them all now\nBut the ... now there's another story here this is by I think by NBC text messages suggests capital I wanted to refute accusers claim before it became public this is a Ramirez claim you know where she says there gaps in her uh her her memory because she was drinking so heavily\nAnd she she had to spend six days talking to her lawyers and a ... and ... before she could decide the Capitol I may have exposed himself to her\nAnd she also was texting friends asking that I ever tell you about this and uh so so now now that now it somehow bad that Kavanaugh want it to refute the accusers claims before they became public\nSo this is I mean this is what this is what they're up against this what he's up against here and but I I don't think it's I don't think it's working I don't think anything is sticky cars that there's nothing there is no they're there to quote Peter Struck on the uh on the Russia investigation into what the twenty six team Trump campaign\nSo today the New York times puts out a new story to what kind of a to keep the heat on Donald Trump as he heads the Mississippi for a campaign appearance tonight on behalf of the Republican Senate candidate down there\nAnd um it's a Trump engaged in suspect tax games as he reaped riches from his father he reaped riches from his father you inherited money\n\nAnd then here's a quote I mean a lot of this a lot of this story by the way as a as a critique of of the New York journalist who covered Donald Trump including the New York times\nI built what I built myself Mr Trump has said a narrative that was long amplified by off incredulous coverage for news organizations including the New York times\n\n[noise] of course the story of how Donald Trump got rich can not be reduced to handouts from his father\n\nBut that's what we've done in the headlines we've reduced it the handouts from his father\nBecause that's all anyone's gonna read no who's ... who's got time to read all this\nThey say that a Trump by the time he was three years old was making two hundred thousand dollars a year as part of Fred Trump's effort to hand is money down\n\nWell pretty good for a three year old [noise] [noise] well I you know there are guys\nThat have they have they're the guys in the launch woman's union in Boston who as soon as their son is born they signed him up for the longshoremen view so we can you know even if the kid as an infant isn't getting paid he's at least on the seniority\nI mean isn't isn't that something that's traditionally done you try to help out your offspring me this is actually especially to avoid\nThe death tax yeah\n\nAcross the decades aged and a better by less than aggressive journalism or back to this again I'm just you know I Can't even got time to read the whole thing it at a better by less than aggressive journalism Mr Trump has made sure his financial history would be sensationalized\nFar more than ... so there there it is it for four or five hundred forty to forty two I uh I Hope but Trump makes a trip to North Dakota just like he did to West Virginia I think he's already made a trip to North Dakota has an ... I'm pretty sure he has\nIf he's got ... if if if he's ten points up I mean he may make one more trip just the you know make sure it's in the back but I mean ten points is that\nThat's a pretty good margin over a a over a ... an incumbent senator at this break eight four for five hundred the forty to forty two at time per call what they will take will take a will take a call Tom your next with highway car go ahead Tom\nLong time listener thanks how hey kill questions why sexual assault a terrible thing but all people out there now has made the accusation and it's almost as bad into any book I have an accusation and also Blumenthal who are they in a judge him\nWell ... book or a out of the blooming falls ever been accused of sexual harassment meaning made up that story about being in Vietnam but Booker yeah Booker has admitted that he wrote a column for the uh Stanford newspaper when he was out there\nIn Palo Alto as an undergraduate saying that he had rubbed a woman at the age of Fifteen yeah I Know ... so that always said should if someone in the intro was saying if you are asked a woman in high school your wife should be ruined I mean what about what about Cory Booker he admits it\nKevin Kevin ... denies it Corey but Lloyd method it\nRight or is it a judge him at all so long though they make a sexual is Asian but also is the one that went and fabricate is a good time so you know go ahead and call him wrong so\nRight keep going\nI agree I agree what about ... Harris has passed I mean she started out as she was the girlfriend the vote Willie Brown I mean that's how she got her start in politics you know I mean who who are any of these people to watch\nThat Dick Durban accused the he compared us troops to ah to the chemical ... under Pol Pot in the red army of Joseph Stalin I mean that's the turbans background I mean they do all these Democrats have ah various ah things that they\nThey raped there she and a friend or a no cabinet and a friend raped her several times after giving her a lift home from a party she made no attempt to claim of time or a place for her alert story they forced me to go into the back seat and took to turns raping me several times each they drop\nThey took to turns raping me several times each\nThey drop me off three two blocks from my home that's where it says three two blocks from my home no one will believe if you tell be a good girl a group of white men powerful senators who won't believe me will come after me this is science Jane Doe oceanside California\nSo this is I mean so there this is what they're going after they got how many of these let her do you think they've got you know\nThis this letter written by Brett Kavanaugh's is gonna be fun for the New York times to report on\nIt said that there are Mollie Hemingway quoting from the letter that he wrote trying to organize as each week party and Kevin rope yes it would probably be a good idea on Saturday the Eighteenth to warn the neighbors that were loud obnoxious drunks with prolific viewers among us the danger of addiction is great and that would suck because of the money and because this week as big potential\nJudge Kavanaugh my name is Sheldon Whitehouse on the senator from Rhode Island\nWas this a sponsored then by the Ralph club at Georgetown Prep was already boosting going on [noise]\nUh aid for four or five hundred forty to forty two\n... meanwhile here's another story you haven't heard anything about Jared ... the Democrat nominee for governor of Colorado was involved in a physical altercation with an ex female an ex an employee who was female in which he admitted to police he pushed the woman\nAccording to a police report obtained by the Washington Free beacon\nThe incident took play dates back to June of Nineteen Ninety nine and backed by the way back in those days Jared polish his name was Jared polish shuts\nHe's now what is it with these Democrats changing their name you know Gary Hart hence\nBay toe Robert Beethoven ... what's wrong with their given names Paul your ... go ahead Paul\nHello long time listener did you ever go to a beach party when you were a teenager Paul if not we can do for the Supreme Court I organize them I I really appreciate\nWhat go a little show over the age\nAnyway had that red light and Jerry ... lives are smiling down on you you are doing service but I Want the attention to a certain facts you know\nYou are the amateur upset because senators and don't\nSeem to make a profit as ordinary people seem to know how to do is just going to find out the facts to\nBase for saying that fall I appreciate trauma why\nWhy why are you finding\nWays to trauma bay why\nWhy why aren't we why [noise]\nLove them Matthews brothers [noise]\nJoining us now on the news line is uh Derek hunter from the Daily Caller and the his title of his latest book it seems particularly apropos for the moment of it but we live in a rage Inc as an outrage incorporated a\nUh Derek guy the the uh the the outrage ink\nIndustry is a is running three chefs this week are they coming out with a Jane Doe Jane Doe one Jane Doe to Jane Doe three every every hour there's a new Jane Doe none none of them have any facts but uh the the mainstream media is just going crazy what their stories\nYou never let the facts down and we're now in a very avid me as an outrage industry your growth industry on the left it's their only political tactic they need to keep people riled up terrified or angry\nIn order to motivate them to vote because the alternative would be talking about the horrible things they want to do to this country but I'm Talia judging by the media for learning and the amount of money being funneled to go to the pages for these so called victims I'm thinking of coming out with a sexual harassment claim against judge Kavanaugh there's just\nToo much money in it right now it's it's ridiculous that any objective human beings especially an elected official could look at\nWhat's going on right there and say yeah this is totally believable and absolutely normal who these details soon each batch who need evidence we've got a narrative that needs to be fed it scary scary time and and look break or\nWhat kind of country we are going to leave my children and I have one my second one due next week so my wife is a hand grenade and she's going to be born into this world\nYeah it's it's something I'm I'm just looking at the headlines of the New York times Kavanaugh was questioned by police after bar fight in Nineteen eighty five and you think to yourself bar fight I mean he was thinking you know punches thrown and uh\nYou know people hit over the head and then you read that and then the and then the the lead they admitted that the only his only connection was he was he may have thrown an ice cube but somebody we that does that rang rise to the level of a bar fight throwing an ice cube and somebody\nI Want to know who the person was called the police saying where they were they wearing a swayed jacket ruined my life jacket or could amplify let this ice cube set on my shoulder long enough\nSuddenly truck Connors with a battery on her shoulder but it's an ice cube offended to the point that there has to be a an argument over an ice cube I mean\nI Would think we're at the point of absurdity but we didn't even stop when we cross that line we hit light speed when we got to the point of absurdity now you've got MSNBC and NBC News renting in an interview with Julie sweat Nick\nIn which she says oh yeah I've got proof here's some names go talk to these people\nOne of them says I'd never heard of Julie sweating like\nThe other one is dead and the other two haven't returned NBC's cold right now how you know how journalism works if if you're putting a story together or you've got nothing back and get up and in fact one of the people who says this is supposed to be backing up says no I don't know this person you know on that story\nBut they gave twenty minutes to that story yesterday on MSNBC and one clip\nDuring ... show and clips of it played on the nightly news I tape journalism is dead but it's been cannibal eyes\nYeah you know we used to always say that in the old Hearst newsroom in Boston never let the facts given the way of a good story but we were just kids around you know I mean it's like the ... that's the that's really a a a an a maximum now when the in some of these news rooms how 'bout how 'bout this with\nMichael ... from the Washington Examiner Michael lab and then he said Monday evening that his client Julie sweat and they did not witness firsthand\nSupreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh allegedly spiking the punch of high school parties in the early Nineteen eighties\nBut he knows a woman who claims to have seen the act and while she is willing to speak to the FBI she won't go public\n[laughter] and they'll give her name to Dianne Feinstein and right now Mazie Hirono is ruling over the prospect of funding a bronze statue of this mystery well maybe it'll just be a cloud of brown cloud because they don't\nCare anymore they're not even trying you time how when politicians would try to make plausible lives you know you weren't being right through you the truth was being massaged and that was sort of part and parcel for politics\nNow they don't even try any more they throw it out there and then they walk away from it like they didn't have anything to do with it and they're onto the next one Senator Grassley sent a letter to Chris Coons today it's pretty brutal social at circulated now on social media\nAbout an allegation that Chris Coons sent his office with no substance whatsoever that alleges that judge Kavanaugh may have attended a party\nAfter he graduated Yale are strippers were in ... at his old frat ... like he's not sure he was there but he wants the Senate to looking to judge Kavanaugh's calendar for that year to find out whether or not he might have attended it's past the point that you can't parity this any more they are overpaid\nI give me give you another one here this is a this is ...\nAt last night at ten forty PM I have a telephone conversation with a woman who will go unnamed of course\nWho lives in Florida who told me directly that mark judge Brett Kavanaugh would spike the punch with rain alcohol and ... not not grain alcohol or quite looms but grain alcohol and the ... I mean it\nCan we get Bill Cosby to comment on that is I mean I think that's a little bit of overkill isn't it but you're right there I mean everything out there and just you know we'll see whatever sticks\nI I think Bill Cosby is going to college and you know Lebanon quantity of boat [laughter]", "show_name": "Howie Carr Show", "year": "2018", "city": "Springfield", "day": "07"}
