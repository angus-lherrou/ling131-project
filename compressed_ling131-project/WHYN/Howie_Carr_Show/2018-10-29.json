handled it when the Muslim terrorists shot at Fort Hood and killed I Believe Thirteen people that day so that's a different that's just local crime that was when they you know what do you call they call it a workplace violence\nThe ... as opposed to ... suppose Donald Trump and call this ... this worship place pilots what what do you think would have been the reaction but but\nThe Obama called the workplace violence he refused to meet with one of the wounded soldiers\nWho wanted to tell them how shall I Believe they were being treated because they weren't trading or the or the Pentagon it

at the back of the base\n... and ... and there's no pushback there's there's you know there's nothing said about the way Obama handle that by the way he was yelling that guy that guy or his name was

shouldn't have been the bombs\nBut it's also if they want us to talk about what's dangerous I think it's very dangerous after something like this when you blame almost everyone except for the person who did it because if you're a crazed person\nIt used to be that after it happened people will talk about how you'll have to come together and how this person's a monster and how evil prevail sometimes but like in the end love overcome but now this guy was on the news for a hot minute and then they move on to Donald Trump\nIt's like they they don't even spend on a second discussing that this guy has serious mental problems and it's a horrible person and they just go right to explaining why Trump causes that danger and if\nYou tweet out bought some prayers they say stuff your thoughts

who immediately jumped footwear bodies are buddies aren't even cold yet she's already putting blame at Trump's feet\nShe's also the same one who tweeted out a earlier I think it was maybe a twenty

cute\nI Know really the Esquire Magazine who were on a magazine that is the real question how is the cure is still around I mean they're basically just Twitter accounts at this point but that was a very common theme with celebrities and\nJust public figures that Jewish people in America should feel bad if they supported Trump because the blood is on their hands it's their fault\nThey're responsible it's just I I Can't even I used to set might be able to connect the dots of their crazy theories but now I'm like wait a second Trump who has a Jewish daughter who's what did he went to

ran up\nA sixty five thousand dollar tab the strip club [laughter] that's one of those some of your stories of the year\nBut we need to see the receipt we need to know how is this broken down was mostly drinks are mostly strippers what they always\nSaid definitely mostly drinks I think\nThey said that they started out with like these four hundred and fifty dollar bottles of champagne which they thought was ... they were being caught but I'm I was doing the math but I don't think they have a hundred thirty bottled\nUp past what I'm saying it's going to be mostly strippers right and what if you can kind of justified because they're trying to get to take care of their mental health you know relax a little bit\nIf you if you are spending money on strippers that's usually stuff you have on hand you don't usually like charging like oh I Want to give that to pretend dollars charge it to my bell how would you do music videos\nWhen they make it rain um actually no funny story my parents were actually in London to visit my sister who studying abroad and hanging out with the jaguars no but they say they thought eagles fans everywhere and an eagles fan said to my dad I hate to tell you

of the night you want more bottles and you just really wanted a taste of the highlights life and you didn't want\nLike forty five dollars worth of sparkling water you have to let people know if you're giving them a little piece of champagne and then they keep drinking at you have to say by the way you're officially off our cat you're on your own so I'm kind of team jaguar on this one am I right\nI still think the most of it was spent on the strippers even at even at four hundred and fifty dollars a bottle there's no way you get up to sixty five\nOr ... and then they got the ... the bill and they tried to run out the door I mean I I just I Would love to you know see what the conversation was you know I mean there was we thought they were being caught or at least that's what they said yesterday after the game\nWell you know there's a pre conversation to buy the ... the bar management there were like hey keep an eye on those guys they're running up credit fab we think that I Try and

because even if there it doesn't really matter whether there is or isn't terrorist in the group it's still bad they shouldn't be allowed to come into the country and it it just kind of makes our arguments stronger I think but then they focus on well you can't prove that you can't prove that\nWell where are these diseases coming from by the way they we have all these new these are new old

involved in that if a that have led to this ah this ah for these hordes of a of of uh illegal alien swarming into the country\nAnd uh you know the the the one quote that really stands out I looked it up again was a Milton Friedman he says you cannot have open borders when you have a welfare society\nAnd that's what we're proving right now because what you have is a people who don't want to work or coming in to the country and it's just it it's it's a recipe for catastrophe and uh and and that's what we're getting\nThey did a poll in the union leader today somebody sent it to me the Manchester

Hanson\nDo the migrants ever pause and wonder whether their own past and present at present attitude to the law in the abstract man some small part explain why their own countries in the concrete are often prone to lawlessness in other words why would a host country welcome in aliens who break the law and order to\nEnter it because of their own home is lawless\n\nIt is Orwellian to leave a nation because of its lawlessness and then first whether another country illegally and second to continue to reside in con prevention up the law\n[laughter]\nMost most of the migrants claim they have no intention of diverting their odyssey to another country only America\nWill do you have often Central American government's the Mexican elite wouldn't be illegal aliens and their sympathizers and the

why would anyone wish the editor such an Illinois liberal country so different from the customs and traditions of Central America\nWould not Mexico be much better place for a refuge or a refuge for the Caribbean people given multiple offender nice of ethnicity language culture and history\nYeah\nI mean why do they want to come here at the end again they they keep then now they're marching with the flags of two of the U.S a\nLittle countries from Central America in front of them so if they if they if these countries are so terrible and there are oppressing them why are they why are they carrying their flags I I'm just I'm perplexed by this\nEight for four or five hundred forty to forty two\nYou know why can't we have people coming into this country who are actually going to contribute something to the country other than infectious diseases and ...\nYou know\nI mean I Know I Know not all of them are going to be a burden but most of them are I mean that's what the statistics show\nEven if they work they're not going to be able to make enough money there they would they going to need that English as a second language for their kids that they're that they have no health insurance when they get arrested when they get arrested they'll need translators they'll meet psychologists\nKnow ... what is that what is the upside to me as an American or to you as an American taxpayers what is the upside to to Americans of any race\nWell it's pretty clear that Democrats aren't even asking that question all they care about is making I mean they really believe that the welfare state should apply to the entire hemisphere\nWhile they just they they don't I I don't think they they they just believe that they want to get them into the country so they can make them dependent on handouts so they'll vote for Democrats they\nThey don't seem to understand you know when the when the boss or the vandals crossed into the Roman empire you know if you if you opened up

and then they were going to put up their king is the boss I mean it's not going to it's not going to end well for the Democrats if they think that importing this new underclass is going to keep them

when when Clinton was reelected I wrote a column in the wall Street Journal history has over\nOkay you just keep telling yourself that it's over a four four or five hundred forty to forty two what\nShould or what should be done about this caravan I they gotta stop they've got to stop these people ... eight for four or five hundred forty to forty two\nAh nine seven eight since the black community is why is it up to the Democrats they need another large group to exploit that's I I mean I think that as a I think this whole like illegal immigration thing is is a reason why the uh the the uh\nThe large segments of the black population are drifting away from the Democrats not to mention large segments of the Hispanic community\nI mean is it that this is about if you have a job if you have a stake in the society you don't want to bring in a millions upon millions of people who you're going to have to support and your kids are going to have to support and your grandchildren are going to have to support it doesn't make sense from any angle\nEight for four or five hundred forty\nSomething as many as I think the the may ... indicted on heroin charges out of north Hampton fifty

into another failed Latin American state\nYeah and you know Victor Davis Hanson I've just been reading from his column today I mean ... there's ... there is a certain irony here that they're they say they're fleeing Wallace knows\nAnd so they they want to come into the country illegally and like brothers and sisters were here they don't want to obey any of our laws so we're right at what kind of ... legal lawful society that they think they're going to have for very long if they wanted a U.S with their ...\nNo that's right flooded with all kinds of cultural dysfunctions that they have in their societies I mean this is why I always point out that the biggest um immigration restriction is group in Washington DC uh isn't called um you know Latin Americans\nDrive drunk and ... it's

have we been on and now we just have this never ending flow more more illegals crossing the border now than there were last year um since the caravans aren't being stopped so they're just gonna keep coming\nUm that is going to change our culture I mean what what do people think if\nI'm at what point is is it not America anymore and are we just El Salvador\nOh I I agree I agree and uh do for the president is a serious about stopping this a caravan this uh I call it the gravy train\nWell you know I'm very nervous about the ... the president is is excellent on talking and I'm making making promises and telling us what what he wants to do but when it comes to actually doing it\nUh that's where everything seems to fall apart\nUh this is by the way why we wanted a wall and maybe maybe President Trump didn't understand why that became\nThe chance of his campaign I mean as long as I pointed out before talks about a lot of things when he came down that escalator on and then he'd go out to these thirty thousand person focus groups of Trump supporters they are the ones who created the slogan of his campaign build the wall they're the ones with the build the wall hashtags\nWere chanting it every single rally and continue to do so to this day may not have understood what was so important about that\nThat rally cry about the theme of his campaign but we understood we don't want to have to keep going through these caravans every three months but the rest of our lives Trump isn't going to be president forever we need a permanent barrier on our southern border\nYeah I I agree and I and you know I I think yeah but this is one of the reasons why the percentage of black support for Republicans in the Hispanic or support for Republicans is is increasing\nI mean this is just that this is not a positive issue\nFor anybody who's in the country pays taxes legally speaks English and ... and ... bills that they have a stake in or their families have a snake their
