Ramirez shaking his junk in her face she must have been thinking of Bill Clinton but basically no one supported her story either\nAnd then one of the silent heroes of this\nHas been the porn lawyer Michael Evan Eddie boy he did a great job\nFor the Republicans he came out with such ridiculous antithetical information that no one believed word of what he said in fact the cast light away from a weight from a from a doctor forward and Debbie ... and put it on sweat Nick nobody believed in fact here's a quote from\nSenator Collins on Saturday quote some of the allegations against judge Kavanaugh illustrate why the presumption of innocence is so important\nI'm thinking in particular not of the allegations raised by professor forward\nBut at the allegation that when he was a teenager judge Kavanaugh drug multiple girls and use their weaken stayed to facilitate gang rape this outlandish allegation was put forth without any credible supporting evidence\nAnd simply parrot it public statements of others that such an allegation can find its way into the U.S Supreme Court confirmation process is a stark reminder\nAbout why the presumption of innocence is so ingrained in our American consciousness quote unquote so said the Senator Susan Collins and that was a beautiful comment I Love Susan Collins I Love Lindsey Graham and I think Michael ... he's doing a great job representing the Democratic party and needs to keep doing it\nPlus uh as far as supporting the me too movement and standing with Kevin ...\n... I read some way of a expert from the independent women's forum Julie gun like coming up later on but Patrice lay on wood 'cause it's been on my show many times\nWrote a column a son this morning Sunday Morning about supporting survivors and standing with Kavanaugh she said those to promote the slogan set up a false dichotomy if you believe that survivors of sexual assault an abuse should be able to tell their stories and find justice I Am with you\nThat you then must believe the allegations of Christine afford therefore you must agree the judge Kavanaugh was lying and you must have poses confirmation she said this is a false choice as a woman I can be sympathetic to victims of sexual abuse\nBut also care about the facts of each specific case if I was a member of a jury sitting in a rape matter my sympathy would be what the victim\nHowever I Want to hear the evidence or lack of corroboration and inconsistencies to make sure the correct parties identified and she goes on to point out the number of times the Innocence Project and others have exonerated\nThrough late ... DNA testing rape\nRape is to have spent thirty seven years in jail including Gregory towns and Van Dyke Perry who spent and combine thirty seven years in prison on false rape charges DNA testing showed that the men were not connected with the crime\nAnd the victim later after they did thirty seven years in jail admitted she lied or how about the Hofstra University case in which for Hofstra University men were indicted expelled from ... sure their lives ruined about a gang rape\nOf an Eighteen year old fellow student and twenty nine the accuser later admitted that her allegation was fabricated the authorities dropped the charges but\nThe damage to these young men and their families were already done plus innocent projects\nIt go to innocent project dot com they have hundreds and hundreds of men exonerated of rape charges when later evidence came out why can't the United States Senate understand that about Ninety percent of the allegations of rape and sexual assault or accurate but ten\nPercent or more are not accurate in other words there are uncorroborated and you need evidence which is a bedrock of American Jurisprudence destroyed or goes on to say as a woman\nAs a mother has a sister and a daughter I Believe in justice and fairness and the me too movement these fires are not in competition to treat men fairly all victims deserve justice\nBut justice is not one sided due process and fairness should be upheld for both the accuser and the accused for conservatives and liberals for women and for men\nSo when you look at the allegations of professor Christina forward\nThey completely falling apart they don't exist\nThere is no cooperation and so you can't say we support the me too movement and we also have to say that we believe in bedrock principles of due process and fairness and innocent until proven guilty those two principles are not in conflict\nExcept in the minds of Cory Booker Kamala Harris and a senator Hirono of Hawaii when asked\nThis morning whether it's right for paid democratic activist to chase down Republicans in restaurants in elevators and airports she could not say that as wrongful activity she couldn't say that in fact they indirectly demand\nViolence against Republicans and showing where we are Steven ... of the Late Show has a terrible late night product I Would never watch but I read this or the Drudge Report\nThis evening aerial doom is aerial doom is as a writer on Stephen cold bears the Late Show on CBS she wrote at six thirty six pm on Saturday quote whatever happens I'm just glad we ruin Brett Kavanaugh as life\nUnquote you see this was never about finding the truth about professor forward she was used like a three dollar steak by a Senator Feinstein and others to make public\nPrivate information that she wanted to keep private because she fit their diatribe it is unbelievable\n... and this writer for the CBS Evening show\nStephen Colbert aerial Duma says it clearly quote whatever happens I'm just glad re ruined Brett Kavanaugh as life they want it to ruin ... for the sake of ruining him because he didn't vote the way they wanted him to vote and he was nominated by Trump who they hate\nThat sums up the entire difficulties with Democrats\nThey now try to dig out from their own rubble for the coming midterms suddenly they were woken the Republican conservative majority\nAnd now we're more energized to vote than we've ever been because the Democratic party has shown us their backside and it's an ugly backside let's continue to take your calls\nWe have thousands on hold millions are listening the heroes of this fight didn't think I'd ever say this Senator Susan Collins is a hero Lindsey Graham is a hero Mitch McConnell\nIs a hero unbelievable the losers the mainstream media peddling and lives in a relevant sees\nSenate Democrats demon ... demon rats and some of them call them the Senate demon rats and mice\nImagined that imagine the status of this country imagine where we would be at this point are you kidding me unbelievable it's the best trumpet so blessed to have what he has how he has it and where he hasn't so watching that Harry\nHow good the Democrats make Mohler of a fool of themselves then they did demanding\nNo due process rights in fact Blumenthal and others who was the attorney general the Vietnam War hero ha ha talked about the fact that a judge Kavanaugh setting United States court of appeals judge does not have the presumption of innocence doesn't have it at all in fact once the allegation is made\nThat is tantamount to conviction even Michael ...
