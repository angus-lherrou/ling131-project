I I don't know and I'm Sorry okay All right Doug thinks thank you Bye bye\nAlright and Michael you've got some uh some water soft their tips\nBy being in the industry okay add one thing I Know is that there are some generic soccer is out there that you can get from a pay the plumber you have a reputable farmer and they usually get from a company called black or Frank's\nOkay older pretty generic ah water softer may usually running that six hundred dollar range him she called they might be up a little bit depending on your area\nBut a colleague and an echo water are the two companies that basically invented waters oftener uh-huh I like that and I if I was to bring out the recharge tank and replace it\nWhen it was no longer making sock water and that's why the original commercial hey collagen man because you'd be out and he'd have to come exchange the tank uh-huh ... land the uh in fact the first\nAutomatic water soccer that you put salt in on your own and didn't have to have the exchange tank thing okay and what\nThey were actually bought out by the echo water company ... man that was a privately held company but at any rate uh they create in the water software that uses the algorithm so it only to the water\nOr recharging when needed so it might only recharge your habit back a quarter of a tank okay or\nPay this and that they both water\nAnd fall and it ruins charges for\nBottom up so lift up the resume ... that we're all the other brands unless the pat and does run out every ... done it at all it was the same direction grading rivers are ... and the bad and then they lose their softening capacity over time yeah yeah\nI'll go water in may in fares Martin salt savers and you get 'em in the big box stores or you're gonna course bio from one of the dealers and a whole range anywhere from three hundred bucks at the big box stores all the way up to two thousand dollars if you're getting\nA just a unit if you get an R O U attack another grandad or you go to the big box store and get one that's made by them corn ... uh and beyond that under two hundred dollar\nAfter I'd I'd tell you I like I said I've had three water suffers and there's definitely different qualities out there um I mean for sure uh the one I have currently I'm it softens water are significantly better than the other two did\nAnd um so anyway hey thanks much for your input I Do appreciate

field uncovered for four hours for a chance to listen to the president so ah I was oh shut off to the side\nAnd I waited there about a half an hour forty five minutes wonder if it's going to happen or not I have the equipment with me so a a nice woman comes as the president's ready to see you know and I said well thank you\nSo I Walk their walk back around came around the corner\nPresidents like twenty feet away says bill hold on I'll be right with you I said I'm not\nGoing anywhere [laughter] I'm a I'm not going anywhere I'm right here\nSo it came up with change some nice days he says he listens to me\nCasually on Sunday night and thanks for what I Do on television for him I said no problem I Believe in what you're doing and I said this to him I said look either concerning twenty sixteen\nNow when you got elected you were going to be like in New York Republican kind of a moderate Republican you've turned out to be well beyond my expectations I said you make Ronald Reagan looked like a ...\nBut Democrats once you're doing is that is fabulous away exchange some more nicely these small talk and said you ready for that I said let's go so I handed him my bike and I took a Mike\nAnd I talked to him for like Thirteen minutes\nTalked a little bit about the rally happening a couple of hours later friday night we talked about the tariffs about Canada and Mexico talked about the show they talked about South Korea whenever the ashes Kavanaugh whatever it was talking about Thirteen minutes and I said I'm going to run a Sunday night is that I may be listening\nAs well Mr President thank you very much so we're going to play that interview and about a twenty twenty five minutes at the bottom\nAnd then later on and we have a Bill O'Reilly coming up and also a diamond in silk or I think fabulous and diamond in silk reminded me hit him on two or three months ago\nAbout how dangerous it is for an African American to step out of line and not to be a liberal Democrat there is no more loyal partisan voting bloc in America than African Americans especially African American women they vote like Ninety six percent democratic\nAfrican American men vote about Ninety percent but there's no more loyal partisan group for the Democratic party\nThan African Americans especially every American women some as diamond in silk about that but what happened Tuesday and Wednesday I think a ... was in the White House I might have been Tuesday or Wednesday\nAnd CNN honored Jeff Zucker viciously and racially using pejorative racial terms\nRacism attacked Kanye West for car sellers is a former Democratic or office holder and South Carolina\nNow he's a paid contributor to CNN said about Kanye West quote Kanye West is what happens when negroes don't read\nStories you know he said he's illiterate stupid he went on to say quote Donald Trump is going to use it in pervert it and he's going to have somebody who can stand with him and take pictures but then it gets worse CNN said terrorists set Meier\nWho's a coins herself as a former Republican said quote this is about ... this is an African American woman talking quote\nBlack folks are about to trade Kanye and the racial draft they've had it with him he's an attention whore like the president he's the token negro\nOf the Trump Administration unquote so you have an African American paid commentator saying number one she is speaking for all black Americans black folks are about to trade Kanye the racial draft they had it with him as she spoken to thirty five million blacks and that's what they tell her\nAnd and it really couldn't have got much worse so racism was used by CNN she went on to say quote no one should\nTake Conyers seriously he clearly has issues he's already been hospitalized unquote Jimmy Kimble\nSaid that he's irrational and the madman snoop doggy dog eat dog eat citizen Uncle Tom and so entertainers\nComics late night comics have gone after in the past Clarence Thomas\nAnd Jessie Molly Peterson and Colin Powell and Benjamin Carson in ... and others for being disloyal to the Democratic party when the Democratic party has not been anything but disloyal to African Americans and hurting them practically every chance they have\n... it's incredible to watch what's going on back for the past\nHalf century Ninety percent of black\nVoters have cast their ballots for Democrats a national elections even though it's against their self interest the Democrats have consistently opposed go choice trapping kids and failing public schools\nFor generations they've ... Democrats have promoted illegal immigration which has destroyed black working class jobs and champion Bill Clinton's prone after policies\nWhich have led to a massive levels of unemployment in black communities they've also Democrats who crippled a black families by embracing welfare writes the penalize married couples to get married it goes on and on and on\nAnd this was all set in a sense to CNN's Don Lemon\nWho laughed with venomous cuddly and what these other African Americans were saying\nCan you imagine if a white conservative Republican had called some black guy a house negro or use other racial pejorative against them they would be kicked off said but not when their own get to do it and they do it with such really\nAnd you know when you think back in history\nWhich CNN did the Kanye West borrows from an ugly ugly and tragic history of slavery and the pre civil war you see white slave owners who wrote Democrats ruthlessly\nPunished any black man or woman\nWho sought to educate themselves and think for themselves the Democrat white slave owners in the south\nHad their control blacks maintaining power over them and after the civil war ended conducted by Democrats slave owners had to release their slaves but they formed the Ku Klux Klan\nDemocrats formed the Ku Klux Klan\nAs a terrorist arm of the Democratic party\nTo intimidate murder Lynch suppress and destroy any political activities of the newly freed black population to keep them under control if they threaten the Democratic power structure believe me\nThe Democrats and the Ku Klux Klan went after them hard later on in the era of Jim Crow white Democrats\nCodify into law the idea of literacy test and other means and methods to dumb down and keep African Americans poorly educated and keep them all in line to protect their power Ninety five percent of black people continually vote for Democrats\nBecause the sample shouldn't media like the CNN and ABC NBC and CBS control black Americans to keep them in line to keep them under control where well I watch free thinking\nAfrican American men and women be personally destroyed by CNN and the mainstream media Democratic Party\nAnd so then I look at the results of the Trump Administration black unemployment historically low criminal justice reform is coming he's fighting against illegal immigration that hurts black workers he's trying to find a solution to the never ending slaughter\nOf black men by other black men in Chicago dominated only by the Democratic party\nAnd he's going to try to make it possible for Democrats to sit down at the table of equal economic opportunity and so what happened\nAnd Kanye West is the same crap that's happened to Clarence Thomas to Jesse ... Peterson the Congolese arise to any black who steps out of line they're called madman\nLike by Jimmy Kimble they're called uncle Tom's like by Snoop Dogg they're called mentally ill by Don Lemon\nAnd they allow the racism on CNN dummy employed\nAgainst a black man\nIf he doesn't express the right political viewpoints that's why CNN working with the Democratic party much destroy Kanye West and and they do their best but I don't think it's going to work I have trust and faith that African Americans maybe in three weeks\nWe'll discover and learn what the Democratic Party\nHas done to them and not for them the truth is just take a look at the education system and the crime in cities like Baltimore Chicago Detroit Memphis or Milwaukee\nThe schools are completely dysfunctional the black family is completely broken there's no job creation the average black student comes out of high school in Milwaukee or Detroit or Chicago reading about the eighth grade level unprepared for the world of the twenty first century and all those cities\nThat Democrats have been in charge for the last fifty to eighty years with no discernible results\nYet when a black man like Kanye West steps out of line him against their expressed support for a different political outlook he has called every dirty rotten filthy racial name and the book\nBecause it fits the idea of the Democratic party keeping blacks in law and they want to dissuade other\nThat's an A.

basis they need it and she had a big impact on me I Will tell you a bill she really had a big impact\nOn me and the other thing the mid west I looked at Canada Mexico and South Korea [noise]\nMillions of jobs have been credit and you were told a year or two ago by Gary Cohn and others that you know the candidate deal is probably not going to happen Mexico's too tough NAFTA is ingrained what'd you do that caused Canada may not be real happy right now in Mexico may not be real happy and then South Korea\nTo kind of play because we're the big dog in the kennel but they don't treat it that way what did you do with the\nTrade deal and we're also the piggy bank that everybody wants to come in and Rob\nAnd uh Mexico we made a deal and we told her look otherwise we're going to have to just to actually car industry which would have been bad for them and frankly I wouldn't have wanted to do it but we were going to do it and\nWe made a deal with Mexico we could not make a deal with Canada they just wouldn't make a deal that was fair for us because NAFTA was a total and complete disaster you know that better than ... you saw what happened over here with you still have building's empty

with South Korea which is fabulous as much a a much improved approved deal you know improved I Will say that Hillary Clinton do you remember she made that deal and she said it's two hundred and fifty thousand jobs and she was right for South Korea so they got two hundred and fifty we didn't get two hundred and fifty\nIt was a terrible deal so essentially we terminated that deal and we made a new

all these great things happening the media objectively covering\nThe Trump Administration give me fifty fifty somebody's talking the other day and said why do you think it is CBS NBC ABC\nOr the New York times Washington Post every big city newspaper Hollywood movies too late night comics are all one way and and I said\nI I guess it's groupthink because they all live in either Hollywood or New
