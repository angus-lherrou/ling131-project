Springfield\nA regular army of Honduran migrants streaming through southern Mexico toward America is made an end run this afternoon\nAround Mexican agents who briefly stopped them the numbers of straw to about ten thousand and every time you watch ABC or CNN interview one of them they talk about a gentleman by talking about what Trump wants you to do and the F. word all these things are shouted against our president\nThere are getting help from sympathetic Mexicans at every turn offer them food and water clothing transportation\nDriving pickup trucks and vans and cargo truck stop to let them clamor board to go north and so over the next several weeks we're going to have tens\nOf thousands of individuals from the most violent place on Mother Earth make their way into Texas Nevada Arizona and basically the media is telling us we should encourage it an outlet and and let it occur\nBack Nancy Pelosi said Saturday that she would welcome all of the migrants from Central America all of them well there's about thirty five million who live in Central America there's about a hundred and forty million in Mexico there isn't\nThere are two hundred million in South America polling has indicated given a choice South American Central Americans and Mexicans\nSomething like two hundred million would come to America to a hundred million what would that do to our government to our welfare spending ... hospitals do our presidents we wouldn't have a country anymore to hundred million want to come here\nAnd because the way the law is constituted that are the Democrats were not allowed to change it takes ten Democrats\nAnd the Senate to do anything and they won't permit it they will permit that because if you're from other than Mexico to him the other words from Central America\nAnd you may go to America there's a magic card that you have to read seeking refugee status and that begins a legal process it will take years in the meantime you're inside of America waiting for hearing that cannot take place\nWe are not scaled to have enough camps they have enough judicial officers do you have enough lawyers are not scaled for any of this to allow tens of thousands or millions to arrive at our border so far this year until October first which is what about two and a half weeks ago we have a hundred and Seventy five thousand\nMigrants have come to America this year from a central and South America\nHundred and Seventy five thousand we don't have the judges the lawyers the courtrooms to hold hearings hundred and seven hundred Seventy five thousand when you have five to ten year backlogs of millions who adopted her jak and so the game being played\nBy the Democrats as extremely serious if you're from Mexico here illegally you're going to take and right back immediately if you're from Central America you have the right to hear that goes on and on and on and never stops\nSo uh I I'm interested to see when\nAnd if the media will change their coverage to provide objective information the damages caused by unbridled massive\nIllegal migration from third world poverty driven criminals societies into America and what the impact that has in schools orphanages hospitals and the rest there's no media coverage of what's happening in Nevada Arizona California\nTaxes to New Mexico through legal migration ... there's no coverage it doesn't exist the murders of rapes et cetera it does not exist\nRemember that nine of the ten most violent countries in the world or south of the U.S border sixteen of the twenty most violent the other foreign Africa and they're invading our country they don't have uniforms on but they're coming here in mass incentivized by our media by the Democratic party\nI sat in twenty sixteen the reason Trump shocked the world\nWas because of illegal immigration\nFederal judges\nAnd the economy right now with Trump is our leader everything is coming up roses it's unbelievable\nTrump has everyone from North Korea to Russia believing we're about to bust up every new trading necessary to keep to get America back on track the trade imbalances are starting to flip it was an economy exceeding five percent GDP the unemployment numbers so not just the ... they're the lowest they ever could be the or\nThe other three point seven percent of us would not work can be put a gun to their head\nThe terrorists are on the run ISIS is destroyed Iran is on notice in marginalized\nAnd even the Saudis now are doing some soul searching about how they treat people opioid issues prison reform marijuana reform is all coming on the rise this guy is performing magnificently but the media is going to use they think immigration the tank\nThe twenty eight teams to favor the Democrats and the tank this president and twenty twenty now that's not the world that I live in maybe if you live in Connecticut a Las Vegas or Chicago or California San Diego that's the world you live and you want more individual is here with a third grade education\nEighteen to twenty eight years old with no marketable skills not able to speak at the English you want maybe a few thousand more in your community please bring them according to the Democratic party but that's not the word I live in Cincinnati, Ohio I don't think\nThose who think about these issues in Las Vegas or Chicago\nOr California San Diego Tampa Denver Cincinnati I don't think we think about these issues in ways that the mainstream media can understand I must live in some alternative universe because according to CNN this is the issue of unbridled migrants walking into America\nThat will cause average Americans living in Wisconsin and Michigan\nThe vote for the Democratic party if that's the case I live in some alternative universe that's not the world in which I live\nI'm Sorry and I wish there was some way through the magic wand that we go to help the two or three hundred million Mexicans Central Americans\nAnd south Americans not living a great life that don't have the opportunities that you and I have\nWe're only four percent of the world's population but every year legally through presidency's we've taken legally one point one million foreigners to come into America take the oath of office and become American citizens which is more than the rest of the world put together we already do that one point one million\nBut I'll be damned if I'm going to sit here\nAnd watch hordes of young males\nFrom El Salvador Guatemala and Nicaragua Mexico Venezuela Colombia\nPeru Bolivia Paraguay why Europe why Brazil and Argentina it simply illegally make their way somehow into America claim their quota refugee get in line for hearings five or ten years from now that will never happen this is fundamentally\nChanged our country that is far\nAnd it's going to be much worse if in twenty Eighteen one and two weeks two weeks in two days\nThe Democrats take the house and or the Senate if that out if that happens the country we live and will cease to exist do we have the do we have the wherewithal to take in a hundred million people are the schools coined in such a fashion or the hospitals ready to go\nOther bridges the roads the expressway ready to accept a hundred million more people\nBecause the Democratic party says that's what's coming how is this possible that's the most violent\nPlaces on earth is sending us largely young males to come into America I got a Kevin Jackson coming up later an African American leader of great note there is no race or group of people more hurt by legal immigration than African American males especially young African American males\nThey figured out that this is not benefit them at all doesn't benefit American business does it better for the American public education\nDoes it benefit the hospital systems that we have the benefit of any part of our does it benefit our jobs economy absolutely not we bring in legally one point one million you know I'm proud to say that\nWe are a nation of immigrants but there are legal immigrants you don't determine for yourself to join the country come\nIn walk into a country which you don't belong to a not a citizen up then demand rights are you kidding me oh last year the question tonight is that the issue that's going to cause\nMillions of Americans in two weeks in two days to vote for Democrats do you believe that one eight six six six or seven seven three three seven we continue\nWe have calls from a Chicago Los Vegas Connecticut California\nSan Diego and every place in between coming up later will be Corey Lewandowski who was the Trump campaign manager for a year and a half and twenty six team did a great job I'm going to have ... plus Kevin Jackson\nTwenty minutes after they are built counting on the great American live with you every Sunday night

about seven hundred will be gone down in the south side of Chicago women are raped and brutalized in torture and on a regular basis\n... inside of America much less and other parts of the world so why is the media focusing on\nA murder and turkey because if it's a journalist excuse me ... without a journalist there was a\nPart time contributor to the Washington Post but\nEven if he was quote a journalist does that have more value to me that a police officer or someone to someone I American soldier killed absolutely not\nYou know I I\nI'm waiting for the outrage from CNN about forty Mexican journalist murdered in the past two years in Mexico by drug cartels have you heard about any of their you know who they are to me because show narrative as a hustle\nIt's fake news it's a ploy used to attack Donald J Trump to undermine his Middle East policy which is works so well they're exploring his death and weaponize is death\nAs a cudgel against the Trump stir that's what's going on\nI guarantee you he his life as no more value than a truck drivers lie for cops life a soldier's life or waitresses life for coal miners life a taxi drivers life all the might be murdered brutally tortured happens all the time in America and elsewhere so why is the death\nOf a Saudi Arabian in Turkey big news\nBecause the media wants to use that as a club against the president and his Middle East policy and I think there is those at CNN and mainstream media that do not do not like the fact that Israel now has a friend in Saudi Arabia\nThey don't like that and I bought the half million Syrians killed by Iran and by Russia by barrel bombs any of those lights up meeting the CNN no because they cannot be used as a weapon against this president they want to\nAct as if when Trump says bad things about journalist so Maui indirectly cause the death of Jamal could show geek in Turkey who believes is crap it's unbelievable\nBut let's continue\nBelong becomes available it never does one eight six six six or seven seven three three seven the thing\nIs tonight if we can focus on illegal migrants swelling to ten thousand vowing to reach the U.S supported by the Democratic party incentivize rather mainstream media and the fact that Jamal can show gate if he was my father if he was my brother\nI'd be outrage at is that that was ... it should not have died\nSaudi Arabians do this all the time Syrians Iranians Iraqis inside of America there are several hundred black guys killed every year in Chicago and one hundred dead cops can you name one cop killed in America this year give me the name and your mind think give me the name of one cup right now\nI bet you can't because it made it uncovered\nYou mean Jamal could show\nA Saudi Arabian killed in Turkey is more important to us that a brave police officer\nWho gave his life is that what CNN believes the answer is yes\nThey want to use ... as a cudgel against Trump\nAnd why I have no idea it must have nothing else to talk about\nLet's continue when we do is go right to the call [noise]\nOne becomes available you know the routine built hunting and the great American [noise]\n[noise]\nThe optimal introducing new

Blumenthal he's been off require the cabin out here and granted\nI Know for a fact he's working on this a caravan with a lot of other Democrats across the country\nAnd he's probably going to be down at the border and a week or so they're trying to get over a hundred thousand of them all the rights of the border you know by the time this thing hits the fan President Trump has already said he's not usually reserved seats aren't using their real army and I think the plan is they want to get like another ... current state kinds of powers and\nYou go to our troops on the border\nThe immigrants are being told oh don't worry store of it like stormed the Mexican border a few days ago ... how do you put in a a token effort to hold them back twenty four hours or this is the ... the U.S and see a deal with Mexico because Trump has got to say that Mexico whites you write all these people on our border\nThe troops are going to be there they got to be colder stormed the troops\nI think there's got to be a lot of gunfire a lot of Democrats are going to be there there are no ... for the media the media we're this is all according to\nOffend them and that's why you're from a Dick Blumenthal he used a war hero a state of Connecticut but in Connecticut which is a deep blue state in financial difficulty I does this play well with residents of Connecticut because when I watch CNN or ABC News I'm thinking they're thinking\nThis is playing horribly for Trump where I live in Ohio\nWe don't want ... will happily\nTake one point one million every year more than the rest of the world put together as legal citizens who take the oath and go through the process we don't want hordes of illegals coming from the most violent places on earth we don't want that is this playing well in Connecticut\nIn ... in Connecticut there's so many people fleeing the state because of the high taxes I think the typical person in Connecticut has been a legal immigrant there's tens of thousands of them here thanks to Governor Malloy ... into the past year and a half\nThe Blumenthal every time these legal immigrants ice is about the court room they hold up her shirt\nBlumenthal shows up at the church with other Congress people from Connecticut in front of the TV cameras and they plead their case these people should be allowed to stay blah blah blah and eventually be ice a suspense\nTheir case you know for future here he's in front of the CD cameras all all the time trying to see the eagles illegal immigrants here in Connecticut\nAnd you know it's disgusting and remember remember here's the deal if you're from Mexico and getting caught you send back immediately because of the law if you're from Central America and you say the magical words I'm a refugee and I want to hearing you get in line\nWith a couple of million others and you never ever hearing then you released back into American emotion can be held his fourteen days there's not we're not scale to handle this invasion for the most violent places on earth Central American we're not scaled to doing\nContinue with added no Los Vegas Nevada and ... and welcome to the bill Cunningham show ed please go ahead\nYes first of all the FBI and the U.S national security establishment should investigate and find out who's funding the current a con boys or that\nOr whatever they are called uh they can't have that capability and they should find out who's doing it also how can a bomb a drone American citizens like this Ella we eat guy kill them all up you know ... and then the media doesn't Cheney's no doubt that they really do much later they killed as a sixteen year old son\nWell and it's because you know ... ... you could shoot him in in the view of CNN ... can be used as a club or against Trump they'll do it but they're out of whack he's being killed by Obama's no big deal the Iowa college kid raped and killed by not a legal immigrant\nOr not was quickly dropped she's gone a composite or killed on a regular basis no big deal in fact that ... that kind of behavior in that part of the world\nIs regular that's what goes on there and I don't like it much but I think CNN doesn't like the fact that Israel is become friendly with Saudi Arabia I mean when I heard Trump and somehow I hear Trump's comments about journalists\nAnd then I hear about cars show again is if Trump indirectly killed the guy that is what CNN get do and why why is his life more valuable than a cubs life\nBoy NPR ... which is subsidized by the taxpayers is the same I end up look at the head of the past set of who's back to stand up oil as political opponents ripe old Porsche and Obama and Secretary Clinton looked at the other way that guy because we needed to base their supply Afghanistan\n... says African Business conference that Obama held repair the African leaders and I think the daily mail newspaper looked at it and it was the ...\nGallery of human rights violators and corrupt officials but you know the media like CNN and MSNBC and NPR they just falling over how the great Obama was reaching out to Africa not looking at the human rights background of this spot\nFortress African leaders so the whole thing is ...\n... and you went over that quickly but use backers than had a leader\nWho would boil alive his political opponents\nThat's not always there's about a thirty eight forty million people who live in Guatemala Honduras El Salvador Nicaragua about thirty five to forty million how many would come to America given a choice in the Democrats got in charge and a complete open borders how many would come\nI probably say oh well all of them [laughter] forty million right that would come\nBut you know it's funny because there's also a lot of there's a lot of a love for American hunter\nStores like ... you'll see the American flag you know sit on the wall she lays there is so they're headed back\nThat was even that does is getting off the site or a little bit I was thinking it would be good to make Honduras the fifty first date of like oh my God\n[laughter] and the reason why is because people if we if we could come and run their country and give it a local government\nIt would people would jump to that and they would be more patriotic\nThan you didn't have a gym thank you but here's some fact during the violent death rate in Honduras is Ninety five per one hundred thousand\nNine of the ten most violent countries on earth or south us border sixteen or the twenty most violent or sell U.S born or the other four are small countries in Africa\nSo we're

camps are not big enough we're talking about this year so far\nOne hundred and Seventy five thousand kind of under the radar we're talking about tens of thousands more coming at one time were not scaled to do it\nDoesn't work that way the federal law odd to say that upon arrival from Central America or any other place you're sent back to your country of origin immediately that's not federal law federal law says Mexican Jess other countries you know\nSo if you're from El Salvador Nicaragua Guatemala or Honduras or Venezuela and you show up on the southern border instead of Flint and running away from the cops border patrol these individuals run toward the police and say in English I demand refugee status that the amount of hair and\nThen they had three processed it takes to lots

about tens\nOf thousands a month coming into America we don't have the money it doesn't work what needs to happen is the federal law needs to be changed with the cooperation of the Democratic

event they watched that the struggle to Japanese and how can the\nUs some reason [noise] I think it's because I'm immigrants so it's not exactly something that\nIt was in court treat and it's really I

of capitalism and conservatism\nThe worst run states in America are controlled by the Democratic party and the best run states in America are controlled by the Republican Party but thanks for calling let's continue with more\nI'm gonna put a call in or to Corey Lewandowski urine about five minutes see was the campaign manager for Donald Trump for like a year and a half and I'm going to ask him about the immigration crisis when I look at the Drudge Report tonight much stimulate oh hell is breaking loose and ABC and\nNBC and CNN thinks this is the vehicle they're going to drive for the next two weeks in two days to bring down the Republicans in Congress and I say oh contrary mon for air I Believe\nThe three reasons Trump got elected was number one the economy number two immigration number three federal judges here's performed magnificently\nAnd all three areas and and I think this is the October surprise that will sink the Democratic party come the next sixteen days let's continue with more have long becomes available eight six six six or seven seven three three seven\nComing up in about five minutes from Corey Lewandowski top of the next Darwin Kevin ... near the blacks fear\nTo talk about why he was like oh by Fox and the impact in the black community of illegal immigration good at the bottom of the last hour we're going to have on a report from Peter Wallison who's written a book about the deep state the fourth branch of\nGovernment which is the bureaucracy those continuous more built Cunningham the great American\n[noise]\nHelp stop bully be more than a bystander and stop bullying dot Gov ground zero week nights at ten one use radio five sixty WHYY and\nDoing well you know about a week ago I spent some time with the president to privately it was wonderful\nYou spent like hundreds or thousands of hours with the guy and I said on the air the other day that uh there there's a differential between what I see in the media sometimes with the president and how he truly is before we get on to so many issues going on especially the mobs versus jobs and all that kind of stuff\nYou know the American people a measure of the man himself\nWell you know I've spent so much time with a then candidate Trump and now President Trump and a truly cares about other people he's extremely uh magnanimous\nAnd private he is funny he's gracious he's always asking about how my family is doing and what he can do to help me that just who he is and if you listen to the media you know they tell you he's the worst human being on the planet help but the truth is he's exceptionally\nGracious I've seen in so many times helping people that never get the story told because he doesn't want the story told but he's always there to help whenever he can\nWhat why is that because the media ought to be calling balls and strikes you know they ought to be saying well this is what's going right this is what's going wrong media ... Research Center bows out well bred present one of my buddies ... every few months as the media coverage is Ninety two percent negative Ninety five percent negative\nThe media is protected by the U.S constitution only business in America that gets constitutional protection and the media should call balls and strikes a lot of good stuff a lot of bad stuff why does the media only report the bad enough to good\nBecause they only report the bad and this administration the Obama administration you would think that our economy is growing at four percent and we had more Americans working than any other time in our nation's history conflated those to see Trump agenda is not what the mainstream media wants to talk about\nI here's a great example just last week I think it was a President Trump did an interview with Leslie stall for sixty minutes she interrupted him sixty five times during that interview had to put that in comparison when sixty minutes during an interview with bronco bomb or a couple of years ago they interrupted him more times\nHave their own agenda their agenda is to make the president look bad\nNot to give him credit that he deserves for the successes that he's had because they no longer in the business of reporting the news they are now in the business of making the news and that\nThe big change over the last two decades\nCorey Lewandowski the president or the other night Montana framed it as mobs versus jobs the only difference is the Edmond J and I think that's brilliant on his part because one\nLook at Brett Kavanaugh will look about a trucks that ever trumps sticker on getting burned I look at Congress mean getting shot I look at the Republican congressman Republican operatives getting beat up and getting stuck in the side with tens\nI look at how you're confronted in airports in restaurants mobs versus jobs and do you think the average American I think forty percent of what the president forty percent oppose him there's twenty percent going back and forth do you think that the moniker of the president mobs versus jobs is going to stick\nCry I think it will stick because what the American people see and hear what people like Eric Holder had to say very recently when they're down we kick them and we kick them in the head you know the the calls to violence by the leaders of the Democratic party whether it's\nA Maxine Waters or other is saying if you see them in a gas station if you see them in a restaurant you go after them you don't give them a break\nYou know that's not the way our country is supposed to be and I didn't support Brock Obama but never ever ever did I ever remember Republicans or conservatives for that matter going after members of the previous administration when they're eating dinner at a restaurant we've now seen it with Sarah Huckabee Sanders we've seen with secretary\nNielsen of the guests we've seen with Senator Ted Cruz we've seen what happened to Congressman Steve ... where he almost lost his life because the mob violence antifa is so out of control there you go on their desire is destruction\nIt's not to make our country better this president has created I think over for a million new jobs in the last Twenty one months and that's where we should be doing look even if you don't want\nThis president if you didn't want him to succeed you want him to succeed because you want our country is exceed\nAnd that's what the differences that Democrats I hate to say this and they hate this president more than they love their country\nOr the other issue the culturally acceptable didn't mean to fame and to make fun of and dismay or the president and the first lady you may recall about a week ago TI who's a rapper that I Will watch nonetheless I saw him and TMZ and I did a video in which a look alike millennia Trump\nWas stripping nude in the oval office performing sex act in the oval office and it was culturally acceptable to do that I'm sure he might sell a lot of\nLot of his songs and records from that can you imagine three years ago if a country artist had to pick the Michelle Obama stripping naked in the oval office and performing sex acts in the oval office what would the outcry from the media have been if it was Michelle Obama\nIt would be front page news for a week on end that wrap that the uh the country artist would have had his life probably threatened on multiple occasions but look let's go back to just about a week ago Hillary Clinton gave an interview about her husband and his relationship with Monica Lewinsky\nAnd they asked her do you think that relationship was inappropriate and less than two weeks ago her answer was no\nIt was appropriate because she was an adult\nHe was president of the United states leader of the free world Monica Lewinsky was an intern and Hillary Clinton was still justifying her husband's behavior can you imagine for one second that was the the converse if Donald Trump had done that with oh during the media would be saying oh", "show_name": "Bill Cunningham", "year": "2018", "city": "Springfield", "day": "22"}
