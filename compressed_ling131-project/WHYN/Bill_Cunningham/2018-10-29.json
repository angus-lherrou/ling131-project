Khan about is I Need to I Want to help my daughter with a Dr ...\nParents and the bathroom and it where uh try that paper holder is attached to the wall\nThere are two ... one of the impact the other one in completely off the wall and their drywall call there in a heavily about an hour and a half a wider quaint parents hate and maybe\nBeing wrong but I don't know I even took a class\nAnd I candy how on and on about Dr wallich here that I'm Wondering how they're going to work with Hank ... hats that racket there there's nothing behind the drywall I mean it's just open space\nAnd how big is so we have two holes that are the brackets said hold the wallpaper or the toilet paper a holder on the wall or maybe like a ... inch and a half long and maybe an inch high was is that close in their eyes craves oddly\n... half or so tall and not very wide ... about about an inch wide of ...\nAnd then there's two screws that go through that into the drywall\nI Believe that closely at the bracket but I'm Wondering if if that three haired and I don't know just here [noise] um [noise] it's something you can be done other than just the packing material put on there and you're probably going to any\nMore than that you're probably going to need a little bit more than that let me ask you a question the whole where that bracket that whole bracket the one bracket is no longer attached to the drywall so there's a whole they're correct right and how big is that whole\nWell it's probably not more than an inch an inch and a half at the higher higher wise about its very cake and it's not all the same time that it about three inches wide or sell\nOkay so that's going to be a challenge to patch it and then to come back in a put a bracket on it so that I was afraid yeah so there's a couple of things we could do I'm One\nOf the things you might do is good and ... and ... and play is something that may be ... just\nImagine a block of wood that would cover that both of those brackets and king and they sell those decorative once okay oh and we would take that other bracket out All right and we would basically install\nThis six gushing or this backer piece okay so\nThat would be that would be visible that would go on on\nOn the surface it would be decorative you can go up to the hardware store and you'll see 'em they Darren Woods some memories sustain you could paint 'em and it's just a an ornate\nA backers backer piece that goes over both holes that would get screwed and then you could screw the toilet brackets on to that piece of wood and re install your toilet holder your toilet paper home okay I'd take a look at that there's also plates that you can\nYou know install over the whole uh but that's going to be a little bit challenging to than mount something on there I Would really take a look at some of your options on an excursion\nA toilet paper over there and walk through the ... all the different folders I think you'll find something better work nicely for

and the entire thirty preserve\nAnd they had on the the the doctor\nWho understands saved his life\nFrom the emergency room in Pittsburgh Allegheny General Hospital\nAnd not a doctor is Jewish\nAnd the two nurses who first arrived at the scene to save the rotten filthy life for Robert powers are Jewish\nHow serendipitous the Jews save the life of Robert Bowers and if I was in charge I Would a\nDeal with all the other ones first to deal with him last to know fully what a blood out but unfortunately he's alive now being cared for in a Pittsburgh hospital by Jewish doctor my God\nAnd so I look about what happened in the hate this guy exhibited for many many months and I like to know where are the people he communicated with was he on friend that was ... who else knew what he ... he was saying the things he was saying and and by the way\nHated Donald Trump because Trump was a great friend of Israel and Bowers also had a Trump because Trump is the only American president in history they're Jewish grandchildren his daughter Ivanka\nHas become an observant Jew her husband Jared Kushner is a ah Orthodox Jew the children the president's children are Jews the president has attended many Jewish\nReligious functions is I have and so this guy who ah hates Jews and wanted to kill Jews mentally ill no criminal past his neighbor said it was a great guy always very friendly and went after Trump for loving Jews\nIs now Trump is being attacked by the mainstream media in Washington Post for somehow causing directly or indirectly the murder of Jews\nWhen Trump is the best friend Israel and the Jewish people I've ever had a few hours ago\nSarah Sanders put out a tweet presidential press secretary quote is there any tragedy\nThe Washington Post went out exploit to attack President Trump the evil act of anti Semitism in Pittsburgh\nWas committed by a coward who hated President Trump because President Trump is an unapologetic defender of the Jewish community and the state of Israel so one headline Saturday yesterday and the Washington Post said\nBomb suspect found an inspiration and Trump\nSo the media is saying that ... was encouraging incentivized by Trump to put out a fourteen bombs simulating the killing of two ex presidents and twelve other a notable Americans so that the president's being tried to assassination\nAttempts and the murder of Jews not by some far left wing website is filled with hate\nBut by CNN by MSNBC and by the Washington Post\nThat are supposedly mainstream objective news sources which of course they're not in fact on the day that CNN received the photo bomb in the mail from ...\nThe New York times ran a progressive fiction depicting the secret service itself assassinating President Trump with Russian help it's unbelievable on that day and in fact CNN's parent company Time Warner\nAs you may know what's a co sponsor of the play in Washington park that simulated the stabbing the murder of the president last June performing Shakespeare's Julius Caesar they had an actor playing Caesar dressed up like Trump he was stabbed to death\nEach time and their performance\nAnd uh one of the sponsors of that was the parent company of CNN now can you imagine the reaction if say the summer of twenty Fifteen that one of the parent company of Fox News\nHad a play in Central Park that simulated this stabbing the vicious murder upper Iraq Hussein Obama I Want to know the media reaction to that event but the parent company of CNN\nPaid money to sponsor see Julius Caesar's Julius Caesar\nThat had the an actor playing Caesar dressed as Trump\nBeing stabbed to death in fact after James Hodgkinson attempt at the masses assassination of Republican members of Congress resulting in a mortar wounds to Stephen ...\nThe Washington Post the next day ran a story about stirring up violence focusing on right wing talk radio even though Hodgkinson was a supporter an advocate of a Bernie Sanders\nAnd also posted many complimentary things about Rachel Maddow so instead of focusing on the fact Hodgkinson actually traveled hundreds of miles to the cap and take the leadership of the house of representatives and it was a Democrat a Bernie Sanders supporter\nOr frequent viewer of MSNBC the Washington Post ran a story about violence stirred up by right wing talk radio over the last several weeks\nMuch like the uh the photo bomb sent to about fourteen people there have been at least twenty examples of left wing or sending envelopes filled with white powder to many many Republicans in fact all Republicans\nPeople like sex or a defense James Mattis the president himself the vice president all the adult children\nOf a President Trump have received in the mail envelopes containing white powder simulating rice\nIn fact the the the rice in like substance was sent to the home of Senator Susan Collins after she voted in favor of Brett Kavanaugh so all this is going on for weeks and weeks and weeks and the media largely did not cover it because all the news that fits they print and if that\nDoesn't fit and then they don't print it\nIf there is a political violence committed by James Hodgkinson of Illinois they blame conservative right wing talk radio of course we know about Ted Cruz an IT cruise chased out of restaurants and also when a Senator McConnell was having dinner in a ... restaurant\nA Democrat grabbed his food and threw it in the street other diners came to the assistance of Senator McConnell who's a survivor of polio and his wife who's in the cabinet and the media\nDoesn't want to call those actions a mob in fact one\nCNN anchor brick Baldwin and Don Lemon chastised Republicans for using the quote andme word one other example\nWhenever a white nationalist they've got the right to do it but I Wish they would march in the street\nProgressive activist cover the words they express as violence but win largely violent leftist from in ... and other progressive groups commit acts of violence\nCausing thousands of dollars worth of damage on college campuses the media never covers it that way at all and so this is a long history\nOf radical leftist\nAnd so I'm On the right committing acts of violence that is covered completely differently by the objective mainstream media the worst in my opinion is Time Warner the parent company of CNN\nProviding money to sponsor a Shakespeare play Julius Caesar when the main actors\nDressed up as Trump and he stabbed to death and people applied in fact when Louis ... Louis Farrakhan the left wing nation of Islam begun the anti Semite set a large rally that Jews are termites in thousands\nSenator Susan Collins received the so called rice and white powder this is terrible it's awful ... are you aware of this was going on just the media cover it like they cover the full bomb attacks\nBy ... not even close both of these events are terrible those responsible should be held to account there's been several arrests of individuals or a Democrat and activists on the left\nMove sent these substances to the Trump children to the secretary of defense to the president the vice president the press secretary and other Republican lawmakers\nAnd the media knows about it but they don't cover it because\nThe perpetrators you're on the left\nI Want an equal treatment of all this those in Charlottesville can deal with this for a moment\nThe president said there's good people on both sides you know what he was referring to he was not referring to the tiki carrying torches by the white nationalist and the races marching around shouting racial slurs about Jews or by the way the president's grandchildren are Jewish\nHe was talking about those who want to keep Confederate monuments\nThose who want to keep Confederate ... mind you're much he said those good people on that side and there's good people on the side were protesting the think the Confederate monuments out to be taken down but because that charges not explosive enough the left in the media keeps saying\nThat the president said there's good people on both sides he was not referring to the white nationalist\nHe was referring to those who wanted to keep Confederate monuments\nNow from bill counting EMS perspective I\nI don't like the idea of Confederate monuments 'cause they declared war in my country the United states of America and killed something in the range of six hundred thousand Americans by the way\nThose Confederate who did that road Democrats they you know the Ku Klux Klan and the Democrats lynching Democrats they're all Democrats so please tend to media set the record straight when the president said there's good people on both sides\nThe one son he was referring to wear those southerners who wanted to keep southern monuments on the other side were those protesting he was not referring to the white nationalist caring tiki torches\nShouting racial and ethnic slurs at night in Charlottesville there's no good people among that group you cannot be a good man or a good woman\nShouting racial or Jewish lawyers and the southern city at night carrying torches there's no good coming from that that is blatant racism and that's wrong most continue to get your goals root cause in Wisconsin Ohio Indiana Illinois\nNevada Florida New York and California by the way the\nBoston Red Sox are bought 'em in the seventh inning of four to one [noise]\nBecause Andrew ... a friend of mine who was left field\nFor the red Sox I'm rooting for the red Sox\nThose continuous

gone wrong\nAnd that that's gone wrong largely has not been Trump's doing but other forces he's the president but he's not the ... he's not the dictator is not the czar continue their calls will go right to go to Robert know Utah Robin Utah welcome to the bill Cunningham show rub go ahead\nThanks for taking my call ... thank you\n[noise] alright well yesterday in the middle of the day after the shooting at Al Sharpton on MSNBC he's again and send them down and then today on his show\nThey're really again and and well his friends\nAnd you know\nWell I'm not ready for how about the riot that Al Sharpton started a New York city huh based upon the death of a Jewish person what about ... furniture Mart I mean it Al Sharpton life is filled with anti Semitism and he runs around with Louis Farrakhan who called ...\nThat's right and and get it [noise] I I watch cricket going really a year you know I could make yourself\nNot capable of all um\nWell I don't know I just I just Google this December third the Nineteen Ninety five the river and Al Sharpton apparently referred to the Jewish shown or a ... fashion martyrs they're white interlopers in a rally three months before the Harlem massacre\nNewly revealed taped show Sharpton is not named Freddy but manages the least dispute and calls out his audience Nineteen years ago Al Sharpton inside of the massacre at Fridays furniture Mart because a Jewish a small business owner moved into the black community and so I just Google it and how how does he get away with it\nThat's what I'm saying I got away with it that Middle East is going on and on it the people for this crap\nAnd you know other than the guy who write to the White House and it was right and he actually got the cash for being made right\nAnd and this is you're calling from Utah and this was the guy who's now under indictment now this was in a large media stories that fair to say no the words maybe\nEven a larger story and second page for the phone\nAnd an all white powder sent to the Trump children not much of a story it All right but I don't know just being concoction would've actually\nCause any damage but it was like a fake pipe bomb in other words it was intended to cause fear and if someone would get that and you open an envelope and you get white powder over your hands imposed on your lap believe me and it's a fearful tear filled event\nAnd this was a regular event that the left does to Republicans and the media doesn't cover it do they\nCover it and you can make rice and don't care if they're being real\nOwe them a well can you imagine a bunch of Republicans have done similar things to the Democrats when Obama was in the White House\n[noise] [laughter] oh no you couldn't even bring up you're going to bring up anything you know you're kind of say a word\nWell you know Time Warner did this to Trump\nWell what if the parent company of Fox are sponsored a play in Central Park that depicted the murder through repeated stepping up Iraq Hussein Obama look alike saying twenty ten what would the ... number one Fox's parent company never do it\nBut Time Warner sponsored a play in Central Park Shakespeare is Julius Caesar\n... character looking like Trump being chopped the death toll on stage and the and the media loved it and the audience cheered every night\nNow but I Wonder if the same thing happened to Obama sponsored by Fox\nWhat if it would add a Canadian who rock Obama and how they had on\nCathy Griffin now is touring the country to sold out audiences\nWhy explained to me Rob why the media doesn't respond to these obvious discrepancies in disparities between\nThe way they treat different acts the same actors committed it kinda depends against him is conducting thank you for your call let's continue we

that this afternoon on CNN is the best place for you to be in anywhere in the world and so what happened to them yesterday morning cuts at the soul of every Jewish American my boss is a Jewish carpenter and no matter what happens in political discourse in America that brings violence\nAnd the American media the press CNN\nAnd their allies always lecture Trump Republicans and conservatives about our anger our rhetoric and our violence\nBut when progressive explode\nWhich happens on a regular basis like stabbing Republicans setting Dutch trucks on fire that say I support Trump sending a share is sending a rice and in the mail to numerous Republicans including Senator Susan Collins or the children are the president whenever that goes on at no point\nOr progressive ever lectured by the press somehow it's twisted in turned in the Trump Republicans conservatism even when the\nPresident is the only one in American history to have Jewish grandchildren and even though the murderer and Pittsburgh had postings saying how much he hated Trump\nBecause Trump a Jewish grandchildren and Trump supported Israel somehow CNN is still twisted this thing and if something's wrong with Trump never mentioning the hatred the radicalism of the left which exceeds what happens on the right no hope Ferguson and Baltimore all the race riots\nThe shooting a cops in Dallas in Baton Rouge all came from black lives matter from the left never any connections river may\nBetween the cop killers in Dallas\nDuring a rally a black lives matter and then meeting and the White House with those same leadership a black lives matter saying what a great job they're doing and civil rights by the president Brock Hussein Obama and the media never said wait a minute Mr Mr President\nHow do you meet with the leaders of a group advocating the killing of cops what are we went dead cops when you want them now pegs in a blanket from like bacon there's never a connection made it doesn't exist\nBut Republicans and Trump are lectured constantly whenever violence takes place it's always Trump's fault Trump's rhetoric Trump's tweets the Republican Party conservatism one route Republican speak up

Semitism in Pittsburgh was committed by a coward who hated President Trump because President Trump is such an unapologetic defender\nOf the Jewish community and the state of Israel and so you're the

two years of the Trump Administration will be the peaceful two years so that he said the last two years are going to be a disaster let's continue now with ah Joel enough for junior Jonah Virginia Welcome to the bill Cunningham show Joel how are you\nCan even bill cranky for taking my call once in a halfway you have some friends that called me earlier today from Florida\nAnd they're talking about and that's to kill them I was running as the Democratic candidate for governor you know that what they're telling me is that they've been running a lot of commercials and the state of Florida\nAnd which to have and also they have been having rallies and which both Al Sharpton who you spoke of earlier\nAs well as Iraq Obama Maxine Waters and others have been in the state of Florida campaigning and uh they have been coming up in reference to a federal indictment of Ali mystic tell them everything that comes up he keeps coming up with the race card\nI'm Wondering what your thoughts are in reference to the Florida writes\nAndrew Gillum as a socialist his background is similar to the Democratic candidates in Arizona Andrew Gillum believes in the most left wing radical viewpoint of the police department Andrew Gillum is set in the past the guy who would be the governor of Florida\nThat the police departments are like occupying forces\nThat began as slaves catchers it's the most radical governor\nFlorida would ever have now they're saying this is not the most a lot of the most exciting character I Know but at least is not Andrew Gillum and at least she wouldn't go to the same route of the Bernie Sanders Maxine Waters type and he would take over Florida government\nAnd cash straight the police departments you of numerous police departments and Florida that have said they cannot support this guy because of his beliefs about the police you can't support him if he Andrew Gillum wins in Florida I I Would be shocked\nCrack being called by the people that are

Saturday today or has been along the lines that uh this is Robert Bowers was just a wonderful guy the NBC News this morning head on a neighbor lived next door to them or\nHave you had a woman who said boy kept to himself quite friendly that kinda stuff joining me now is that a saint Thomas Redskin former NYPD officer investigator detective and Thomas Redskin welcome again to the bill Cunningham shown Thomas are you\nGoing to be very tough situation awful um but when I watch\nSome of the morning and afternoon coverage of Robert Bowers forty six years old I guess no previous criminal record at all\nAnd the hidden menial jobs was a truck driver did various other little things next door neighbor a woman said boy he was quiet kind of shy and he said oh goodbye no difficulties he had posted online for quite a while and I met him ranting and raving including hatred for Donald Trump the president\nBecause he thought Trump was too uh too nice on Israel didn't like the fact that Trump's grandchildren are Jewish and he didn't like the fact that a Trump like the state of Israel nonetheless\nUh the media is pointing this out somehow Trump's responsible the Washington Post ah yesterday afternoon and today did ugly reporting\nSaying that ah that in fact a Sarah Sanders put out something a few hours ago that said is there any tragedy of the Washington Post war not exploit to attack President Trump the evil active anti Semitism in Pittsburgh was committed by a coward\nWho hated President Trump because Trump is such a on a public defender of the Jewish community in the state of Israel\nSo let's go back from a police perspective some I've said uh the analysis the experts come out of the woodwork now saying the Pittsburgh Police should have known the FBI should've known\nHow many thousands or millions I I've been tempered comments rather racial anti Semitic anti woman anti male whatever anti homosexual or ... is on social media like everyday who's going to monitor that monitor that and Tom do you see any followed by by law enforcement in this case\nI not as of yet when I've seen is you know Einstein is always twenty twenty especially in the long course men or the investigative world when I Can't believe [laughter] no one else was honoring his tweets\nSocial media and there's other things that he was posting couldn't have alerted only\nWent one way you know when you say is if you think say something [laughter]\nThis case you know someone had this scene and could've alerted the police on the police you find out that the police the FBI or some law enforcement agency was told about Bowers and do something or in a look and see if this guy does have guns\nOr potentially followed him we can criticize the police but until that time\nPolice law enforcement agencies even intelligence agencies don't have the manpower the bandwidth\nTo be able to follow every single person thinking a complaint\nAnd even sometimes like the shooting in Broward County there was a woman or call FBI numerous people had caught about an Eighteen year old a punk mentally ill insane person that just shot up to high school and even though call in or the FBI people call it in that wasn't followed up on even if those things happen there's no perfection\nThere's no perfection and law enforcement correct\nNo production on horse you're only as good a shift today and was on course when it's very easy to after seeing\nA law enforcement is fun so I Know my experience with the NYPD we always look back we always did that review of what happened and what we could do better at the same way that they're doing what the case and the bombings or the bombs that were sent\n'em the looking back and figuring out what we do better in the future and that's what law enforcement agencies I'm sure Pittsburgh and the FBI and other agencies are doing towards ... and ... hours\nIn fact a Bowers said a posted just a few hours before the slaughter on Saturday morning quote\nI Can't sit by and watch my people get slaughtered screw the optics I'm going in unquote so whoever he was dealing with social media somebody knew or should have known this guy was disintegrating and I and that person did not do anything now the experts have said\nBecause I'm sure there's several thousand individuals sadly in the country like ... hours waiting for a trigger moment that social media exacerbates highlights these kinds of feelings\nBecause those of like minded get together and they feed on each other's hate before social media ten twelve years ago you sent letters or you made phone calls but in social media you can be a friend hundreds and thousands of people or other like minded like those clowns marching around Charlottesville\nShouting slurs against uh against Jews and against African Americans over several hundred who did that they use social media to get together in the they feed on each other and feed on their hate\nThat the media doesn't well report this but this guy hated Donald Trump he he'd previously road I never voted for Trump\nNor have I ever owned Warner even touch the mega had he goes on about Trump's grandchildren being Jewish",
