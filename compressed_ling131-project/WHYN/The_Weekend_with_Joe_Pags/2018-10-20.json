California I don't want ... nuisance archiving I was living in San Francisco when he became a San Francisco and he said he\nWas an ... you have a great Republican candidates out there John Cox he's a great businessman his his problem is simple math\nAnd sort of like New York city although it's happened in New York City is even happen in New Jersey Chris Christie Christie Todd Whitman um and and then all the other occasions Tom Kaine is another example where Republicans were elected after Democrats make a mess\nI guarantee you that Cox could wind now that the sanctuary state of California wants to put up a sign and say free health\nCare for everybody in the world it's a sign you're basically our governor saying illegal or legal doesn't matter resident non resident doesn't matter we're going to give you free health care now if the average Californian is that is packed that Thirteen and a half percent statewide on income\nIf you're OK with that good luck to you\nBecause it is unsustainable it will bankrupt your state there's my prediction but if people want to experiment with is that you know what am I I'm not there to tell people\nCan't and I agree with you and they had on counted on the way the thinking gotta get out of California can't afford to pay taxes and all that\nYeah I mean it's unbelievable look and why do you think there's a mass migration out of New York and New Jersey\nAnd Illinois to states like Florida Texas in the Carolinas wire Californians all going in Texas\nYou know what what uh Democrats on what they're hoping for that California demographic shift so that the people that ruin California and left might do the same thing to Texas unbelievable which is what the beta O'Rourke has been all about from the beginning\nAnyway the you know good

stream was on the top of your school down a bit you you'll see a section for parodies people been asked me to both my parents for a while now so I've done that\nIs also a section for interviews a section for monologues and some some news stories of love inside\n\nTurns out I started new story this morning that nobody one what was the mega millions or was it the power along with Bill when it was\nNobody won the billion dollar jak but now it's going to be\nOne point six billion come on to what the hell is going on one voice six billion dollars you imagine that would be nuts that would be absolutely nuts are let's talk about Elizabeth Warren Elizabeth Warren for decades\nHas been claiming to be a Native American or as I like to say American indian why am I right when it comes to American\nIt'd be in because the individual tribes actually call themselves Indian tribes if it's okay for them it's okay for me she's going to be an American Indian a charity in fact for admissions to school\nFor applications to jobs she she has been listed as the first woman of color to be a professor at what Harvard or Yale or something like Harvard she's been making this clean but there is no verification there's no proof she's never ever given any bit of evidence\nTo suggest that she is in fact an American Indian\nSo the president like he's apt to has been name calling her because it sounds so stupid he calls her book on us I think it's funny as hell people who are offended by it aren't very smart and don't have a sense of humor you know like Rachel does all who's white\nLike Sean King who's white\nYou know they're both pretend to be black Elizabeth Warren it seems\nAs though I'm pretending to be an American Indian what's your well because my cheekbones proves it no it doesn't prove anything in fact\nThanks though so president been calling around he said do a DNA test if you could prove to be the urine Indian or give it a million dollars or your favorite charity so she I guess secretly does a DNA test\nGet to the test back\nAnd gives the results of the Boston Globe which is the far left wing left is the outlet\n\nAnd they write this big story that she proved that she's Native American they say there is a there is a likelihood of up to one in thirty to chance or she's one thirty second Native American to as little as\nOne one thousand twenty four ths Native American\n\nAnd then the Boston Globe out to four hours later updated and corrected and say well the most you could possibly be as one sixty fourth Native American and the least is one one thousand twenty fourth then when you look into\nThe actual test further it turns out there was no comparison of her DNA DNA of American Indians\nIn fact the only comparing that was done that was even close was with South American native tribes\nAnd maybe she got South American blood or maybe South American made of blood both the probability is one in one thousand twenty four this not only didn't prove that she is a Native American this group that she's not\nOn average the average white American has more Native American blood than than losing with worn that's a fact somebody making it up as a fact she's not a ... an American Indian she's gotten benefits for pretending that she was\nShe just thought she was going to prove the president wrong when in fact she proved yourself or did he or she is so not American indian but the Cherokee Nation has come out and asked her to just stop now\n\nOr when they did bad some left wing cable news outlet called the Cherokee Nation racist or a [noise]\nOr sharing the Cherokee Nation is racist retelling a white woman to stop pretending to be part of their nation\nVets the world in which we live guy looked at St in that any time you go through this week thinking that lives with Warren proved to president wrong that anybody go through this week and I think to yourself as well she will use Native American\nAnd by the way this is not a story anybody any Russian even care about except for the fact that it's an abuse through lying to get benefits that were meant for somebody else but nobody was talking about this nobody cared about this\nAnd Elizabeth Warren Pocahontas herself decided I'm going to go and start this whole thing up again and you ask yourself what she's thinking nobody nobody was thinking about this or even a second yet for some reason\nWe had to have her thrust of this in our face again why decided I had to do a or a pact parity about they call it Pocahontas all have their free will come back if you don't really read my packs parodies

E. A. my middle name\nI'm just saying I follow you and your husband is maybe I'm just going to say I haven't gotten to follow but this was when I was probably going it's fun to buy that OK appreciate it um you know traditionally you bring up Kevin I've been told him to become an old bones but it happened so early that I feel like things might ... before the midterms ... dying and Feinstein yesterday\nBut gave us a golden egg somebody asked her if you guys when the Senate if the Democrats win the Senate will you reopen investigations into you know justice terminal Laura she said yes\nYeah well that that should not surprise anyone because we saw how crazy they got during the actual confirmation process it's it's really terrifying it is\nAnd then finally showing their true colors that Democrats are they really don't stand for much except trying to be destructive and and do anything they can to go against the president and destroy him and I'll tell you do one of the reasons I think\nThat you eat so much with resistance out there is because this president is actually winning you don't try and stop someone\nWho's down or losing you only try and stop someone who's winning and Donald Trump is waiting for the country again and and they know that he's draining the swamp and they were terrified because the old way of life\nIs over and they knew what before and and it's very scary for people who are living the highlights in Washington DC or not go in and and voting on the ... so it makes them scared because Donald Trump has nothing to gain from that he\nHe's doing this because he loves his country to hold and anyone but the American people and and they never had a president like this before um\nWhich is all the more reason that we need\nAll the Republicans support we can in Congress\nThat is a lawyer a trauma but really great to talk to you if your brother in law I asked them ... I asked her husband this I asked the President Bush\nUm when she made the announcement ... I'm guessing the family got at first I'm going to actually do this what was your knee jerk reaction because as you said he didn't need for anything he could be you know playing golf every day in Scotland right now and not worry about all this political stuff\nBut his love for countries should this is my calling was my duty who's your who's your thought process what it looked like your father in law was really going to take the stuff\nI he actually that all of them down and said I Want to do that and then two days before the famous athlete or a day during dinner and said\nYou guys need to know that they're going to come after me they're going to come after you they're going to come after all of us they will attack us they'll tell lies about it obviously it would have been hard to predict it will get to this level rise up but like I said I was a hundred percent on board because I knew\nThat my father in law to do this job he's a businessman he is so smart when it comes to negotiating seeing when he's been able to do in in so many different respect what Tara trade um he's really great at that than I mean back then that he would be great at it\nUm so for me it was a hundred percent in again I don't think anything prepares you for for all of this um it it is so much bigger than any of us but that's why I think although we all get attacked\nOn the time although the president Mitt to pack every second of every day none of us for a second one change any of that because we know that it is about the bigger picture and the future of the country and if we have to take a couple of planes going on here and there and the president\nOr you know take that every single day more than any of us it's totally worth it because I really think this\nCountry is headed in the right direction they get an I always tell him he's going to go down in history as one of the greatest presidents of countries ever had\nA disagree with that it's Laura Trump or her husband his or her father in law is the president I asked him back in twenty sixteen or because you just said it was nowhere near I mean you expect to the media would come after the leopard come after you does but not like this\nAnd I understood it was just completely unexpected he said no I knew that they would probably go hard on me probably go dirty on me but I had a lot of friends in the media you told me I made millions and millions of dollars for NBC on The Apprentice for thirty and forty years the media actually treated me very well and wanted me in the newspaper on the television or radio show\nSo he didn't know that it would get to this extreme you've been in the media for a long time I've been in newsrooms for a long time as well yesterday le left but I didn't know was going to be like this show when we when was the realization for you in the family that this is way worse than we thought it was going to be\nWell I'm actually still for a portion of the campaign working at my former job in television and I ... it became very frustrating for me to to work there because\nI Would be all different nations but sometimes ours including um the way that they would bring things and and say hey that's not what he said you know what he said um that\nThat was it it it was very clear wine to me that I don't didn't think that I was going to be able to work there for for forever if you know he became president ...\nBut um but certainly after they started attacking all of us personally and you know when I was pregnant and they they attacked my unborn child I mean to make the auditors are idiots so crazy but again I think it's because\nThey knew before that I'm trying to became president that if he got in there there was no turning back that he was all business and he was really going to be looking out for the American people and their old way of life was going to come to an end so um I have to say that it it's just another sign that he's doing a great jobs\nYou know I Would agree with you you guys were you have the ... family members you to my wife is Lara Trump irritates her husband her father in law of course is the president of the United states we've got we've got senatorial races now that are starting to lean writes the midterms are starting to look better in the Senate for Republicans although\nI can see that it doesn't mean anything unless people don't vote in Texas where I should you've got to cruise the income but he was doing an incredible job in working with your debt with your brother in law are very well know although it was rough on the campaign trail who's being Jones from a guy by a guy who's basically Obama\nAre saying you know we can work together yeah one one undivided Texas but under the surface those you know use the far left wing socialist disco award\nYou look at places like Michigan were Debbie ... been there for three decades and it's time for her to do now and you've got a guy named John James who might actually be able to get that show that Israel's seat this really used gonna come down to whether we can motivate people who believe in what they see happening now\nIn the country to get off the ... you can go vote for him it's really what it is is it\nAbsolutely well as I think you're right now I'm In Minnesota\nTraveling to stay campaigning I Will be in your neck of the ... in Texas on Monday youthful I Will be on your day ironically and Michigan I'm this is so so important we we know that the president has done incredible things already and that's what a lot of people against and even people on his own party sometimes money and get them\nAbout what's going to happen if he had a ... a people behind him that voted on by\nPresident and and really pushing the gender or we can do much more progress in the country and by the way I Know we talk about socialism if anybody has any question about what social and them look like look in Venezuela right now\nThat could become the United states and America if we let people like or or take over and and put his agenda forward it's really very frightening socialism has never worked in fact that the Democrats are embracing people like that\nShould shock everybody to a degree that you you not only are going to get out and get in the mid term but you're going to take everyone in your neighborhood and everyone in your family to go vote 'em\nIn their area and I know that it felt like a fight and twenty they seem to get Donald Trump elected in ... certainly what the fight isn't over you and you can't get back you can't relax we can't be complacent me to get out to vote and put people in Congress or we're going to vote with the president\nIf anybody ever wants to know about socialism talk to your shoes are delicious used his wife was from Venezuela who tells the stories of how disgusting it is there I mean there are people waiting in line for food than the government officials show up beat them up maybe even children in the streets to take care of their families first is made him in the country it is horrific\nAnd you really do have people in this country or tells you reporters ... you've got people who are actually starting this guy Gillum in Florida we are going to go the way of socialism because that's the best way to go\nLower last question I really appreciate your time and by the way I'm Glad you're in Minnesota we go for great stations there we were very highly rated in Minneapolis St Paul MTV okay they're hearing you right now um\nWhen you look at the fact that people on the left are saying volition will impeach the president will open the border will abolish ice we will roll back the tax cuts and take more of your money away and we'll drive jobs out of the country that's what they're running on and the factors there almost fifty fifty right now and almost every poll you see\nWhat is it that we're doing wrong you and I ... I done junior the president the Fox news Hannity what are we doing wrong but it's still so close that is crazy to me\nWell I don't know though that it's really that close I mean we thought how accurate the old words a great point I don't\nReally think that if that is out there I think there are people that are afraid to tell a pollster that call them our coaches them on the street that they want to vote Republican because the media and Hollywood and done\nSuch a a number on on people whenever they come out in support of the president or as a Republican and um so I think it does make people a little\nA bit he went to work sometimes but when they get in the voting booth\nFurther your education and English literature the master of education and master of arts in English programs had\nWestfield State University are flexible affordable and innovative Westfield State University has been educating teachers in the Eighteen thirty nine offering regionally nationally credited education programs we are from Massachusetts teacher licensure programs leading to both initial ... professional licenses the master of arts in English program\nPrepare students for advanced graduate studies in English and\nFree professional stays in feels like communication publishing and public relations to learn more and joined us Monday October twenty second at six PM in the Horace Mann center lobby in Westfield state you'll have a chance to explore program options and\nScholarship opportunities and just for attending we'll waive the application fee for more information and you are a sweeping does it go back now dot com that's go back now dot com and joined us Monday October twenty second to see how a degree from Westfield State University can make a difference in your future\nOutlook farm for the pumpkin fast this Sunday and indulge in a pig roasting barbecue live music from Woodford way horse drawn have rights to the orchards a community tagging crafts sailing tasting of their beers winds insiders brood right on the far\nTo yourself to a gallon of outlooks traditional all natural sweet apple cider rouse the bakery eatery and produce far and pick up some fresh pork and homemade sausages from the butcher shop plus lots of pumpkin the Jews from die one get one free this weekend outlook farm route sixty six was tempted it's all good\nJoined the drug Enforcement Administration celebrate and read it and do from October twenty third route that their parents and property and if you can talk to your kids announcements participate and prevention education activities in your ...\nAnd take the ... for more information on how you can celebrate mid week there's W.

vindicated I I'm I'm I'm never\nFlabbergasted by the lengths to which the identity politics left will go to write to\nTry and unwind blatant lives ... this is a woman who advanced her career by manufacturing a ... a Native American ancestry that it's been debunked over and over and over again and I I really do believe that her staff was convinced\nThat by releasing the results of a test\nThat showed that cheap\nPossibly had Native American ancestry six to ten generations back yeah but that was based\nOn a proxy of Native American blood line right in other words the the researcher\nUsed South American genetic markers as as some sort of of estimation for whether or not she really has this ancestry come on Joe this is someone who identified as a woman of color right in order to secure position in a in a prestigious Ivy League university\nIn a very real way ... is about as black is this woman is Native American and you know you're right and they're using like ... as they're hoping and praying that the south American blood somehow has some native blood and there is no proof in other words she's wider than I'll ever be\nSite and in fact by a statistics that were quoted and none other than the New York times it turns out\nThat this one thousand one one one thousand twenty fourth fraction of a possible Native American bloodline makes makes her ... less\nThan ... ... ... in other words than the average white American press more Native American ancestry than she does\nA hundred percent but you're absolutely right about that and the Boston Globe tried to say that she was one thirty second at the at the most and one one thousand twenty fours at the least they even had to update that four hours later to say okay maybe one sixty fours at at the most\nWas the show was an I'm Italian I'm English I'm polish and Irish or you know these things\nAnd I'm I'm I'm actually about two thirds Italian than the other still falls into place\nI have no clue one one

American students have um suit Harvard University which awarded\nElizabeth Warren this a position as a as a professor right because of her fake claim and those Asian American students have on earth do all sorts of admissions\nDocuments showing that they were discriminated because\nThey were Asian American and there were too many of them in the university system and it just goes to show you that you know the the the Olympics of grievance\nAnd the Olympics of identity politics brings us exactly to the to this point in time and and it's and it and I think so many people are sick and tired of it I mean for the twenty five plus years that I have been an outspoken conservative quote unquote of color\nAnd yeah I'm darker than Brock Obama a\nI've had all of these white progressive leftist shouting
