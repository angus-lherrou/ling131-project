left media the legacy media in this country listening to what she has to say and it's like now giving her ... ... ... years the odds then\nI mean the whole thing is odd but it was more of those involved at all but here's the really odd thing\nWhen you turn on a television network whether it be CNN MSNBC or Fox News or were you see me during the week on Newsmax when you turn it on\nAnd somebody who's present it as an expert on something\nLike I'll have an author on are all have a geologist honor all have a\nAn actor on it and I'll say this is an activity you might remember from is this is a geologist who's an expert on this topic that we're talking about this is somebody who is a senator former senator um here's the president's son you'll normally present the person and say here's why you want to hear from this person\nOn some of the networks they'll say that the person who's a contributor well that means is the person who's getting paid for your parents or an analyst generally speaking never as good as they do but they keep on presenting it wasn't a lotto and they never say why are we supposed to listen to her\nAnd actress Elizabeth ... says really equal rights amendment and then they do a whole story on it and USA Today I'm confused why are we doing a story and a list of a lotto\nI don't get it I'm confused but not as confused as she is\nFor some reason she thinks if there's an equal rights amendment which is unnecessary because we have guaranteed equal rights in equal opportunity in this country for some reason she thinks that we had an equal rights amendment then\nChristie lousy Ford would have stopped the Kavanaugh nomination an appointment\nAnd she's never really said why and again I don't really care why ... why she's not an expert\nI talked about this boy talk about this for a while now but we just we sometimes see our top athletes that people that we really like\nOr actors or actresses people that we see you on the tube or or on the big screen for a long time and we set ourselves well we were you for some reason project intelligence on them a list of a lotto is not intelligent\nShe's somebody who clearly was easily indoctrinated and she has no idea what she's talking about none she has no clue\nShe has yet to make a point that makes sense\nYet the the legacy media keeps putting her up on high because a she's attractive and be they think that she has some political sway that will help to get their viewers in general Americans I guess where the dumb people out here like a like me to buy into this far left wing garbage\nListen to the lotto actually doesn't help at all not ... doesn't know better side they think she does but she doesn't want to listen to the lotto actually does is she hurt the cause\n\nMe she actually makes intelligent people arguing may\nSay well I'm definitely not going to vote that way look how dumb this the thing is that she's saying or liquor taking selfies or taking videos well sitting in a very serious hearing\nOr look at her blindly saying you must believe every woman because every woman who's telling the truth when we've got documented case after case after case where sadly women have lied\nThey don't misunderstand me and I said it's from the beginning you should take every allegation of sexual misconduct seriously but you should not just simply because it said believe it you should believe it once it's proven\nBut there you go you turn on the job or or you read you know some of these current events websites there's Alyssa mulatto and they never ever ever never say why we should believer you should believe it wasn't a lot I'll be cause filling the blunt\nJust doesn't happen oh another trendy thing that's happening today which will boggle your mind is Robert ...\nRobbery rubbery layer of course the Confederate general who lost and had to surrender to to us rent\nAllegedly if you believe NBC News or the Washington Post President Trump last night went to Ohio and praised Robert ... period and the story and of course\nThat's the only period and the story of your legacy media that lies to your viewers and your readers and and those who follow you on social media\nOf course the president did praise Robert de leite on his lead up to talking about how Ohio in Ulysses Grant kicked his ass\n\nHe talked about what a great general Lee was and how great still kicked his ass\nNow the media knows that but they also know you don't know that you don't know that the president said it that way so if they say the president praised will Ulysses S grade are they telling the truth or praised rubbery layer will be telling the truth yes but it's also a scent of omission or reliable mission\nThey didn't tell the whole truth\nCan I take out to a section of that and make it sound like the president went to Ohio and praise Robert are you leaving left and waved to the crowd ... that is what is the best thing ever going to get on my plane they'll go back to Washington yeah I guess you could say that if you're a liar\nA better thing to say might be what he really said Ulysses Grant was dashed and this guy was really good\nThat was the context but white tell the truth when you can lie and then corrected later and by the way on social media when you lie under your your legacy media tens of thousands of a re tweets and likes what you're correct it a few hundred that's the way it goes to this day and age\nEight hundred five zero one Seventy eighty one eight hundred and five zero one seven zero eight zero bottom of this hour is going to be former Governor Sarah Palin the great state of Alaska what a great conversation I had with her and how we ended up connecting on my show the Joe ... show Monday through friday is kind of mind boggling if you want to see the live video feed yourself by Joe bags\nDot com it's the topic of the page that we've redesigned the page you can also see my parodies there you can get the interviews that I Do and my monologues as well as the new stories to Joe packs duck on coming back on the weekends their ground [laughter]\nYou want to believe that his name is Beto O'Rourke is Robert Francis do work what it is fourth generation Irish American nothing wrong with that just don't pretend you're somebody you're not\nHe's a guy that was in a punk rock band and word dress he was arrested for for DUI DWI in the late nineties the guy who reported him because there was an accident says he tried to flee the scene the police report says he tried to flee the scene\nPolitically he said things like I'm open to the idea of abolishing eyes he said things like we basically stole half of Mexico from them which is patently untrue\nYou said things like he would definitely want to impeach the president of the United states should he get in he's an open borders guy he believes in open borders doesn't want a border wall yet when you see these commercials or here's commercials he's saying things like or diversity is our strength and we need to be together and work together for a better Texas\nWith that crap doesn't work anymore because people with America actually watch what you people did\nIn the capital hearings it was disgusting and you went from probably winning the Senate till you're going to lose it now provided people actually go out and vote you need to go and vote and and a guaranteed when in the house doesn't look so likely anymore\nAnd the reason for that is people understand that right now under this president they've got lower taxes we've got more jobs and we've had ever\nYou've got black and Hispanic unemployment through the roof women unemployment through the roof\nYou've got manufacturing coming back our standing in the world is much better the terrorists are working because we're getting better deals with Mexico and with Canada and with the EU [noise]\nThings are shifting\nThe left overplayed intent\nAnd that's what we're seeing now they have to pretend like the president doesn't doesn't like us granted loves Robert ... which is just dumb when we come back\nHere from Sarah pale and former governor of Alaska right here\nOn the weekend don't touch that ah\nYeah

Facebook Twitter Instagram email the live video feed do [noise]\nRadio network as well it is the weekend with Joe bags and I'm Glad to have you long for the ride a there's a lot going on this past week I was able to connect with Sarah payload yes\nSarah Palin the former governor of Alaska and also the former Republican nominee\nFor vice president of the United states it was very interesting how it happened and in our show to tell the story in the interview we were able to connect and or do you hope that you're watching as well as listening and if you're not go back to the live stream later and watch it because the scenery behind her as beautiful in Alaska but lose Jonah boys and girls that surveillance Sarah how are you\nI'm doing great thank you for having me\nThey were not be mad at me for that whole thing like friday just people no I was actually and this was unfolding on me or live you're listening but I was telling them what was going on\nAnd and I got a random Facebook message from somebody not named Jew who said Hi Sarah Palin and pick up the kids up and dropping kids often and I'm listening I just want to see a good point they should maybe you've got a famous name and correct me if you're a teacher was do you remember what you said you said it's really neat I promise\n[laughter] like\nGoing back and forth and I needed it oh my goodness somebody is cognizant of the fact we get pumped a lot and we get along so thank you for doing that and know it was funny I started getting the calls and the tax people up here in Alaska listening\nI was trying to get what I'm trying to verify it me\nWhile I tried to verify the few ways when I got the email back from sure appealing dot com I knew that it was somebody connected with you at least um but then I sent you a tweet that you guys couldn't find and then finally I just said do you have an iPhone let me face time you'll is just settled this once and for all and it's a good as we got to go to the state you so much for reaching out by the way\nAnd that's about it and then one other thing about that is yeah so I'm grabbing Todd phone by that time out of the vehicle and we're all in all these button to try to figure out how to say that\nAnd it worked out does your brush the boat you took my first time in there you were like well that's definitely her son Tina Fey that's her that's ... ... and now you got a hold of me because you are seeing what was unfolding or in in Washington DC I still to this day sure I have no idea how Lisa Murkowski be became the senator\nAs a write in really so that's the starting point for me and then she says as a Republican I Can't support Brett Kavanaugh and the reason she said she couldn't support him was that he's not the right guy at the right time\nDid the people of Alaska except that excuse\nNo and go back even further from her write in campaign out after he lost the primary up here remember what's heard Senator Frank Murkowski after having served twenty two years in the U.S Senate he gave his daughter the job\nWhen he was elected governor up here race or one term in Iran against him and defeated him for that that leads to God and that's how we said they didn't essentially 'cause man once you're in and you have these special interests from around the country right up funding you you know you should have to\nIt's tough to hold them accountable and say okay enough is enough\nTime to go but no I'm\nIrrational reasoning that she provided regarding that that that vote against Kavanaugh because as you point out she said he good man it's not about qualifications and I'm like\nWait you know about calls like of course it is and whether either good matter yes I don't know yet it didn't make sense and then her speech on the Senate floor which is kind of talking in circles are very very very disappointed because Joe as even suggested as an outright set on friday the things\nThat she's putting in jeopardy just for the state of Alaska but for this country I mean it comes down to the Supreme\nHaving so much with in its graph having to do with our solvency our sovereignty and she was willing to play some games with that\nWell she was willing to play games and the point that I made that I really appreciate that you that you are you like\nWas it up and I sort of a court of appeals in all ... opinion of course the former vice presidential nominee for the Republican Party back in two thousand eight and of course the former governor of Alaska and just a great all run person so you know this but I wasn't a vote for John McCain has been right on my mother's name until you got on the ticket\nAnd then I voted for you so and I think a lot of people actually did that the point I made friday was Lisa Murkowski and people like her were actually putting in the hands of the most liberal court in the United states the Ninth Circuit court of appeals the the um the law issues of Alaska and everybody in the west coast\nIn other words if the Supreme Court has eight members and it's tied for the foreign almost every week it would be for the for now it goes back to the previous court in the Ninth Circuit court of appeals will decide the first amendment checking amendment Fourth Amendment Fifth Amendment Pence Amendment for Alaska what do they make you think\nThat that's exactly right and Joe I was impressed because nobody else was talking about that but there um what her action was with essentially bolstering the Ninth Circuit had she had her her way and that's the Ninth Circuit out of San Francisco right he talked about injustice\nAnd justice being delayed for Alaskan because that court a million people they are to quote unquote served it's the largest by far\nThe second largest the eleventh and they are only thirty thirty five million right so there is such a backlog of cases and not even talking about the ideology behind that very very partisan very liberal Korea is just a practical reasons why we don't want to give them any more power anymore say over Alaska so\nFor me to be messing around with that uh that was very very dangerous and the other thing is that\nI'm In the pioneer valley radio by
