or how they work out a buys him and want to buy\nEven if you think the ... do bubble has burst we too late or too old for technologically challenged you most\nNuts man\nYou know you've got so many unhinged people out there how do you protect yourself you got the alleged bomber under arrest as well the ah ridiculous legacy disgusting media reporting that it's the Margot bomber the make America great again bummer which is disgusting\nReporting that the bomber was going after Trump targets no\nNot the case would you have is a bad guy who did something very bad\nAnd calling him demographer bomber is not only inappropriate it shows that you shouldn't be in the journalism business at all\nThose of us on the political opposite side we're not calling the shooter at the congressional baseball game the Sanders shooter even though he was a vehement Bernie Sanders supporter that's not what we do it's also not being honest and they start reporting the news\nAs as it is in reality\nSo we've got more violence today we don't know why other than this person allegedly shouts some sort of hatred and I'm\n\nAn incredible hatred and loading of of people have the Jewish faith we don't have any motive other than that we don't know his name although it's been reporter to use a white guy with a beard\nYou know it also has reported that the bombing suspect it was a white guy to that guy list themselves as Native American as first name is Caesar or says are so he could be Hispanic as well and also a report that he's a talented in Filipino\nThe media always though quick to say it's a white guy remember George Zimmerman\nThe guy who killed Trayvon Martin because Martin went back and was beating the hell out of 'em in in self defense he shot and killed him they reported him as a white guy for a long time until they had to once his picture was out there admitted that he was Hispanic so then they started calling him a white Hispanic\nSo dumb that is so the media always is looking for a spin I'm always going to give it to you straight as I can\nAnd that's what we have a Pittsburgh I'll give you updates as we go I definitely want your thoughts on this uh this bombing suspect that is a ... that's under arrest and even more than that I mean it looks like at some nut job who had some crazy delusion about\nWhat his role should be in politics in this country I mean just the pictures the van itself if you're looking at a going what there was a guy riding down the street with a van that looked like that and nobody suspected or even years ago where they are a substantial criminal record\nYears and years and years of convictions who by the way was a registered Democrat I've seen reports that he switched to Republican and twenty sixteen and suddenly Trump made him do it according to the media\nOut a bunch of alleged bombs I'm not even convinced there were really bombs but he sends out a bunch of alleged bombs\nTo people we put return addresses on these fake addresses on the actual send to an area that we're supposed to show up at all these prominent Democrats houses and their officers they never made it there but it's for the media it's not about are the bad guys off the street thank God nobody was hurt\nIt's more about Trump did this I guess there were some letter signed by hundreds of journalists about how Trump is somehow inciting violence against journalists that's not true he's done nothing like that\nIn fact it sounds really stupid and an journalistic to even say something like that in fact I can make a good argument that the media\nIs inciting violence against those who support President Trump you if you were a make America great again hat\nYour target and that's okay\nIf you go to a Trump rally or you have a Trump bumper sticker you're a racist and Islamophobia Xena fall but that's OK the media school with that you're late night talk show host calling the president's mouth a blank holster for for ...\nThat's okay that's perfectly fine fake news incessantly that's just the way it is will correct it later and there are there is an example of for example at the example of that\nWith the media again playing the victim in fact Jemma concept from CNN the other day tweeted out this appointment or engaged\nOver the fact that when President Trump was talking about the bombs that were they were going he didn't mention CNN specifically give that in mind this is a guy whose job is supposed to be to go there to report the news and he's not ever supposed to be the story is mad that he wasn't the story and when the president does call CNN out\nThan a cost and and and his ilk say he shouldn't be doing that\nHe's putting his endangering denigrating what we do for a living so make you make your mind up either you want to be mentioned by the president or you don't want to be the president you don't get to tell the president what mentioned he has to make for you so I mean we're living in bizarro world here really are\nThose who perpetrated violence on the left should be arrested and or or killed in the act like the guy with the shooter was in that congressional baseball practice\nThey should be prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law and sent away for as long as we possibly can those who committed violence and they're on the right same thing should apply but the selective reporting and there's the desire by the media to pretend like\nOne side is inciting violence and the other side is that it's just a crazy person that was unhinged that's irresponsible that's responsible or by the way the the bombing suspect\nVery odd the whole thing's odd claims he's a seminal Indian is family or a family friend or a lawyer or somebody claim that he wasn't at all that he isn't one by one name that he went by different name one name sounded Native American or American indian and the other one sounded Italian first name certainly sounds Hispanic\nWho knows what he is when we do know is he was some promoter for chipping nails and some bouncer at at a bar even the night before he was arrested\nSo whatever the the leftist trying to glean from him and put it on Trump is irresponsible and stupid and the media\nNeeds to learn it's job again the job is to go there observe and then tell us what you saw\nIs not drug or observant and tell us why Trump caused it that makes no sense so I'll keep you updated on what's happening in Pittsburgh certainly we've got a bunch of interviews coming your way a bunch of interviews I might take some false flag Paul Ryan's led Charlie go I'm not going to do conspiracy theories today that that that's that's stupid\nCharlie and go ahead and hang up in Maryland I'm not taking that call I'm All right we've got John Hi bushy use the guy from the he's the executive director\nOf the Ronald Reagan um Institute in California great interview with him where we compare and contrast how Ronald Reagan um through his accomplishments treated was treated by the media and how he treated the media and it wasn't much better than what's going on with Trump and then how Trump does it very very different styles\nBoth of them had incredible accomplishments for the American people the media was not on either one of their sides how is it the that the media is Harold and Ronald Reagan as a great president great leaders thirty some odd years later\nWhereas Trump is being treated as he's being treated so we get that for ya I've got representative Kevin Brady you're hearing the president talk a lot about a new a new tax cut plan for the middle class in America is that tax cuts to point out or is that something different we break that down we talked about it makes you stick around for that I've got a package\nParity that caravan we got that for you which is okay I did it last minute I think on Thursday Wednesday or Thursday so it's okay\nWe'll try to get you that also mark lot are from a GOP we talk to them about traveling around with um with vice president Mike Pence\nAnd the enemies Scaramucci the ... the communications director of the trauma distraction for eleven whole days he's got a new book out we'll talk to him as well your thoughts right now in the bomber the bombing suspect that is on the media coverage on the the climate in America and look I think that the left is causing this\nBecause they're deathly afraid of what's going to happen on election day and by the left I mean the media the political left um Hollywood left they were all freaking out now and there was one event that happened last Monday that I think is causing them to freak out we'll get into it that event\nRadio station been doing that nationally syndicated for three years although the show is eleven years old I'm I don't do conspiracy theories now I Do believe that people conspire and try to make you think something different happened\nThan what actually happened I get that that's real and in history that is certainly happened okay\nBut I'm not going to have you you know call in and say I think it's a false flag and the Democrats were losing so they needed something somebody just out\nOf their asses hold this guy in Florida game of van with a bunch of crap on it and had them send out what would those who think it's a false flag would call a fake bombs\nThe reason why I'm successful other than it's been good show is that what do they talk news and when I report the news to you and when we break down topics I always base it on fact\nIf you base it on fact you're always going to be safe if you start speculating I can probably take calls for three hours would you guys telling me what you think happened when it comes to the alleged bomber I ... I Can't play that game so that we go on facts what do we know\nWe know that he called himself a a a ... a couple of different names first name always Caesar\nWas either ... or it was all theory or whatever we know that the guy had some ... a bunch of weird stickers on it we know that he's got an extensive criminal record we know that he was a Democrat until twenty sixteen when he allegedly\nSwitched to Republican we know that he's a wannabe bodybuilder we know that his family says that he's delusional\nWe know that he's presented himself as an American Indian\nI'm a seminal to be exact in South Florida what we know these things we know that also his\nAllegedly who's the lawyer for his family I couldn't verify that it was a lawyer but I'm was on NPR or something saying that he was actually Phillies actually Filipino and Italian who knows I don't know what I Do know\nIs the FBI says these were real devices [noise]\nThe FBI says yes they were really we're not a hoax they could have detonated thank goodness they didn't [noise]\nI Can't go on what you say I have to go with the facts are the FBI says that's what it is what you're telling me of the FBI was in cahoots\nWith the false flag that where they found this guy out of their boats and just say hey look here's the guy let's change the election\nI Can't play that game it's a one eight hundred and five zero one Seventy eighty Joe ... dot com they're either [noise]\nYeah it's the weekend with a gel pound [noise]\nAll in with Gary settlement on your radio they tell me why don't we\nMessage ... burning your degree from one of the top business schools in the country might sound impossible to fit into your workload but what if there were a business degree to further your career and gave you access to world renowned faculty\nLeaders and mentors all on your schedule one that opened doors to some of the most influential CEOs tech companies law firms entrepreneur in thought leaders\nAnd what if you could earn that degree in his little less sixteen months one hundred percent on line to find out more text offer to seven nine six four or five that's o F F E R to seven nine six four or five\nStar chair on line MBA information management or business analytics master's program from the W.

S. dot com or scroll down you'll see the ... that I Do a lot of humans are are in Georgia you most of the ... so I posted the parties there you go go check them out of also there's a section for interviews I've got a ton of interviews on there now adding more every day but go go there and check them out of you've heard that had been an interviewer I\nYou saw somebody talking about it on social media\nYou'd go right to the source Joe packs dot com and see them monologues that I Do right there as well um we have not heard much about the caravan of the past couple of days with the alleged bomber with these bombs showing up at mail rooms and so on\nWith the targeting of a prominent Democrats now you've got the synagogue shooting in Pittsburgh I mean there are important news stories going on but I also think that the media is happy to not talk about the caravan this is not a conspiracy there is video showing people\nHanding money to those who are joining the caravan choice being well funded by somebody and I believe that the move was to disrupt our mid term elections by saying look at a horrible Trump is\nHe hates the immigrants he hates the children what about children [noise] he ... he can't stand women and children he wants to separate families is a bad guy because the left is doing horribly on Kavanaugh they're doing horribly and be on the economy they were doing horribly on healthcare they're doing horribly on the border\nSo they have to do something and I do believe that this is a concerted effort because you\nLook if Honduras is so bad or El Salvador Guatemala if there are so bad it's so horrible you're not going to be able to like go on Instagram or Snapchat and say hey let's all do this a caravan heading north and start tomorrow and then thousands of people show up visiting coordinated effort\nThis is something that reminds me of the term always use for former president bronco bum a\nCommunity organizer somebody organized the community down there in Central America and said there is a better life for you plus we'll give you a couple of bucks started heading north\nAnd now there's this massive people heading that way so that and I wanted to get with a share of mark lamb he is from ... County Arizona he is a right they're separated by an Indian reservation but right there on the border\nAnd deals with the illegal immigration all the time I Want to know how he's preparing\nFor the caravan heading this way and and what exactly it is the law enforcement is willing to or has to do as it gets here a sheriff I appreciate Joe are you\nDoing great thanks for having me on\nIllicit always appreciate it really had a good time with your at the fair get together in Washington DC got some great knowledge I have to wear my cowboy boots next time I was like only a shrimp um six want to do for his standing next to you but uh it it was a great time and really great knowledge I Love the way you guys there in your sheriff's department\nDo the job and especially to watching you out there on live TV\nI saw you out they're interacting with people in the community and I love it ... the way that you take the job on a lot of people\nI've seen police officers you know guys like this to who walk around like like you know their stuff doesn't speak I've seen some go I think are sometimes too lenient you seem to really have it down to do I'm going to interact with my neighbor here maybe somebody who goes to church with me or my my kids go to school together\nBut at the same time I I Can't let them go too far because then that would make it bad for the community is that kind of how you approach it\nYou know that is these are my neighbors these are people that I'm going to see at the store and these are people that I'm going to deal with in the future and uh I don't know what his wedding it's gone on in their life to put him to this point so I tried to treat everybody with dignity and respect and we try to go in there now they escalated\nI don't have a problem escalating as well but I find that you can you can attract more flies and then you can then they're\nSaying and and watching you interact that again the sheriff mark lamb from ... county I've seen that I mean you walk up generally speaking to my ... unless they like get a shot somebody you walk up generally speaking very respectful and and I use seem to be giving them the benefit of the doubt now\nHow often do you figure percentage you can put on this where somebody will not get with the program not understand but you might actually be willing to cut them a break and they just don't shut up and they just give you a hard time and it's this whole community versus the police but is there a percentage of people that you think talk their way into jail or into a ticket or something\nOh yeah I don't know what it is for most police officers I mean for me it probably about ten percent of those female\nOr ... difficult to deal yeah\nAnd uh you know I'm I'm a believer in calmness power if you walk up your common they can steal that they don't feel you're amped up it ... it really\nHelps that situation go a lot smoother even if you have to rent it ended up going to last year but there's some people that have just like you said from the word go they're not with the program and that you could tell that immediately\nWhat I've learned from watching you a ... mark limping out County Arizona and from watching other law enforcement officers on on shows like lie PT and others\nUm it is that when you walk up you generally speaking don't want to put somebody in a bind I mean there really is a lot more discretion that I think I ever knew there was\nA but again if somebody's going to get with the program you'd probably have three or four or five different charges on some cases that you can lay on them and but they're also minor enough to where you could still get them home tonight that you know it's kinda it's I didn't know that do you hear from other people like me who say you know I had no clue you guys could deal with it that way\nYeah you know a lot of people don't realize that and we do have a lot of discretion and that's why I Try to tell people look\nJust relax you know there's going to go a lot more did a lot differently than you think you just stay calm and just work through it um and it does give us the ability to use some of that discretion but you're right and if we wanted to we get stuck on a ton of charges too so it it really just depends on on where they want to take\nAnywhere imagine cooking butter based at stake for sure pork tenderloin key
