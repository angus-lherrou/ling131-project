I'm ... I'm here or whatever you want to call her but she said it but she's not credible and that goes to by by the expert opinion of a prosecutor as a specialist in this field\nOne Christine lousy Ford\nDidn't know when but she says\nAt a party when she was Fifteen and he was Seventeen that Brett Kavanaugh push on the bed laid on top of her tried to date her clothes off put his hand over her mouth and\nShe she got away and then and then left she says it got to be more judge was in the room was playing the music loudly and running interference for Kavanaugh mark judge says wasn't there no idea what she's talking about\nHer her very good friend late and somebody a girl said I have absolutely no recollection of that ever happening and I don't think I've ever met Brett Kavanaugh\nAnybody and everybody else did she said was at that party has refuted the claim well Christine lousy Ford testified in front of his panel the Senate Judiciary committee\n\nAnd leaving their left and right middle everybody's ... incredible credible witness credible which is actually true she's not credible she might be believable that she really is\nWhere she really does believe that she's a victim and something really did happen to her but it is incredible that it was Brett Kavanaugh\nAnd it's simple to to go down logically as to why she doesn't know when it happened not even a year doesn't know where it happened not even the neighborhood doesn't know whose house it was\nDoesn't know how she got to the party doesn't know how she left the party she's been incorrect about everybody she says was that the party and she's actually given a couple of different numbers as to how many people were at the party\nBrett Kavanaugh on the other hand has\nEverybody corroborating his story and he's got a a calendar that shows what he was doing every weekend and every weekday basically in Nineteen eighty two or whatever it was\nSo as much as she might have been believable that something happened to her and I hope she gets built the bees and help the person who did it is brought to justice but it was not credible her allegations against this guy specifically and that to a point\nOf delineation that the the legacy media didn't want to have legacy media didn't want to say well she's credible as somebody who probably had something happened to her but it is not credible what she's saying about Brett Kavanaugh the legacy media didn't do its job and then reported that correctly\nThe second accusation which I'm a woman named Deborah Ramirez who says that at a party they were playing some game\nThat I don't know you do to spin the bottle or there was a quarter as if they're playing something to where if you lost you had to drink and they were purposely making her drink and got her so drunk you're going to remember anything and then uh she's told wrecked Kavanaugh put her but his member are pulled pulled it out\nAnd put it near her face now she admittedly doesn't remember it and when Democrats staffers from the Democrat senators that are on the panel\nCalls are contacted her she spent six days calling old friends asking headed something happened to me\nYou remember anything happened to me and nobody remembers anything\nAfter six day she decided yeah I I guess it did happen I wasn't I wasn't sure but yeah I I Am now he did it I don't remember him doing it but I remember people telling me that he did it\nTo his cabinet are set up with no there was anything like that what are you talking about\nThe third one is from slime ball lawyer I have an oddity is truly sweat Nick who says that for three years Brett Kavanaugh mark judge worthy organizers of parties where there would be trains are boys are taking a gang rape\nCabinet and judge she said would spike the punch with grain alcohol\nAnd ... she knew this was going on but she was smart enough to not drink the punch then one day and this happen between Nineteen eighty one night than eighty three she said but one day a one party joins ten of them\nIn Nineteen eighty two she somehow was the victim and was gang raped but continue to go into the parties for another full year and instead of calling the police which she said was just don't drink the punch\nShe changed her story to NBC News at least once NBC News instead of saying we can't run this ...\nShe's not viable not credible not believable that rented anyway and then said it's important to note that the stories you say today is different or there are differences from the stories you originally told us her story has changed a bunch of times then heard history comes out especially somebody that makes you got about allegations all the time\nSo completely not credible\nBut that didn't matter to grow because Booker that didn't matter too lazy that didn't matter to Feinstein that didn't matter to ... they didn't didn't matter to come up with Harris it didn't matter to any of these people\nHe was he was guilty Cory Booker robots recalled Spartacus but he's admitted Grover what are your Fifteen he groped a girl he admits that he's a senator somehow he actually said at this point it doesn't matter if he's guilty or innocent\nCory Booker said that\nAnd he meant it it doesn't matter if judge Kavanaugh's guilty or innocent at this point well that I Believe galvanized us as a people we said that's not fair\nDue process of this in this country is guaranteed you are innocent until proven guilty and if that's the threshold and it is\nThen he's innocent nothing any of these\nWomen has said or the the the slimy lawyer has said or the far left wing resist lawyer cats who is a lawyer for Ford nothing they've said\nHas proven anything\nAll you have is Deborah bureaus completely uncorroborated in fact refuted by people Julie sweating it just seems to be a nun ... from outer space story she's given and received Ford\nOnly they say something happened\nEverybody else name and the FBI spent five days six days\nInterviewing many more people ... didn't come to the Bush has offered up evidence that there is no cooperation there is nothing more here\n\nYet the left is still today going Twitter read your favorite website they still today have these paid protesters showing up in the Senate halls\nTheir ducks and people which means are putting out their information their their phone number is their addresses\nIt say a violent crew of idiots better still just completely disconnected from the rest of us Melissa mulatto is your spokesperson\nAmy Schumer is your spokesperson and their argument against Kavanaugh they're still attempting there's still exempting these days are rapists serial rapists at about a rapist on the court it's it's a disgusting this way\nThey are trying their best to change the best although flawed system judicial system on earth to to be Saudi Arabia or something or China\nCome on man\nSo Brett Kavanaugh and again as I Do the show it's not happened yet but I assume that he will be confirmed later today there are a couple of things that could happen\nBetween now and then and and yes we've got to talk about Lisa Murkowski who is a an alleged Republican from Alaska who is going to vote against Brett Kavanaugh today and she the reason she gave was he's a good man\nJust not the right guy for the job right now we would come home and so I Need your thoughts on this\nI I'm guaranteeing that you would have never been this engaged in a Supreme Court nominee ever in your life I guarantee that is true\nBut let's break it down and where are you on this even if you're on the left or even a political you're a Democrat or a liberal and somebody who'd generally speaking doesn't agree with me or doesn't agree with Trump\nYou're welcome them so we have these Dan\nFour men than for\nPerformances poor I agree\nDo they do it to your mom ringing yeah they they they [noise]\nThey they they harmony for you don't need to\nDo your duty again trying\nBack to ride stuck in the

flakes lakes lake I go to just go and play play but I'm going to call it 'cause my ... am I going to do that but there you go a little some something for your thoughts on what's going down on what's happened so far and and again\nWe do the show before a vote would have been taken on Saturday So or to keep a close eye on that there are a couple of big monkey wrench is that can be thrown in you got this guy deems a believe a Montana whose daughter is getting married today\nAnd as the father of my daughters I with a [noise]\nHe's got to be at his daughter's wedding we that's got to happen so he's a Republican and he's a yes vote for Kavanaugh will he be there when the vote happens if they have fifty that's enough because they've got Mike Pence will be the tie breaker\nVery very interesting to me this is going to go down I Want to know where you are on this especially if you're on the left\nThe party on the left Democrats went way too far here and actually shot themselves in the foot one

things to be so again at Joe talk show a lot of people want to be heard\nOn this confirmation process has been disgusting it really has been enrolled it all started with Diane Feinstein sitting on this letter that she had for two months you realize you're Dianne Feinstein the ranking member of the ... member bunch that\nYou realize that she had this letter even when she was talking to Brett Kavanaugh privately in her office didn't say a word had the letter when she was questioning Brett Kavanaugh I'm In the open hearing\nDidn't say a word when it looked as though Brett Kavanaugh was going to be fast track because he's easily qualified for this job then suddenly somebody in her office or some lawyers somebody leaked to the fact that there was a letter\nAnd with the woman's name was for the matter what you think of Christie loves before she was a victim your two\nOf the left politics\nEight hundred five zero one Seventy eighty let me go to the phone line to see where you are on this coast were either a country divided or were country galvanized I think this was just\nAn absolute practice\nFutility for the left and I think that it probably served to motivate those on the right I think you'll see a lot more conservatives and Republicans do\nGo to an even centrist that lean right go to the polls for the midterm whereas they might have said sat at home before I think the Republicans will gain two or three seats in the Senate and we'll keep control of that body or it's still gonna be very close in the house but if you have a better chance now because now the bases riled up\nThis was a really bad miscalculation\nBy the left in this country the political let let me go on the phone lines and say hello to uh Roger who's in Spokane Roger what's going on high\nIn running yo hey I think clay clay is appropriate name thank you and who\nWere in favor of that and I'm really disappointed in the Republican you know that they cannot stronger during the early process\nThat I'm even more upset with the Democrats and ... and ... and ...\nNot a and get your act together and that\nHe truly representative and that given the crap and and get very disappointed in the whole process and that kind of and the need to be elected the next the cream colored yeah\nRoger I think it's a very good point the Republicans were very ... to the big invention for the call by the way\nI'm very weak in the beginning they just didn't want her to keep decorum they wanted to keep it all the up and up and I and I can appreciate that but when the hearings distorted let's go back to that a month ago as soon as grassy started speaking Kamala Harris interrupted him rudely\nYou know all this fake outrage\nAbout how Kavanaugh interrupted Feinstein and some others because he was fighting for his political and personal life and for his family Kamala Harris purposely interrupted him\nYeah Cory Booker purposely interrupted him I think lawyers are did they were ... ... it was it was set up that you had protesters that there are some pictures out there that suggests they were getting paid to go to the cheaper in protest to all this fake outrage about red cabin on it and his\n... and his temperament is that it's all BS\nBut I agree with you the Republicans aggressor you I think that in the end they did it the right way but as that was going on hey wait a second elections have consequences we won were in charge of the committee I Will clear there's room if you've given interrupting then it would ... would proper political is when they were breaking it on purpose\nBecause they really thought they're putting on a show which somehow window for them he turned out it made them look like idiots will be it used to that they are Clyde in Lexington, Kentucky iCloud what's going on\nHey Joe ... thank you very much for taking my call really you've got a\nI think the Democrats are dead so now they're [laughter] they're getting worse every month or just getting worse and worse and they try to take that man down there to get it very frustrating\n[noise] ah [noise] the other thing is I Can't understand how anybody could think that Corning crying or at a man makes him guilty\nAnd you've got a list of the best shot if that's true but that's why the court case and I just think it's all for what they're trying to do to Brett Kavanaugh because the guy obviously has a lot of classic that very well rounded young man I call them young because I'm sixty six I'm over the hill\nCan [noise]\nGet hockey time in the pioneer valley news radio five sixty W.

be able to help and\nUm you know somebody younger guys when I was here a couple of years ago taking steps in in that in terms of their game and the leadership and the way they play so it's um\nUnexpected about and it's a big honor and and I appreciate it being given and hope to uh do good things will then\nHow would you describe your own personal leadership style and what you\nPicture

gotten better than others\nYou talked a little bit about the younger guys who are here in twenty sixteen Seventeen guys like driving on Anthony Greco and guys who are taking these big strides forward in the year that you were here and in the twenty Seventeen Eighteen these how did that change the excitement level for you for being a part of the thunderbirds versus where he was in their inaugural
