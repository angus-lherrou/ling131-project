advisor but again people need to understand how all these things work as simple as that absolutely hey thanks everybody for lifting a we hope that you found the information we present of helpful\nAnd we will be back again next week we're going to have the topics in questions that more right here on the financial support with Richard oh dear\nWhile she was meeting privately with Brett Kavanaugh but not telling Brett Kavanaugh about\nAny of these allegations whatsoever member that\nAnyway well Deborah Katz is the one that well she didn't really believe Paula Jones and she did take al Franken's side\nAnd you know it as you know you just got to watch this\nIt there's no end to this now they are not going to stop until they\nGet a no vote on Brecht capital that's just this they should not surprise anybody and Jeff Flake is now in Massachusetts today trying to run for president thinking he's gonna which by the way is the way to do it you don't like Trump Gobi to and thirty six days\nDemocrats they'll make their case\nAnd they're going to ask you to give the house of representatives to Nancy Pelosi in the Senate Democrats to Chuck Schumer if that's what you want on election night in thirty six days and you want to turn on the TV and find out the results\nIf you stay home well you'll get the government you deserve we always do\nYou want all progress that we have now achieved in two years to stop that'll happen too\nBut all the senators saying well no no no we got to limit the scope but it's got to be very quick expeditious in and just have the FBI do this that's not what they ever intended they want this to drag on through the mid term elections in the hope that Donald Trump doesn't get to make as Supreme Court nomination\nAnyway joining us now is Carrie Severino she's the chief counsel policy director\nFor the Judicial Crisis network a welcome back to the program well as predicted the bar has shifted and now the Democrats won an extensive FBI investigation but from my standpoint as it relates to professor forward there's really only for people that need to be interviewed and I would assume by now all four of them probably work\n[laughter] I'm sure they were it was either find people because they already had been interviewed by the Senate Judiciary committee let the the the goalposts are moving faster than the speed of light here it's it's very difficult to believe that any of these people\nAnd it it can take themselves seriously they said it's going to be four days a week and now they're going I an artificial deadline\nYou know they were saying the FBI the gold standard there impartial there you know she worked at every Democrat that now they're going up that Trump is evil puppet master controlling the FBI are actually going to be it's horrible part is an organization\nYou know it it it it is and it would be laughable if it wasn't a man's lifelong reputation here on the line\nHere so when I had to go get like two weeks ago as far as everybody else knew Brett Kavanaugh had an impeccable reputation that is now that's gone forever\nYou know re Donovan famously once said after being investigated for a year and a half where do I go to get my good name back mhm well in this case I I don't think Brett Kavanaugh ever gets back in many many ways I mean Clarence Thomas will ever be remembered because of the last minute accusations of Anita Hill\nYeah it it it's very discouraging although I have to say I I Do get ... on ... you know someone who clerk for Justice Thomas and knows the why he he you know there are certain ... ... people who are going to get simply use that as their kids to discount discount them because they disagree with in any way\nOn a clear someone who does can an incredible amount of respect on that that judge Kavanaugh is a kind of person where even when he ... on the circuit\nAt a lower court judge that Supreme Court\nThey saw him as someone to really take seriously\nYou know more than a dozen times they bought the fourteen different times they found out they vindicated his opinion they had a huge amount of respect for him I don't think that's going to change I think um they are not going to be watching this\nWith the same knee jerk parties in response is I Hope that that that we're seeing some some of these people are ... but I but it's\nThe parents' reputation now\nIf you read James Comey's New York times piece that he came out with the ... it to me it's absolutely stunning\nAnd the things that he's saying because while the FBI's packet in the middle of it when we handled the Hillary Clinton email investigation while he was writing an exoneration himself prior to the real investigation which didn't happen until three days before he publicly exonerated her\nUm but then he goes on to trash the president at length\nAnd then he talks about FBI agents are experts which they are interviewing people in quickly dispatching leads to their colleagues around the world to follow up with additional interviews\nAnd they will confront people with testimony and other accounts and\nYou know yes the alleged incident occurred thirty six years ago but at the age is no time has little to do with memory um which I found a little strange\nUm and then you know for example everybody remembers if it rained on their wedding day\nUh I don't think that's a ... in that particular sense maybe to somebody who is traumatized by could see that but for somebody that's not traumatized maybe not um once they start interviewing every witness knows the consequences he says\nIs one thing to have your lawyers submitted statement on your habits are very different thing to sit across from two FBI special agents and answer their relentless questions of course the bureau won't have subpoena power only the ability to knock on doors and ask questions most people will speak to them that there is what he says refusal to do so\nIs its own kind of statement now I Want to just address that because my FBI friends\nMy friends in the in the bureau special agents have all said to me never ever talk to the FBI unless you have a lawyer ever and I'm like why I'm somebody who loves the FBI I don't love the upper brass\nOn their Khomeini and the cave and struck and page but\nThe FBI is is the ... the FBI people I Know the salt of the earth people\nAnd I said of course I'd want to help him he goes no and then they say look what happened to General Flynn General Flynn is accused of lying to the FBI and the FBI didn't think he was lying to them and you just it's dumb to ever talk to any law enforcement without a ...\nThat's what all my law enforcement people friends say because it's a crime if you lie to the FBI let's say you said something in the Senate Judiciary investigation and it doesn't exactly match up you could be charged with a crime of lying to the FBI it's ridiculous\nAnd you know the irony that this ... hit companies coming and low right now it's just to try to destroy Trump with everything he can and his other another section in that play book but the irony at the exact same\nFederal law provision that says it's a crime to to lie the FBI is the one that said it's a crime to lie to the Senate and they're with their debts get it's not just you know a similar penalty is exactly the same\nStatutory violation so that's just not they've been kind of pretending that that I guess playing a little bit on people's images maybe from the movies of what the FBI guys", "year": "2018", "show_name": "The Steve Rovithis Show - Your Real Estate
