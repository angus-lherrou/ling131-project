all kinds of important conversation between struck companies you redacted in front of us we had to go with the Justice Department find it wouldn't be the first time he hasn't given us information frankly I think we're in ... I'm going to real well we've got thirty seconds in a time to get into another subject here Mr I'm\nWhich I'm I'm proceed dead but I Do think it's interesting that you ... you discovered it and we couldn't get it right away like all the other text messages we had to wait until the final report\nOur to Sean Hannity show toll free number is eight hundred nine four one Sean if you want to be a part of the program what we played their Rod Rosenstein you know for people that did wrong in the deal Jay face consequences\nRegarding ... well he signed the final buys a warrant himself and then when he was talking about the rule of law speaking up for truth and Jim Jordan blasting Rod Rosenstein uh conduct now the president met yesterday on air force one apparently had a meeting not a lot of details about what went on in the meeting\nWith Rod Rosenstein there was talk about well he might be fired after it had been discovered that he was talking about well you want me to wear a wire\nAround the president and his answer was you know at least has the spin was well I was just saying that you wouldn't want me to wear a wire around the president and it was all in the tone and the cadence of what he said we have three articles in front of me right now one by Katherine heritage at Fox one by Sarah Carter won by John Solomon\nA Solomon's article goes on former FBI lawyer plot to record removed Trump was not a joke and John Solomon let me read from the article don't tell for her FBI general council member James Baker\nHe was one of those that resigned that those infamous discussions\nAbout secretly recording president Donald Trump and using the tapes to remove him for office where a joke he apparently doesn't believe it and he yelled quite the vantage point as he was on the inside of the FBI bureaus leadership and may have twenty Seventeen when the discussions occurred and Baker told Congress last week\nThat his boss than acting FBI Director Andrew McCabe remember became\nAnd Lisa Page both took notes of the meeting and McCabe was saying yeah Rod Rosenstein had in fact said this\nAnyway now James Baker is saying and Andrew McCabe is saying that in fact they were dead serious about about the idea\nOf Sarah surreptitiously recording the forty fifth president\nUsing the evidence to make the case\nThat Trump should be removed from office according to every source now in all three articles and Baker told lawmakers that he wasn't in the meeting that McCain had with the deputy attorney general Rod Rosenstein and which the subject came up but he had first hand conversations with Medicaid\nAnd the FBI lawyer that was assigned to a ... page about the issue so Baker talk to both of the\nUn quote as far as Baker was concerned this was a real plan being discussed that a source directly familiar with the congressional investigation it was no laughing matter to the FBI or member then you can go back to what was the insurance policy to remove Trump\nIs five months now into his presidency is this just before the appointment of the special counsel\nThat says just in that timeframe around the media elite strategy that was occurring anyway so it goes on word of bakers testimony now surface just days before Rosenstein said to be interviewed them private by the\nHouse Judiciary committee lawmakers that's supposed to happen Thursday of this week and the New York times first reported allegations that Rosenstein the number two at the department of justice has tried to downplay his role in all of this in his office suggested that\nHe thought the discussion was a joke that Rosenstein never gave in order to carry out any such plot and he doesn't believe the Trump should be removed from office of making those statements through a spokesperson is a bit different than having Rosenstein himself face Congress\nAnswer the questions under the penalty of a felony if lawmakers think he's lying and bakers account lawmakers this month clearly complicates already complicated picture\nAs it relates to Rod Rosenstein before shows up for Thursday's interview but even more so Baker story lays ... extraordinary conversation and we go on from there and now we're going to really take our time with this issue today and we're going to now begin to put the\nPieces of the puzzle together because what this is we're laying out here are the top people the upper echelon\nRemember twenty five people have either been demoted fired or have left the FBI the O. J. and their\nUpper ranks here and James Baker is one of them and Andrew McCabe at least a page of both corroborating what apparently now James Baker is set about Rod Rosenstein anyway John Solomon ease but investigative reporter is what the hell\nBreak Jarrett Fox News legal analyst and of course the seller of the number one book the Russia hoax\nThank you all for being with us I'm John let's just I Want to also put this in context where people because it gets complicated\nWe've got a first start with the timeline the timeline is mayor of twenty Seventeen well that's when Robert Mueller is getting appointed by Rod Rosenstein just before that we had people like ... at least a page and and Peter Struck talking about uh media elite strategy that had to do with the dusty a\nWhile it now appears that that was all being league for the purposes and again ... all was was the dot CA recycled in different news outlets for the purpose of initiating the special counsel so would get appointed that we're discovering that they're even talking about Sarah petitions lead\nTaping the president of the United states so that they can remove him from office this sounds like a cool to me\nOr if there's one other event that occurs and that may turn friends that really I think you're a shockwave for this conversation and that was the termination of James\nComey's the FBI Director of it all out all this Russia investigation to go on and we know now ... after market every day they don't have anywhere from a proving any form of collusion with Russia so they've been nine months out of James Kobe's let this go on for nine months\nHe's let two agents who have an anti Trump a bias read that investigation he get fired and once the natural reaction of all those who've been supporting James Comey and roses or a McCain aide\nAnd a stroke page it's hey maybe we can remove this guy rather we can't prove that he did something wrong with Russia maybe we can prove these incompetent and will will record him and uh and maybe try to take 'em out through the recording and the twenty Fifth Amendment this is not what the FBI with hot in the ... record talking about the history book\nLays out a real possibility that this was a soft crew right look at this we have the FBI not investigating a crime here that in fact they can't find a crime by a page\nAs well at least two pages testimony just to be clear she said they they had found nothing and nine months leading up to the point\nThat's right so they switch gears right maybe we can remove them through other means and and this conversation is so extraordinary ... it is isn't that drama the FBI or twenty Fifth Amendment never envision the FBI being involved in it\nSo you've got the FBI and the deputy attorney general or allegedly our conversation he says it's a joke\nThey say they're dead serious about it and they believe he was dead serious about it and no matter which way are coming down just another example of how far down the road the FBI was beyond its core mission which is to investigate crimes stop counterintelligence\nAnd again this has nothing to do with rank and file agents that all this this is John group of rogue power hungry upper echelon management types and if anything they took the the cases away from the field offices purposely so that they can involved themselves in these nefarious activities that's why\nIt really does explain a Greg Jarrett why every up", "show_name": "The Steve Rovithis Show - Your Real Estate Resource", "year": "2018", "city": "Springfield", "day": "13"}
