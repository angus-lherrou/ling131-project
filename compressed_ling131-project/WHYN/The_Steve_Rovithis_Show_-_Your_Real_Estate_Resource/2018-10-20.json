the funniest\nRetired military and they weren't going from here and leave Iraq on or off of the nation and better than\n\nThe way it was for his services only ... percent investment tax where we live on for making up and pain sources that are going to be reliable energy the root of orders gas viable\nFor information to consult with all of\nMean when you hear the financial Franklin claims paying a building in the last week on\nAnybody wants to thoroughly review the contract with the details of\nThe company fails then why it's brand new five ... only those are the person or people making them\nOr we have representative John Ratcliffe\nAt talking about fusion GPS founder Glenn Simpson well he's now saying that indicated he's going to plead the fifth he's not saying a word anymore or he was on Fox News Sunday telling Maria ...\nThat Glenn Simpson is in real legal jeopardy in all of this you also confirmed that the FBI has evidence that directly refused the premise of a ... a Trump Russia probe in other words that there's been and remains exculpatory evidence\nThere was a great piece by Jonathan Turley ... three reasons mall or may not charge Trump with obstruction apparently not asking any questions about it but\nSticking exclusively to whether or not there was any type of collusion which we all know the answer to a you have one top Republican lawmaker now saying the FBI failed to provide a federal surveillance court with important evidence well we don't that now for a long time and we know that\nFor Pfizer court judges\nOr handed information that was supposed to be verified and corroborated ended up being Hillary Clinton's bought and paid for Russian lies that was put together by fusion GPS interestingly funneled money through Perkins Coolio law from the hiring of Christ is Christopher Steele a foreign national he doesn't even stand by the information and the ...\nAnd it was the bulk of information to get for Pfizer warrants\nAgainst the Trump campaign associate and the lead up to the twenty sixteen race all this comes down to some simple basic fundamental things and they never told the Pfizer judges that it was\nHillary Clinton they paid for this information and it's unbelievable that this could be happening in this country but it looks like we're finally beginning to get to the bottom of it at least I Hope so\nJason Chaffetz is with us former congressman now on Fox News contributor author of New York times best seller the deep state we have a Victorian tons singing Joe diGenova of diGenova and Toensing with us a thank you both for being here let's start with Jason shape it's because this is your will house\nAnd it seems to me that it doesn't matter what Congress request\nAs they seek to do their job of oversight they're never going to get the information from the department of justice and they're not going to get the people they need to talk in front of them under oath\nWell the hard part about when you issue a subpoena when I was the chairman of the oversight commission or committee I can issue a subpoena but the only way to go on for that is through the department of justice and so the weight of the paper really isn't worth much because the deejay won't enforce its own subpoena the subpoena issued by Congress\nThat the name that people need to also militarized themselves with is marked Elias market why it was ...\nHe was counsel for the DNC he was careful for Hillary Clinton he\nWas counsel for a ... group he was involved there this this guy sits in the middle of a lot of these transactions and the movement of money and I think more and more you'll start to see his name along with you know or and Simpson and all these others\nWell I think the fact that ... Simpson is now saying Victoria that was going to plead the fifth and it can get away with that and make them come in and plead the fifth you know the idea that they can just threatened to plead the fifth and not have to actually go through with it I think it's important\nThey should make him show up and in front of the TV cameras plead the fifth and it's ridiculous to accept a letter from the lawyers on and I hope Jason you're talking to your former French and telling them to get them to\nUh get in to the Congress to take that said and I don't care if they're not going to I'm In ... because I think there are other ways to to figure out how to do it\nYou've got a subpoena used the peanut first and then you negotiate later you don't say oh mine he didn't show up talking trying to work it out now you have to think about scene and he said Pina and then you say you can't make it Wednesday then you make it Thursday that I Can't believe there's no ... well\nI mean I'm trying to understand I mean the president said that there would be de classification and all the materials the Jim Jordan was just talking about would be an redacted and we'd have a chance to see the ... the gang of eight information that three oh two between\nA Bruce or and Christopher Steele and how they wanted a funnel that information straight into Robert Mueller's office or Joe diGenova but you know the idea of why do I think even with you and Victoria's my attorneys\nThat I wouldn't get away with just saying I'm going to plead the fifth leave me alone now or or not handing over subpoenaed materials to Congress\nWell I don't think there's any question that Congress has dropped the ball on course to get some opinions but let me just say this 'cause this is really important all the names that you heard\nMichael than Mr liar Simpson or all those people they are ... to everything that was done in the United states\nWhat's fascinating is what happened in the United kingdom between the Congress has an important issue a subpoena score we now know that the FBI\nOr am I stick and that you do you conduct electronic surveillance of American city hit on foreign soil without legal authority to do so and that information\nWas fat conversations George ... what were your perspective and into court intercepting the compensation they found out that Papadopoulos was not interested in Hillary email or anything else and they never ... information to the by the court\nYou know it seems congressman shape it's that every piece of the puzzle now is falling in place I think we now understand what the insurance policy was Lisa Page testified that in the the nine months of the investigation\nLeading up to the appointment of special counsel Robert Mueller that they had no evidence of Trump Russia collusion at all\nUm and by the way even her lover Peter Struck said the same thing he said well I'd be all end if there was something there there is no there are there and then all of a sudden we find the media elites strategy that they discussed this with Andrew McCabe comes in James Baker comes in and other people come in\nAnd what we see is again it goes back to the Clinton bought and paid dossier that dossier information is leaked out to the media creating the impression that in fact there was Russia Trump collusion\nBut they did it themselves they took the again it's it's all they were doing the leaking so that they can appoint the special counsel so then the which one could be ... begin I is there any part of the puzzle that isn't clear to you because it's getting very clear to me\nDo it is becoming a crystal clear\nAnd that's why Jim Jordan is exactly right\nThe people that were in that meeting and reverse the timing of this evening this meeting happens directly after\nA district Colombia's relieved of his duties but just before I'm Mr Mueller is put into place and you have to understand who's in that meeting what was discussed it sounds like bakers being most candid about what was going on there but each of the people in that meeting should be brought in for its own their own deposition\nUh transcribe under oath", "show_name": "The Steve Rovithis Show - Your Real Estate Resource", "year": "2018", "city": "Springfield", "day": "20"}
