John you remember the days when you and I were selling you know three and four routes that day yes yeah you're lucky if you get three and a roof so weak\nDon't forget no that was that was Fifteen Years ago I Know when when we're all in ... when ... when ... when we were taking the tree tap shingle off a roof ... only lasted ten to Fifteen the ... the because it wasn't an ventilated properly and it was today today if you put a roof over our house Twenty years ago\nIs still looks like they want to look into ventilation right is it correct legal that's why that's why the resources have slowed down right\nAnd because of all those catastrophes that we had in the areas where people you know we had to her a tornado in two thousand eleventh two thousand twelve we had the ice dams and yet I was in twelve\nIn abundance of rules were done whether the rules were five years old or ten years old or Fifteen Years old they all need a new roofs at that time between hail damage and things like that so that's why the ... the roof in marketplaces slowed down because now all these groups are just eight to ten years old\nAnd there's no need to put a new roof of the house that was roof is only eight ten years old\nRight and that's and that's what I'm Talking about John is that I think that if you look at the the marketplace itself I think there's a lot of people out there that are not really putting on roost right now because of the fact that it is um\nI don't think that there's a lot of people that are thinking of doing their roofs\nWell its roots are in need it right out of wine because I don't\nThink we had the hailstorm right I don't think we wind damage I don't think we had you know the ice dams from last year I don't think there was a lot of ice and snow and stuff we only

years where was the last one year out and do you do you go to a composite ...\nWell yeah but then you know that's the expensive yes you know so now John the other thing too and it's a great question to ask because I think it also leads into ducking like we're talking about earlier\nIf you buy a brand new pressure treated deck you cannot and let me rephrase this one more time you cannot stand it are painted for the first six months to eight months to a year\nIt has to dry out I bought a pressure treated piece of wood John that weighed ten times more than what it did just because it had so

three one nine for nine six\nSorry we're into the third segment of the show right so we again we're going to ask those callers out are those people listening out there they may have been home improvement question give us a call we will talk about anything and everything right jump\nYou know we talked about roofing deck in signing and window citing in windows are a good fall project I I think they are but you know and there was actually windows\nI think any project that you're thinking about doing is the best time to call is when you're thinking about yes now starting off with do you have a budget in mind right most people don't ask themselves this question now don't think about\nWell cheese let me find out whether or how much the prices and then I'll go get alone when I knew no that's the\nBiggest mistake you can make go find how much and I I'm going to say this\nA carefully go find out how much you're worth it and I don't mean to sound is really bad but you got to understand you're borrowing money from a bank today with interest rates rising I'd a lady that had to get a loan they asked her for her divorce records\nI mean why the bank needs to know anything about her life is none of their business but this is what they're doing today they're literally going through every fine tooth comb of your life to find out whether you're going to pay them back\nWell they're protecting themselves horse they are you know what I'm saying the banks are ruthless this way and I don't like banks and I don't like insurance companies because they only protect themselves well they don't protect you as a consumer\nWell they're in business to make money in the in the audience companies in business to save money in the U.S as a ... you need a the protection from the what the banks and with the insurance companies also seemed to help you in the in the near future if you're doing need\nRight here so if we can focus in on you the consumer first and say hey guys go get your loan figure out how much money you got to the bank sell off your stocks and bonds\nYou know figure out where you know if you're getting a gift from a family member find out how much it is right figure out how much you got then talked to a contractor because if you have no money you shouldn't be getting estimates on something that you have no money to do\nWell you're right I I Would check credit scores and see if your credit is up to par if you've done it\nKarma dot com right here you can go on your phone or your smartphone and in anything like this is what you're going to find it\nIt's very simple yes and uh this way he can find out what your credit scores and if you and you have decent credit and you have no money you can also find me a ... an secure loans to green sky synchrony this this will be five or six to ... us different institutions that offer financing\nRight at the un secured say give me a credit card and some of them go up to thirty five forty thousand ... ...\nThat's where you come in right because now that if you know that you can't get money from a bank or that your credit score is doing really good and you know you have no loans then you shouldn't be a problem with writing zero percent financing or a ... very low interest financing\nFlyers nine nine the seven point nine nine to nine point nine nine depending on what\nYou want and and you find it for Eighteen months do no interest ... no payment you guys off for finding yes see finances finance is very important to teach people that that need the job done and because if if you're if you have equity in the home is still going to take your six to eight weeks to get that money right\nSo just to the audience understands you know sturdy home improvement offers financing for those people that need to get a roof right and it's available to you where you don't have to do what no money down a little money down okay it's just just based on your credit score see for me as a small contractor I don't do that I don't have\nThat so my job is more of the\nYou know kitchens bathrooms handyman stuff that type of thing I Love the small jobs those are the things that I enjoy the most\nUm the ones where you guys come into your offer additions and kitchens and remodeling and the same thing in your off this financing available you know those projects so for me I don't do that John and that's okay because that's a cost of doing business and I also\nThe paperwork and they don't have a you know a staff like you guys out but that's okay there's nothing wrong with that you're a good local contractor that does work John you guys Connecticut\nEaster master of math ledger all over Massachusetts you actually asked west or we can\nHandle the volume in a just like if you need a roof we can handle the volume of put a roof find your home right we do over two hundred three hundred a ... a year and a work helping that can withstand any type of ah any type of job no jobs too small little jobs too big for us to handle it and do we get out there and do it in a professional manner\nAnd and you know it's funny because we've always all used to talk on the show about consumer protection and one of the things you know as I'm passionate\nAbout is understanding the differences between one contractor and another the other biggest myth in our industry that I Want everyone I don't care if you're listening in Massachusetts Connecticut Washington D. C. where every year at\nOne of the things that you need to understand is that this myth that you cannot share an estimate with another contractor is a myth\nI each going valley it's like going down the casino in and and your calls somebody's bluff to to see what what type of contract from another contract\nAnd if they end by the way it does the number matter no no the estimate on that the number that that's on that contract doesn't matter until you compare apples to apples who you get that comparison of the job\nAnd when they don't know I Do I ask them coming to the name\nIf you're embarrassed above than they cover the name of\nThis for you to be embarrassed about John John we we technically compete against the yes yeah OK\nAnd when I'm In the room with someone else and they said well John a seller was there I go hey just a good friend of mine right great company nice guy absolutely people you can trust right right okay so why would I sit there and speak ill of a good company now if there is a bad\nCompany what is your mother always say if you got nothing good to say don't say say don't you think as a consumer you want people to tell you are going on\nWell well I I just I I look at the line item Sam I says I don't need a name on the bottom line to shake a logistical show\nMe showed me the middle of the guts of the of the proposal where the scope of workers listed\nAlready taken a permanent now does he have proper insurance are they putting their own dumpster on the driveway or the uh are certified by the manufacturer or to use it will use a roofing sample or to use in six feet of ice and water are they using the synthetic on delay meant\nAre using trip pages a three inch five in trading strip edge or they use and started to ... to cut the tree tap shingle are using the hip\nAnd rich cap or they cut the tree tap shingle for the hip and rich kept these are people just fell asleep listening to that Cleveland might have fell asleep but they're all looking at their contracts and looking at looking at him right now and say\nCheese that part of the ... is that part of the scope of war and that and that determines the war coverage also see that that goes from a a ten twenty year two fifty lifetime", "year": "2018", "show_name": "The Daily Dive Weekend Edition", "city": "Springfield", "day": "07"}
