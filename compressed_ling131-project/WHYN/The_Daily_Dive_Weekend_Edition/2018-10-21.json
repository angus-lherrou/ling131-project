windows in your house and now the doors you know you you have that the stuffed animal that stuff's and snake on the bottom of your door keeping the draft\nOut now [laughter] this is neat yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah they put the snake underneath the door to draft now that's the problem now's the\nTime to think about putting a new entry door into your home is in the long run\nAnd treat door is a good deadbolt lock said yes now as a company we don't supplied to lock sets the dead ball\nBecause we can go out there and spend Nineteen dollars for that both the ... you could spend over three hundred four hundred dollars for a good ... and that's all right all it's very important that as a homeowner and you want to be secured\nYou want to be able to pick up the what you want as a lock said yes and you know normally like to see on the on the on the door GM is the metal casing around the block so yes the metal the little metal a trim around the locks said so\nIf someone does try to kick the door and if you're preventing it from a ... ...\nWell when you have um is it very simply John if you have a concerned over your door security\nRight now you know you know the strike play where the ash comes to that's what I'm Talking right the little tiny plate okay here's a very simple tip for you guys out there there's usually about an\nInch screw that just hold that into\nThe gym at the door yes okay take that screw out and replace that screw with a three or four inch screw right okay that would prevent someone from coming by maybe chicken manure and breaking the gym right so just by simply changing those two screws you can make your house\nMaybe feet you for your own peace of mind feel a little more secure\nWell the the the more expensive the locks that the more expensive the better the the tools and the battle battle she knows that you will have\nSo I'm not a I'm you know I'm a ... of course locks deadbolt into locks is always a good thing but\nThe most important thing John in my humble opinion I think you'll agree with me 'cause we didn't have this discussion is a composite Jim yes a composite gym because when you buy a door on the big box it comes with finger joint did would\nSo that's not what you want okay you don't want finger joined did would you want to have um a composite jammed its customers were not close to me but it's made for that door yes so that makes it a hundred and forty percent stronger for that gym so they won't break or split that's what I\n... well that's what I say resistance also exam and besides that yes what are we always find that the composite still or the syllabus adores the one thing that always rot Celsius or is the water comes down to during the outside right at the bottom where they're still is it always routes out well guess what with composite it'll never happen again\nSo the only doors I sell is always with a composite gym\nWell thermal who has a great in in ... to your door with a composite you didn't get the composite gym with the threshold you didn't get\nThe giant you can't get it at a big bucks and when you read you can get anything special ordered well but again through in ... you know through a professional distributor right\nSomeone that is a good company that we use it yes contractors\nWe don't buy stock doors when the only time we buy stock doors is when you need a stock door like you know when you when you're just looking for ... a garage me indoor yeah you know and you're by the way you're selling the house in six months and you're out of there and you just want something cheap

what's the valley what's what the Jim uh what's the hip you know what you you know my hip of my body or the hip and the root of all you know All right so these are the terminologies that people don't necessarily understand in\nWay that's great thank you for your phone\nLine so you know his question was simple as that you know I have an existing foundation to I hire a contractor or not and you'd be surprised John where some people think that they can do it themselves\nAnd I have a private client that's doing that now they think that they can do than the project themselves but then what happens\nWhen the electrician says there's a problem then the Palmer says hoops you know then now you got the the the supplier didn't deliver on time and he's expecting because [noise] the electrician has to be out of there by friday but the delivery is not happening till Saturday [laughter] so\nHe made we made we were talking about extension GM's earlier and you show a now you got a rough rough cut to buy six it's really a two by six is not a tool it's not a one and a half five out of the house right so now you're watching jams gonna be a different sizes\nHuge incredibly now you have that extension champs every door every window right you got a half inch sheet rock on either side you know what I mean so you you know in depending on where he's going to use that would you write he has dimensional offer that's real\nWhen he says to buy it is to buy [laughter] because there's no such thing as a two by six anymore yeah one and a half\nBy five and a half I Know but\nUh you know when you get when you get in the ... in this rough it's rough cut yeah you're getting a full to ah to buy six right so ... which is a lot sturdier so and I wonder if what type of ... what is it\nBut then here's the next problem what happens when you run out and you needed like ten more pieces\nWhile he's he's seen the he seemed like he knew\nWhat are you know not like it on your type worry oh I understand those suspects down but but how many times have you had guys that you ordered you know a ten pieces a two by fours and they use the twelve\nYou know what I mean when you only need it ate Connecticut I'm wrong they [laughter] they view that we fulfill that have taken three feet or two of them yeah they don't they took one of the two and a six foot away [laughter] what a five foot all\nEnd by the way the gentleman John speaking the truth this has happened we've had people with not that much brain power working at times and you wonder but think about it is there a college for they become a carpenter\nWhile you go to that you can go to a union ... little ... union that'd be a ... ... what's the word I'm looking for a\nA a print is an apprentice right and you're using the learned on the job right that's the whole point and I think that we should be encouraging more people to not go to college let's make sure we understand is um\nI Know the sound that absolutely everybody this is not for everybody but for those individuals that want to work with their hands you'll make more money working with your hands than working with your brain or doing\nYou know computer graphics or whatever else these are some of these young kids are trying to graduate with\nAnd they need a trade we need people in the tree yes you want a job you want to make fifty sixty Seventy thousand a year without having a any college debt than I encourage you to stop looking at computer gaming and get in the field and learn something right because this is what we need this\nPort adjusted to Branford hall there are there are schools that are ... it could lead you into a trade\nWe're looking at electricians right now electrician can make forty eight dollars an hour if you wanted to play and if you worked in the union you make it even more with the benefit package and everything else guess what\nElectricity might be afraid of it but you learn you know and these people are making a lot of money without a college education without spending that kind of money so I Would highly recommend\nFor those people out there to stop telling your kids to go to college and get them into a trade because that we did I\nAnd I first I see them as very sincere about this on ...\nPassionate because you know how many guys are out there John that we're looking for\nTo be able to work in the field because there's not there's no carpenters being made anymore right we have to take the young kids of today which were doing and I'm doing in my company and were training them and learning them and say put down the YouTube and stop watching ... and put on YouTube\nAnd see how the door and get the phones out of their hands yeah but you know want to know what's the phone in your hand and start you know researching how to frame of wall or Sam we're going to have to take\nHer out of all I have found them from going from amber [noise]\nHorrible practical tonight I saw for
