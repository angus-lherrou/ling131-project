call this morning lines are wide open at eight hundred three three one night for nice six eight hundred three three one nine four Ninety six\nI'm no services important John you know we experienced it it's tough you know I'm reading a reporter forty percent of inquiries home service companies are ignored\nIt seems hard to believe isn't it that but this is the the the\nAnd it's not just big companies are small companies it's both because they both have their challenges but I hear this from constantly like when I have a an electrician a plumber you know when we're hiring subcontractors that do work on our larger projects on the commercial jobs and on the on the addition projects\nAnd they say listen I Can't do it all I Can't go and run leads I'm getting I come back and my voice mail is full and you know my answering machine you know the answer machine saying what about you know like uh my voicemail is is full and I got all these calls to call back\nWhen can I Do and I'm Out there working all day I can only run one appointment night and even if that and then if\nMy kids got to a game I Can't go and run lead that night next thing you know so they're letting all of these opportunities just blow by blow by blow buying it drives me crazy\nSo sometimes they just say you know what forget it I'm going to go work for somebody and you know pay me good money I don't want to they're running ragged because during the books doing the sales running the jobs something's got to give right how can you focus at work all day when you're worried about everything else\nOr you you got your focus got four o'clock appointment and you're right in the middle of doing things ... and it's now three o'clock in the wrap up and call the day you blow on another day behind ... where if you work until three thirty four o'clock\nAnd get that project finished mhm uh you will head of the game so you you have to make a commitment on whether you want to be a sales a salesman mhm a worker a labor or or whichever type of field you want to go into but you can't do all three of them was to two of them are going to shop\nNo doubt no doubt and and I think that everyone struggle even internally John we struggle with\nFolks like yourself that get overworked and you'll have have you know we rely on you so much because you have so much skill you know Jeff we've got guys that can do multiple things and handle multiple tasks and and you lean on people when it's super busy you know luckily eventually a kind of blows over but it it's it's tough when you're in that in\nThat you got to ride the wave Adam yeah you\nKnow your answer famine and there's been no matter what you do is not always a way it's either it's a six month off on six month locked business it really is you know you you you you really kind of come to a screeching halt but right now it's it's\nEveryone says oh this spring is the busiest way than the late fall is by far the busiest time of of of the year I looked on my calendar\nJanuary February and ah I see why I'm work out so much in September October and November\nRight while you're doing the work and you're lucky we're lucky that we're able to stock up the work flow because of all the other projects that are are settled and put together now that our our businesses leaned a little bit more long term as we're doing more\nLarger projects [noise] ah you know they take awhile to plan they take a while to get through zoning and and be approved so next thing you know if you close a deal and in mid November may not be starting till mid January and finishing in the spring\nRight which is a good thing for people out there and then have plans are looking for a plan design or they're looking to break ground and uh to to it's a two month process to get all these all this paper I call the paper trail get this paper chill and order so you can start breaking so you can get into the the labor in the construction end of it\nYeah I think um you know we talked about this endlessly but I Do want to make recommendations I think nationally what they're finding is working to help the skilled labor shortages\nIs for companies like ours to to to to make an initiative and to take on more apprentice programs right to really bring folks in because you've got to train people if you want him right because what's out there isn't enough and then there's what you want\nUs to cut costs the corporation costs the company money to train course a installers but in the long run as long as they stay with you as long as they make a commitment to work with you after you after you factory trained them\nYou know that it's a good ... then it's a good investment yeah I mean what happens is uh we factory train or a couple and swallows for three weeks four weeks and months six weeks\nOr after they get factory trained in after they get the certification they ... they work a couple of weeks and then they say well we got all our certification we need thank you very\nWell yeah but you know there's you you know there's there's ways to combat that I mean you have to offer more I mean it's different you know it's it's offered the offer the overtime time and a half its its offer four one K. it's off the benefits because\nYou know it used to be the case in this industry you're a skilled carpenter you're not getting benefits you're not you're not getting a a you know overtime you're not getting you know\nEven the W. too so this has changed dramatically over the past decade because because the market has flipped there's ... you know it's it's supply and demand John yes pretty simple there's there's too many jobs to be done out there and not enough workers\nOr ... before every everybody with a truck had a lot of latter brackets out of there were there were ... they were ... they were window installer now you can't even find them now\nYeah you know every every fire fighter was or how to how to trade whether it was a plumber electrician or a a sheet rock or or window installer mhm or even a landscaper yes they are they're in their in their fields right now where they don't need to work this extra time\nThese extra jobs to make ends meet yeah\nIt's different different world I mean and and I think ah I expected to continue um especially in the in the in the greater Boston market for ever [laughter] basically and and I and I think that it will be you know in in central mass western mass northern Connecticut it'll be it'll it'll continue to busy busy busy as valuable you're not residential\nIt's commercial to Adam everything commercial industry out in the Boston Boston area you know I was in a Dorchester the other day and a commercial buildings you you don't think they could squeeze in another\nBuilding it in a proper yeah sure they can they gotta not Scott I'm not going down right I got three of them going ... site called dynamite right it's incredible well let me just make sure people were worried about what what are they going as well as you are it's called well are you thinking of it in two different ways ... what do you say ... what do you what are you saying what do you mean were they\nWere they parking ... where the park and all these people on these big high rises to build them right in the sex and you know was all the all the traffic you know the ... in infrastructure can't can't the\nCan handle it well I'm thinking of it to more from a standpoint of gentrification like where where are the folks go because it becomes so expensive way you know there where is that where is the Affordable housing because I don't see it I mean it's it's like disappeared in these areas like Framingham was a perfect example I used to be\nHeavy immigrant um area ten years ago and all these big you know triple decker and an end to families now those triple decker is our individual single condos [laughter]\nAt selling for three hundred and fifty thousand dollars each you got a million to property than they used to be three hundred thousand dollar tripled doctors and they were very affordable housing well that's all changed gentrification as a nice way of saying get out yeah because it's too expensive for you to live here and we want to charge more money\nAnd where people going so I don't have the answer that question because I don't see I Know that there's there's still affordable housing in Brockton and like you said Dorchester has always been known as a very poor and rough area but when it's that close to the city\nIt's just like Brooklyn New York it's not ugly anymore because because the uh the uh\nI think the investors are buying these ... like you say that the change in these three families into a ... three level do candles and a divide up the properties that they had one neighborhood in those four three family homes that were a boarded up", "show_name": "The Daily Dive Weekend Edition", "year": "2018", "city": "Springfield", "day": "28"}
