Springfield new traffic\nAwe but we were talking you get a word and I yeah I wouldn't let a dog I got it when he does like up he agrees with everything I say what's the best thing about it so [laughter]\nNo but seriously um you you do see that the actually the best time of year to understand\nYour ventilation and insulation problems of your home now a lot of people are going to go home what do you what are you talking about but but Yeah John you see those lines on the roof\nThose are your rafters right yes rafters are not insulated would it is not an insulator so the heat is escaping out of your addict through the wood right that's the reason why you have the inflation in between in\nIn Cape style homes or if it's cold enough inside of it that's where the frost hits like you know what I mean so that's where you see these things and uh we're looking at a keeps our house and you could see those lines everywhere which is kinda funny but yeah\nIt's it's it's amazing how um the frost will also tell you the warm spots because now of course is the the top of the roof is there's no frost but everything's down at the bottom\nWell ... yeah ... ... not working you origins that work in the heat the heat or building up they'll develop into the rich ... and ... and there's this moisture there's there's moisture and the first five feet of the of the ... coming down off the origin of ... that means you've got to the heat loss that's right a wood heat lawsuit\nWith ventilation comes an insulation factor so yeah and I think\nI feel that the Cape style houses I one of the worst type of homes they can properly instantly\nIt isn't it well it's not the ... well it's an ...\nAnd you get a it's a it's almost impossible but the problem is John\nUsing old technology\nIt's one of the worst yeah but there's new technology that you can do it better than how we used to do it because the raptors we're maybe at the most of the two by two you know and that was the problem is that they would go all the way up and they were really they weren't making to buy for teens know me so you don't have a lot of sickness of insulation that you could pack into what fiberglass right\nBut now they make spray fall right any so here's the problem John most people don't want to know how to do it right because of the expense of the expense but you still have to explain it to him right hey no problem more than happy to fix your roof properly and here's how we're going to do it\nRip your roof off rip the boards off pull out all the insulation\nWe're going to then spray foam your entire addict top to bottom put all the plywood back onto the roof back on its last but we can do that yes\nI've I've I've done job I Believe that magnitude yeah or the\nEgg does discriminating clients that they get it done get it done right\nI don't care what the expense do it well those are the people that have also have dealt with mold that have dealt with you know vermin in their house you know I don't know about you but the nose spray foam especially close el ... spider ... not a mouse nothing is going to go through the\nLawyer and the moisture is going to infiltrate to nothing in uh the deal Cape style houses you know before they had ... that's a raft of raptor mates they put the installation right to the deck and and that that created the mold in the mosque issue from the inside out because you couldn't see\nThe conversation that was building up between the debt board\nOr the roof the roof she than board and the insulation right uh once you take that off you you're you're better off just removing the the sheep on the show like the plank born in putting insulation in and doing the job in the proper mean\nOne of the Facebook friends of ours is making common uses any proper venting the sausage and an escape through the ridge or the movers the floor of the addict should be properly insulated and well blown in or on faced insulation\nThe um the paper phase should of course be toward the vapor barrier moisture of the inflation making it\nA useless overtime yes that's true of the old techno yes it I'm Sorry my cousin I Love 'em and I just wanted to say shot\nAnother guy off off the face\nBut another another guy that was just totally blocked me and say I don't like you but it is the old technology yes sorry\nUm I Will no longer use fiberglass insulation on any project that I Do\nGreater than you know like if it's a kitchen it's one wall will do that right but if we're doing in addition we're redoing an addict we're redoing the house adding on we're only doing spray foam okay\nAnd the reason for that is fiberglass insulation believe it or not is the filter yeah shit he will escape through yes and if you look at the our value okay you're never going to get to a point of a hundred percent are about right you're never going to stop the complete seat loss with fiber to us\nWell 'cause there's always your infiltration coming through whether it's a because in in between the rafters that's where I talked to one way or the other around the electrical outlets what about\nThe way we do the air sealing which is what you're supposed to do first before putting more insulation into your at\nThe stretch energy coach today you need what you're going to talk about right\nBut you're supposed to um put a spray foam around every single hole that goes up into your addict right now if you were to 'em and eliminate all that forget about all that forget about the ridge meant not working forget about the software events not working\nBecause you can put more insulation you can get the ... still work completely perfect you can get the Richmond to work not all rich rents work the same okay so when are you\n... it's just a second I was going to stop stop\nYou take a break we're going to take a primary job I was I was gonna let you roll for\nYeah but now it's gonna he's disagreeing with me so we'll come\nBack we'll come back\nAs a homeowner you

Samaras Oreos\nMy service dog he's a he's a service dog and train that so [laughter] you know [laughter] you know I tried this I'm On the small school bus but they let us take the helmet on that I Know and ... that just you know he's a good boy he's a he's just in training and he's just here and he's like saying hello to everybody yeah All right so anyway um\n... cameras that race says something that's very easily readily available to everybody Sam\nBelieve it or not Home Depot rents rents them or do they really you can rent one at most of the big box stores okay and there are companies that will come out and actually\nWell you know we talk we talked about inflation the two segments of the show the easiest way and the least expensive way out to do with the insulation is called mass save\nThat would be the you know the correct way also to prevent you from spending money yes because we always want you to save your money right so\nYou know mass save for some reason though they won't blow to close so insulation and is there a reason for that Sam is the cause of the cost of\nThat I don't think they've caught up with the times I think it's just like the the mass state building code that hasn't caught up with the times or they're doing much better but I'm I'm really disappointed with massive for not including spray foam into their cost because it would cut down even more energy\nBut um I don't know why but a very good question to ask those guys um why won't they pay for some of the newer technology that's available\nBecause of the costs of it you know Johnny wants especially when you get into an app into an addict or across space where they have the\nThe duck worked up ... up in a in the know John\n... wait a minute why is ... ... why do they even exist and I'm not going to speak for them so pleased we're not trying to\n... but I understand why the utility companies all joined in to say hey let's help people out save energy because\nIn order for them to build another nuclear power plant enemy verse next to impossible so we can reduce the amount of demand that on their service because if they're running a Ninety percent\nA demand on a nuclear power plant they got to reduce the amount of demand right and the only way they can do that without having to build another one to to meet the demand is to say hey guys save energy full well that makes a lot of sense to me\nMarriage have not save is run by the national grid ever saw yeah they're\nAll pull their money together and say hey guys don't use so much energy\nSo we'll we'll give you money to use less energy right it it'd be the lights will give you the door you know the door test to check all those places that you need some insulation in that way it cuts down on the consumption of fuel that it uses to produce\nHeat in and if you look on you\nSo the bill there's a number to call there's an eight hundred number to call and call the number and uh everybody qualify for this and it's not a not for the richest not for the poor\nYou know but not every town qualify like I'm the only negative side because if you have a local municipality that has their own light or their own power you know well mostly light because there's nobody generating their own power that I think a ... no\nNo I don't know I don't think so but imagine you know a new thing of today would be absolutely go to\nBuy time for the most iconic brand into booming cannabis industry just went public joined me I peel now high time in\nThe commercial airline industry is booming\nWith this level of demand the industry needs more aircraft technician we are the eight\nThis audio is for your review for ...
