Springfield\nA lot it jumped up my employees a lot how can I give back so if I Would invest are you standing up all those those parameters ... ultimately create success especially in a climate that we have today with millennials and things like that let's make a difference but it's not just have the status quo because hey let's look around it didn't work out so good for us\nYeah absolutely I mean as you know we're not doing things in a vacuum you know without repercussions so it makes a difference and\nAnd just also you know we we're not only invest in um publicly traded investments we do private investments as well and some of the local\nAnd no it's good to talk about local in our area um and also those are really are things you can see 'em and everyone likes to be able to sort of relate to things that are around them so\nThere are things we have invested in that you'd probably still can invest in in our area are right here in Springfield for example there's the wellspring cooperative oh yeah if you know those guys started out with a furniture business I think in a in a window shades business which is still have\nIs a workaround co op so they're building ownership with local people in a in a business and now this newest business is their harvest greenhouse I'm\nAs can be for ... for the ... the right way as candidates industry\nNo outs actually there\nAnd let us primarily now you can go to the supermarket and go to big wind by harvest greenhouse lettuce now grown here in Springfield really you know\nAnd those are the type of things that you know you invest in some of the day out of your people you'll always get behind\nYeah and they love people love that you know supporting Springfield supporting urban agriculture they have an education and outreach program with the schools are I mean it's like when when when\nOh that's so so how do you so so how do people approach you with this I did that company company and say we're looking to create something like this and then you know you get creative in and help them understand how you might be helpful and then you go out and advocate to to get investors like how does that how does that process one\nYeah uh well we're pretty networked in the socially responsible business community so we ... we knew the people that wellspring already okay what what they were currently doing or before they started the greenhouse\nSo it was natural for them for us to talk about that you know when they wanted to do the the next business and\nNot only did we do direct investing into their cooperative they are also getting loans or a loan from a local CBS fi loan fund called the TB grows alone fund which stands for pioneer valley grows\nWhich is administered by the Franklin County CDC\nSo the the fire as a community development finance institution and ah they get a centrally you know money from the government at low interest rates that they can then re loan out kind of like a bank but often to places that banks may not lend to ...\nTo spur economic development so\nThis particular loan fun has a mandate to do sustainable agribusiness in the pioneer valley\nOkay so those funds are set aside specifically for those kinds of purposes and then you're able to help people understand that they're they're well yeah I mean obviously may direct message but [noise] you give them guidance on those things as well help introduce these kind of blown ... these are things that they seek out on their own or just because it's a community like we all know these things are kind of hear\nYeah I actually don't think a lot of people know these things are here um you know if you're not looking for them necessarily if you're not saying yourself I Want to invest locally you're probably not going to find\nAnd and if you're talking to advise or who's not suggesting it you're also not going to find it\n... yeah All right so it grows long find 'em just by the way that one is still open um you know you could go to their website and uh invest directly I think the minimum is like a thousand dollars huh you know when you get a modest interest rate\nYou know I'm I don't get any money you know if people invest to be\nA highly regulated business and yes she had no I get commissions for that I've if anyone invest\nAbout as good they share and I mean that's ... ... you know we we see that um I sit on the plane for progress committee at the climate valley planning commission and we've run to the same kind of issue from time to time people don't know some of these programs around the town of ... the genesis of the program here in some respects\nBut share some of those great things that are out there so people can go oh wow I haven't thought about that and and which is great and and your point you know ... locally giving people these opportunities to grow here it helps everybody so now that company grows\nAnd maybe they got to hire people awesome now you can if you say hey you know I really want to support local agriculture I I Would prefer to get my my my food source locally awesome on top of that now you have a place where you can do that\nAnd the more that we have these things and I've been seeing more and more to about you know creating local sustainability my sense of wrote the food chain and things like that yeah so I one of them I don't know if it was New York where was by some some\nYouthful I'm like rooftop gardens and or or you know and it's just like a it may be amusing wrong regard but I mean you go in there and they're going to potatoes and squash is all this stuff about farm who saw from any she's in here\nThat wow okay why what you know it's like ... like this before yeah but it's like everything else we don't think about it than we do and and now all of a sudden we create these programs in these opportunities for people to do it so it's great that\nThese folks have a resource due to consider like you know I Do want to invest I Do want to grow in I worked hard for my money I Want to put it to work so it can work harder for the future but hey you know what if I could get a win win where I Do that locally why would not so such ... sounds like you've got to have a pretty fun fun job what you'd have to\nI you know I feel purpose and agency with my work I Do you know it's a little bit indirect right 'cause I'm helping people who are then you know investing their money that's than supporting good companies if you will doing good things\nAre also want to mention close by and based in Holyoke is the is the other ... another CBS I\nCalled common capital yep Miller them so they also have alone fund as well and you can lend money and they in turn blowing it out to local businesses\nYeah the I forget the name of the fun but I remember when it came out years ago and I just was excited about things like that because why not because like you said some time his community first phoned me my here yeah I think yeah and if the if you visit the website common capital and still have the information on it a good group of out you know being transparent and getting things out of some stand it\nBut you know with with things like that I'm\nKeeping people those opportunities you know and and the other like you said earlier thanks sometimes I've talked to a bank so I tried to start up a coalition of banks that with lend to start ups and and it took a hit\nI maybe maybe got one that was maybe going to do it but then it kinda just unravel because they need so much information at that you know in in order for them to for them to do what they need to do in their level of risk that they're willing to accept um you know they have different metrics they can go by\nWell what about that small business owners says you know what if I got ten thousand dollars man I Would this would totally change my business just a small amount like that you just so much with these alternative resources and also\nYou know kind of programming while you're talking about helps those people get those funds you never know that little bit and all of that the seed money could do so much and get somebody you know that next step so that's awesome\nYeah we have we have room\nFor improvement in how we fund innovation ... yeah you know it'd be much nicer if it was easier but I mean that's it's also extremely high risk probably at high risk right I mean most new businesses fail\nBut they had a I was at that the economic development conference so Stanley Black and decker was there mhm and they run a tech star component in their business where they have innovated you know innovation through manufacturing and talk about these things so they\nThey invented like this really small engine that goes on so in order to get water in India that this is you know ... beyond the scope I mean water India they used to have to use these\nDiesel a machines in order to pump water out\nSo they invented do this this this uh innovation lead these small little engine that runs solar panels that then pump the water up and it's it's like\nHow do we come together so it's funding innovation put its risk you know what I mean some of the stuff may not work and you know some of the left holding the bag so I'm always saying full of people that are take that risk and invest their money into [noise]\nYou know that's why people go how venture capital is how you know you they might detect return it ... couple of other time not every one of these get knocked out of the park God blessed enough for taking that risk and do it because that is where that innovation comes from 'cause listen takes money to make some of these things happen where most of the things that\nYeah and you know you know and and the venture capital model can also be improved and some people are trying to do that in terms of the terms that investors will get maybe\nYou know it can be more of a revenue sharing model so that way you know the company successful than they have money to share yeah some um and so there there are other models out there actually and um which is refreshing\nI mean and all these things that I Would say are born out of necessity and and you know as as we evolve and we see hey you know what we can do this little differently you know and and it did\nYou know the way to do this and I'm a big fan of of ah it's sometimes to my detriment or I'm a big yes and instead he had like kind of person a yeah but you know tried using many times and I'm like oh my God this guy be another way to do it for to assist yeah San ... the ... you know what can we do next instead of sending barriers for ourselves", "year": "2018", "show_name": "The Engine", "city": "Springfield", "day": "28"}
