are like a lot and I'm just you know kind of trying to explore that a little bit more addition to having a healthy active lifestyle how can you have a healthy relax mind as well 'cause it's kind of all works together\nNow all of a part of my work I read now I've of reworked get a little bit but ah I I work do many respects leadership training and a lot of his personality behavior base

squirrels you get to the super like wound up and he had ... million ideas and yet most entrepreneur is\nBy the way higher and reflected because you're very creative thinkers mhm my can get away from that is why meditations important mhm because\nOnce you get that center and what's great about what I appreciate it by the guy did meditation I struggled and meditation to because some high energy and I got a very active\nThought process and it's hard for me sometimes this is why I appreciate that go into guided meditations just because I've got someone that's keeping me centered in bringing me back and you don't get me through the process so those things are important especially now\nYour life is crazy ... and a million miles an hour we have different demands\nTechnology where on the job twenty four seven even if we're not an entrepreneur because people can get access to the right when do you have that opportunity to shut down to lease you you give\nPeople not only a a place where they can come and do that but I've seen a lot that you created big sense of community in in what you do as well to yeah you know so you bring people together and sort of I mean every time I've gone everyone's been at least you know\nThe people that class we helped me because again [laughter]\nLike oh no don't do it [laughter]\nSo uh they have already knows one another it's it's a friendly you know you're going in you have to work out so you're not just going into you know your your salvage couldn't just going in for a clash of somebody really getting to connect with people building relationships and bonds and all those things lead to a pretty active and healthy lifestyle\nYeah hence the name [laughter] [noise]\nSo you've got these programs now you've got cycling you've got\nBar you've got a reiki meditation ... how how is business grown over the years while I guess is is it bad like all on the upswing or is it like that typical thing of success where it's like it's all scattered grabbed it's all over the place and eventually they were doing pretty good [laughter]\nI could have been how's the journey bit I guess so to speak\n[noise] um I Would say in terms of like just the business itself um\nI I I feel like an elder in the business world because I see all these like newer studios popping up and you know they they look like the young vibrant\nChildren and I'm like oh child [laughter] I've been there\nI Know because like the first two years it's just fire like everything's just like it was booming and just like growing growing growing crazy crazy everything was madness and then you hit a point\nI Would say around about ear three or four where you're no longer the shiny new person on the block and that's really the test I think um I think you're for definitely your for your three as well was private we're probably the hardest two years that I went through because\nI'm like I said you're not a shiny new staying on the block any where you have to figure out how to wise to stay in this business and how do I keep growing when I don't have that newness anymore and it's\nNot as new and exciting so I'm after you know pushing through those two years I'm making it out the other side now you're five and six I've been able to breathe personally a little bit more\nBecause I feel like I'm we're pretty balance now you know we have the flow is is somewhat equal to the outflow and that's normal and the fitness business and\nIt's kinda it kinda maintains itself which is really nice and being able to take a breath as a business owner is always nice to but\nUm you know I I guess I Would say yeah it's been kind of jak it um but it's\nBeen a huge learning experience to just in you know knowing going through those rough two years and and knowing that you know that could happen again anytime and and I often does happen to a lot of businesses as well but learning how to get through that has you know made me a stronger business owner as well as a business given some strength to\nYeah I mean it sounds like you've been adding new things I mean I was reading something to get what it was like two weeks ago news big tire company and they go you know we customer demand change we're going back from like the customer demand change or did you just keep your\nFinger on the pulse and cost yeah because I think it's always changing so that's why I appreciated it be kind of your dirty and respected because\nYou've always kept people involved you your members you know we're trying to learn from them and what would you like and\nYou know stretching and things like that listening to people and going home you know what I maybe I can corporate ... because a lot of people coming in and they've got pain mhm huh I can link these things together I can give more value to the people that come in and giving that\nAbility to create that sense of community but also staying relevant and that sounds like when you're not the new person on the block you know of a sudden argue relevant anymore what whatever may come from those things\nBut I mean of the shops I mean all of the ... of the businesses like yours how many have you really ... really actually and a handful but I'm not ...\n[laughter] a lot like the car like what you buy the ... everybody has this car [laughter] yeah I wouldn't have bought it said they have it on my clothes almost ... yeah I'm\n... yeah I think it's I think it's like you said keeping\nYour thumb on the pulse of what's going on I watch a lot of the trends that happen it seems like a lot of trans happen out in California like on the west\nAnd I try to watch what happens out there and ... and things that are successful and then it takes about two to three years for it to actually start to happen\nOut where we are so um if I can you know pay attention to that and get ahead of the curve I've been a head of the curve and a lot of different spaces and the fitness industry um we were ... of the car with bar\nUm when I started doing bar there was really nobody else doing bar out here and it took a while for people to places like you're out what it was or something like that was the way\nBack to that 'cause I think that's a but we had a conversation about that years ago because I think at a time there's only one other place and yeah and I offered him when you when you bought it\nYeah it's a little while people are like why is this and then all of a sudden you know there were other studios that\nStarted opening up that we're doing you know and they're oh now I Know what this is and then it started to grow a little bit and now there's a ton of our studios everybody knows that borrowed everywhere so\nGetting ahead of it before it saturate is really a big thing to do and you can get you know the most out of the program and have some sustainability it with the program as well\nAnd I think stretching cue that something that and meditation that we're getting ahead of as well I'm an offering aerial meditation as well as the stretching and things like that so I think you'll see that start to grow grow grow grow grow and then become over saturated and then we move on to something new so\nYeah just staying staying relevant and like you said is is if you have like ... over there yeah so I think you know in terms of looking at how my business shifted in changed um I started primary well I started as a personal trainer I don't do much personal training anymore I Do some not very much I also started the boot camp trainer\nAnd we do some boot camp but not that much anymore but you know moving from that sort of you know and then I incorporate NPR acts and we kind of of you know flowed more into bar and yoga we still offer boot camp and ... type stuff um but we ...\nKind of try to see where the like I said the trends are if you know I didn't want people are looking for and being able to maneuver problem is if you get into the business near a personal trainer and or boot camp trainer and that's all you do and that's all you want to do\nYou're going to be stuck when people don't want pointed out it is a big thing anymore so I think it's important to be able to change and um transform as a trainer or as a business owner as much as it is being able to watch what people want\nSo me being ignorant on the subject it'd be used example that will be under several close not so if I ever CrossFit studio I Do wish CrossFit that may be the flavor of the month of the year or whatever but now two years down the road less and less people want CrossFit they want more yoga\nStudio I Can't\nIf I don't skate or died essentially by just keep doing CrossFit I may go the way the ... that's very true okay and I'm curious to see what happens with that down there I just have yeah because I was like ... ... when you said there's a bunch popping up I I didn't correlate it first of all a cab I saw a bunch of course it and I'm like oh comparable\nSomewhere but I've seen CrossFit studios\nRight so that started to to come in like a few thousand ten or so and I've seen just as many start to close as well so um you know I don't know I I Know sometimes you know there's a lot popping up as well like um orange theory I don't know if you've heard of that is like\nThe looming and there's a lot of like pure bars also like a one shot\nDeal or ... yeah so I don't know like I I it could it could sustain it could last depending I think it depends a lot on the coaches and the staff that they have there and tell us of the business but you know when the trend dies do those die too I don't know we'll we'll have to wait and see but\nI like you know because this is my you know bread and butter if if I sell but this I like having multiple streams of revenue because I Know there is one area is is suffering there's always something else to pick it up and that has served me very well in terms of keeping my business up and healthy\n[noise] yeah I mean that's a sense of ... ... community I think what you just said it comes down to the trainers and people that are there and staff and so on the more", "show_name": "The Engine", "year": "2018", "city": "Springfield", "day":
