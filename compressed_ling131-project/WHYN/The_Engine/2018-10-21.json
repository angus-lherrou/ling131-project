H. Y. N. news radio I think she\nFly in and do what he weighs why NFL ... Springfield\nAnd just really ... you just get connected and build that confidence from a different place so it's really special because we're not just giving speeches about\nLike you know I'm [laughter] like wrote kind of topics as the ... their personal and it gives all the women in the club a chance to connect with each other and empower each other because as they're giving the speeches they looking at the audience that everyone's kinda nodding their head along going oh yeah I I relate to that I get that I feel that same way and there's power in that too\nYeah I mean we we are I did a similar workshop with a bunch of the executive not too long ago ... probably the\nWhat was surprising similar to what you were chatting about and we took the most time which was awesome and the way we asked leaders to write down what they stand for ... and as simple as sometimes we think those inches or until you like you say what do you love and to really ... down and really think about it like what do I stand for what do I love\nBecause different free ... each person and we can kind of say way over our you know let's say I'm organizational norms or things like that but it's very personal ... I'm I'm assuming\nYou know obviously had the privilege to work with these these uh doctors over ... I'm assuming each one of them got into medicine for a very different reason yeah you know and it very passionate to him and yes what do you know do no harm and help people but\nWhat got ... author and Sally involved are probably very different things but that passions Aron lets harnessed that was that the top of mind\nYeah it is a great team building exercise tend to think now they're not just talking about their patients and did you get this done as you said that to the lab but they're instead talking to each other as people and they're connecting with each other and totally different levels so it it really builds the team camaraderie and the respect and the and the trust in a totally different way\nYeah I mean you know we you know talk a lot ... workshop sometimes you're in the business of people first and then anything else to do a secondary and kept making what did she make in Baskin Robbins or whatever you make and\nYou need people to do all those processes and you have to build a good relationship with the people around you I Know it's hectic sometimes I can eat I Can't even imagine what it's like inside of a hospital which so many things are happening and you know\nLet's be honest so matters of life and death you know what I mean\nUm but it's so important to be people first to understand I affect all these people around me as a\nAs a surgeon who or whomever but also my colleagues and an end to understand you know it was said earlier maybe they got involved in medicine for different reasons is still commonalities they slip that whole passionate about it and then there's what a great way to reconnect just on a personal level like\nKnow what I never really talked to her that much for so much alike yeah we're going to go out and have fun now you know in an extra element they have kids I have kids\nIt can we get together families together who knows what a wonderful things\nYeah actually it was a six month program I did that ended in June and on the last night I heard a bunch of the women talking to each other saying you know we should continue to get together every month and have dinner once a month just to kind of talk about what's going on our lives and what's changed as a result of doing this work and I just sad\nThat this this is the\nPoint you know it's it's about building the skill to feel more confident leading groups in standing in front of a room and going to speak at medical conference but it's also about just connecting us humans you know we don't get a chance to do that all the time it gets so consumed by our schedules in our responsibilities sometimes that stuff slips away and it's really important\nYeah I mean you know again the aspect of working with a bunch of doctors I mean to just there's a lot lower and a lot of moving parts in her life and\nYou know you can be [noise]\nGet immersed in the job I can only imagine and then but yeah but yeah I think those those\nMoments to kind of awakenings to understand I've got these people around me I've got this passion inside me you know\nLet me let me liberty to a different way I mean and and you know that's one example but even you know the clubs or you have throughout New England you know bringing together very diverse you know groups of women to learn from one another and celebrate one another and and it just this community I guess in a sense of what you create and that's\nThat's a powerful thing ended up at shell that sense of community\nYeah and we work really hard to focus on the community element we restrict each club to Fifteen members and when the when the members joined that cloud their member of that club because we want to build trust we want to build a real community where you see the same women every meeting they meet twice a month for two hours and\nAfter sitting in a room twice a month for six months with the same Thirteen fourteen women you start to realize like\nThese women have interesting lives they've interesting things to say I'm watching them grow in front of my eyes are watching negro and they're witnessing it and they're sharing with me wow that speech was so much better than your last one you really shared yourself they are really vulnerable\nAnd to be on that journey with them as something that it it's hard to get anywhere else you know when people ask me what is the speaker sister had I'm like well it's not a retreat and it's not a workshop designed a networking event but it's like those really magical ... can be [laughter] where are you really get to show up as yourself among a group of other women who are doing the same thing\n[noise] so now you you you mentioned the clubs yeah around the area um how do how do women learn more about the the clubs how do we learn more about you know I Am so many of the clubs to\nYeah well we have clubs in in western mass we have clubs in North Hampton Amherst Springfield whole ah south Hadley we have several more launching around Connecticut and central math and\nThe way that they find out about is going to speak or sister had dot com or clicking on club directory which some home page and it ... it's a whole list of all of our cloud okay and they can send a message to the club leader through that page and get all the information about upcoming meetings and anybody can attend free as a guest\nJust to see what it's like even if you don't really know and you're kinda like public speaking scares me about this sounds interesting just go and check it out and go to one meeting\nSo we do have our clubs and then I also do public speaking\nAt um you know corporate events and workshops and I'm I'm speaking at the uh professional women's chamber in November at the Springfield country club at their monthly meeting and so there's an opportunity for people to come and just sit in the audience if they want to let her learn a little bit more about finding finding your voice\nNow used the do now do you have classes to that folks can take [noise]\nWell right now I'm teaching a class called the speaking school for women but it's sort of an process and I'm not sure what it's going to come back\nGot you got you know just always want to always want to ask the question [laughter] yeah\nSo now you so now you said this earlier um the the clubs are kept so let's say I go to visit a club and and it kept I saw the benefit to go as a visitor but then we can you help play somebody in a club that might be comparable to that yeah OK guys\nLiterally yet and I'm right now all of our clubs have a couple of spots open also awesome yeah it won't won't be an issue\nWe find that the commitment is as long as women want to stay if they find after six months they got what they needed they can leave after year there's that decided hey this is so much deeper than it expected I'm going to hang around we try not to create any expectation around staying for a period of time besides what the\nMotor needed comfortable or if you just want to keep on coming because you like the community and things like that by all means you're part of the clubs so or the system and rather so keep on coming exactly nice yeah so now you know you um I did see on Lincoln\nThat you were speaking at the uh professional women's chamber yeah yeah I think Jim McKay liked it or something like that of the class cool [laughter]\nSo you're able to get in front of these these groups of individuals and share your story a little bit and and and sure about the speaker sisterhood\nUm where do you where do you see yourself with this and the next few years like is it is this something going to keep in New England is something of designs to grow you know as needed like oh I Want to take over the world or I went to war America like where do you see speaker sisterhood over the next few years we would you like to bring it\nWill come on building a global and [laughter] I'm\nSeriously that I'm building a global empire um I I Want to I Want it to be an international organization but\nWe we launched a club in New Zealand last year as a pilot just to see what I'll be like to have an international club and we realize why we're really not totally equipped to have a club that I Am right now we got and we realize we need to stick with the U.S right now and so we just launched a club in Louisville, Kentucky we have another one\nAn chicken Cleveland, Ohio and other in San Diego so we are branching out across the country so my vision for the next couple of years is to just keep finding places different communities to bring the clubs do and then to also they'll clubs in corporations\nAnd bring this club to girls so we're partnering with girls and can Holyoke in great organization yeah we've created we did a pilot program with them over the summer for their nine to twelve year old girls that were in Great Britain and again with the fourteen Fifteen year old girls this fall and spring\nSo we're hoping that we can create some programs that really are our value and that we can bring to schools and maybe the Girl Scouts and just keep on\nYou know sharing this this movement of the value of public speaking so that you can really discover yourself in Korea future through it\nYou know and so so this is going to be my own observations so ah and I do not shed about this before but I guess I say when you look at specifically young women um I'm appreciative for your efforts there because\nTo me if women are able to find their voice sooner on in life they can advocate for themselves a little bit a little bit more yeah and not be fearful of it and and when things aren't right they don't have to just let me let me go in and just\nHuh no but see now I I don't appreciate that I don't accept that um that's very powerful and I'm Mary appreciate that you're going into that kind of work from girls in that space [noise]\nUm [noise] you know I see the little bit and some of the work I Do in the community so the more that we can empower women especially to advocate for themselves and find their voice and do the things we're we're all better off for others and\nEveryone's got us among some of us have sisters ... you know listen for nothing we want every one of those women in our lives to be\nWe see them as being very powerful ghetto it's even more exciting when they can for sometimes when they don't see themselves as powerful but now they have this ability to see maybe the way that we see them they can see themselves and that's just you know that that's awesome and especially when you
