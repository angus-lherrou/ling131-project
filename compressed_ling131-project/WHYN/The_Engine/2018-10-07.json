anchor I left the party to go to a bar to buy a soda I haven't drunk alcohol since my Eighteenth birthday\nAs I sat alone at the end of the bar Julie approached me she was alone quite beautiful well dressed the no drinking hand consequently my initial thought was she might might be a high in hooker\nCall girl because of the time I weighed three hundred and fifty pounds so why would someone like her walk with me what what someone like her with someone like me\nI'd never been hit on with a bar on a bar before so he starts uh he's he ah he start seeing\nI felt she only had an interest in my three hundred and fifty pounds self because I was on television and well known\nAnd she he says he resisted having sex with her uh he was having marital difficulties during a conversation about our sexual preferences\nThings got derailed when Julie told me she liked to have sex with more than one guy at a time in fact sometimes with several at one time she wanted to know that would be okay in our relationship\nI asked her if this was just a fantasy of her she responded that you get first tried sex with multiple guys well in high school and still liked it from time to time\nShe brought it up because she wanted to know if I Would be interested in that so he's he sees what's going on here and he says uh I was that he has a new wife and I guess he's lost a lot of weight and all this I was deeply troubled and felt the moral dilemma Dwyer reach out and tell the truth of what I Know and risk family relationships to remain silent\nUm I Know I also know what it's like to be accused of

surprise their crime rate has been going up dramatically\nRight well they haven't been they haven't even been prosecuting a lot of people for I missed the misdemeanors or ah or quote unquote minor felonies but they used to charge them for a ride like shoplifting you you you can't get arrested for anything in California now practically\nWell that that that that small potatoes are I guess they think they convicted talents or there's nothing wrong with just letting them out on the street\nNow they know they they have no problem in there and look at San Francisco I mean the ah look at look at the feces on the streets I mean uh you know ... you know I left my heart in San Francisco I mean you're you're left your stomach and San Francisco now if you have to walk around out there All right

however these hand or not and not test criminals\nAmerica's Talking to Fox News\nNews radio I think\nWent in and good at an old manufacturing company and made it all\nOf a office space now so that's why I'm seeing some of that that makes sense now because let's not for nothing\nWe were just in a in Dallas and and that this company we're working with they were they were bought out by a company Australia and the company in Australia worries about the little things so they're coming to the properties are going hey listen we got in trouble the bushes we've got to fix all these things like put you just push what about revenue like\nWork on the small stuff first if we make our our our real estate holdings appealing people will come to then people into going straight sample of shoddy they want to play some ...\nHis places awesome yeah Simon feels so actually investing in those things you get those you give people a reason you want to get people on the street in Springfield bill something beautiful yup give them a reason and don't you say hey I Do this and throw up a shingle give people you create a vibe you create a community inside the so these investments are important\nAnd I I think one of the things that the city did which is now really I'm hitting that uh juggler up the safety issue is putting out those police kiosks you know you see one right on Taylor and me and you see one over on the white street and you are ... and I mean and they did on white street they have a whole nother police department\nYou know I'm In the chest not park towers building yeah oh yeah and so you see all of this and it's like wow okay I feel a little I feel safer here and I think that was one of the biggest issues and now we're ... we're coming to a tipping point with that\nUm and I think that that's really changing people's direction of the way they feel about when they're down in Springfield\nAny part of it was ... I think part of the MGM writer or something to the effect of member from someone to plan for progress committee they're sixty\nPositions in a police force were created by MGM coming to town if I'm not mistaken\nI don't know the number but I Know that there was a significant number of them\nYeah 'cause I was at a um a couple of years ago I was at a a mayors conference and they share that since like Nineteen Ninety the Springfield police force lost a hundred and fifty positions\nSo now we've released replace sixty of those with this and that these that list I Walk downtown and hey how you doing there engaging oh yeah it's it's it's I see people out of the building and enlisted in the other thing too in the ... and a hockey team here a few years ago did an economic prospectus and ... and it proves true\nThe more foot traffic you have on the street the less crime you have\n... so the more we get people here the more we get people to events in these great things going on downtown eating at the restaurants going down and sitting outside on ... that's ... and especially when they redo the park over there sitting outside and do some dark well and she said they're going to be outside a dining outside on the ...\nNow and dirty away our right next to fat cat um and that building is all being re done stern squares really starts yeah so I was told that my ... way which was that um that area right in between a golf oh yeah yeah fat cat which is a beautiful new park\nWe all it's gorgeous I haven't been see now I haven't been damaged already right on out the curb cuts so you now have outdoor dining you could potentially have dining on dirty away you'll have ... where I mean you really like\nWhat we're seeing 'em and I think of it has a lot to do with um some of the new investment but also one of the reason why we're getting new investment is I had to do a shout out to lowering the sewers and grandma died and the transformative developing initiative with the least that local programs and mass development with their subsidized or loans as well as\nUm the bed and the city with their grant programs for facade clean up what they're really doing is looking at\nHow can we make Springfield look better and in turn become better and if if you know anything about a Rudy Giuliani's broken windows\nUm approach in New York City I mean\nBack in the eighties New York city it was crazy had graffiti everywhere I ... I Know you were there and I I don't want your videos contributed exactly he [laughter] and so what he did it start if if it looks better people will feel command if it doesn't look nice people won't feel comfortable\nAnd if I I Will I Will tell anyone going walk by MGM and see if it doesn't feel like a different Springfield do and start to walk\nAnd not to mention we see construction we see people investing in things changing the landscape I mean you look at ... Smith just came on Worthington gorgeous facade all beautiful old cardboard on the outside of the building I mean you're really seeing a different Springfield which I'm really excited about\nYeah I mean you've got to give people a reason like you said you'd be kinda talked about earlier Indian may be the draw and that's great but we got to give them you\nKnow it was a spark yeah yeah a best way to put it it was to spark and what was the\nPop up the beautiful messed pop up with Nancy and uh uh oh are they just had a pop up across the street from MGM are beautiful ... or something like oh yeah maybe that that simply are simply grace\nThey getting draws getting people over there they have built up around it let's get them and be in great but\nWhat's what else is around ... animal we build up the more we get people out there the better it is and I'd say even like listen we're a couple of blocks down here in the studio is ... or so removed from MGM but there's a lot of life going on you know down here to ... to there's a lot of things happening\nAnd I mean when you want to talk about some things happening obviously one of the things that's happening that you wanted to talk about today is is how's Canada as well as I was really Canada is affecting\nAnd look at you you share we talked about before a show about you know different you know towns and what's going on in Springfield right now seems to be like there's an opportunity a tremendous opportunity here in the city on\nAnd I think what it's done for the real estate landscape is you know if you ask me five years ago uh where we were with a commercial real estate as there was a pretty large surplus of commercial real estate and Canada's comes to a front now and I'm\nIt was just they could only have an industrial properties\nAnd so um when it comes from and just so that people know you have cultivation which is growing you have manufacturing which is either creating just slipped concentrates edible things like that and then you have the retail dispensaries okay all of these are under the R. M. D. I'm On Brelo\nOkay and so when we talk about candidates it's not just people selling its people growing it it's it's a it's a very diverse part but it's a lot of it has to do with manufacturing\nAnd when they were placing at the state said well we you know it's got to be in an industrial zone originally and then the municipalities could go and then other work down from that like city like the city of Springfield said will allow it below industrial as long as I'm there's not a parking issue\nUm and that there's the residential buffers in the school buffers yeah um but anyways what that's done is you've seen a massive influx of people trying uh trying to get into this area and mainly if you look at the city is at Holyoke Westfield chicken be Springfield Palmer\nUm those are the big ones and they kind of open their arms to it\nBut yeah we want to take part and get some of this tax\nRevenue and it's it's really not what you're going to think about some dirty place I mean these are legitimate business people that want to invest and have a good business and so what it's done is it's really almost created what's the opposite of now we have somewhat of a scarcity and so there's not a ton of\nProperty available anymore I'm\nThat falls in certain categories which is really kind of trickled out ripple out to the traditional businesses that we've had here for a while\nSo so now\nAnd what you do in the past ... commercial real estate you work on that and but you can also work with a obviously your knowledge candidates you can help people find those locations and your are you work with people just have to figure it out like where do I\nDo do I do yeah I'm actually working with Fifteen companies right now I'm In yeah Fifteen there's a lot\n... ... ... or ... or the local companies\nSome are some aren't um and it all started when I lifted a property a that fit the bill for cannabis and uh it was an industrial property I started getting calls and I got him from Nevada and Colorado and California law all out west where they have a open recreational a legal\nAnd I didn't know what I was doing so I said okay if I don't know what I'm doing I gotta go research it and figure it out so I flew out to Colorado\nAnd did some towards the facilities and really learned about the facility is out there so that I could be educated so when I did work with a property I Know what I'm doing and as a result that cannabis is a very small community\nAnd so they they talk and when somebody you know has some good information and knowledge on it they'll want to work with them and it grew really quickly and ah as of right now I'm I'm I'm helping clients find property or whether it's police or for sale I'm I'm also helping them or along the lines of\nA you know some business plan work and some things because you know some of the smaller companies that don't have the wherewithal um like some of these other huge companies with a ton of money and you know ...\nUm it's been really easy uh you know for me to research the every town bylaws things like that to make sure that I can help out some of the mom and pop so that it's not just massive companies coming in\nAnd we got to be honest you know let's be fair do it's a it's if it means it's heavily regulated industry you don't know what I mean ...\nIndustry I think to date that I've ever worked with just because you have the federal issues that and then the states saying yes it's OK the fed is saying well we're not going to enforce it\nThen there's a huge risk there and then each municipality has different laws as to how they regulate it and what is okay and what is not okay\nAnd then the general public has their own thoughts of what is okay and what's not OK and so um and then also the tax ramifications the legal aspects of it so it's an extremely complex industry and it's there's still a lot of uncertainty", "show_name": "The Engine", "year": "2018", "city": "Springfield", "day": "07"}
