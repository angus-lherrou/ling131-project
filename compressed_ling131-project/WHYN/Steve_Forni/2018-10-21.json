{"month": "10", "state": "MA", "station": "WHYN", "content": "Out her credit record because your son marrying her will inherit her credit record and that could hurt ability to buy a house as a newly married couple\nI'm Rick Edelman this is the truth about money triple each plan wreck here's an amazing statistic from the United nations forty percent four zero forty percent nearly half of all births in the United states now occur outside of wedlock\nForty percent of all the babies born in America are born to moms who are not married to the dads by the way that number forty percent in Nineteen Seventy it was ten percent\nThis is a massive change in American society\nAnd I want to ask you about the implications on estate planning what are the legal rights and responsibilities what are you doing about properly naming airs because when you are married you have certain automatic rights under tax law and other federal statutes\nBut when there is no marriage certificate many of those rights\nDon't exist so you need to make sure if you were giving birth to a child to lose other parent you are not married\nYou need to make sure you're talking within the state attorney for the protection of yourself\nYour partner and most importantly the child\nWere checking telephone calls here on the record on the show had not the Dana Point California Bob you're on the air how you doing\nHi Rick I'm a a question or a is actually a market neutral funds um my wife and I are retired wherever sixties\nOr you know I'm a little I Would say I would say not nervous but\nUh uh uh just concerned about preserving by uh uh what I've accumulated and I started researching these so called bark at neutral on the poor up you know a portion of my portfolio I Would say and\nI guess I just wanted to know what your take is on them\nYeah I appreciate the question about the whole name is indicative of a sales pitch\nIt clearly is titled in a way to appeal to someone who is afraid of losing money in the market and therefore they pronounce themselves as market troll ... earth is not supposed to mean and the first place\nA market neutral fund is by its sales pitch suggesting that they're going to generate\nA neutrality meaning that if the market goes down they're not going to suffer losses it's going to be neutral\nThat's ... that's a sales pitch no one has ever been able to really deliver on that kind of a promise a and there's no reason to expect that they're going to be able to deliver on it in the future so rather than trying to choose a sales pitch but his so called market neutral what we would simply out for instead\nIs diversification in other words don't put all of your money into stocks have some of your money there\nTo give you some opportunity to keep pace with the cost of living but don't put all of your money there instead have some of your money and bonds and yeah I have some of your money under the mattress having some of your money in cash\nOr does make perfect sense we don't have all of our money in any one place but having a little bit of our money and lots of places makes sense so not just stocks but also bombs and foreign securities and government security is an oil and gas and real estate in exponential technologies\nAnd on and on and on so that is what we have found to be the best approach or effectively phrase it another way it's not the best approach it's the least worst approach\nUm because what we have really found it's kind of like democracy right the worst political system ever devised except for all the others and it's similar to the same thing we don't know what is the best way to invest so we choose the least worst which is not making big bats\nSo if you simply place a little bit of your money in a large array of investment opportunities you can help insulate yourself\nFrom losing a lot of money at any one time in any one asset class because you don't have all their money in any one of the class so that makes sense for it\nBut says yeah totally naked and uh you know thank you for talking the out of it uh because it didn't make sense to be\nAny time you come upon other similar kinds of questions give us a call happy to help thanks so much\nYou're very welcome that's Bob from Dana Point California here on the record all been show you can do it he didn't call us a triple a plan wreck you doing some analysis on Mitchell funds are you looking at investment opportunities we can be a really good sounding board to help you make sure you don't make a big mistake\nSo let us take a look at your investments and in fact even better if you help us look at your investments\nBefore you buy them we are now offering to provide you a free retirement review just go to Edelman financial dot com slash review I you know if you're trying to figure out the key answer to the one question that is dominant in the retirement planning issue is real simple\nDo I have enough money to retire will I in fact be able to retire and comfort\nJust go to as I said Edelman financial dot com slash review or call us a triple a plan Rick I'm Rick Edelman there's been a lot of conversation on this program and many other places about the fiduciary rule but the obligation of financial advisors\nTo serve your best interest right now only registered investment advisors firms like Edelman financial are responsible obligated to act as a fiduciary to our clients stockbrokers do not have this obligation insurance agents do not have this obligation\nWell hero comes along the New Jersey bureau of securities that the state regulator in New Jersey they've now issue to notice that they're going to release a proposal that will in fact require everybody brokers as well as investment advisors\nTo adhere to a fiduciary standard when providing investment recommendations to clients New Jersey's acting they said because\nFederal regulators meaning the SEC\nHaven't done enough to raise the standards and so New Jersey's doing it by themselves does this mean we're going to suddenly see fifty states doing this individual eat with fifty sets of regulations\nI Hope not I hope we have one over all encompassing regulation at the federal level but in the meantime if you're in New Jersey you're ahead of the curve compared to everywhere else\nAs we close up a show this weekend I Want you to know that our prayers are with

'cause we're only six games and but you know they have ten points in Providence is three and her she has three and so I Know it's it's not a lot in the grand scheme of things doesn't seem like it but you know when when we reach\nA the latter part of the season you know it's going to be ... it might look back on this and think you know while this the boy was nice to get off to a good start here for the average so again a bagel up till of all and beat them twice excellent\nOr they will play Providence on Saturday here at the Massey mutual center they will play Hartford on Sunday at the ... center Hartford is off to a good start as well and I just think that that they will always think\nAnd so it's only a matter of time until uh uh they sort of ... so let's open sided risky keep this rolling and I think they can I think they got a nice mix fear of talent we've talked about it of course we talked last week with Ryan Smith about it so we'll see if they can keep rolling\nThen the Celtics they are powered through to a one oh three one oh one when at Madison Square garden against the nix the career high twenty four points and fourteen rebounds for Jason Tatum\nThe Celtics are now too and one they host Orlando tomorrow I don't know if all the time to talk Celtics so let me just do this real quick I watch the end of this game and I've watched the last quarter and a half and the Celtics were up eight\nOr was it eight maybe it was well again please don't ask me to do math um I'll call it nine ... nine\nAnd they bring in their main guys right they bring in Hartford and Kyrie in jail and brown and Jason Tatum I think mark Morris was on the uh on the floor and scallop Rooney on the commentary says\nYou know with this line up that they that they currently have on the floor compared to what the Knicks rolling out they should go on an eight to ten to run and instead the Knicks I've been going on at ten one run and tied the game and so ah I Know again I Know it's early but I read with scallops\nJust go ah you know you just go back to Boston with a three to lead and you're on the road is so it's not like you have the red Sox fans heckling you because nobody hackles David Price more than the red Sox fans\nI think you're better off starting them on the road because uh the fans are nicer there than they [laughter]\nI mean do you think the fans in LA are going to give David rise are dying no way and pains in Houston or getting of David ... no absolutely not no you'll get a hard time Red Sox fan um so I I it was a perfect time to put them out there\nAnd he absolutely delivered and uh for something that I ... bridge sure it was coming back to Boston I mean I did not anticipate them going down and and beating\nI'm beating Houston as handily as they did but uh that was great and also a a quick shot out the report fellow who quite honestly I think it was absolutely amazing in that uh Houston Sears every time he came out to pitch she was great\nA show that came finished up and Mike rebel singlehandedly lost the game for his team as die he tried going for it\nA try going for a to point conversion up water down one\nTried to go over to point conversion and missed it they got a flag though and got to do it again and missed it again and the second time they did it they went out of a no running back formation\nSo markets to marry or is it the one yard line trying to get a to point conversion with no running back behind them that has got to be one of the dumbest things I've ever seen\nI mean you least want to put a couple of fat guys back there so at least pretend like you're going to run the ball from that spot\nI mean why don't you just run it anyway they got the you know between beyond Lewis who is so a a slimy and squealing
