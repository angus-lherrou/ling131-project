{"month": "10", "state": "MA", "station": "WHYN", "content": "So well pretty interesting uh illustration of the technological changes that are coming to society I talk about them a lot in my book the truth about your future that's what it's all about exponential technologies and how they're impacting every aspect of our daily lives\nThere are some of the latest and greatest announcements that recently come out in the field of quantum computing this is the entire next generation of computing Google Microsoft and tell them IBM they're all investing in this or over Seventy prototypes already\nThe U.S house of representatives just passed a bill the national quantum initiative act\nTo accelerate education research and development they say that the quantum computing can lead to new pathways that will cure cancer explore the ...\nFirst developed an imagined new materials and solve complexities of our own human biological systems it's really kind of amazing when you think about what's coming next you know it's already here\nAI to help catch criminals in China police in the shoe east railway station have caught seven fugitives who we're connected with major criminal cases they have found twenty six other people using fake IDs you know how they did it\nThey're wearing special eyeglasses that have a I built in\nThat give them facial recognition so just by looking at people in the crowd they're able to identify if you were really you or not\nYou know we just talked about a new supermarket where there are no cashiers there's a coffee shop near Brown University where students are the customers\nAnd they get free coffee\nNo cash is accepted the university students however in order to get the coffee for free have to provide their name and phone number email address and their major\nAnd they also have to provide their date of birth and their professional interest and the coffee shop collect the data\nAnd sells it to corporate sponsors who will then reach out to the students through logos and apps and digital ads and screens in the stores on mobile devices and another are you willing to give away your personal data\nIn exchange for free stuff\nThat's the premise of this coffee shop and it's raising a lot of eyebrows among those in the privacy war\nMeanwhile in the field of medicine Chicago start up is now three D printed a human cardiac patch it's a major milestone leading to bio printing fully functioning organs you take a patient's own blood cells you reprogram them into stem cells you'd make the stem cells into a three D. bioengineering\nAnd human heart becomes viable for transplantation\nIs the first time a cardiac patch was bio printed three D. with multiple cell types the human heart is made of\nMeanwhile researchers at the University of Oxford department of clinical neurosciences has created the first robotic system that operates on a human ... a robot doing surgery on you or I\nMay insert the robot in to the pupil ... an incision less than one millimeter inside the surgeon than operates the robot via a joystick\nIt eliminates the worry that the surgeons hands might shake or accidently move or whatever the robot has already been used to conduct two routine procedure removing a run brain from the retina and dissolving hemorrhage is under a retina and in both cases the results were better than what human doctors could do\nAt Johns Hopkins scientists have developed an electronic skin that can fit over a prosthetic hand it allows the user to feel sensation including pain\nThrough a prosthetic skin pretty amazing the FDA has now approved of in a system that will assess whether a patient has a disease that might lead to a vision loss it's eighty seven percent accurate and it's the first screening device that doesn't need a human clinician to interpret the image a robot system doing it all by itself\nThere's enough of Thomas ... was invented by on a contact lens that lets people see three times better than twenty twenty\nHow would you like to have binoculars in your eyes\nOr being able to look as if you're using a microscope that's what has already been created with the body on a contact lens\nThese kinds of innovations and more are going to radically improved quality of life for pretty much everybody on the planet once they reach mainstream production\nSome other a fascinating changes going on in the field of exponential technologies at MIT they've created a wearable interface that knows what you're thinking\nWithout you having to say anything out loud it's a white plastic strip it hooks over your ear goes below your jaw the electrodes pick up a neuro muscular signals that are released when you think of a certain word sort of like saying it in your head\nAnd it's accurate Ninety two percent of the time so people wearing this device say they're paralyzed and can't speak or say they don't have a voice box so they have some kind of physical disability just by thinking they're able to communicate\nIt's amazing what's going on in the field of medicine but it's not just the field of medicine where we're seeing some pretty amazing innovations in the field of robotic scientists of MIT of made a robot that can teach itself to see and identify objects\nAnd how to manipulate them as well know robots been able to do this before this robot is capable of picking up an object it's never seen before\nAnd without resorting to trial and error it knows what to do with the object that's how humans do it you pick up an object you've never seen before and you know how to pick it up without breaking you know how to turn it so that you can examine this robots able to do the very same thing\nThis is just a few of the illustrations of what's going on in the field of exponential technologies and how they're going to radically improved and alter every aspect of life that you can think about and that's why we encourage you to go to our YouTube channel\nGo to YouTube dot com

the wrong end of a record setting blitz by Drew Brees to the air and New Orleans was damaged as much by penalties inefficient defence [noise]\nUsually precise Alex Smith through an interception it was generally off target now comes Caroline that would just seven interceptions in as a plus five turnovers and there's nine stack\nThe pay there is also have the NFL top rushing up ants in part because a quarterback in Newton is such a weapon\nThat he's porno with nine touchdowns in zero picks against Washington along with two rushing scores Washington last five straight to Carolina\nDarn it because I like Washington [noise]\nIn these one in four they're taking on the ... at at a a one o'clock jets or two and three and the jets or two and a half point favorite at home [noise]\nIf any team needed to
