got absolutely embarrassed in the season opener against Washington and then on Wednesday and Thursday they turned right around flew up to buffalo and then be a really good savers team for nothing so I'm as bad as the Bruins looked on a ... in that first game against Washington\nThey look to actually pretty good on on Thursday night or against buffalo so you've got to give credit words do there\nAnd uh and like I said they're off till Monday when they'll play Ottawa and that's kind of strange to me because uh obviously tomorrow is a holiday I like and I had a hard time wrap my head around it because I'm not off I mean will be here um I got work to do\nSo I'll be here on Columbus Day but I'm the Bruins like home opener is a Monday at one like I just I don't know like it's Boston like why why don't you make your home opener on a friday night at seven like\nI mean again I Know I Know a lot of people have tomorrow awful lot of a lot of us don't so like how many Bruins season ticket holders or don't have Columbus Day off I don't know it's just\nA one o'clock game on a Monday on a holiday that not everybody necessarily gets off just seems like a strange time\nTo have your your home opener but whatever [noise] ah so that that's what's happening here Celtics they had some pre season action they fall one Thirteen to one or two against Cleveland they didn't have Kyrie Irving didn't have Gordon Hayward and then had to market smart got thrown out in the first quarter because he wanted to rip JR Smith face off\nUm although it was a great basketball fight because I'm Marcus Smart runs into the fray and he pushes JR Smith from behind\nAnd then he puts up his Dukes but like you backpedaling like you know as basketball guys like they want to fight but they don't like that come at me like somebody hold me back because I don't really want to go after this guy somebody grabbing hold me back\nA which is pretty much what happened it was terrible I I Love market for it I Love that kind of energy and like I don't need market smart throwing hay makers\nAh I just uh basketball flights of quote fingers basketball fights are funny um and so my guess where I got tossed but I whatever I Love that kids energy\nA dairy rosier had Seventeen points if you're curious and that's the last game the pre season here for the Celtics and then again I I say sort of like bizarre I'm\nThe Celtics will now have their season opener is a week from Tuesday so like the difference between today's the the seven so yeah it was ten days between the final preseason game and the season opener that's just weird because it's on the sixteenth\nSo Tuesday the sixteen so I don't know I I find that weird they'll take on the Seventy Sixers they're a ten foot so I talk about weird scheduling things\nUh ten days between the end of the pre season out but it doesn't matter if uh NC double a football scores tells me run through the top ten for you real quick it was a kind of a fun a fun day a number one Alabama just absolutely steam rolled Arkansas\nNumber to Georgia it'd be Vanderbilt\nA forty one Thirteen number three Ohio State over Indiana forty nine twenty six number for Clemson smoked Wake Forest sixty three to three number twenty to Florida Gators they upset number five LSU twenty seven Nineteen um from what I hear that game was like\nAbsolutely sweltering like when you think of when you think of\nWhat the weather feels like in the swamps of Florida like his 'cause that's where the University of Florida is that's where either the gators 'cause they're just in swamp plants and apparently it was like a hundred and ten degrees with like\nThree hundred percent humidity just like the most miserable conditions that you could possibly imagine that that South for the swamps of South Florida can bring a that is what happened the weather was like there in Florida and I don't know if that had any I mean I didn't watch the game I I just sort of follow things in\nThe overall perception was that the people who went to that game were absolutely miserable um so anyway Florida beach LSU or at home or six Notre Dame baby number twenty four Virginia Tech forty five twenty three Nineteen\nTexas beat number seven Oklahoma forty eight forty five they have a kicker named decker I Can't make that up\nHe stole the weekend the Texas kick her name decker D I C K E R that is his name and he is the kicker the kicker decker the kicker or you go to Google the kicker I Am not making that up but totally took over the Internet is that\nA Mississippi State they beat\nTheir own ranked number eight Auburn twenty three to nine or ... and a number nine west Virginia and number tend to Washington they win in their individual contests their eye in case you missed it the patriots did beat the colds thirty eight twenty four on Thursday Night Football we will I get into that game a little bit as well\nA a little bit of a post game and you know it's funny it's been two games now since I've been on the air right 'cause last Sunday they played Miami and and then they played a obviously the played Thursday night and so I think the last thing I sat on the air was a I don't feel good about the patriots against the dolphins\nAnd uh you know I was obviously totally completely wrong which is fine I got on the the whatever I'm going into that game I didn't see anything that the patriots had done that a bed me being overconfident about anything\nUm but I should you know I said the three factors are that you have Brady in in belle jak there the dolphins and you're in Gillette Stadium as oh those three things I don't see a reason why the patriots could win\nBut realistically those three things apparently we're the only things that mattered because uh the dolphins are just awful just terrible and and like a it's funny that ah [noise]\nI don't I don't have the number ... ... Ryan ... some ridiculous it's like he's making it up now\n[noise]\n[laughter]\n\n\n[laughter]\nShe uses squeezes mayor or terrifying attractions one location signed\nThey were\nAnd so like a ... so so here we are with the whole idea what you're doing game three and a really you know what you're doing game for I mean they've been talking about certain Nathan evolved the endgame for but\nYou know\nWhy would you do that when you should pitch in game three and then okay well then we'll put you need three so ... like it's just it's\nThis sort of a [noise]\nUh this sort of run around that I Would have thought the team would have had a better plan of you know before we reached this point and again like I I saw that I think our scores doing a fine job I think that uh this is the situation that he'll probably had a lot better than the guy like like feral wood\nAnd again you know like it's he's not the GM you know it saved up ... you can only work with what the ... he gives them\nAnd as of right now it it is a borderline slim Pickens here for this red socks to him as he was very interesting very very interesting to see how the next\nUh two or three games play out because I don't know uh I mean I don't know what they're what they're looking at here like did they like did they really have to go to pour cello\nYou know do they have to go into Rodriguez they didn't have any other arms and anybody else to go to I mean I guess not\nSo I don't know\nI ... the next the next couple of games can be very interesting um the Yankees seem like there's sort of steady Eddie and sticking to the game plan and just sort of role along\nYou know and all these other teams by the way made moves to the bullpen at the ... deadline the Yankees rolled out Zach Britain a couple of times against the red Sox here they what they got Jay half going you know and and you and you know you\nYou're going to do with Braves year and a workman every single game because you literally have to and then looking at the end you're starting rotation saying yeah a Eduardo come up when he ... I mean just I I don't know I ... poor planning on my part in again I'm not like a baseball guy like I I\nThis is sort of out of my realm of of sports talk is how do you manage up of starting rotation in the playoffs bullpen I don't know but boy oh boy does it look like the guys doing it for the red Sox are are are doing a very good job of it at the moment\nSo ah if your Red Sox fan you have a lot of reason in my opinion below concern here going in the game three and going into game four and a forgive me for not knowing that I assume that it goes\nA to a certain way to a Yankee Stadium in game five back at home so I mean they gotta you gotta when one of the road now in that ... ballpark of ah the Yankees so um [noise] I I don't know Sox fans you're you're in an interesting spot here are very interesting spot\nA but I Am glad that it's the red Sox Yankees I think everybody in the planet was rooting against the gays and that are in that that\n... one game wildcard Yankees uh A's nobody wanted ...\nNobody so I'm a\n... so that that's it but this will be fun look I really I really did try to watch the game like I like I've gone to bed now twice this week way earlier that I wanted to because I was watching baseball like I was watching the baseball game last night and it was nine Fifteen and I'm like I Can't\nI Can't watch this\nWhat about\nLike I I'm On a bad man I Can't watch this nonsense so I'm Sorry I'm so I'm really sorry I'm not a baseball guy and I it's funny I haven't um I haven't seen it you know the last couple of games scares me the last couple of games I I've been trying to find um the length of time like every every\nSingle always tell you like in the box score how long the game was attendance six cetera et cetera and for some reason or be or ESPN hasn't posted the length of time\nSo what does that tell you that tell you that there are a little embarrassed or that they want to make that information really really hard and difficult to find\nIs probably in very small print in white\nOn this uh on this website but uh I can tell you right now both of those games were deathly long and even the game last night like like it was the second inning maybe they see maybe this is what baseball people say makes the sport great it was the second inning and people were acting like like the Yankees got a home run and like the crowd looking\nLike there was the second inning the second inning\nLike the the announcers in the ... everybody was just it was like this just like a dramatic passionate\nFrom us see eye heart radio music festival tonight and tomorrow night at eight pm on Springfield cw [noise]\nYeah we'll get back for Sunday mayor Steve forty [noise] a lot to get to today in the world of football even though you're patriots don't play\nA should still be a fun and interesting day of football let's get do it [noise]\nAnd\nThere\nAre right um [noise]\nStart in the shower year Miami Dolphins three in one there at the three in one\nSitting at a bangles the Bengals are favored by six and this one despite some awful statistics including be gained by four hundred and thirty five yards and now it's Ninety to eighty to Miami leads the AMC he's just telling you guys are fraudulent that team is\nOf course they were routed in New England last weekend the dolphins do lead the league with nine interceptions also on top of their division tied with Baltimore and the AFC North the Bengals are struggling on defense too\nThey rank last on third downs allowing opponents to convert fifty seven percent but off the ... especially in the red zone Cincinnati escort and its past\nThirty four trips\nThe longest active streak in the NFL that is impressive especially since in Cincinnati [noise]\nBaltimore three in one there at the one two and one Cleveland Browns\nBaltimore favorite by three o'clock in this one o'clock match up\nA favor by three o'clock feared by three points while here's a match up the former team from Cleveland loves Baltimore has won five straight in Eighteen in the past twenty meetings on her coach John Harbaugh\nWhile defense always is the calling card for the ravens Joe Flaco is eat touchdown passes only two interceptions and Justin Tucker could make feel goals and Sunday kicking from Lake Erie if you want it\nOddly this is the final entered division road game for the ravens who beat Pittsburgh and lost to Cincinnati I'll say that again\nOr this is the final ensure division road game for the ravens\nSo you think about having to go play on the road within your division\nA Baltimore's done after this week\nAt Cincinnati ...
