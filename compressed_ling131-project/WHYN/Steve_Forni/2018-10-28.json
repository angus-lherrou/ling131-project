College Board and now prices were flat they didn't\nRice seven percent which means of college was going to cost you twenty five grand\nIt's now twenty five grand one hundred as opposed to seven percent increase of thousands of dollars so this is really very exciting news and demonstrating slow but sure\n\nThat college is becoming more affordable I Believe are going to see this trend continue we already have colleges that are freezing tuition we have private schools that are offering to charge with public schools pay we have out of state schools charging within state students pay\nWe have ... states that are providing free tuition half a dozen of them are so far around the country we have companies that are providing free tuition as an Employee Benefit Disney Chrysler gee uh ... uh we have Walmart and\nStarbucks all offering free tuition for employees it's really very exciting it doesn't mean you don't need to be saving for College of course you do the good news is the amount of money the parents have saved for college and college five twenty nine plans has said an all time high of more than three hundred twenty eight billion dollars [noise]\nSaid a lot of money to problem is for forty college savings\nPlans network the average account is only twenty four thousand dollars\nYeah that's not going to pay for college for your kid and oh by the way less than half of parents who have a child headed to college less than half of parents\nAre saving and a five twenty nine plan so none of the parents are saving for college not enough for setting in the right place and not enough for sending enough money so yeah college costs it looks like they're stabilizing but that's not enough to do the deal so um I Hope you're paying attention to that and I want to share with you the best\nWay to go to college that anyone anywhere has ever figure it out\nAnd it's been designed a poster child for this as a woman named Martha ... she was profiled in the media not long ago\nShe goes to Harvard and she doesn't pay anything for tuition at Harvard she doesn't pay anything\nFor room and board you know why because she goes to Harvard but she's not a student she works in the kitchen and\nWhile her job in the kitchen typically pays in Boston\nLess than twenty seven thousand dollars a year she earns fifty thousand a year\nWhy she making so much money as a kitchen employee at Harvard University because Harvard has a policy\nThat requires service workers to be paid the same pay and benefits as other university employees so she gets a much higher salary she gets full health insurance and pension benefits paid vacation childcare assistance\nShe has discovered that the key when going to college is to go get a job at college not [noise] classes\nI'm Rick Edelman you're listening to the Rick elements show it would not be a week on the Rick Adelman show if we didn't\nTalk about Wells Fargo\nSo we've got to do it again the New York attorney general this week has now find Wells Fargo sixty five million dollars\nFor its deceptive cells practices called cross selling\nWhere the banks sales new financial products and services to existing customers\nAccording to the New York attorney general Wells Fargo told Wall Street analysts that it had a superior cross selling strategy that would increase revenues but the attorney general's office says the Wells Fargo did

Reserve\nTo fire Wells Fargo CEO Tim slow and he's been there for Thirty years and she says he was quote deeply implicated\nIn the banks misconduct meanwhile despite all of this Wells Fargo just announced its third quarter results and their profit jumped thirty two percent just six billion dollars in the past three months you know what they're saying in the boardroom at Wells Fargo\n[laughter] [noise]\nI got older and you're listening to the truth about money let us know how we can help you triple late plan wreck is our phone number AAA seven five to sixty seven forty two\nAnd we're going to talk a lot about this right this game last night this Red Sox game the whole ... thing to me was freaking awesome and I and we're going to talk about that too I I Would normally go to break right now I should go to break\nUp but I think instead because I'm sure he's there and hooked up across the street and I told them twelve ... twelve dense let's do it I think we're joined right now But Ryan Smith right there but\nYeah I just decided to give you an extra half seconds do a story into some panic there for oh no\nI you know I appreciate it on your toes it's live radio so I you know we we call this dug the roulette wheel you just see what happens\nYeah oh outstanding how can you complain about the way the results have been over here\nA what a a game last night I I I guess I'll start which goal was your favorite because there was at least or at least to highlight reel goals\nThat had to be the owner Chuck game winters late in the third or just the presence of mind to go to the front of the net during a little bit of a broken play after\nA rally Stillman who had his best game as a pro last night on top of all these other details that I'm sure we will touch upon\nHe makes a great play driving down the wing he draws a couple of defenders ice to um throws it into this lottery appalled Thompson narrowly missed is getting a one time or on goal comes back to the point and there's Batman gene covering up where he supposed to be to immediately slam on time or on the net and I don't know if ... McIntyre but\nThere was Harry's the as he was falling onto his stomach ...\nInto the open side of the net the presence of mind to know that there was a little bit of ... there to try to shovel it hold on his back and as he was falling\nAnd everything he's touching is turning the goal particularly on home ice and that is something I think a lot of people knew that ... was a veteran player could provide some good leadership for this team I don't know Harry himself saw start like this coming for himself on a personal level\nWell ... and so you mentioned it ah being in the right place and I think that's one of the things I noticed from these veterans is it's when you just have five guys and the ice were where they're supposed to be that's how you can generate\nScoring chances in just like you said having a guy like Mad Men gene another veteran in the right place having Harry in the right place you know ... in the right place uh that's something that I assume you have to learn when you get to this level and it must be nice having a lotta guys on the line up that have already learned that that's how you got to play\nAbsolutely and what it also does from that perspective is it allows players to be in\nI mean to make those calls when you made them is is insane um it's funny I took a couple a took a couple of notes um during the game last night and of course you don't meet I always take the notes when I when I started started drinking I mean now that I'm doing I mean I I get out of the numbers game to go home you know you sit\nOh and you make yourself a cocktail and you're watching the watching the game before you know if I'd like to ... so um I took some notes but one of the ones that I thought was interesting 'cause I Would never remember it the next day\n[noise] um\nWhat makes it so challenging is being in the NFL and having to\nI'm having to make in game adjustments based on where you're pitchers batting like one of the things I never realized is like if you're a pitcher\nAnd and this this could be wrong like I'm Still not even really a hundred percent sure I I think this is right though so like if your pictures batting nights and get paid shit for he's not necessarily\nYour pictures not necessarily still in the ninth batter spotlight job up at one point said the pictures batting spot is now the seven hole and I I was like ... so there must be some sort of sequence where when you ... for an up guys enough times like the positions move up and down the line up like I have\nA mind blower not like I Can't even wrap my head around this National League stuff but [noise] one of the things that I didn't really think about until last night was the fact that the red Sox carry three ... and the reason why they were able to do that was\nYou know ... comes in and gets a huge hit a because she could pinch it for the catcher so not only are you ... for for the pictures but you you know you have you might want to pinch it for other positions having three catchers allowed Alex court to put pinch hitters in for guys like Sandy Leo\nAnd um you\nKnow just having those options on the bench I mean let me see if I I think I have the coral audio I'm Sorry bear with me 'cause this is live radio I think this is Corey here talking about his bench and how he's able to use it\nThey understand the role they they know where they may now that I'm going to get\nA chance to contribute regardless if you are on the bench but I'm a one point I felt that in our bench wasn't suited for that but then we we ought to be and uh and and now we got more options than living writer\nAnd ... who was just excellent and ... was all over the place yesterday I mean this is the guy I don't know if they're gonna win tonight but this theme is bound to win this thing I I mean I haven't seen the team that was this\nA well oiled in a long time and I like I don't want to get ... crazy like I was I was almost thinking about it uh yesterday I was like you know I Wonder how the scene compares to be like the old for team\nAnd I got that such a bad such a tough road to go down\nI mean it that often to lead this might be one of the best teams I've ever seen and read from the red Sox but I Do know that that you know for the pitching was ridiculous you know and that that sort of brings me to one of my points which is uh the way that uh the way that the game is approach now in the playoffs like it used to be\nI say the old days I mean I'm Talking you know into doubt even going back to say two thousand for you you had your starting pitchers and that\nWas what the focus was like all we have to go against Pedro and shelling and ... and you know going back to the years in or was it two thousand Thirteen\nWhen uh yeah that was the year that we're a Tory hunter flipped over the flipped over the wall and the red Sox were ... in that series against Detroit and remember how horrible the red Sox were against those Detroit starting pitchers\nAnd the goal was we just need to get to the bullpen but did you please let us get double time because we can't hit anybody\nUm and and so that that's changed a little bit like that that that doesn't seem to be the approach like you started moral Rodriguez knowing he's only going to go five innings I mean Chris Sale going ... doing five innings to me it's sort of business enough and David Price everybody's talking about how great that start was you went to ...\nUm but\nThat sort of the waste played now I'm ... you know and you go back to the\nUm you know ... when Cleveland Indians maybe four years ago I started getting a shutdown lockdown bullpen\nAnd now the game is more on long relievers and bringing in you know you you have three starters so your fourth and fifth starters now they become your long relievers and Nathan evolved he goes to winnings and\n... and so there's so much of that goes into\nInto not only planning the for the world series in ... managing but having to do it you know in an ... ballpark that much just because I you know we all we know years is the is AOL AOL ball you know I'm not sitting down and watching\nYou know Mets pirates in June I'm just not doing it and so to see it on display or and to see a guy like core or be able to figure it out on the fly and push every single right button that is a that is amazing\nI Will say that it wasn't so much amazing for the other guy on the other side of things Dave Roberts ah he had a guy rich Hill who was in and pitching fantastic and pulled them out for some guy who was not so fantastic and um [laughter] and\nHe was getting sort of crushed or on social media won a treat in particular [laughter]\nThe the ... [laughter] the dear leader our president this is great [noise]\nDonald Trump tweeted last night watching the Dodgers Red Sox final innings it's amazing how a manager takes out a pitcher who was loose and dominating through almost seven innings rich hill of the Dodgers\nAnd brings in nervous relievers who get she'll act for run will lead garden managers do it all the time big mistake so I think President Trump just got day Roberts fired\nLike\nOuch [laughter] I get the president's telling you you're not very good at your job\n[laughter] oh man\nI was I got to get off Twitter but that's a really good one oh that's good uh let's let's switch are focused to the NFL go a lot um I don't anticipate soaking up with Rob Christopher Smith in fact I I quite honestly I don't even want to bring the guy's phone and bother I Know is that weird to me\nI just like I like it's like nine nine in the morning and like the guy's been up all night I'm just I'm not gonna bother so I'm so there you got we're making decisions are making programming decisions on the fly but we are going to go around the league the NFL we're talking coming up next it's a\n[noise]\n[laughter]\n\n\n[noise]\n[noise] people still think an education from northern Virginia community colleges", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Steve Forni", "city": "Springfield", "day": "28"}
