in virtual tennis even do he can street options lay\nIn your nephew\nWhen the toilet paper is running low rich replaces the role of the actual older not just on the back of the toilet\nReaches drinking and driving rich you know what do you do in rich\nI was just telling everyone how great you are\nMakes people look\nVisits dot dot ... dot org public\nService announcement brought you by the national Highway Traffic Safety Administration in the ad council news radio five big\nFor you to do any which way you bring\nTelling the message only to juice now they're not talking to gentile strike\nBecause they're still Jewish believers they they may not have heard\nThey haven't grass that yeah right yeah that's right [laughter]\nThey're still segregate it exactly and they're only talking to the Jews I don't know if I really have ever paid any attention when I read that particular averse because I Know that persecution really was what caused the church the girl\nPersecution causes us to grow because you put your faith on the line and it forces you here than actually to change your geographical location and they begin to tell the message and they when they told the message\nEven though we know that the message was for everyone gentile and Jews alike they first go to the juice\nI think when you're when you're kicked out of your community or you have to leave your community and you become a refugee if you will\nThat your tendency is wherever you go you probably try to find people that you're familiar with that you have some kind of a connection with and so that's where they went they probably found pockets of Jewish people in these cities and ... and so that's where they felt the most comfortable and that's where they want to tell their message\nIt's fairly interesting I think that's an excellent point because I Know when the Chinese travel all over the world they look for Chinese restaurants really yeah they don't want to eat anywhere else they want in a Chinese restaurant\nWas amazing to me when I went to Africa twice and in Nairobi all of the Chinese restaurants that were there I'm thinking I'm In Africa Chinese there are Chinese restaurants all over the place\nThey're everywhere and the Chinese like to eat in Chinese restaurants that's familiar familiar ...\nExactly [laughter] just say that in Chinese yeah [laughter] so anyway they they like\nThat that's like you said they liked that feeling of comfort and they go for him to be around people that they liked so here they go to the Jews\nAnd Paul is going to pick that up later in his gospels when you I mean when he writes in his pistols he's going to write and he says to the Jew first because he says some of them however\nMiners Cyprus and serene winter Antioch and began to speak to Greeks also telling them the good news about the Lord Jesus Christ so there was a few people that grabbed it early now and they said let's preach the gospel to everybody\nYou know what here's here's the message a ... and we're hearing news about Peter doing something with some of these Roman citizens with the century and I'm sure word was spreading and and it was getting out that now the Holy Spirit had fallen on these guys so maybe there was something that was just kind of staring them as well to go out and start speaking to the great\nSense all the first thing you do you go to your neighbors you go to your cousins or go to relatives you go where you're comfortable then you go to the geeks I mean the Greek side of your comfort zone there you go and that is not easy to do that is a hard thing to do isn't it really is we really like our comfort zones and America we've got a lot of comfort slant\nAnd so they began to tell Greeks not Jews now they begin to tell them about the Lord Jesus Christ and the Lord's hand\nWas with them ... the Lord's hand you know I think it's pretty amazing when he talked about the Lord's hand to hand is something that actually is very functional when you think about the way you can use your hand if you think about some people that don't have hands they really have tough times in life\nAnd even if you're a left hand it there's a lot of trouble is that you have in life and so you know the hand of the lord is something\nThe lord was with them in many ways to functioning with them helping them\nTo preach the good news the Lord's hands with him I have to believe this is a sign of the annoying thing of the lord it's like when you lay hands on people you pray there's an annoying thing\nI think this is really focusing the Lord's hand I'm sure that speaking about the work of the Holy Spirit was with them and great number of people believed and they turn to the lord\nYou know that's such a a wonderful verse to like it to think about that once again I go back to Jesus Christ of leaving the responsibility to tell his story that's hard to believe it's all around the world to us the people like us\nAnd that using our hands and in our mouth and our voice were able to tell the story of Jesus and ... and this happens a great number of people believed\nThat there was a Jewish\nMan who died on across rose from the dead ascended to haven't told us he's coming back and people believe that they hear that message and they believe it because the presence of the lord like you said was there the Lord's hands was there there was such a bouncer that message that caused people to turn to the lord\nSo they told the message of the good news but why like you said\nThe Lord's hand there was a manifestation of the Holy Spirit that convince people that the words are true and that's what the lord says he says that\nHe sent his word to heal them he says but what happens is is that he confirms is word with designs following so when the Lord's hand is there he's confirming what the people are saying and they see that it's not just words but it's actually\nA manifestation of the spirit that they are whether like you say it's something that is internal that God Speaks to their spirits through these words that they're saying but there is a presence of God in the meaning and they say wow yeah turning to the law\nIt's it's an amazing thing 'cause it is you hear stories all the time about different things and ... but then when you tell somebody about Jesus Christ and what he did\nWin it's accompanied by the power of the Holy Spirit the presence of the Holy Spirit it does something in in a person's heart in life if they're open to the direction of the Holy Spirit\nI think every person has this in their spirit and they're being there is a hunger for the truth they recognize that or not there's a hunger that's there and got his place it there and the only one that can feel it is the lord himself you can try to fill it with drugs you can try to fill it with ... money\nFame and you look at the stars sometimes I look at some of these people to commit suicide I look at some of these people that they get caught up on everything and so forth and that doesn't fill the void you have in your heart only God can do that you\nYou hear that message like I said and there's power and that man and a message and and once again you know the the Jewish people thought it was for them because Jesus was Jewish and everything was done in this in this little cocoon of Jerusalem in Israel\nAnd then when Jesus was standing there before he ascended into heaven he said listen you're gonna you're gonna be my witnesses in Jerusalem man Judea\nAnd then he said so Mary until the most parts of the earth\nYou wonder what was going on in their heads and and they were probably thinking oh yeah there's pockets of Jews all over the world so we'll get to share this with all of our Jewish relatives that are out there\nNot knowing that that message was also going to penetrate the hearts of melt the hearts of non Jewish people ... all of those people\nAre and and and if you do any kind of church history\nYou'll see that the church you know we always think about is spreading into Europe but it went eastward anyway the everywhere India and China and it reached Japan and and it's amazing when you see the the scope of the outrage of this simple message about Jesus died on across rose from the\nYou know began like you said it began in Jerusalem because that's where it took place that took place in Israel the Jerusalem was where he was crucified and were heroes [noise]\nAnd I think if you take a look at the beginning there spreading around the world\nBut it seems like the focus is returning now towards Jerusalem it's coming back to Jerusalem you'll look what's happening in the world and you look what's happening in Jerusalem and you see how a lot of the world turning against Jerusalem and you see a lot of things happening in Jerusalem\nThat's a sign that the messiah is ready to come back and so we're really looking for him to come back come through the eastern gate like he promised he was going to do and come in back to Jerusalem again\nAnd if you travel the Jerusalem is pretty interesting because if you're on the amount of olives were Jesus is supposed to return to\nTheir has ... all the graves are from our Jewish their Israel except for maybe Schindler and a couple of others that are there\nBut they bury themselves there because they knew them as I was going to come back there and they want to be the first ones to rise from his dad and I then when you cross across the the the the actual cavern before you come up into Israel and in front of the the Temple Mount\nIs covered with Muslim graves and so the Muslims have planted their graves there because it's a holy man can become unholy if he touches a grave so they know them aside as coming through the gate so they\nPlanted all gray and for us all these things\nThat's not going to stop teasing outcome and he's coming right through that eastern day they're going to be an earthquake or something all of all the Arabs are going to ... you know everything they're going to part way ... going to walk right down to yeah it's got to be amazed at what an exciting time to be living in really is what an amazing\nMoment to think that the that Jesus could return at any moment like no other time in history at any moment he could he could return\nSo that's pretty amazing when you look at it and so many people believe than they turned to the lord and news of this reach the ears of the church in Jerusalem so\nThey had a some kind of a system them call by cell phone but somehow and anybody was traveling to Jerusalem which a lot of people did traveled through some they they would pass notes they would passwords and they would tell everybody what's happening up and Antioch that people are getting safe yeah\nIt's phenomenal to ... the whole way that you know that Jesus hit the scene with Alexander the great conquering the world's getting everybody to speak Greek and other Romans building the trans stumps yeah everything was like I had that it was phenomenal and so it could go out and it could come in news travel fast\nRight that is that when he arrived uh or actually it says and they are the church in Jerusalem heard this news and they said Barnabas the Antioch\nIf you remember Barnum as he was a an encourage or think is worthy even meant encouragement and so they sent him up to Antioch", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Bethany Assembly of God", "city": "Springfield", "day": "07"}
