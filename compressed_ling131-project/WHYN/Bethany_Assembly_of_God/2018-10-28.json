Springfield\nAt a place of worship I'm Pam who sales Fox News I synagogue in Pittsburgh the latest target of a person with a gun\nNo I'm assuming that they had a an entrance usually many places where gated I had a wall around them so that would be the outer entrance kind of there's a inter entrance where the house actually was all around it so he's at the outer entrance and he's knocking at or\nOn the outer entrance and surfing girl no that's an interesting concept to because\nHere we are trying to Christianity in and we have a girl that's a service no ... I don't know what\nHer status was here says she's a servant I'm not sure whether she was actually owned by somebody is a servant or whether she would just serving\nYeah you know it does it say it does it say so obviously she was employed at least we'll we'll say she was employed by the house and I think Roman serving a slightly different than what we think about slavery you know and we think about it we go back to the Eighteen hundreds of what happened there it was a little better situation back in these days\nAnd her name was Rhoda right he came to the door and when she recognized Peters voice Peters outside banging on the door and she recognizes that it's Peter yeah and she's so overjoyed she ran back without opening the door and explained Peters out the\nYeah this is great Peters there are there like a dust that\nYou know I wouldn't want to be wrote it you know forever for your name is recorded in God's word that was the one who didn't open the door which\nYou have to kind of put yourself in her position just killed James and I know they're going to kill Peter\nAnd they're praying for Peter's it'd be delivered it out at free but James didn't get set free and so they're figuring oh man this Peter he's done tomorrow they're going to take 'em and and so he's in jail they know what the Romans have done they know what's happening is so she's just shocked she you know the voice\nAnd she doesn't open the door and I I don't know what that would be as far as an emotional response it's one that is so emotional that your actions don't seem to make sense at that\nMoment yeah so excited she was so filled with joy plus she didn't want to aid and abet a criminal who would just broke Asia or cough\nHe was just so she was just so we are joined it because she was just in the room praying and and interceding for the release of their you know their leader\nAnd then she hears and recognize his voice how how exciting thrilling would that be ... because she's part of the miracle now she is she she is experiencing this God ordained miracle at the moment and sometimes I think when we when we experience a miracle it's hard for us to comprehend believe and it's hard for us to contain ourselves\nAnd so here's Peter standing outside the door and the girl is supposed to open the door to help them in she leaves him fries hanging outside\nBanners looking around over his left shoulder as writes your fellow man who's going to come and get that something they'll sometimes\nMiracles are like that the miracle is already taken place and yet you're standing there because all of a sudden you're you're confounded by what's in front of you\nAnd and nothing seems to be going the way you're looked like exactly go she should open the doors and just come in with Peter arm in arm right I Would have been really exciting but no she runs lease Peter there and she runs and tells everybody in the ... and Peter is at the door yeah that's pretty exciting instinct\nFor Peter he's ... he's looking around going okay wait a minute I just got miraculously delivered am I going to get arrested again [laughter]\nYou know is that the next the next line and in the Bible\nReally kind of is amazing because here these people are praying for Peter to set free\nPraying for God to intercede and she comes and said that Peters out the door and they say you're out of your mind folder faith ... face a heavier mind you know I think Jesus would say oh gee of little faith filming goodness but this to actually tell her you're out of your mind\nHow can you say that you know we're in here praying ... do you think the answer the prayer you know I heard that statement fed like you said really makes you wonder did they really believe what they were praying was going to have that's\nA good point and a lot of times people don't they pray but they do and just a hot of a ritual that how well not really believing that it's going to happen but we have to understand maybe perhaps because she's a servant girl that she wasn't maybe one of them maybe she wasn't even praying with him she just answering the or moving food doing whatever so I had to do\nAnd so maybe she was one that was praying with them and they didn't consider her as maybe being quote as spiritual and as as they are how they say\nYou don't know what you're talking about right but she insists that the next one says when she kept insisting that's pretty interesting when you're talking about praying keeping keeping keeping keeping it before the war in front of this thing she insisted that it was so\nWell they said maybe it's not fair but it's an angel now\nYou know I don't know how I Would respond if somebody told me I was crazy no yet all true you're out of your mind and then you'd be like oh really okay yeah cause you you know you would take that as as an affront easy for you yeah you know and so\nI'm Glad that she kept insisting and and kept pushing it you may think I'm Crazy but I'm not even there was a miracle at the door but\nEven has all but even so they still don't believe are no cars they say can be Peter now must be his his angel ... and maybe they kill them early killed them early here yeah so they're they're kind of still it to the ghost that's yeah we'll see [laughter] rather than a deliverance atmosphere and they say it must\nBe his angel no\nI'm not sure how much experience to head with angels but Peter obviously did have some experience with angels because the angels came and got them out of prison\nAnd the cycles and these are praying must have had some understanding of angels because there's a lot of angelic activity in the Old Testament and in the New Testament and there was an activity that we saw so they're thinking that okay it's not Peter but it's his angels\nIn So Peter kept on knocking\nYeah Phil outside at this point I wouldn't have been knocking I I think it would have been banging on the door I'd never been a little harder than knocking bar hiding because you're afraid to ... kind of our area high ranch is a lemon and when they open the door and\nThey saw him they were us Tanishia that's an amazing word right there they absolutely were beside themselves just like Peter was about I'd himself when the angels came and delivered him there beside themselves because their prayers are being answer\nYou know and and they recognize them and and they just got overtaken right Peter comes to himself he gets excited he goes he knocked on the door\nWrote a column she sees him she gets excited they go and they're not really sure if they come out when miracles happen I think that's the only response that we can have as best on a worse time national this really happened\nYeah and then the next versus really amazed because Peter motion with his hand\nFor them to be quiet and described how the lord brought him out of the prison so they were so excited that they were ... to have a heater has to stop them and say listen you left me out here for a long time let me tell you what happened yeah\nLet me tell you what Alison I just busted out at a lord busted the lord but yeah I didn't bus up award busted me out yeah they didn't even need a filing a cake [laughter]\nSo then it goes on and it says I Want you to go tell James and the brothers about this he said and then he left for another place you didn't even stay\nNow because I didn't notice that yeah he didn't stay to the permit was a criminal here just busted out of jail nobody you figure you stay in the ... and they would have coffee is he he would say okay you're going to be ... and it'd\nBe real excited about it but he's maybe he was a little upset because they left them outside\nFor sold it could be I'm not sticking around here [laughter] you don't have any faith I'm going somewhere where I can find faith I think he knew that you know here it was a pretty nasty guy yeah he's er he's somebody he definitely\nNeeded to to guard himself and those people as well so he he he was doing this obviously for his own safety and the safety of the church\nThem almost but it's interesting that he ... he says I Want you to share this I Want you to write tell people happen and I you know Jesus really does for us when he does something in our life he says okay I'm doing this miracle in your life I Am setting you free I'm doing something that's going to give you an ability to become more than you are\nBut I Want you to express that the people I Want you to go and tell people tell your brother tell your sister's tell your moms and dads tell everyone about what God's done in my life\nYou know it's it's one thing that that we read about in the New Testament yeah I mean there are miracles there's miracles throughout the Bible\nAnd it's it's so important for us to remember that God is still working miracles in lives today he did it here and this serves as a point there for us today to say that hey you may you may feel like you're in prison you may feel like you're surrounded by the enemy and things are just coming apart at the seams crowd to God\nHave other people pray for you and let a miracle happened in your life because God still does miracle\nAnd you can be sure that when you pray for someone and somebody comes to you and says look at you pray for me and I had a miracle\nThat you'll be astonished math that you'll be style just by that fact matter of fact you probably won't even believe it and he'll you actually see something that amazing yeah if you will not believe that these people did not believe at what happened when got answered their prayers and how that happens to each and every one of them\nBecause like best or said he says it's just astonishing yeah\nWhen God does something miraculous in our lives because it's beyond are doing is beyond our beyond", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Bethany Assembly of God", "city": "Springfield", "day": "28"}
