Springfield\nPrayers in the oval office between the president and the pastor I'm Pam who sales Fox News after being welcome to the White House pastor Andrew Brunson drop to one need place his hand on President Trump's shoulder and prayed Brunson return to the U.S yesterday after being held for nearly two years in Turkey\nAnd here it says this is the first time that Christians were called Christians and they were called followers of Christ\nAnd they're named Christian now today we have a lot of people that have the name of Christian they say I'm a Christian but they're probably not followers of Christ the original meaning was that the words that Jesus spoke you put them into action you followed his example and so they were followers of Christ this word Christian is only three times in the entire New Testament here\nIs the very first time we find people being called Christians\nAnd so here it's probably because of the intense teaching I Would say that the apostle Paul people to come to understand that Christ was the key it was faith in him it was all about Christ so if it's about Christ you should be crushed like yes Gen\nChristians and to have that moniker put on you that you are Christ like yeah you know what an honor I Do some people have said that maybe this was used in origin to you know to put people down as a you're a little Christ you know or whatever\nAnd and we know people that use the name of Christ in in a foul way but here it now it now we take that as a as a privilege to be able to be called a to be a person who acts like Christ thinks like price levels Christ\nYeah that'd be comes the Supreme authority for your life has to be like Christ if you live a life that is similar to his [noise] that is your\nGuests that's the highest thing you could do has to be like crisis so that's why it becomes such a powerful thing like you mentioned\nAnd during this time as as inverse number twenty seven some profits came down from Jerusalem Antioch\nNow I like the way they say some profits now we we we often wonder what the profits are what they are but these are some profits and I'm assuming that people are going to come as a profit or people who are going to speak for God that's really what he's talking about here so they're coming down from Jerusalem to Antioch now\nI Would I Would say coming up but I'm becoming down because there is a limit as high up by the altitude is high\nAnd when you come down to Antioch you're actually coming down but if you look on I'm happier going up they're going to go north north going north or you're going up but it's actually coming down because Jerusalem was the high point in the in that whole range so [noise]\nSo that's why they say that in one of them named ...\nThat's quite a name I think they had gone bus ... catch the bus is going to say that what you're going down\nAnd give us he stood up and threw the spirit predicted that a severe salmon would spread over the entire Roman world\nNow that's an interesting thing you hear often times profits standing up speaking for God but here he says that there's going to be a famine\nAnd you'd almost say that this is controlling the weather [laughter] somebody was that you can't do that\nBut if you remember Jesus stood up and he come to see so if the comes from God profited he's truly speaking from God it'll come to pass so here's a way you can tell that came to pass because it says in the next where's this happened during the reign of ... so they put that in there I'm sure that look was letting you know\nThat in history at this particular time there was a famine that came\nSo this profit was true yeah you get an happen\nAnd that's the exciting thing about scripture once again because you can line up the people in places that are mentioned in here with\nA seal are hilarious and so so that's what's really cool about looks accounts because he names people places\nAnd there is historical record there's great archaeological record of events that tied to the to the book of acts as well as the Old Testament stuff is so this right here when it says ... we know he's talking about we know the years that Claudia is right it's it's really cool\nIt is and the cycles each according to his ability decided to provide help for the brothers living in Judea\nSo this is an encouragement for us because the generosity that was found in salvation we received it free it was a gift that was given to us because of this gift giving to us than we take what we have received from God\nAnd whatever ability that got us give us to burn whatever we have we use that to help others who are in need and that's pretty exciting when you think about it\nAnd anyone who's ever shared really shared something\nUm there was a gentleman in our congregation that\nHe saw the need among children in a certain part of South America\nAnd it was up to him at this particular time because the Holy Spirit was talking to him he was either going to buy a forklift that was probably maybe three quarters of a million dollars I don't know [noise] and he was either going to have to buy a new forklift or gift to this ministry for children\nHe decided to give to the ministry the children and they rebuilt a forklift for maybe I don't know I ...\nAnd the three quarter of a million dollars\nMuch less but he ended up giving that yeah extra and over to to help the children and for missions and not know there's a place where all of a sudden I think the Holy Spirit\nReally revealed to him a great medium and didn't under his own strength but here the Holy Spirit gave him the ability because that's what it says here each according to his ability decided to provide help for the brothers living in Judea\nSo there is an ability that we have that is given to us just not something that\nYou can just do it and say I'm doing in my own strength you can't it's where your faith rises within you and God Speaks to you and you're able like Jesus who gave it all you know for us You're able to give according to your ability the spirit gives you to help other brothers and sisters and that's really exciting\nYou know you you hear a word ... a profit ... speaks under the influence of the Holy Spirit shares a word and then there's response and that's\nYou know that's what we hope happens to this radio broadcasts through the ministry of of preaching and teaching or in your local church that you don't just hear the message and then don't do anything with it\nBut it spurs you to action it causes you to do something and whatever you are able to do each according to his own ability you have ability God's just looking for availability and you\nTo do whatever needs to be done and at this point right here others weren't going to need some help so one church decided to help out with the other churches is it's a wonderful story of\nLike you said faith you hear the word of God and then faith rises up within you causes you to act\nIt's pretty amazing because when you when you look at this radio program that's Bethany is put on and I think it's since the fifties ... exactly sure how long ago but this has been we've been producing this radio station and it's not inexpensive to do this radio station and we pay for it\nAnd I don't remember anybody ever sending in any offerings from the radio station not at all\nBut we do it because we believe in the message and when the messages preached we know that those cuts your heart in one way or another\nYou may not get into this radio station but you may be inclined more towards a living like Christ more toward actually having a generous heart and you may give to other people you may give to other churches you may give to other\nNeeds that you find available but probably some of the reason is because you listen to the gospel message and to soften your heart and helps you to become more like Chrysler become like a Christian shouldn't make generous but that doesn't\nI mean you couldn't send in a check for a thousand dollars to the radio station right here and help us 'cause that would that would probably help quite a bit even though we don't receive anything we never really asked for anything\nBut this is what happens when the Holy Spirit speaks to people's hearts if you listen to any other radio programs or any other TV programs are always asking for a financial blessing they're saying keep the radio station on the air Bethany is paid for this radio stations since the fifties and they have a charge that community anything they haven't done anything about that at all\nBut I'm sure it's touched your heart's somewhere so that when someone does make an appeal you respond by the Holy Spirit you decide by your ability what you could shift\nSo I'm not making an appeal for you to give but I'm saying that if you listen to this every week what'd you send a check in now might it'll just it'll do you good it'll be a blessing to you buster other people do say well I'm not send any money but I like listening [laughter] I like listening\nSo the idea here is that according to his ability they decided to provide help\nAnd assistance to the game with came from the power of the spirit because the spirit revealed to them how much they had\nReceived from the work of the of the living God now Jesus himself when he did for them then that begins to develop within them this desire to do good to be able to be a blessing to others\nIt's it's really cool because I I've met a few people that said hey I recognize your voice and yeah we listen to you guys on Sunday Morning that's amazing and and for some of you who were your pastors you may never have even met us we we you may not come to Bethany\nBut if you actively listen to this program and the spirit is speaking to you through our words\nWere kind of your pastors and so that's really cool for me to think about that we're having an influence on you and if you can take a little bit of what we share with you and share it with other people that's that's what it's about\nSomeone to call you pastor ... I'm a ... I guess because his what his goes on and says it says ... gave this prophetic worried about famine and then all of a sudden these people who are disciples listen to the word of ... and then in verse thirty\nMiss they did sending their gifts to The Elders by part by monitors and salt so they heard what aggravates shared that there was going to be a famine and then the Holy Spirit help them say we've got to help those people in Jerusalem that are going to be going through this famine\nAnd there are people out there that are going through a famine today it may not be food but it may be a family of God's word and here we are preaching the gospel best drag us and I", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Bethany Assembly of God", "city": "Springfield", "day": "14"}
