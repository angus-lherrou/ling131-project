war soldiers but you could still have these types of operations and I think that's really\nA one of the most fascinating things that I go over in the book because a lot of people have these experiences and then people kind of go well no one guy there that did that so you must be mistaken or maybe somebody was traveling through or this or that so I Hope that helps them sort of get a better idea of what could be happening in that situation\nLet's go to Chris in Columbus ohio Hi Chris go ahead\nHi Georgia since you're a gift there has been a in Ohio northeastern part you know I've got to ask I Believe he did a show from there the man's school reform and tore yep we sure did and every time I go there and there's something it's electricity\nAnd if I could I'd like to share a love story with you sure okay my mother\nAnd full blooded Cherokee of called in quite a few times a follower ... are there any way up my father died\nAnd three months later my mom she's really depressed\nDidn't know how things were going to work out you know to put two kids\nAnd just before daylight woke up my father was there he came in her bedroom sit down on the bed mom stood up\nHer daughter kissed her\nAnd said honey everything's going to be All right both beautiful and the strongest power of everything is love and I was going to share that with a sweet mhm\nThese sometimes these stories are just emotional issue will hurt the Brendan\nYeah yeah you know I mentioned a little bit before it's these aren't negative experiences for the most part it in in my in the real and that accounts that I go over with these people that have people I've met over the years you know\nSixty sixty seven percent I think are more positive than they are negative\nAnd it's this idea of someone coming back saying goodbye saying you know it's okay um\n... you know these are positive experiences in their life changing and they reaffirm the connectedness that you had with this love one and and these are important things in life we talked about before it could heal some sort of psychological wounds and help you move through the grief process\nSo this phenomenon could be used as a coping skill and there's a lot of research out there that says that sometimes paranormal experiences art uses coping skills um so you know I always shutter when it's always negative negative negative negative goes goes goes scary stories\nLike that in real life\nGo to Joe in the Bronx I chose to go ahead\nGeorge how are you know Joe good I'm Brendan yeah I wanted to ask you a question then maybe really a story about a full up are rich and and I seen um [noise] ... um the question is\nDo you think that there is a supplemental under channel of communication going on between the go see a permission and the recipient of the ghost experience\nUm maybe perhaps subconsciously is to subliminal um communication to wake communication going going that precipitate the a ghostly permission appearing\nAnd I had a full reparation experience or after my brother passed away\nUm I'm a singer songwriter and I was having writer's block on his song not related this story before on coast to coast\nUm my brother comes into the room [noise] um he looks the way he did when he passed away in the hospital I'm short of 'em and I it's it's during the day\nOr at the foot of my bed he walks by and he speaks to me and says just get it done and then disappears into the wall\nUm can you may be elaborate on what\nCould have precipitated this\nOr does your does your brother pass away or he was\nHe a this was after he passed away how long ago that he passed away a ... a ... before he had the exposure and maybe maybe maybe maybe uh fourteen years\nOkay All right I'm while answer your second question and we'll get back to the first question one quick so I I think it's kind of similar to the what we talked about earlier you\nKnow without the husband saying his wife and then the wife kind of says hey check behind the workbench\nAnd he finds the pumpkin there this is an idea where you sort of gather information from the environment\nUm possibly connecting are resonating with his consciousness and communication is is happening in other words he's saying get on with a complete your song those types of things he's giving you the motivation because that's something you need at that point it's like that guy needed to find that pumpkin you needed some motivation\nSo you resonate with the consciousness of your brother and when you resonate with something not just information as well\nUm and the idea you talked about before as far as that unconscious communication between people there's a lot of cases out there like that there is one case in my book that I go over where a I'm a guy wakes up in the middle of the night\nAnd this feeling like a dog is in trouble\nAnd he has this visual operation of a dog laying in the water injured\nYou can't communicate with a dog but he could somehow\nFeel like the dog is trying to communicate with him and had a reading each other's emotions and then you know wakes up because the dog that type of thing so you know why there isn't physical communication or words there is some sort of like I'm understanding or whether you're reading a mind type thing\nWhere do we get the book the gold studies sprint to\nA study at Barnes and
