on brain injury\nAnd or any of these phenomena alright ... in Ninety two I at a closed country and shortly after that I started as a free ... and some of them became so disturbing that I caught it takes me and I used to I haven't really had\nMany brain injuries causing some of these things what do you think\nYes definitely I mean it's also being found in on PBS the post traumatic stress disorder\nLucy John Travolta movie where I think he had a head injury and all of a sudden they use aluminum aged into the paranormal with psychic abilities I think what's that called Michael\nNo wasn't that one did was something else but uh it was a great movie but so you think so that some kind of injury to the brain could augment your psychic abilities\nYes it it could I could open you left to different dimensions because I've I've heard of cases I Know of people who have had near death experiences and then when they recovered they become psychic and they're able to see or as a blow to\nPredict the future and they have all kinds of psychic abilities which they never had before\nNext up let's go to Gary in Monterey, California Hi Jerry go ahead\nHi uh I liked it 'cause I'm a skeptical person and uh I've got to agree to a couple of degrees ...\nAnd I talked to a physics engineering for years so I'm kind of a you know that kind of guy sure however uh I had a dream that seem to come true uh many years ago when I was in my thirties\nAnd a ... and ... says hey that's disturbing and there are fewer space and time\nAh right now it doesn't seem to allow information to flow backward in time so I thought I Would make myself an experimental subject and I tried for a year to a record my dreams\nAnd at first I tried a member of the seventies the portable tape recorders are kind of clunky mhm and uh and to record you'd have to hit two buttons I think like recording play at the same time right right\nYeah so it turns out that was a nightmare like getting up at three in the morning and trying to hit the button so I went back and just writing things down on paper\nAnd of course then the problem is uh\nGetting yourself up out of a drain I figured out a method for that that took me some of the road reliable and one night I had a very unusual dream or it doesn't seem unusual nobody sided but what happened later will be interesting\nAnd what it was the ... is a I was in a situation where I'm sitting with two other people\nAnd we're sitting outside it's some kind of a table\nAnd we're enjoying ourselves having like lunch or something and the one person in the mail and I feel very very close to him and comfortable with him and then there's a woman and I don't know her\nAnd a one point the the nail says uh and we're outside some kind of a format outside I like you know couldn't figure out the map but anyway he says uh a dairy I have to go to the bathroom\nYou know where it is and I said no you know I Do too we were had been drinking a cup of the line I thought I Do too\nAnd so uh he lets go look for and integrating we have to walk up a rock side but some kind of structure outside with all of a couple of steps and then there's another walkway going both ways more cable and then I Would add up a couple of them because like many level\nAnd finally I said oh look a there is the bathroom down there and so I'm walking ahead of them and in the dream\nAnd I get to the door and I pushed to the bathroom door open\nAnd there and I'm trying to not be grossed about this but there I see something unusual and what it was is in rent rooms have toilets of course you know the doors closing and you're a little of both and then they have your old right someone\nHad in urine all gotten number two\nIn other words [laughter] so I stopped in my tracks and and he ran it can be the cellar with my parents\nHe said what are you doing and I said oh ah somebody just because something really awful and hair and he said what he ... them\nAnd uh at that point I had\nA lot of foreign students I taught in college we recruited all over the middle east and\nUh and and the Pacific region Indonesia Japan and a lot of foreign students in my physics classes and so I said well you know maybe it's a person from another culture who didn't understand and you know he thought that was the place to go to the bathroom and you know [noise] okay so I wake up\nAnd I thought that's a weird dream I'm going to write this down in some detail I woke my cell phone okay so that's like on a Monday I'm almost out of time here so I got to push a\nCouple of days

Francisco later this week to either make man uh my wife and I should chip okay so I go to made a mind San Francisco we go to ... where somehow\nWhich is an outdoor place where you sit outside and they
