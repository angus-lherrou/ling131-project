{"month": "10", "state": "MA", "station": "WHYN", "content": "Um to this day the one thing I Wish I had done is make note\nOf the make and model of the ATV and asked them\nHow did you get past the road block how did you get that ATV back onto this road the two girls there's no way they could have lifted any weight and even to adult men that looked like lumberjacks again they look just like the people on the brownie paper towels\nWould have had a hard time picking up a like a four hundred pound ATV and somehow getting it over this huge trench in mound of dirt\nThey looked at me odd they said they were up there scouting areas to hunt the two twin girls in the backseat\nLooked like they were in their Sunday Best church clothes I Can't remember this was a long time ago I Can't remember specifically if they were wearing dresses but I Swear to goodness it looked like they just came out of church they might have been in dress is not what you would expect for going out scouting hunting\nAreas in the rain forest in the woods um\nThey were like blonde hair blue eyes again just like of aliens came down here and said how do we blend in and looked like humans it was like they were too perfect\nNot a flaw not expected dirt know dirt on their face their hair was perfectly comb their clothes I didn't even see a a a single wrinkle the plowed shirts were tucked into their waistline not seem like you would expect out in the woods in the middle of nowhere\nSo they just comment you were looking for a place to go hunting as they're driving by or did they stopped to chat\nThey kind of stopped and chatted they they see me they see me coming down the road and so they hold often they kind of parked a little bit and I I stopped in I I chatted with them probably\nProbably two minutes probably two three minutes of course I was on my way down to the lake and like I said I've got this logical brain that seems to just kind of reason away anything and all these weird events that I've had in my life\nSometimes don't sink in until after the fact and you know I started thinking about it we'll wait a minute how did they even get that ATV onto the road that show [laughter] alone how weird their appearance was I mean I was struck by how odd it was at the time but um\nYou know I just kind of reason to the way that well there are people but\nI tell you up in those woods there'd been some strange strange events uh\nI I called in a while back I talk to you when you talk to the big foot researcher that their records their their sounds it was those sim woods\nWhere I heard this ah ungodly sound that couldn't\nBe any other animal and I don't think are the best opera singer POV raunchy could have imitated the sound and I'd encourage you to find out what coast to coast did with the audio tape they used to play\nIt's a legit big foot recording Chen or more years ago George ... used to play it I think art bell used to play it hasn't been played for years but\nI heard that\nUp in the shame woods it's a unique recording never heard of it before I'm starting to buying more and more to the fact that these big which might be dimensional\nMight have a extraterrestrial connection with the ... that I saw in the woods or more I think about it there's\nI'm Ninety nine point nine percent sure those were not humans and hindsight I'm just glad they didn't take me whatever they were doing up in that area\nWell we're glad to cause a ... you wouldn't have been able to call in presumably thank you Jason for sharing that story that's a that's a pretty

until he played this year sounds like coast to coast they realized that that's what I heard I\nWas up um the Willamette to national forest the love of ill so between um mount bachelor and three sisters in Oregon\nAnd I'm up there a late night watching the stars and hanging out and then they'll likely music stuff sometimes I just kind of hang out more which were quiet and there's nobody around her\nHours up their little went down to looking at stars who binoculars and I heard that same sound that he's talking about as best as I Know what he's talking about um and it at a weird psychic effect I don't know anybody else it had this experience but um it was kind of like hey what are you doing up here you know and and that kind of second guessing but\nOil it's really far away and you know maybe I'm just imagining that and\nSo I kept hanging out look at the stars in about ten minutes and they closed oh I'd say at least three to five miles in maybe ten minutes and it did the same sound again only the the impression or psychic impression on me at all it was like hey I'm coming at you\nI jumped in my car so I got out of there and you know I never really piece together what was you know I'm like Crawford I Will do a lot of reading was one of the coast to coast\nAnd we're the theorists down it was like oh my God that's what it is it you know musicians like listen to
