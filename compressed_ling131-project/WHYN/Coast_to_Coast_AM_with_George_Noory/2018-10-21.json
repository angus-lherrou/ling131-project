Fairbanks as we keep track of the swarming earthquakes\n\nAnd of course we're in the political season this is an interesting poll according to CNN\nAfter the first presidential debate the question was who do you believe to be more honest do or Clinton the answer um Dole over fifty percent Clinton around thirty percent\nSo the people that are saying though is the more honest of the two candidates but then I asked who would you vote for the answer\nDo twenty eight percent Clinton's fifty eight percent now this says something does it not\nAbout the American electorate on the one hand in question one they are asked who is honest and only a third of the people said President Clinton\nBut then they're asked who are they going to vote for and two thirds of the people just about say President Clinton now in my way of thinking this says more about the people surveyed or if you wish to believe it representative the electorate\nThan it does than it does about the candidates\nAsked a buy Newsweek who is the more negative or nasty Dole gets about two thirds fifty nine percent Clinton eleven percent both of them Thirteen percent who has better character to be president\nClinton gets forty eight percent do thirty six percent and ten percent of the people said\nIt makes no difference at all I Am going to make my prediction for the election what I think is going to happen and mostly if I'm right or wrong I haven't done very well with the stock market so there is no reason to believe this will be accurate but here is my prediction for what it's worth\nBill Clinton is going to be reelected if not in a landslide than by grapes margin\nRepublicans will hold Congress no I'm not sure about this one but I Believe and I will predict the Republicans are going to hold Congress by a very slim margin\nThe Senate will remain safely in the hands of the Republicans are within a seat or two at the most\nWithin a year after the election the Clinton Administration is going to in my estimation be buried\nIn scandal so that takes my prediction about a year out from the election I Believe Bill Clinton's going to win Republicans are going to hold on both houses of Congress and that within a year a lot that has been suppressed before the election is going to begin to come out and the president is going to be in trouble\nSomebody sent me a bumper sticker was mark an where mark is um is it simply says if God had wanted us to vote he would have given us candidates\n\nAre a little cynical but it may be mainly ride on\nA model has tried a number of things against Bill Clinton none of which have worked\nTaxes crime\nI'm most recently of tax on the Clintons fundraising activities the foreign donations and so forth and none of it none of it has worked if you look at the polls and here we are under two weeks now\nTill election day they have widened for Bill Clinton not the other way around a you would certainly expect them to be tightening up by now but in indeed they are instead widening and I wonder what you make of that\nNothing Bob Dole has done including the most recent fund raising a allegations and some of those are very serious about liberal\nThe foreign donations all the rest of that four hundred and twenty five thousand dollars from an Indonesian company\nPretty serious allegations really but uh they are not going anywhere in the minds of the public

good night yeah that night she later used to the Rockies you're on the air although\nI was wondering if you could play in the class how\nThe electoral college the electoral college is kind of um\nA way for those who have participated in the party politics of getting a candidate elected 'em to go to Washington and celebrate their victory\nAh and of course they a cast what is more of a ceremonial vote than anything else and generally it follows a what the electorate has done in the popular vote but it's pretty much away for um the people who participated\nYou know at the time to go and celebrate their victory\nSome reason I thought that they left a Taliban were like what you're like OK\nWell there are people who feel that way that it is technically that way but um it's it's really not and they really do follow the electorate and I've heard a lot of people say well you know they could go and do one thing after the electorate has done something else but I've never seen that happen\nOkay so that's the best I can do\nOkay I think yeah right take care west of the Rockies you're on the air hello\nGood morning or good morning a quick little comic anecdote here are on our

landfill mhm and because of the gas underneath and the ground when they turn the water ... flapping above water\nNot good I don't know if that's true or not but that's what I heard another thing right here in Portland somebody has come up with the idea because of the drugs and the young folks they ought to\nA drug test the young folks when they go in for a driver's life Mm and that's okay that's that's fine but why not test everybody if they're gonna test just the young folks\nWell I I I I'll tell you why I I think why I'm it's probably because of the Fourth Amendment in other words they probably figure constitutionally they can get away with it when it's a minor\nBut constitutionally they'd probably a cannot get away with it when it's a um somebody who's a ... or you know become Twenty one age of consent is that oh that's just a guess\nOkay well it just seemed unfair to me or that they would do it to the young folks and not others because there's a lot of young adult that\nWell I've got All right let me try this out on you if they were to test everybody everybody went to get a driver's license how many drivers percentage wise do you think would immediately be off

I I'm Amazed and\nEspecially listening to some of the yeah the ... I mean the variety of things that you uh play in the back backwards talking that that\nWill serve man does not live by politics alone at least I don't and talk radio across America right now is almost in you know unless you're a doctor so and so I'm hoping people out with their emotional problems otherwise a talk radio is all politics all the time it's either going to have to change\nOr as the leading format in America it's going to die out\nWell I you know I think\nI think you've made a really good point there as well and uh I'm I've been\nHoping that you know I've I've been kind of apathetic about it because it's like a a fish fry she just got through saying what what do we have to choose from and what do we have to choose from there and\nIt is not a good choice is yours there\nThere's no choice and I was thinking about Nicaragua little Nicaragua I've I've been all through Latin America I used to live in a Central America and uh you know like all the place banana republic but they're really quite advanced tie literacy rate very politically minded\nAt twenty three presidential candidates in Nicaragua right and a very close election monitored all computerized yup ... very well done very very well done I was there and let's see I was there in Nineteen Seventy\nNine July when the Sandinistas took over the government and I was in the capital and then I was there\n... ... right out of high school oh man that must be really done something\nYeah two of my buddies taking a trip down to South America in our uh ...\nYou Asian getaway trip kind of thing you know\nAnd you went to Nicaragua winner take it to go [laughter] yeah well we didn't know that was going on and I understand all ethically aware now I understand Nicaragua just looked like a nice place to visit\nWhile I was part of the itinerary down to why not ... well destination\nTo their benefit they did not return Mr or did I get a power thank goodness that\nYou know what was really amazing was we we were airlifted back by the American embassy they took sure a lot of people they took us back out too I'm sure ... we we had an airbase there are ... or something going on and ... before we started helping the country's later but uh anyway they um\nI noticed in a photo that I saw in a in a print and uh but I'm pretty article ah what do you have to buy a newspaper down there they had um you know that's such a model who became the president\nUm she wrote in town and the victory procession alongside of Daniel Ortega\nYou that's right I recall that thank you are very much for the call I recall that and uh the elections or in Nicaragua are definitely a bright spot if we can just do something about ah Cuba\nOr the world will indeed in many ways to be a better place east of the Rockies you're on the air hello\nGood morning good morning how are you there I Am fine uh my name's Kevin I'm calling from la fountain Indiana Yes sir about the cats in Australia yes uh\n\nI Believe about a year ago um did they not try to get rid of the rabbits in Australia correct okay I've I was thinking they they they were trying to do that\nYou know they like designer viruses down there\nI see [noise] um there's one thing that a person has to remember amount to voting for a for a do or Clinton this year what's that um\nClinton or as approving judges for um you know he's already appointed more judges and has a first term than Reagan ever did both terms that he was elected and he's got a lot more judges to a point\nWhere you know I Would say that what you're raising is a good and valid point except for the fact that if you look at the appointments that required congressional approval ones that were made by Clinton and required approval of the Senate or almost inevitably a just like rubber stamps or they were approved\nYes I I realize that I I I Would just uh for some reason with thing to do with that I have a little bit more conservative or a thinking on when when he goes to a point these judges then went to\nWell I Would certainly like to think so but the record would be that he helped confirm those that were sent to him by President Clinton so why would you think that his appointments would have a a ... would necessarily uh be\nYou know I think both of them are going to be forced if there is a Republican House as there is now a no matter who would get in to force people in excuse me to appoint people pretty much in the middle no matter who gets in\nMhm maybe I'm wrong I don't think so well I just thought I'd throw that out at at the people out there know as I

actually wanted to mention a turning the election our favorite subject yes [laughter]\nWell it's bearing down on us you know we're less than two weeks away now\nYes that's true\nI happen to hear that a little bit of your program with the to the gentleman from the Libertarian Party\nYes in the uh the taxpayers Marty right and\nAnd uh I didn't happen here if either one of them are veterans anything about a a treaty that to Clinton has entered into with the United nations\nMm well the United nations was mentioned I don't think specific treaties\nYeah uh there there too that um I don't think most people are very aware of of mostly because the media doesn't talk about them than Clinton really doesn't talk about but there's two treaty that particular a treaty on the rights of the child and the other one that's on biodiversity\nYou're actually treaties are not something that Clinton or any other president can just entered into right treaties require ratification by two thirds of the Senate if they are highly treaties\nExactly and probably the reason they haven't been ratified is because we've had Republicans in there that have been keeping a check and balance on things\nYes and if we're smart we will keep Republicans in there\nAbsolutely that's that's the thing I'm hoping for that at least if Clinton is reelected a\nI'm a realist and I I Do believe he is going to be reelected I'm I'm not here to be a cheerleader I'm reading the tea leaves the way I think they're dropping and so I my feeling now is to concentrate on keeping the checks and balances in place\nAbsolutely uh I I Would be interested in and people uh comedy if they have heard anything about the uh the ticket or a treaty by\nEither trying to uh you know get more information about myself but when you uh delved into them and find out what they really say uh you know they're going to pay\nPoverty against the United states completely away\nAll right well let's see what we can find out from the audience aren't\nHome

Martin\nYeah that was very very chilling and very fascinating I think\nHe was right on on about a lot of stuff on when you ask them about the anti Christ and all that I was really my radio started fate and really bad in and out when they started to answer that question started banging on my radio on everything really yeah said oh no I Want to hear this park because that was a really good question and the\n[noise]\nWest of the Rockies you're on there\nAre a icon you one day last week and I was a man\nOn the subject of reincarnation and I got the impression you didn't want to talk about it\nWhile I'm pleased to talk about oh well I'm\nA I I Wonder if you would get a guest on who would be opposed to it and you said you were going to have their priests on friday\nNoon to the whole program it never came up the subject of reincarnation\nOh I see well I Would have been obvious so I mean he was a Catholic priest\nAh well I Wonder yeah but I think there are pros and cons to the subject and I would like to hear somebody um has the argument against it\nI don't want to excuse me what why don't you go to make some now what do you think okay\nThe people who believe in it they say that we keep reincarnate ing and ... and coming back because they said that's the way we learn yes\nIf you remember they always say that they say that's how we learn yes and yet on the program friday night you and the priest both agreed that that we are a lot I don't know if you remember that but\nMy aunt remembered clearly\nYeah well if if we keep reincarnate and to come back to learn at issue I think we would find our way by now we would not be alive\nAnd well in other words we would become wiser in wiser in ...\nWhich is that we're getting dumber and dumber and dumber and and now\nThere's another problem with the reincarnation and that is that there are constantly more people on the earth in other words yeah more souls yeah right so maybe um those who are learning and becoming wise or because of reincarnation if it does exist are being an effect out voted by the ... coming along who don't know a damn thing\nI Do know that I like now when\nYou first came on this radio station when you left the station I remember hearing you say that you intended to have a masters then guess and I don't know maybe you changed your mind but I Would like to hear him talk about it\nFor no I haven't changed my mind at all I had the rolling several times as you know\nOh and then I must admit I hear you I I doubt mission program but I I never heard him on your program\nOh mine oh no I'm well then you must not catch 'em all well ...

Do I Do uh because I I personally am in a foul mood for actually weeks following April fifteenth oh yeah\nI I'm determined that or I Will not pay my taxes until that final day I hold onto it all the name here you know for as long as I can why should they get interest when I can get it that's right and then when I have to sit down and I have to write the check I'm I'm really angry for a while oh yeah and then I forget\nYeah it just makes too much lever happened\nThat's correct they're not they're not fools\nYou have a good they are or\nWhat you too sir thanks for cheering me up\nThat's right if they hold the elections the first Tuesday after April fifteenth it'd be it'd be a whole different tune out there when it but they're not that don't they're not going to do that they know that we have short memories relatively short now when I'm forced to think about it I recall my anger and I'm sure you can do\nBut it doesn't last doesn't you forget and if they weren't checking it from you in

occur\nOccurred when the Supreme Court quit hearing any cases on it well\nI'll tell you something it it may be well that they're not hearing cases on it because they're a maybe a case\nTo suggest that it would be a state's rights issue and that the Supreme Court ah would say the second amendment only applies state by state or I once asked I interviewed judge Bork and that's what he said that's what he said he believed\nIt could be the tenth amendment does give us that [noise]\nSo I wouldn't be too much of a hurry especially in the present climate\n\nBut for for the last three years the Supreme Court has refused to hear any case on the second amendment\nThat's what I said you may you probably ought to be saying thank you because that leaves it in a gray area if it goes to the court that could be it\nYeah [noise] a on a lighter note at that conference call you had the other day with a with a oh two or three people um that was that was really fascinating what what are you referring to all of the uh the conference call with um I was trying to think about the permits and everything\nOh yes yes yes yes oh uh you mean the Graham Hancock Robert Duvall a Richard ... extravaganza\nOh that was that was fantastic well\nUh it was a lot of people miss understood it was such a critical important thing that was actually being argued they thought we should have done the show on what might have been under this things are in the ... or whatever but what was being argued was near term extremely important\nAnd um so a lot some people were disappointed they well they want to talk about what was in there or not the politics of what was going to be done to get in there but it's so uh right on top of is that it was an important argument very important\nWell I tell you one of my problem I Would\nI taped major game the other night right and I had an Ninety minute tape and the thing right and at the very end of the tape\nYou had asked him about that you have a ... and also the strange

said\nNo I I Can't you can't know\nOut here [laughter] well I'm\nI'm getting I really could I shouldn't because I don't want to get it wrong um I remember indeed these strange ah animals in Egypt and I think when I asked him was\nIs there going to be more of this more mutant animals deformed animals uh-huh uh any he said Oh yes basically he said yes so all the signs were seeing the mutated frogs

them in late ...\nAnd his article Houdini afterlife experiment did it work Thomas resentful welcome to the coast to coast am how are you I'm well Richard thanks for having me on my pleasure\nLet's talk about Harry Houdini ease\nUm how should we described his I mean he was not just a skeptic of after death communication he was an of vowed to bunker and I don't even think that is saying it strongly enough I mean he there was almost a hatred of for\nThese people that he considered to be frauds where did that he knew why did that happen how to come about\nThat that's a very interesting place to start 'em because you're absolutely right I mean\nHe wrote two books as you mentioned and he really um\nHe um was not just on the side he his mother died in Nineteen Thirteen and at that point he tried to get in touch with her through some psychic but he could tell they were all faking what they were doing and so um\nThat kind of got him going and so he has an excellent magician he was able to replicate some of the things that these fake mediums would do\nSo he was always looking for that and actually I think this is\nUltimately got him killed because I think that the people these fake psychics we're talking amongst themselves and I think they want it to refer them up a little bit I don't think they wanted to kill him\nBut I think they wanted to say back off men we don't get in your way get out of our way and I think they might have spent some money to get that um that young student who had done the boxing team\nTo punch him in the stomach which was a trick he did in public\nAnd as you know Richard he he would pick someone out of the crowd pick someone like you or me you know right in there and have them come up to the stage and he would make his muscles ready and he would be ready for that\nBut this time with this guy came backstage and Harry wasn't expecting it at all his muscles aren't from this guy really late into him and the trauma in his abdomen was so intense that um you know you had those problems and his appendix burst and this is why he passed away\nRight and and had he had he gone to the doctor immediately to receive a medical\nUh help he probably would've lived but always the showman he the show must go on and he went on and he performed or four or five more shows and and then finally collapsed in Detroit\nYes he was doing little tiny handkerchief magic 'cause that was all he had the strength for 'em but one other point I on this subject about these fake medium he would send his assistance out and they would find\nPeople and they would see the show and he would find a point in time where the show could be busted so to speak\nAnd he would even get the guy that was in control of the light and on the deal and Harry would show up with a photographer and the newspaper Harry would be wearing a disguise\nThe magician would be in the middle of his you know they say on the weather would ever where the hidden string making something fly to the sky or whatever and the lights would come up and the photographer would take a picture and and the you know the fake media would be totally surprising you and he'd say I'm Harry Houdini him to pull off his mask and\nSo these guys are very upset\nFascinating I I had not heard the the theory that perhaps some of these a cabal of of disgruntled psychics mediums had put this young student at McGill University up to the task of of ah yeah this writing on beating on Harry right into\nMy that's my own idea I haven't heard it from anyone else um it seems to make sense a few phone calls hey you know I mean so I had nothing on Henry you know I mean he didn't have any kind of reason to go there or do anything right right I thought it would just\nI just wanted to ask you about briefly about a circus or Arthur Conan Doyle because they were area and and he were were good friends and yet a door oil was a prominent spiritual is so how did that\nHow did that friendship survive or the fact that Harry was such an avowed do bunker didn't have time for spiritual is and yet he's good friend and his wife were both very much into spiritualism movement\nYes yes the spirit was movement is not exactly out in the fine in some kind of permanent structure you know you can't say there is a leader but a lot of people did look to the oil as the leader of the spiritual as\nA matter of friendship

H. Y.

of years after the say on\nHe was in a really bad car accident he was with his ... eyes car accident and his healing processes aided by pain killers and some of this is a morphine and he becomes addicted to more than a need for the rest of his life has morphine and alcohol problems\nAnd I think this might have affected his ability to function as a psychic and much later you know the end of his life and I'm Sorry I don't have the dates on this he was involved in a very high profile said on 'em with pike that's the name that comes to\nMy old James Pike up yes he was up here on on I'm In Canada upon are now a Canadian National television other Canadian connection yeah\nYeah and I think it and I'm looking at it now Nineteen sixty seven for how a say on for pike now pike son had tragically committed suicide\nThe year before now what Ford did for this high profile say on what he did with all the secrets of the three is the only thing that\nYou kind of breaking up a sign on us Thomas ah I'm not sure if it's a cordless phone or a cell phone but maybe if you keep very still speak maybe OK\nI'm area it's actually a voice over I T line and sometimes it does break up is that a little better it is\nOkay um the James Pike this was the ... an Episcopal bishop his son had committed suicide a year earlier and now Ford is doing a say on on Canadian TV\nYes and and he does a little upfront research brings it into the sand says if he's getting it in a psychic way whereas in fact he got it from the conventional way this was discovered after four died and people went to his papers\nAnd found his research preparing for the ... and that's why people say this\nSo this is another black mark against or if they're bored and it's again muddy the water so this case Houdini case\nAs fun as it is and is exciting it is it it's not going to be the first to break through convince all the hard nose skeptics who just isn't\nBut but okay so Ford is discredited because of the sands in Canada in Nineteen sixty seven but as you point out he had been taking morphine he had been drinking has a perhaps that had damaged his a medium Mm abilities does that\nSara Lee discredit the work that he did on on the Houdini case\nYeah yes that's the way I see it and it does or doesn't I I just it it it puts a cloud over it but it doesn't necessarily directly bear on it\nNow despite best is a re catching and you know saying no I I don't\nBelieve that Harry communicated with me nor Cody then why did she continue to do these ... high profile public say ounces on the anniversary of Harry's death for the next ten years\n[noise] um she did it for ten years after his death but she didn't start them until a couple of years into that so she did about seven of them as my count\nBut the point is still well taken and here's the way I look at it when she was with Harry um she would be on stage at times and Harry was the one in the spotlight but when Harry dies she's in the spotlight but she doesn't have anything to do\nYou know and so all of a sudden she's in an unusual place and so by stepping into the spotlight only once a year for one night to do the\nFan and I think the last one was in LA I'm On the top of a building you know the first they were going to do it down in the building but then they said let's just step on the top where we'll be higher closer to God and the spirit\nAnyway I think she knew these were going to be a failure because she was the one that was acting as the medium and she's not a medium so he's pretty much guaranteed they're going to fail\nSo she can say that statement at the end you know and yours is long enough to wait for any man and and that kind of thing and it kind of makes it safe\nFor her to say well I tried I open minded I tried but it didn't work and so I'm going to go back with my friends and embrace the standard mainstream believe\nBut your inclined to believe that the original statement released in the New York times in Nineteen twenty nine affirming that she had been contacted through a Arthur Ford has been contacted by her beloved Harry that that\nThat quite possibly happened\nYes yes I Do in the other letter that you wrote to wind chill is also it has a fair amount of passion to it she's very strong you know and so I'm now someone who would say well if she was trick and didn't know she was tricked she would still feel very strongly so I'm I'm open minded to that comment to\nYou you finish the essay with a I don't know if you have in front of you if you could share with is the final words of Harry Houdini as brought forth by Fletcher and Ford Flex your being the spirit guide and for it at the end of that successful session can you share those words as we head into the break cheer\n'em and

Mussolini at first it was an author of Mussolini so Mussolini actually started the whole thing but you know again I'm history books being what they are that tends to be a little lost\nUm [noise] so America gets into the war Britain is getting pulverized uh being bombed at night for more than a month every night\nUm people are taking shelter in the tubes in the book I have a first hand account of that I actually my great aunt is still alive she lived through it through the ... bombings in Birmingham she watched the city's burn 'em every inch of entry in in Birmingham a very interesting stuff\nSo um that was really neat that I have that personal contact with with her and she's still alive and doing well by the way\nUm anyway uh we get into the war and we're we don't have anything to do was down at the moment we're just trying to help Churchill and because they were really they have no people have no idea according to my end it was there how close\nEngland came to losing their island they were lined up on the other side of the day being the Germans were lined up on the other side of the English Channel and this was what their MO was they used to go and later on airstrikes\nBomb them into oblivion and then just paper on your ground troops over and it worked exceedingly well especially with France and they thought the same thing was going to work in a in in Britain that of course it didn't because of you know church does resolve a and you know of course so we're going to the war\nAnd now we're there to help out Churchill\nSo we're talking amongst ourselves now working hand in glove with a with the Brits now all of a sudden we get the rainy idea to bring styling into the war and Churchill loses his mind he hates style and doesn't want anything to do with them never trust them\nI'm of course to admit previously and I'm Churchill really masterminded the whole thing to be honest with you Churchill was the one who gather together but he he just pay the fact that the Americans because they were so similar to the time\nThat style and in America and the American president FDR were working in unison on this it was great for the war it was bad for the world\nBecause Stalin was a temporary ally he had his eye completely on the post war world he knew that after the war we weren't going to be from\nSo you know the answer your question around about fashion um Churchill like it for the war hated it for the world and I don't know if he completely trusted that FDR wasn't going to become a small one only a less aggressive one\nWell at this point was FDR still a a huge fan of style needs to say that they called them uncle Joe\nOh yeah absolutely absolutely it was a there was of course you have to understand\nWe weren't getting things from Russia we didn't know much about the rape birds I think of FDR had known about the butchery and everything going on and he wouldn't have been as fan but of course we weren't getting that\nUntil decades and decades later\nRight in the New York times wherever they were writing glowing a pieces about uncle Joe and how wonderful sure communism emotion that\nThere's still a communist newspaper as far as I'm concerned and you know um they're right down the street from the the Communist Party of the United states of America so\nYou know I mean they're still carrying their faces a ... billion\nFDR it seemed a ... and reading a book that FDR was very anxious to get a face to face with Allen I don't know if this was because he admired him or that he was burned and Stalin was playing a little hard to get\nStoned and need us\nWe need it's balanced island in the U.S\nIt was already\nKnow when when the Nazis started to hit a pact with style and of course we know as Hitler and it's and spelling hit a pack well ill or violated the pack and went after style in which completely blue silence mine\nAnd they were on the march to Moscow and they were doing good doing well with this march and then you know it was ego took over and he\nDecided he was going to go to Stalingrad because it held his namesake so now it was leading under the illusion right now that he's unstoppable is completely unstoppable so\nOf course we didn't know anything about Hillary's drug habit at the time he was on like thirty some odd different drugs so he was such a delusional dictator at the at this time he thinks he's completely unstoppable so he decides to switch course midstream and go towards styling read\nUm meanwhile the weather is changing a winter is following the Germans are ill equipped and he'll close to do this it doesn't matter you know his generals are coming back saying it's a suicide mission and Hillary says well I don't care I Want it will do it so\nStalin is already beating him or he doesn't need us\nSo Hitler has he has he ever ... he has the opportunity to play a little a little hard to get in he certainly was so when we really had to go begging it is it's down on the table and which they get this done\nRight so there was a conference in Casablanca and and then later to Iran I think in a\nWas terrain in Nineteen forty three and a gang member forty three correct they have even at this point they have their eye it sort of carving up the post war world a instill at this point you know I I think teachers Roosevelt still looks pretty robust\nOr you know he you know by by standard to Nineteen forties he was an older guy by today's standards he was only like sixty years old we tend to think of him and you know in our mind that he was like eighty but he was in was relatively young guy um\nHe looked pretty healthy even in in Nineteen forty three um but I Want to back up with a minute and talk about the assassination squads [laughter] you know we're sending over the United states because I didn't know about this until I read your book\nAnd there you go um he's send all of these people home with literature and propaganda as to how they can transform their country maybe our country and to this wonderful new ideology they didn't know anything about evil employers\nYou know in the new deal you gotta cut Roosevelt will get a break here should never been done before\nSo this was an experiment in amongst itself so there's a lot going on here there's a lot of the backdoor dealings in spring party by stone stone is the puppet master the uh he's this guy wouldn't you managed to accomplish\nWith his wife was incredible it was one of the six original members of the votes of the revolution and he ended up there just to make fun of stone\nHe was nothing more than a used to keep the party journals are used to call them um ribs or was it on hundred index card it was the going rate we're used to make fun of them because he was just so worthless when the party\nOne by one he knocked off every one of the party control I mean the guy was it was just incredible ... what a ruthless megalomaniac this guy was\nStanding stop I'm I'm sort of Lenin wrote the un quote from one of his will I'm rich donors to root too dangerous remove him\nAnd after ... death they they called him a you know a pencil pusher and all kinds of stupid things\nMurder I gotta I gotta jump in here Steve will take a timeout Wilson it get taking us into the break with everybody needs somebody and then more on who murdered FDR stay with us here in coast to coast them
