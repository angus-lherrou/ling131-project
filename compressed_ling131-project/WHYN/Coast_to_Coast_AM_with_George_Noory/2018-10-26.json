California is astronomy professor Michael Brown\nOr predictions are that the planet is in the region of the sky\nClose to the constellation Orion which is one that everybody knows the constellation of Orion is a winter constellation that's when it's up in the sky that's when you can observe it most to we have to wait until the constellations up until the winter before we can start looking to where we think it is\nAnd in November what date will you start to remember first\nThat's not very far away what frequencies will you be looking in\nThe best way to search for this is actually just a visible wavelengths just like your eyes because so far as the brightest part that we think it's going to have is just the sunlight reflected off of its upper atmosphere and so we're just going to look right at what you would see just taking pictures with ... what about him for rent\nInfrared is actually is not going to be a very good one for searching simply because\nWe don't have any telescopes with really massive infrared detectors that can look at big areas of the sky at once once we find planet nine looking at it in the in for a study of will be very important but it's not probably the best way to look for it\nIsn't it amazing that all of this impact on the solar system perturbations and even tilting the playing of the solar system six degrees to the sun that he would be caused by an object out in the ... cloud that we can't even see yet\nYeah I think it's pretty fun to think about it we just don't know where to look it it'll be easy to see once we know exactly where to look I suspect that men once we see it then we will study it in detail with probably you know every large telescope on the earth will suddenly swing in that direction so it would be quite exciting when it's finally found\nThis new planet nine is hypothesized to be five thousand times more massive than Pluto that you've got knocked down to a dwarf planet\nYeah so it's a good reminder of the difference between things that are not real planets like Pluto and real planets sometimes people say oh this new planet nine it's just a little bit bigger than Pluto right and like no no no\nIt's five thousand times more massive [laughter] this is what we mean when we say a planet in the outer part of the solar system\nWhen we last talked I think you had two categories of where my does have come from why is this massive object all the way out to the edge of the type about going into the your cloud\nAnd you talked about possibly being captured rogue planet or that he was inside of our solar system where Neptune and urine is our but then he got knocked out by Saturn or Jupiter what do you think today\nI still favor the explanation that it came from inside our solar system and got knocked out by Jupiter Saturn but into we find it and know exactly what its orbit isn't exactly what the composition of\nAll of this was just speculation you can probably come up with many different ideas to explain how I got there but once you find it I Hope will really start to learn why it's there and what it's made out of\nYou've been living with just now for three years do you have any sort of intuitive sense of what you could look like\nMy best guess is that it will look sort of like Neptune we think it's a Neptune like planet just a little bit less massive than up tuned into it will be a gaseous atmosphere\nIt probably won't have clones it's probably too cold to have any clouds up in the atmosphere so in fact it might be quite bland a mostly just kind of\nGrayish white atmosphere with no features in it but it's easy to speculate that we're almost always surprised when we find real objects and so the one thing but I Know for sure is that there will be things about it that we never even thought about that are completely surprising\nExactly how far from earth to where you think this object is\nWe think is about five hundred times further distance than the distance from the earth to the sun so that puts it at something like twenty times further than Neptune for example so it's a good ways out there\nAnd use that a quarter of a light year\nOh no it's not even close to a quarter lightly it's about two and a half light days\nTwo and a half light days from earth is that the border between the ... rebels and the ... cloud\nWell that's actually really good question to which we now don't know the answer before we realize that there's a planet out there we thought we knew about the border but now that there's a planet where that border we thought was now we're less sure because we don't know what is beyond the planet and we don't quite yet know how that planet is affecting what this border is\nOkay we can do that too but it's a great story and it's really exciting that even if\nHe doesn't agree in some of the theories that are out there the fact that there's this extra planted out there does echo what some of these people have said long before anybody even knew about this stuff\nWell the idea that there could be a math planet but when you read like say about the ... through scholar I'm In the translation that we're a card in there and you look at the

example\nThe extra days of temperatures above ... degrees Fahrenheit by the end of this century for Miami Seventy eight more days from Miami isn't already underwater\nSo what was something like a one hundred events can become as often as every other year and so these really extreme floods extreme heat they become much more common in the future and can have devastating consequences\nRight now what are computer models showing do you do is have you worked on the eye BCC report\nAbout what we can expect say in North America in just the next decade because we've already reached another half degree warmer and it's projected that we may go up to two\nIt could be substantially worse than even those the estimates\nBut the politics of the planet don't seem to be supporting dramatic reduction in the greenhouse gases in fact it seems that some of the larger nations the United states included\nMy adding coal now to an industry that we thought had ended\nThat we are going to be contributing ourselves to increasing amounts of greenhouse gases and accelerating the amount of warming so that we would be ourselves pushing the needle on the computer models in which there is even more rapid warming\nUnfortunately you put your finger on it my guess\nIs that the politicians assumed that the problems will only become more severe once they're out of office and so if they are thinking of the next two to four to six years which is where most of the political offices\nThan they are assuming that they can cope with\nThat shorter period of time and it will be somebody else's problem or two decades ago\nMeanwhile we're facing the fact that there will probably be be eat a lot of people who are going to be forced out of homes and houses and what is the United states in the world going to do with what has to be future migrations away from coastline\nCertainly there will be in fact already are places that are having to be abandoned votes on the east coast around the Alaska due to rising sea levels and that will only continue to get worse we will have an increasing number of domestic migrants\nBut it's really the developing countries where their farm or people susceptible where they're likely to be enormous numbers affected by the level Roger I'm forced to migrate as their\nCities become habitable and that's really one of the things that the report highlights where you get\n... votes which migrants at one point five degrees but you had many tens of additional climate refugees as you grow up to two degrees\nAnd that will be a problem for all the wealthy countries because naturally want to go somewhere where there are better prospects and so I think we can expect North America and Europe and parts of Asia to see lots of migrants coming from low latitudes\nAnd in fact I think we've already been seeing that in Europe that's part of the reasons for the Syrian civil war and ... all of the migrants that were coming up to Europe after that which led to a lot of the crises fair\nSo doesn't that mean that there could be a tremendous amount of civil strife and wars over at the migration of people away from post\nBut at least has been something that has been identified by loss of American officials in the defense department and in the Central Intelligence agency\nDuring the Obama administration's climate change was considered a major threat multiplier and driver of probable future conflicts and again there's kind of a hit in the sand mentality has taken root now in Washington which seems to pretend that this doesn't exist\nBut this was widely acknowledged in the defense community as we show it was for years ago\nTo global climate change and increasing more could definitely bring more wars yes\nThere you go ... well it it's a terrible future if we can get this under control and one of the big headline the summer of twenty Eighteen million Florida home may see sea level rise flooding\nOver the next the rest of the century and in fact it is so bad that all the forty eight continental US state\nFlorida now has the most property at risk a study finds that three hundred and fifty one billion dollars worth of homes will be risking persistent title flooding\nThe researchers say if that global warming and sea level rise does continue that in more than one million properties in Florida will have chronic flooding and that when you look at the map\nAs it is extended by computers over the rest of the century\nThat sea level rise which is already one of the big secret uh kept in Miami by the political institution there\nIs it they get flooding constantly on full moon it constantly flooding on high tides they get constantly\nFlooding all over the time and everybody who live there now is it and that political governments and mirrors saying we're not going to let anybody know that we have flooding in the streets of Miami is nonsense\nThey've got to take the bull by the horns and deal with it\nAnd as you look at the map uh knowing that the Arctic\nOr had melted two to three times faster than the computer projection well George when you look at the map of what is expected to happen to Florida over the Next Fifty years and know that\nWhat happened with the Arctic was two to three times faster\nIf Florida had water flooding let's say three times faster than the current computer that projection that I mean that most

November aide twenty seven teen I did my first earth files YouTube channel broadcasts\nAnd since then on most Wednesday evening's beginning at seven thirty PM mountain and another time zones around the country in the world I've been in my office where I'm Talking to you tonight\nIn front of this computer to share news with the general audience that is growing around the world for my work and they like uh my YouTube channel well just a three weeks ago and October third\nI was doing updates on three categories the first had to do with the very distressing subject of half cats be headed cats around the world bloodless weird and Scotland Yard trying to\nGet away with announcing that it was closing down its investigations after three years because they were trying to force people to\nBelieve that it was Fox is in a car road kill\nAnd that wasn't going over well with the u._k. population at all and then I was also doing an update about the sunspots solar observatory shut down I had a received a whistle blower email saying that are actually\nUh the child pornography was just funny deflection that he actually involved the Chinese infiltrate or who\nHad hacked into the observatories computers in order to spy on the sensitive white sands missile range in Holland an air force base a that's down below this solar observatories nine thousand two hundred foot peak\nAnd then the third update had evolved from my asking my profiles YouTube channel audience on September twelfth anyone had young childhood memories of floating out of body\nSpecifically I was asking for ages four to six approximately and I had received a huge number of emails and a lot of people were saying they never told anyone this before and this is what I was talking about\nWhen the next\nMorning on October fourth Laurie Moriarty who manages my are filed social media emailed me that a fan saw something weird happened in the video of the a stream the live stream so I saw a video that Laurie sent me\nThat was slowed down it was weird or I sent the puzzle to a photo shop at video analysts I've worked with for years\nAt first I thought maybe it was an insect was over on a ... like something coming through the window up to the top of a book show\nAnd he did a video loop that you can see right now all of this at\nA my earth files report what are the smoky fog sometimes linked to afterlife returns you can see the whole story and you can see these videos which are really strange and the reply that I got back from the photo shop analyst was\nThat he thinks this is truly anonymous and uh then I asked a that\nSecond week I asked my earth files YouTube channel audience if anyone had ever seen smoky fog like what was in my office and believe it or not\nA second I'm One of these whatever they are came between my hands and up to my right shoulder on October seventeenth adding to the mystery of what is coming in and out of my office and uh people began writing me\nEmails about their own experiences with the smoky fog is it like ... I Do not know this is the extremely a translucent and uh when I started reading the letters\nI began to see how heart felt that there were people who were\nTelling me they had never mentioned any of this parrot to loved ones the children to parent none ... but but I started receiving these emails and one\nCame from a a he had been a retired airline ticket agent and his name he gave me permission to use is Charles hazard\nAnd he uh let me say he said you can use my name and that I'm now from Sun City center Florida but what you're going to hear took place in Arkansas in two thousand and eight\nThinking about all of this is provoked\nBy two episodes of a strange smoky fog in my office when I was working in live stream and that's what provoked him and hear now is Charles hazard of talking about\nWhat happened to him in two thousand and eight from his now Sun City center Florida home\nThis was in the spring of two thousand in age and I was preparing that morning for a group to come in the next day I was mowing the lawn string the camp area on a riding mower and cleaning up the facility things of that nature\nSo at the end of the day after dinner I was ready to go to bed as soon as the sun went down and very tired\nSo after shower and I got into bed it was dark by that time I Can't remember about what time it was maybe eight thirty in the evening\nI got into bed with the poverty level my show and just lay there and looked outside that leaves on the trees were not fully out yet so I had a very good view of the night sky with new stars that I can see and then suddenly I just\nI was getting ready to close my eyes and suddenly I opened them again\nAnd through the window I can see the misty great ball drifting in through the window\nAnd I was just mesmerized but the thing about it was that in this dark bedroom was luminous and I could see the light within it and it was three dimensional was swirling in slowly kept coming towards me it looked like it was coming right through my head\nAnd I was just raising the fascination that I didn't know what to think and then as it reached my forehead I could see in my mind's eye three dimensional lighted hiring left passing by my field of vision\nI was mesmerized by these hiring lives and\nThe feeling that I was getting was feeling of euphoria and one is with the living thing that was surrounding made and then\nAt the same moment everything was happening at the same time at the same time I was getting all this information that was almost like answers to questions that haven't been asked out millennia\nAnd they were all be answered at the same time like all of these answers becoming I wasn't asking the questions they were just coming to me and be answered simultaneously and I don't know why this was happening I was just going with it\nI don't even know how long this lasted it could have been just a moment but it seemed to go on forever and I didn't want it to end because of the feeling was so loving\nCan you describe the shape of the ... that you remember vividly and try to give us an impression of what kind of information was coming to you and was it like a word voice in your head tell them possibly\nKnow there were no word there was no sound\nThe hiring glitz we're almost like God was looking straight ahead and they were coming towards me and then going past the side of my head and I could see peripherally these hiring glass but they had the same texture of the fog good would shadow in life\nBut they were living minutes at the same time and they were just float by me but kind of move at the same time like they were walking back and forth as they were passing by my head\nAnd as far as the information I was getting it was just almost like a download information\nThat was so quick that I was not able to grasp anything that was being given to me it was just a feeling that I was getting it was almost like I knew every answer to every question like I was\nThe super human genius or something that had all the answers to everything in the universe\nWas indescribable it's really difficult to explain it felt like to me it wasn't for now at that moment it was for something that was being given to me\nBut I wouldn't remember any of it afterwards but it was for some time in the future that I was supposed to recall this information because it was like it would be given to me but I couldn't decipher it\nDo you have do any sub text in your mind or your\nSoul about who would be doing this and why for the future\nNo the only thing I couldn't think of was that it may because of my past experience with ever since I was a child I've had psychic dreams dreams of having relationships with an entity\nOr something that is going to now it's like what Charles hazard when he was saying I feel like it has to do with the rotation of the earth that they're going to be like a shift or a joke\nOn that it would cause the nominees in tremendous amounts of flooding\nAnd I had now several emails I'm going to be doing stories on them\nAbout exactly this kind of thing and raising the question could there be a natural range cycle interacting with planets in our solar system that could relate to know what that is written about in genesis\nAnd that is how woven and a complex\nAll seem to be going that every single question is leading to answer that people are raising more issues\nAnd scientists are also coming forward and saying that they have information about this and so tonight if there's anybody listening on ...\nIf you are in the military

only tell you what I saw I Can't explain it all or whatever\nAs we're talking in October twenty Eighteen what do you think today at age fifty seven\n[laughter] I think it's obvious that our government isn't telling the truth about a lot of things and I think that all of this stuff you know I've never seen aliens per se meeting the grave or any of them but\nI think is pretty credible now because you have the Internet and people post than flying craft wind cue stuff that don't fly is flying with no moving parts and I think our government knows\nLot way more than what they're telling us in a big it all goes together UFOs though what the government is doing\nAnd that all of the ancient history having to do with religious figures could be advanced technology being used by advanced intelligence is in this Cosmo\nExactly where it really is extraterrestrial whatever you want to you they don't want to tell you about it and so many people are being punished because it's something that they

the three being also associated with the first one uh were all killed\nBy homo sapiens\nWhat is the truth\nReligious history a political history scientific history\nAnd the possibility that the avatar of history have actually been time travel or trying to help us or to help the solar system not being understood at all and that one of the problem and evolving\nAnd the evolution of homo sapiens has been that we weren't given truth\nLA got down on our knees\nTo entities in front of a who pretended to be or claimed to be God\nAnd they were never God and now we're back around in another cycle and twenty eight and going forward the war is going to be formed in like twenty twenty according to administration\nAnd what is ... or being formed in such a rapid way what is coming where are we

if we're going to have I'm caught but uh it's a fun holiday and I let the kids\nUh but uh it it sort of thing the thing\nAnd the night and tonight I've been trying to share some of the more serious slices related\nTo the issue of what might come back into this dimensional existence a after a death of sort of an afterlife\nI Would like to share with you and our coast audience an example of one of the many emails that I have been getting tonight and this is an indication\nTo the quality and the heart felt and the profound emails that I had been receiving these various categories having to do with out of body or what the fog is and here I Want to read this came just a few minutes ago\nListening to a coast to coast while writing this my father was very involved with World War two Pearl Harbor Hawaii survivors during his life\nHe passed away on December seventh two thousand and nine and was buried on December seventh before his burial I was sorting things out in his home office with his caregiver\nHe lived in this home for almost six years which I currently still own but who do not live there while sorting out his items I was looking through the open door\nInto the laundry area hallway adjacent back door I saw a very fast thin moving horizontal Smokey grey fog\nGo straight through the back door without it being opened up it went through the door I did mention this to my wife son daughter in some close friends I Am an open minded conscious oriented person but immediate feeling\nWas my dad showed me his spirit was leaving the home for good I Would have never expected to see the gray color\nI would've normally thought it would have been associated with something negative but he was a very positive person\nI have come to the conclusion that whatever part or level of his body consciousness soul left the house may have been more like the gross more earthly matter in its purest form I had never heard the word smoky fog\nUntil you offered them up all night and this is what the spin in my own office and I have wondered if it relates to a ... cat that I lost a year ago and that that to the young ones the big furry ones that everybody loves chocolate and fluffy now\nI just keep wondering could it have been that cat that I Love so much a or I have a cousin who passed the about four months ago she was Ninety six years old sharpest attack even a passing it was her body they gave out\nA she always said that she would try to show me that she had survive a my mom and dad have been gone for a long\nTime but you never know because I really do think that this foggy smoke that you can find Google when you start Googling foggy smoke you will see amazing photographs that resemble what has been in my office and if it is something from another dimension\nTrying to come and get my attention and the YouTube channel I Wonder why have you ever encountered this George\nNew or something like that but these are magnificent stories and emails I but I Do get a lot of emails from people who have had similar experiences yeah there's something very strange going on and you can\nYou cannot rule alone the fact that it's real rules don't\nYes and that profound I'm going to be doing an entire series and may one of my uh\nEnd of November coast I think it's going to be with at least two of the people who have had childhood is not the sole that needs to animate the container\nOrganic body what part is it that is moving out from the body in out of body travel and there are all kinds of explanation in ancient Egypt Egypt about there being nine parts\nTo the body and the so complex but we don't even acknowledge our soul in the western\nWorld and it probably is the most important part of us and when you go back to earring ages four or five and sit and you read these extraordinary emails coming from people who say in their opening sentences\nI have never told a single human being in my life\nAnd I am now provoked from listening to your asking the question on your YouTube channel have any of you at age four\nTo six do you remember an out of body because that is significant where was the learning\nThere was nobody teaching this is something that must be spontaneous training of the soul in a new body contain\nWould you buy I sent you an email I think you've got to make sure you for for ... on this virus or you know to chew the machine and\nYeah the polio or something like the polio in November I Will so I probably will be related to out of body these incredibly profound testimonies a and that is a from this band and there's a whole bunch more I can see that I'm getting tonight\nThey keep rolling in doping yes\nAnd people who have seen this and go to my earth files report look at the looped videos that I have on the October ... through third\nOf it may it's very clear a October third and then the second loop the video is October Seventeen look at them look at this strange extraordinary thing twice\nThat has come into the office I have not felt anything negative\nI Do think that people who have been saying that it falls more likely in the category of a loved one I Love the animal something coming back and then the issue is what would be the conditions in\nThe matter world that we live in and all of our busy miss what would be the conditions that would provoke something that is pass into another dimension to do the energy or whatever is necessary to come back into the matter world even if they are appearing as foggy smoke\nWhich ... above planet X again in the ...

so let's ask him Kevin how are ya\nGreat George thanks yeah in two thousand and two silver was four dollars announce narrative caught to production we predicted silver would rise to thirty dollars announced within ten years people thought we were absolutely not nine years later silver hit forty eight dollars an hour and we weren't so nuts anymore\nNo not at all so what made you so sure that the price was going to make such a big move\nAll at the time silver was trading near its production cost an industrial demand was absolutely skyrocketing\nIn why do you think a hundred dollar silver is possible now\nSolar in fact China alone is expected to need an amount of silver equal to half of the global annual mining production that just China the whole world is moving to China just recently California's now requiring all new homes to have solar panels there's just not enough silver supply that kind of demand\nSo we're going to see a shortage Kevin\nAll I can say is that some smart people like J. P. Morgan has accumulated the largest private stockpile of physical silver in the world more than a hundred and thirty million ounces that's over two billion dollars worth of silver I'm sure they're not doing it because they expect the price to go\nDown the hall I guess not but could super reach higher than a hundred dollars announced\nA few adjusted for inflation George Silver would have to be about a hundred and thirty dollars announce to reach its all time high so we think are one hundred dollars is well within reach\nOne could that happen over the next seven to ten years but we believe most of the games will happen over the next three to five years just hard to ignore the potential in silver right now\nKevin our listeners are passionate you have anything that you can send out to listeners so they can find out more about a hundred dollar sober\nWe do George wanted to make a special offer for you it's our latest sky high silver report listeners can learn more about China's massive move into solar and why experts the silver rising to a hundred dollars announce\nThe report the twenty dollar value but it's free for your listeners by calling one eight hundred to nine nine Seventy four hundred one eight hundred to nine nine Seventy four hundred\nFolks this last week even for just came out with a report saying China was leading the way with solar and that in two thousand Eighteen global investments in the solar will outstrip coal gas in nuclear combine\nLet's get Lee or sky high silver report in some fascinating report and don't miss out on the ... revolution call now to get your copy it's a twenty dollar value free with no obligation\nGoal one eight hundred to nine nine Seventy four hundred that's one eight hundred to nine nine Seventy four hundred [noise]\nIt's so important to get a great night's sleep and I could get that with my sleep number bed\nIt really is comfortable is has a certain setting to it in mind is kept at Ninety which is nice for him set him from the new sleep number three sixty smart but also helps everyone from parents to pro athletes improve their daily performance through proven sleep quality it's so important to get that", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Coast to Coast AM with George Noory", "city": "Springfield", "day": "26"}
