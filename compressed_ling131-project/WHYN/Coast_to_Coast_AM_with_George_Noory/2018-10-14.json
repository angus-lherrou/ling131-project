know rejoined your regularly scheduled programing already in progress\nBack to Iraq and if you're aware of that whole that whole issue Oh yes\nOkay um let me just briefly tell you why why he did it normally you collect blood from a suspect in a homicide cases a couple of days later a week later a monthly or sometimes even a couple of years later 'cause there's no statute of limitations for the crime and murder\nAnd uh so it's it's it's not within hours after the murders as was the case here now the the the the defense argued that he should have booked that vial of blood immediately ... and he could have done that however\nNormally you do not get a D our number which you need to book items of evidence until the the uh the evidence at the crime scene has been collected by the criminal is for someone to the search warrant here that hadn't been done yet a phone was still at Rockingham first invented Bundy collecting evidence\nAnd evidence is booked a frequent chilly up by numbers so at the book that while\nIt would have been item number one but what the reason they didn't do that if he had no way of knowing what number of phone was given to the items of evidence that he was collecting that Bundy and Rockingham it would have messed up the whole numbering system\nWhat it would have made the argument that you can read it around and had opportunity a impossible\nYeah right uh but yes but it's also it was in advisable but I mean how could he ever dream that people like Shaq and Cochran or out they're accusing him of framing someone for murder I mean here's a guy twenty eight years on the forests\nNot one citizen complaint against them in twenty eight years he's about to retire and a few months with his wife read it to his farm in Indiana and he's going to frame OJ Simpson it's mind boggling\nYou free you plant evidence and a capital case in California and testified falsely you can get the death penalty yourself on her one twenty eight of the California penal code the prosecutors never even made that argument and in in any event Fong\nHad already given item number one to the spot of blood above the door handle and uh so so I'm a batter\nBrings the vile blood back the fog and any detective will tell you that when they turn over items of evidence to the to the criminal is in their mind that's the equivalent of booking not I just I'm giving you the background as to why he brought it back here a while you brought it back to Rockingham survived torture him on the day after the murders but here's the point that I Want to get into\nThe defense argument of please frame up and conspiracy and all that at the heart of that very argument was banned that are bringing the vile blood back in what they claim does that then I met her in his evil co conspirators took blood out of that while and planted them run at Rockingham and Bundy was a major major major issue with the trial\nPost trial post trial\nSeveral the jurors that that it was the most suspicious thing that the LAPD did during the\nTire case okay now there are several arguments that the prosecution could have made to knock down this core defense argument about bringing the wild blood back the Rockingham I mentioned several in the book I'll just give you two very brief ones right here\nIf he was going to bring the vial of blood back the Rockingham obviously put it in his pocket he wouldn't put it in a large ... thereby advertising to every one that he was bringing something onto the premise is that just common sense good point number two number to\nBan that are already knew that hundreds upon hundreds of reporters and other members of the media had already congregated at rock and a half an Bundy their cameras blanketing the premise is picking up for the evening news\nAll the movements of everyone on the state there are helicopters up above filming everything down below obviously planting would have been absolutely impossible there are many many other argument\nNow what if I told you what if I told you listen to this because it's unbelievable there's no other additive\nThan in the eight hours of the nation that these two prosecutors gave neither Clark nor Darden said one single word to try to knock down this court the fence argument about ban that are bringing the vial of blood\nFactor Rockingham they never once even touched on the issue I check the transcript three times I had my wife check is unbelievable I said there's got to be some attempt to knock this now because it goes to the heart of the defense case\nAren't when you get to the point when you don't have an open up your mouth and author one single solitary word on an absolutely critical issue the question is how does it get any worse we're not talking incompetence here we're talking beyond incompetent if you didn't show up for work hard\nI wouldn't say that you were incompetent incompetence of showing up for work and doing a bad job\nRight well what about didn't even argue on it but they're not showing up for what about the angle that a a ride Bennett are carried it out in the ... but a lot of people thought well ferman socked away a little bit of it remember the sock business and took it over and planted it that's what the what\nThe ... the glove ... they they have the glove they All right here not there were fourteen uniformed officers that arrived at the Bundy murder thing before five minutes\nBefore affirmative ferment arrived rapid two o'clock and it's right at the these murders happened around a oath whether there's ... there there is a division of a window\nSomewhere somewhere between ten Fifteen and ten thirty five PM in the evening of doing the twelve correct the first officer arrives right after midnight okay they're Eighteen uniformed officers that arrived there before for him and all of them saw only one club so there was no second glove there\nFor ... to pick up\nAnd deposit at Rockingham ... even if he wanted to even if you wanted to frame censored by planning to go out there was no second glove there unless Eighteen officers would have been willing to take the stand and commit perjury for ferman now\nMind you Eighteen officers say they all they all made the statement at ... in front of a a a internal affairs but but uh but Clark only called two out of the team to the witness stand instead of calling you have a sixteen she had the other sixty and there she knew their names\nShe didn't bother calling all Eighteen the more you call that stand the greater the ...\nAll Eighteen are going to commit perjury in a capital case just to help someone most of whom they didn't even know from why didn't you do the\nDo you still think too that the way things are going up the global elite still want to dominate the planet and that they might succeed\nWell I think they did dominate the planet for a long time until Seventeen Seventy six because the founding fathers decided to form a new form of government one that was based on laws that were eternal certain rights that people have that or an elite animals\nAll the ... ball or the people that have ruled the earth to cool they didn't like that so for two

sixty\n\n\nWelcome back to the coast to coast and\nSo over the past two decades Wimbledon they might cast to develop an effective system to experience safe and self initiated out of body adventures and this is a\nA six day in ... in debt workshop that he has conducted and created called out of body exploration intensive and at the renowned bin ... Institute in Virginia\nAnd William cells as a certified he'd been therapist and he guide you through these incredible states of consciousness and I personally know that things just from my experience they love to hear more from William welcome\nTo the show and thanks for joining me\nWilliam Hi how are you feeling good aid\nSo tell me first of all what led you to even create such a system such that I ... out of body ventured idea\nWell over forty years ago I had my own uh I had an out of body experience to go back to Nineteen Seventy three and I was not a believer and then there should\nBe impossible but I\nHad a friend of mine that I had a spontaneous experience in college and\nI decided to explore it ... it was a life changing experience for him so I began to investigate it and found that there was methods to self initiate and out of body experience so I explored them and for it took me I Believe on the twenty fourth day of having the daily exercise\nUm I initiated my first fully conscious out of body experience and it was it was completely life changing I mean 'cause I was not a believer but I wanted to explore and experience it see if it was real for myself and it's it's quite a life change or\nSomething you had to leave your tire life a whole paradigm of your perception of reality shifted\nOh yeah it is but now you had your out of body experience was self induced it wasn't through a an accident or any type of trauma right\nRight it was self induced through um like a meditative exercise\nMhm uh that I\nThat I learned and then I developed many different kinds that we can do to self initiate the experience\nThere was this before or after you became a Hitler therapist\nOh that was way before yeah I later became a hypnotic therapist and I was a I used it to develop other techniques to help or negotiate these altered states and out of body experiences\nSo after you had these experiences yourself then you went into helping other people experienced the same thing so tell me about your OB e where did you go what did you experience how did you know that this was effective for you\nWell the my first one I've ever had hundreds and hundreds of experiences over the decades ... but the first one I had um I was actually in a dorm room are going to college and I was doing what I call the target technique where you select three objects and you\nFocus on them and as you fall asleep at night and the next after\nA series of days went by a one day I was sleeping on my side not our when I become aware I realize that was vibrating differently\nIt's it's strange to really describe this but you feel a vibration of floating sensation ... when I reached out my\nArm I realized my arm entered the wall\nAnd when I did you think we reach the arm out\nOh no I was nonsensical I I didn't realize it was tell you the truth at the time but when I reached out what is at now I realize and at that moment I realized was my non physical arm\nIt went through the wall and then I saw them standing and next thing I knew I was standing by the foot of the bed and it was a one hundred percent Rio and I began to move around the room and examined my surroundings that was my first experience it was relatively brief\nBut it was quite a life changing\nDid you encounter any body being guide anyone there\nAre actually that I did and I write about this is my first book adventures beyond the body that I observed someone that was observing may\n... but they didn't I didn't communicate with them but somebody was observing may which was at the moment with a little bit shocking I was a newbie I had no idea\nAbout that what I at first stepped into here and ah over the decades and years of course I became more and more comfortable as I began to have more and more experiences\nIt's addicting isn't it yeah\nWell it's it's it's exciting because you can finally obtained the answers for yourself and he said I think is the most important thing you don't have to depend upon um external sources and uh\nThe indoctrinated society and culture that's around as you can you can find out the answers for yourself you don't\nGive me an example 'cause how do we know the answer true\nWhen you experience some in other words once you leave your body you know you you're more than your body you know that your brain is not the source of consciousness mhm as we've been trained to believe\nYou realize that you continue to exist and also you begin to realize that the universe is multi dimensional\nWhen I began to experience was a not only one non physical dimension but many of them\nAnd you realize that the physical world is just the in a sense the EPA term is a thin at the ... of the universe\nIs just one of them yeah yes\nAnd but you can experience that first hand and that's what's important it's it's it's not conjecture or belief system\nMhm I always think you know is incredible and our\nOur world is and you know this incredible globe that we're in\nA given topic couldn't just stopped here I mean with all of the intelligence that we have here in which all in the tens information's human being why would the universe just create one\nType of human being that doesn't make any [laughter] absolutely\nNot and once you have to mention that once you have these\nExperiences you realize that the universe is multi dimensional mhm and that and that there is there's trillions of other life forms\nYeah and not all human there has to be it wouldn't just be one [laughter] you don't want to do anything\nNo of course not and it's the universe is far more diverse and magnificent and then we can that I can express\nMhm yeah it is an absolute in so now when you you have these experiences and you know they're real because ... he'll meal you and you explained to me is usually not a language to really\nClearly defined what an energy mention is universal understanding\nWell once you leave your body and you begin to you begin to communicate and meet other being's generally they're humanoid they're generally what we would consider to be people that have died\nOr I write about communicating and meeting my mother and my uncle who to it passed and all communication is very elegant and spy solved and there's no need in other words language is no longer a barrier\nWe we communicate directly by soft and it's amazing\nIt's so clear and concise compared to the physical languages that we use here that are symbols\nAnd it's uh it's amazing\nBut that's one of the great benefits or this or that you have an opportunity to experience and explore yourself and discover the answers for yourself there is no\nUm when I teach my classes there is no um belief systems attached to it each individual is given the skills given the tools needed let's say\nTo go out and become an explorer themselves so they can discover what they feel is the truth for themselves which is very important\nNow your classes you teach them and really tell us what does look like when you have people come and I call it an actual tourism many [laughter] ... it really is an adventure and you say beyond the body\nYes it is it's um the among roe Institute which by the way I'm calling from how great invitation only twenty four people can attend it's a world renowned as being the center for\nThe exploration of consciousness but in my workshop I'm generally what I each person is in a checked unit or Bob Monroe had a real thing for ah these Akron ... and um what is that controlled holistic\nEnvironmental chamber in other words each person's in and personal isolation both and I speak to them when we're doing a technique through headphones so everybody's in their own isolation chamber and then I present\nOn that type of guidance it's called the guidelines I'm which I'm you're trained to literally assist others in that um and to let's just say a system to go to a higher dimensional space\nMm mhm so to assist him in crossing over have you ever done this after\nA [noise] a tragic incident and national tragic incident where a mask that still leaves one\nI have because I I did a I was practicing out of body experiences uh during nine eleven era\nAnd myself and I received a lot of contact ah during that period of time um that was a that was one of those events where there was a lot of people that were just\nTotally disoriented let's put it that way a badge and you're having coffee one morning and your office and suddenly your entire body is gone ... I mean can you imagine I mean it's hard for us to even wrap our minds around that\nSo there was a lot of people that we're shifting those um people that died and this is a this is an ongoing process it's done by many around the world and its its functions in different names and different cultures\nGo ahead and then I went to two ... we we presented in I think I'm more or let's just say are very grounded in a scientific waves at least a scientific as we can\nThat goes for all the training here it's a it's done in a way that's presented in a very logical way that's a\nUnderstandable with no cultural or religious overtones in other words\nWhich yeah which is great because you really allow the person to have their own experience within that I Want to find out a little bit more about what other cultures and does this and what it calls and other cultures are going to take a quick break William thank you so much\nAnd when we come back we'll talk about what other countries just exist and

teaching about this work\nYes yeah so um I was familiar with it but\nMost out of body experience suggests to be clear or ... or spontaneous and people have there are certain prayed alludes to them vibrations a fleet paralysis by the way is a prelude if it's if you react properly\nIs a wonderful prelude to an out of body experience if you stay calm\nAnd react uh I always I often say and people think it's strange but I Love sleep paralysis\nWell that's an indication that I'm ready to leave my body\nWell it keeps you have that then you know walking off your balcony or yeah\nAnd I think it's important people don't know how to use it um to initiate a profound experience or as cars science has been taught us that\nMany people have common phenomena and they don't know what's happening millions and millions of people have they wake up in the middle of the night and the norm all over or their vibrating or they're assuring strange sounds you know these all can be\nA prelude to an out of body experience if you're if you learn how to respond to these what I call them in our signals\nOf there's a shift that's occurring within you that's preparing you for this shift of consciousness that we call him out of body experience now important to become aware of this\nThat we do this naturally anyway I mean do you map fees when you are when people are going to these travels the experience to he mapped the brain or do you make any type of um recording of their travel\nWe have at the Monroe Institute we have in isolation booth that has been used to map brainwaves during many different altered states\nThere was a copper lines or isolation chamber huh ah at the Monroe Institute that's used for um research\nA matter of fact there's one in each or we have two centers and uh there's there's quite a bit of research being done on different types of ... states have consciousness let's put it that way for instance we have a class called discovery\nWere twenty people are all hooked up to a mind mirror yeah and every person they go through a series of techniques\nAre and they're they're but they're not their brain waves are mapped during every exercise and in fact I speak it one night at on this class\nAnd I talk about how to initiate obese but they they cover a lot of territory they also how to go deeper and meditation very quickly\nOut a remote view more effectively for instance there's a lot of different let's just say I'm skills that are taught for interested in different kinds of approaches\nLet's talk about some of the findings Cindy's what is a mind mirror twenty people hooked up to the minds near\nA mind mirror it's just a device that um will it's that's the trade name of the device I'm In ... in our class we will have a four people can be monitored by each Martin mirror and it's a it's a brain wave which it literally will monitor\n'em your multiple different venues or the brain\nWhile you're going through an entire forty five minute program\nSo you can track it and then we can print out it resolved and again that you can tell what is what are you most responding to but that's that's that's one of the beauties of the Unruh Institute is that there is research done in these areas\nBut for me the main my main goal is to teach people how to have the experience themselves and not only have it put control it\nAnd get the most of it my main goal is to teach people how to have a profound a spiritual experience ideally throughout a body exploration it's not just about walking and walking through a wall and\nA talking to someone and it's a lot more profound than that you have the we have the ability to have\nThe literally connect with higher self with are multi dimensional self right and have the kind of experiences that that a Buddhist speaks of and\nThe ancient Hindus and missed except talked about throughout the ages\nThat we're no we're there we have that ability ourselves because we are all of us are multi dimensional being it's just a matter of of beginning to open up to our own potential\nI found some great information on your website and let's say by the way it's ... ... ... dot org and there are\nGreat resources on their of um

really making ya and he's come up with a common let me put it in nominal associated with the Cleveland Plain dealer audience\nYes I'm just to clarify I've been at the Monroe Institute for the last eight years so um but I've been studying this and practicing for forty\nOr just to go on my website astro info dot org I included a over a period of ten years I did a a number of surveys\nAnd I've received sixteen thousand responses from people that had out of body experiences and this is from forty two different countries by the way and it's it was amazing how similar\nKinds of experiences that people were having were so similar it didn't matter what the culture wise for instance I'm\nA floating or um\nVibrations high energy sensations eighty five percent of people experience buzzing humming are roaring sounds as a as a prelude normally to the experience\nBecause normally when you're in the experience things become very generally speaking are quiet but there's a lot of phenomena associated with the onset uh Seventy two percent at some point experienced some kind of partial or fall asleep paralysis\nI'm being lifted are touched that was quite common thirty three percent hearing voices are footsteps thirty seven percent this is one that's very common probably to almost anyone\nAnd that is seen through closed islets if you're seen through your clothes dial it's\nAt night and you can begin to see you are already in the process of shifting your consciousness to your non physical body\nBecause you have and it doesn't mean you've actually did your body but it means you're in the process but most people don't know this because they haven't been trained in the in the prelude in the phenomena associated these are common things at\nA for instance probably the most common it's just a jerk awake you feel like you're just a you're taking a nap and suddenly you just jerk back into your body\nRight is I find that many people feel that that's an indication you're you're at a phase with your body as your fell asleep\nSo that that I see the ... on it because then happen if I'm a retired I Will switch and\nI think his muscles in or you saying that an out of money you\nKnow I'm I'm saying it's not that I'm saying it's a prelude to one potentially ... this is what I have found and what many other um experience or have seen and explored everyone\nWhen they sleep we all humans are moving at a face from our body sets with sleep is ... we take it for granted no one you know there's no we we know about REM periods and we know about this from a scientific standpoint but what happens for that one third of our life\nWe're actually moving out of phase with her body and when you leave your body you can observe other people it's like a double image people literally are floating I'm not saying they're floating at the ceiling they're just like two inches\nOut of the phase with her body at night as a sleep and you can observe this actually during an out of body experience\nAnd what does it look like image you're looking at it's amazing the same applies to animals by the way animals also do the exact same thing\nOh yeah when you watch the animals sleep they aren't switching and having all sorts of experience\nWhere they're moving their legs and the dream again or\nThey may be running in their non physical body\nI mean my point is that out of body experiences are as natural as breathing and think about this for a moment and\nAnd that is just that everyone is non physical we're a non physical ... temporarily for a very brief period of time eighty years or Ninety years\nWhen ... biological ... machine and then we're ... we're all moving beyond the body\nSo isn't it I find it just it's one of the ways to discover what's really going on what this multi dimensional game of chess wordplay\nAnd most people are only aware that they think there's two levels of the game life and death actually it's a it's a vast multi dimensional game but very few people are aware of it and you begin to awake into this one you have an out of body or near death experience\nWell if you wanted to ask the question like how did the pyramid game here would you go into an OB and ask that question\nAnd have you ever tried this and I'm curious how would you know the difference between an imagination\n... that's a good question it's all in the perception of the experience are okay and you can have multiple experiences for instance I had I Begin to have spontaneous experiences when I started this goes back into the seventies\nAnd I was still learning what was going and I'm Still learning by the way [laughter] one's a master we're constantly learning and I started to have experiences of myself as a German tank commander\nIn these experience would find myself literally riding the German tank I mean and it was so real it was just like the physical world and I didn't even know what was going on I didn't believe in a past lives that wasn't on my radar\nBut then I had these repeated experiences and that's the way\nA lot of people end up getting verification and I had multiple multiple experiences where I found myself as a German soldier in World War two and I also found out that my let's just say one of my sons was with me at the time\nAnd um my point is that when often will get information given to us or we open to these experiences and we get a download and it's more than just download of information it's presented to us in experiential were there were\nPresent and when you have this happen a dozen times it begins to get you get your own verification\nOr what's going on\nAnd I think this is very important because no one's telling you for instance I didn't believe in past lives until I started to have my own that's I mean I'm just using this as one example\nRight but that does make sense it's it's just not needing to be validated ... anyone other than yourself\nRight I and it's very important that sets self verification is essential I find because that's the only way will ever break free from the indoctrination\nOf belief systems that dominate our society and culture\nAnd very important\nBecause all of us have been from birth we've all been indoctrinated along certain religious and let's just say educational lines and [noise] you know I always ask somebody\nThat's an avid believer and anything left backed up specialty uh religion you know what would you believe what faith would you believe if you would have been born in India ah eh we're all been programmed and ...\nIt gives us an opportunity to break free from that program into truly see what's real and look beyond the programming that we all share\nA cause and that's an important aspect of this and it's an individual journey nobody can tell you what you are and where you're going nobody can you have to experience it and then you suddenly oh my God now I got it\nAnd it's it's a transformational powerful experience and it's very self empowering\n... it is now back to the report to you had you talked about these common maybe put it in ... and also the average age of the first ... ... ... years old that people are recruiting recount the cancer and it's often repeated experience it happens\nOver and over again but it declines during early teenage years why do you think that is the tension forget that\nI I think the children are just more open to naturally experience their multi dimensional self and once you hit ... based on all my research once you hit puberty everything just starts to shut down I think it as an interest in just a sec says something to do with it\nSo that you know the answers for yourself and you're no longer on of anyone else any belief system government religion you are free of all of that indoctrination and that's that is incredibly powerful\nYes and I think more of us need to understand that and get out of the the ... that we tend to get in with his his era gal news that we\nAre ... and you realize it's\nYou know there's so much important stuff that we need to know about ourselves the greatest problem with humanity is a lack of knowledge of self\n... that's the core issue involved in all the ills that face humanity it's lack of knowledge himself if every one seven billion of it's suddenly awoke one day\nI knew what we were\nAnd where we come from and where we're going there'd be no conflict there'll be no wars are being ... none of that would occur ... because we would know better\nIf we really truly knew we were all connected but there are just some beans on this planet we don't want to be connected with that theory doesn't work can we really truly all be connected to only the ones that want to be connected to [laughter]\nWell we go beyond the ego\nYeah we we

San Pedro or the empty or it doesn't matter how you and do the experience if you're a fear based\nAnd you take your fears are mindset is going with us into our experiences that's why it's so important to begin to each to take a closer look at yourself and your beliefs\nAnd to see how and try to perjure yourself as much as possible of these fear based a belief systems that have no reality to them\nBut if you believe in some kind of negative vanity\nIf if there is not like there's negative entered its you were going to create it when your mind is going to mold the reality around you if you believe in love and light you're going to manifest love and light if you believe in darkness and a negative beings and whatever\nThen you're going to manifest that is well well you are creative powerful beings and when you leave your body no matter how it's done you're entering into a incredibly thought response of environment and you have to take responsibility for your experience\nSome people don't like to hear this but it's it's the truth\nWell I had we had one once where I went it was a\nDream I guess I don't remember but it could very well in and out of body experience where I was shocked by somebody that he'd written up it was like a future scene and they were on a motorcycle and they got us in the recycling helmet looked directly at me didn't recognize this person don't know anyone that\nI'm Brian ... owns a motorcycle and it was and he woke me up because it was as if\nThat person was really looking at me and I don't know who lives in it wasn't a protection of anything and it was when I was no there isn't a\nPremonition of anything that happened it just isn't it was as if I had gone into a future dimension which looks pretty bleak pianist and then this person looked at me\nSaying why are you who how did you cross into this dimension and then I woke up because people are scared to each other yeah I'd I don't know if that an added well out of body travel less likely mhm\nWell it could have been but it wasn't a projection of my psyche at all\nNo there's object there is consensus what I call consensus realities and there is no consensus reality\nThere's that's that's why it's important to learn about the consensus realities are created by a collective group of individuals that all agree on a reality\nAnd they create that's why I called consensus there's many types of reality that exist in\nIn a multi dimensional universe and that's why it's important for us to start to learn these what is essentially the rules of non physical reality and how they function because it's not the same as it is here\nWe're used to linear ties right into the gravity we're used to air yeah when you leave your body you don't have a biological body you're not breathing air you know you don't have gravity\nAll the things we're used to have to you have to learn how to function in a new kind of energy that's and that's of course one of the things I teach and\nI'm In my workshops but it's also in my book but it's important for everybody to start learning the nature of our continuing existence yes\nHere that will be prepared for this transition of consciousness\nI understand I understand it well thank you so much Williams has been great if you go to his website which has astro info dot org you'll find out about all of his books and his courses in classes and there's lots of free information there as well\nAnd when we come back we're going to talk about his Colorado and some of the great history with the forgotten towns that's on the route of Sylvie back I only see you're listening to ... am [noise]\nYour sanity [noise] because that's what kids do [noise] but this car is your territory out there [noise] defendant\nAt home with your resolving ... night seven uh done on news radio wide victory doubled you ... [noise]\n[noise]\n[noise]\nWelcome back to coast to coast am so my guess today her website it's called ... two legends dot com and I love the beginning of it it says [laughter] welcome to the blue moon hunted history chores Ruben probably scaring the public since two thousand two Stephanie waters is my guest welcome Stephanie Lisa\nI'm Glad to be here and I love that proceeding commercial about paying because\nGold tonight is to have everyone Peter Pan [laughter] I'm going to scare the ... out of there it's lovely record\nI was thinking about that commercial saying can you really say pee on an original is is that there's a sharing anyway go to the show [laughter] funny\nYeah thank you very much and um thank you very much for being for letting me be on tonight and I've been a long time listener so this is a dream come true\nCause so will you send me your book and we do are you constantly in Colorado during our guys shows and I thought it would be so fascinating 'cause there are so many different pieces of history little pockets of history\nAnd it's really unassuming you can find things like that in Colorado and everywhere but what do what was your first experience with her normal\nWell this I've been seeing go since I was neat a knee high to a grasshopper is what I always say\nI'm and about and my parents never believe me so it was quite frightening\nAnd so this really has become part of my mission in life is to try to spread some better understanding and after I got cancer I'm about ten years ago it was my wake up call and I looked at my bucket list and believe it or not\nMy goal was to try and the unite the paranormal can even immunity and also do some outreach to help children better understand and um so I actually started this paranormal convention and I partnered with my friend or a fence\nAnd she said professional psychic and she runs a nonprofit called the ... spirits out of Longmont, Colorado mhm and so the two of us uh with the brainstorming and then getting a lot of support from other people in the community\nNow we've changed the name to spirits of the Rockies paranormal convention\nAnd uh we we call it a little faith because every year we try to answer it in a different community and\nBy doing that we outreach to the historians because we call ourselves hunted historian because what we do is actual real history so even if you don't believe in ghosts or things that\nGo on and the night [laughter] supposedly this stuff really happened and I got particularly interested in this after I found out about a journalist named Charles for it and I'm sure all your listeners know about him that he was\nPretty popular about a hundred years ago and what he did was he went into old newspaper archives and old mysteries and he revisited them\nTo see if it was possible that these things really happened and so that what I decided to do and interesting and that this is actually my fifth book and I want to shout out to ship for publishing LCD they actually published my last book\nGoes legends and lord of the Rockies and it is available ... ship or publishing\nOkay well let's just back up for a second here so you let's talk about your Journey Through you're going to thyroid cancer and how you how you reconnected your life with goats what were you doing before then\nWell before that I like I said I've always been in to the paranormal because I've been seeing it you know since I was little child\nWhat do you mean seeing it you've you've\nI see it and I actually feel it\nI really like it was my example is a\nI can [laughter] I Know this is gonna sound really funny that I can actually send things I'm I'm In path I think a lot of your listeners probably are familiar with that kind of a term but I hadn't very ex I'm just highly ...\nSo they've now if somebody came up to me and said hey is the Broncos going to win the football team I Can't predict that into the future\nBut what I can do is I see pictures for example today I was at the flea market with a friend and they lost their backpack and I saw the picture in my head of where it was that I just close my eyes and I saw where it was that and we went back in there it was\nSo I'm able to do things like that um\nBut I let's see I think okay so I was a professional story tell her from the time I was about twenty all through college I used to do singing telegrams all of this kind of thing and so I've worked in the entertainment business for quite a while and about Twenty years ago is when I bought a bed and breakfast and managed to Springs Colorado and he was taunted\nAnd so I said well I might as well start doing haunted history tourists and I open my\nBig huge mansion to the public and I had haunted wine and cheese parties\nDid you know before you bought it it was haunted\nYeah I knew was haunted but I was kind of like this you know my kids were oh starting in junior high at the time and I was like oh this will be fun and kids get this we are oh you're going to love this story this is way true I mean it sounds like it's made up but I'm telling you that all that I'm telling you tonight is a hundred percent true\nWe were living in Southern California at the time and my husband was working for cancer research company and he got laid off when the company changed hands\nSo my entire family a move to Colorado and bought an old haunted mansion sight unseen I Swear\nThat because they wanted to buy a hundred mentioned well are they wanted to buy a mansion\nWell what happened is I actually come out I'm actually from Colorado and I'd come out on vacation and I was staying in the bed and breakfast and I got to know the owners pretty well and I told them my story about how my husband was in this cancer research company and he was the CFO and everything\nAnd at the same time the owner's life who actually wasn't living there she was at in California because she I mean ... Texas 'cause she had cancer and she was dying so she was really interested in the research and I tried to give her as much information as I could you know her husband\nAnd mind you and your she died and so during this time it was really interesting because I actually got an email um and it was back in Nineteen Ninety nine you know so I think it was like I feel bad a questionnaire and the room and that's how he got my email address\nAnd he said to me you know I I Know your husband was involved in this and everything but we actually have this\nA bed and breakfast for cell and uh if you you know I Know you said your husband just got laid off of work I don't know if you were thinking about coming back to Colorado but we could talk about\nFinancing the home for you and that was interesting because my husband didn't have a job I mean everything just smell into place like we were meant to have this house and by the way I actually knew the house because I grew up here and he was always really fond of this big beautiful old\nA craftsman style mansion done in the arts and crafts by I just loved it\nAnd um when we bought it it was really rundown [laughter]\n... extremely run down and so one of the first order of business was to actually fix up the house now this was a problem because the owners said to us\nThat they would finance us no problem we didn't even have to put any money down\nBut I was not allowed to sell anything in the house until the house was paid for and we signed a balloon I'm\nA balloon like loans and said that we would pass the house in five years after five years we can do whatever we wanted with the furniture or the house ... what have you well after us you know no no hard feelings to the former owners or anything but I really did not like the way this house was decorated and an artist you know and it's\nVery severe that I'm In a soothing you can see where this was going roe [laughter]\nSo I actually called the owner's son and he was managing the bed and breakfast at the time and I said hey do you think they would mind if I you know just sold a few things and it goes you know what steps do what you want he goes\nMy mother is old and she is going to die soon you know this was before she died and he goes don't worry about it you know I'm just do what you want there never coming back to Colorado again because you know\nIt's too high of an altitude sorry about that just do what you want and I said All right thank you very much so I put an ad in the paper and I had the biggest the state so I don't think anybody's ever seen anything like wow\nI hired twenty people um to help me out and we all had T shirts that said on all that just state so Nineteen Ninety nine and it was ethic\nMy goodness you you do during school out literally everything in the house lock stock and barrel you can see where this is going right [laughter] I Can't wait\nTill the ghost of surely actually sue was not happy with me I'm not long after that my nephew was living with me and he was only six years old at the time and he actually had his own bedroom at the on a ledge estate and he started talking about a ghost named sue\nAnd I really believe it was because he just didn't want to [laughter]\nNo he had an analytical mind do want to become a doctor for like he\nTotally turned it out so all these years I think he you know he always thought that I was a little bit crazy until\nI knew I wanted to know what he does his friend Sonia my step mom's go center [laughter] and ah\nIt it's it's it's a it's it's kind of sweet being validated finally [laughter]\nOh ...\nOh yeah he believes me now he knows I'm good storyteller anyway\n[laughter] well that's that's what it's all about everything's about storytelling so now you still live in ... springs right tell us a little of the history of that area\nWell that's I Believe this is one and this is the most taunted I call it the hunted heart of the Rockies and I'm not alone I'm sure you've heard of Nicholas ... right yes oh well this was his home base he is to hang out here all the time\nBecause we have a lot of lightning here you know where we live in the Rockies ... and I'm so he actually built a lab on the top of pikes peak he he was fascinated with managed to springs especially because we have some very curious magnetic\nAnomalies in our town I can actually walk with my compass around the perimeter manatees springs on these beautiful hiking trails that we have and my how this will shake my hand and never find true north I kid you not the\nThe Indian American Native Americans knew about these sacred places and in the sacred places the trees actually grow kind of sideways and it's just curious about the hair on my back on my arms and my neck will go up [laughter]\nUm you can feel it um and the other thing that curious about it is that because of these magnetic anomalies um Nicholas Tesla actually noticed I Believe he was standing outside of the cliff house hotel and he was watching as these birds um we're just\nCircling over managing springs like they didn't have any sense of direction\nLike their innate sense of ability to find their way through north or south was gone and you know they have birds have a little piece of hepatitis crystal and their brain\nAnd it ... the he was saying he was speculating that maybe because of these magnetic anomalies at the Brits were hunting confused because they were actually behaving in a very strange manner by like diving into buildings and in like ... how the pilot [laughter] interesting\nIt really is a very special place that is fascinating we will find out more about managing Springs Colorado and we come back with my guest Stephanie waters I Am listening to coast to

double ...\n\nWelcome back to coast to coast am I guess is Stephanie waters and she is not only a professional storage other as we can tell but he's also the owner of the blue moon hunted histories tours in Colorado\nSo Stephanie tell us a little bit more about you when we were just talking about men or two springs and how it has this incredible magnetic anomaly there we're ... in Colorado and why specifically Colorado did it just called to you\nI'm I think another reason why I'm that people were\nDrawn to manage his springs for spiritual reasons is because originally this was a sanctuary to five warring Native American tribes and when they came here they had to pack between them that they would not\nFight when they were here this was their holy sanctuary so they would wipe off their war paint and put down their weapons and there was peace here forever until the Victorians came along and the legend is that we started building you know the hotels and\nSo the manager confirmed it snowing yet all of this worked up beautifully [laughter] needing now had she seen the operation of this not\nSince the book has come out it was amazing during the time before the book yes oh yes she knew\nIt was on it but she hit like I said her job was at stake oh by the way it was interesting I forgot this is an important part of the story why out of the blue you know on August Eighth two thousand six team\nBecause this theater had just been sold to the city at one point it was actually slated for the wrecking ball in this book was reaching out for at least trying to find someone to help her tell her story\nI'm sure this isn't the first time that's happened to you\nI'm a ... well the first time I got a call from a ghost that desperately needed their stories\nThat yes but you seem to be the you like the public is for the east coast today\n[laughter] he liked to have made it is it's meant to be one you have a wave really\nConnecting history with you you do the research it's like a real live ... ...\nYou know when you when you go to places and they say it's haunted don't you'll always want to know why and I laugh when they always say it's haunted by the goes but like all the little girl that bounces a ball isn't she you I'm like no\nLeave in ... but listen friendly does give me a break [laughter]\nThere is no devious fund spirited no\nNo that's not if they are they're just kicking you being you trick here they are in prison here by their own their own their own mind that they're they're they're they're in danger\nDo they tend to come out more during Halloween during my time so\nYes indeed I absolutely believe this time of year that the ... and this is the best time if you do want to communicate with your loved ones this is the best time of year to do it I'm absolutely a big believer in that\nWhy do you notice that there's a peak time Oh yes\n[laughter] and the best time of day believe it or not you know everyone thinks that it's midnight or you know they're ... we do have the votes that come out at midnight you know but um or at three thirty in the morning but I find the best time to actually look for a ghost\nIf he wants to see them with your eye is that in between when the sun is just setting it in between day and night ... ... that is the best time\nIs a transition time why\nIf the lighting and if you think about this there are so many colors that we can't see and when the lighting is just right see I'm also an artist and oil painter getting lends itself to the shadow is that makes sense\nYes it does it makes perhaps when you see the shadow people and the light changes very fast right now and then\nI got like it only lasts about ten minutes and then the Rockies we had a beautiful because of the way that bounces off the rack and that led to the mountains like I live in a canyon and it really lends itself to being able to see the shadows that's just the right direction\nNow is the place that you're living in now hunted or did you must have been non hunt ... did the gas or the goes follow you\nWrite it they do on like two words it's very funny the up and doing them now for Seventeen years\nI started when I was in kindergarten [laughter]\nThing but um that being said I've been doing it for so long that I just naturally thought that the this is going to crack you up but I thought that the street lights and managers who were on a timer because whenever I Would walk underneath in life they would go out when I Would be talking about certain goes you know these certain locations\nAnd then one day my friend says well why would they go out when you're standing underneath them if they were on some kind of a trip or to save on electricity or whatever they would on when you walk underneath them and I said yeah that's true [laughter]\nSo they really do communicate with us on the tour I Will talk to them in the street lights flash this town is very hunted by\nA well it's too for a lot of areas I mean even bolder window I Walk around there and then went there once a month doing doing uh my show in the if you just look at the tops of the buildings it's got a lot of history\nYeah yeah you too I mean I've heard that sometimes it just happened to some people with the tripping of life\nI used to happen it doesn't any longer\nAnd the uh did you notice that would happen to other people who are just you I Know you said it doesn't anymore\nYeah I notice it was just happening to me and it happens so much but then it stopped\nI Know and then you don't want to tell anybody 'cause I think you're psychotic they're like oh\nHave you tried to say it's happening at well so\nThey're like oh aren't you especially you know how to do all kinds of metrics I'm really I'm Serious I was just wondering if that happens to you too and they're like no I don't have that are there are there other\nWestern towns like old western towns that you other than Boulder and and managed to springs that you know are also carry that type of energy and that's\nThe essence part rain there oh yeah you know this family hotel right there on that a native ... very sacred Native American land ... they're right there it seems to be a a there's a I have heard pilots telling me that if you go up on an airplane and you look down\nOn managing springs and vulgar and even as to part with ... with the infrared cameras at night time that you can see it light up light up with the red energy I find that very interesting and you know the NATO and he's the call this the sign of the ... the spine of the earth with the Rocky Mountains\nVery sacred land it very very old ancient\nWhy did they call it the spine anything right there in the center of the country\nYeah the center of a war of the pikes peak they believe was the naval of the universe I find that fascinating because maybe it's a portal\n[noise] you know that's what I was going to ask you know why is what we need to get into this this is very funny I Love that stuff [laughter] you know hikes peak it's very popular and it has a lot\nOf um a lot of stories around it and I hope I know that you've written a lot about this and you can tell us about it and um

we were talking a little bit before the break about pikes peak now there's many places in the world that have lots of legends and lower but this particular one like he has\nA lot it's considered one of the\nMore spiritual places in the world as well as um because of its kind of rich waters and mineral rich area in that particular region of the u._s. can you tell us a little bit about your experience Stephanie ... you know that the ...\nWell I'm I ... I think it was called ... or ... I think that's what the native you here\nWell it but they literally believe that the mountain was the belly button of the universe I just love that I loved belly buttons anyway but especially the belly button of the universe that's pretty important\nOne why we've called that that's connected to the mother\nOkay yeah it's connected to the mother and think about the native is the way they must of looking at it as being closest to heaven as they can get\nUm father sky Mother Earth ... and so the significance and even even if you look at the mountain it definitely stand out from the rest of the whole front range it stands out like a sore thumb\nThat and the natives and use it at the end of the significance and\nWe also know that cripple creek is right there on the side of pikes peak and cripple creek as I understand it um during the pikes peak gold rush a produced more goals than any place in the whole world I Hope I have that right but I'm sure I Do [laughter]\nWell it makes sense because there's a lot of other minerals there as well\nYeah and if you I Love the show ancient aliens and they talked about that that we have a lot of UFO sightings over pikes peak\nAnd I'm a lot of those stories of posts and of course in this region but on the ancient aliens they talk about how perhaps the I'm ancient aliens were attracted to this region because of the rich mineral deposits underneath\nThe mountains here in the Rockies and I find that that is a very good explanation because when I was doing my research especially about UFOs I found that most of the sightings happened over the all metal mining camps\nEspecially cripple creek you know there's a story that happened this would have been Twenty years before the Wright brothers to fly over ... over Kitty Hawk\nHere and cripple creek Colorado they were over five hundred people that saw us so when they were coming out of church on Sunday about noon was cleared daylight and it was a flight of about seven or eight of them of ships\nAnd they were hovering just about oh a hundred hundred yards about the time he was so close that they could see the windows I mean that that is amazing and they were hungry and they weren't flying so the explanation of weather balloons was totally\nBefore there was like yeah it just it just I I find that fascinating 'cause it's even today if somebody says oh I saw a UFO you can always brushed it off as being an airplane but this was before we had\nOur governor ... experiment gone exactly\nExactly or even weather balloons wouldn't have behave the way that the beast it\nMhm theoretically\nSack played up and down sideways ring you know like a helicopter mhm a fascinating and they didn't know what to look they there was no explanation now so what I did was I followed that I followed the sightings throughout the Rockies at the very same time it was fascinating to me this was like an Eighteen fifty nine you would not\nThere is a lot of people yeah\nBut a lot of people saw this I mean just outrageously crazy\nAnd you found your story we're in\nKansas and then came over to Colorado yeah it was amazing\nAnd the story was consistent\nVery much so the way that that that's a very good question right there because that's\nThere was no way that the farmers in Kansas you know back then before we had the worldwide Web could possibly know with farmers in Colorado where thing that I mean this was amazing back then you know um what we you know that we had the telegraph you\n... you think pikes peak because of its mineral rich content and waters or to contain a lot of minerals there to conduit or a a UFO or extraterrestrial activity yeah\nAbsolutely um I have had the great pleasure of meeting some wonderful people over the years as the director of the paranormal conventions and one of my friends is named Dan Mathias and he lives in green mountain falls Colorado and um which is right underneath pikes peak\nAnd um he saw a big foot or come to his back door opened his door actually uh\nHe um the big foot actually rubbed at the high any on his screen door and he actually had some big hair [laughter] and um then has really committed his entire life to the belief in Bigfoot and he believes that his property is on part of a portal\nAnd he does live above green mountain falls back in these rock formations and there's Patrick lessen the rocks and I've been back there with him and all of this myself and I believe it's possible you know a lot of you might not have you seen in the writing\nOr he believes that my friend he probably it's it's um you know it's like stick figures I find this fascinating because they are elongated just a straight line a stick you know with too\nLittle like a triangle at the bottom and then a triangle on the top and then these long arms with triangles on the bottom of it it's very geometric looking at its it's fascinating and my friend actually believe that his property is upward hole\nWhere big foot is traveling ... and I know it might sound outrageous but why not consider the possibility that may be big foot is a missing link maybe\nAnd maybe ... maybe he's coming in and out or maybe we're seeing I'm seeing something that happened and another time a long time ago I don't know [laughter]\nWell to me ... how do you feel that the Native Americans feel about just a few stories and go and the legends and so forth that isn't being reported on by Native American\nWell this is great that you brought up this question again to you'd think like a researcher because that's what I Am I'm like well why don't we have more stories and that's because nobody was looking\nUnder the right name of course like a Native Americans wouldn't have called this preacher big foot now would say [laughter] I wouldn't have gone tiny for\nNo there there was a hundred and fifty four different names by the ... Native American Indians depending on where they lived in the Rockies were they were located a hundred and fifty four different names that's why we had a communication problem here I mean I can think of a few names right off the hand that I mean\nThat's why you're doing research on this was so fascinating it open so many doors for me I went oh my gosh now this story makes sense now this story makes sense you know all the same being\nOnce we decide on a name you know sasquatch I think most big foot tall it just like to call it um you know that is just a name that it's been come up within the last few years I mean relatively speaking maybe fifty years I don't know\nI yeah I I'm but I my question more it's more about the hotter the Native Americans\nFeel and the people feel about these places that are being built on the men issue springs area and garden of the guards in the areas near pikes peak\nWhere that is really very interesting and the other good question because the the little legend is that our town is constantly flooded baptized by water every seven years and so it seems to be true\nNow I looked into this and I'm like going All right well when's the last time that we've actually had somebody tried to remove the curse\nAnd it was back in two thousand\nAnd what happened was in Nineteen Ninety nine we had a huge flood again and it wiped out our spa building and it was almost going to be demolished\nThe Murphy company came in and they spent uh quite a lot of money to have this building completely Reagan got it because it had to get rid of all this this is this and that was like three million dollars right there\nBut anyway just to make sure that their investment was not going to be flooded they actually asked five members of the Native American Indian canceled come here and do a healing right over the town and over the spot building and I actually read it\nTake a quick break and they were going to come back with the listener own cause any those
