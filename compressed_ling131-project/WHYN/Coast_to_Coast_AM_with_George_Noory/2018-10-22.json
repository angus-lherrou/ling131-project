those books has overshadowed his original project the one that got him on the path to\nPursuing missing persons cases ten years ago next month they made his first appearance on this program with me to talk about the ... project a groundbreaking investigation into the big mystery in which Dave applied many of the techniques and strategies you learned as a police officer\nWho the sasquatch legend immersed himself in it lived among the group of people of northern California unemployed the talents of a forensic sketch artist give accurate portrayals of what people have been seeing for very long time well you may have been focusing on missing or one one\nThe last few years but never lost interest in big foot so here he is with a new work gets an archive of big foot and wild man stories and news reports dating all the way back to the year's sixteen eighty\nAnd well I think David is probably not likely to take a position on what the answer to the mystery might be he has pulled together a pretty amazing collection of reports from eyewitnesses newspapers journalists hunters and others who've seen these creatures up close and personal ... welcome back\nHey George thanks again for having me a absolutely\nSo good times on the show and I appreciate it\nSo returning to work on big what does this feel like you're dating your ex\n[laughter]\nIt's a kind of odd like you said it's it's always been doing in the background and it's something\nThat's always had my interest I think it's an elusive topic that uh there's a lot of conjecture out there but not a lot of facts\nYou'd never stopped working on it does you know I mean you're focused may have been elsewhere but it's always been sort of a you kept an eye out for articles and information\nYou know I Can't say that I've committed much energy to it in the last seven eight years and focused on missing people but when you're going through the archives and you're trying to pull out articles about missing people I'm always reading\nAbout all kinds of things that I see on these first pages of news news articles and such and\nI started to come across these ah these stories about um something that looked like when you read the articles\nBut when you read the title of it like Ninety percent of the time it will say wild man and I hadn't done a lot of archived work on the topic before but\nYou know eight years of digging through\nThese archives for missing people articles I just started to pull them and put them in a folder and over the years that got large and eventually I said you know this is pretty intriguing I I think even if you're an optimist or a pessimist on the topic it's convincing that something over the years has been around us\nAnd it's been documented and and it shows the historical aspect that most people don't understand\nUm ... we're going to get into the specifics articles about big wild man and giants and sometimes they're the same and sometimes they are different but I wanted to just for those who were not lifting ten years ago\nWhen you were first year can you be kept the hoop a project how you got started on that what you learned and how it kind of got its hooks into you are all these years later\nSo I I never had a dog in the fight or I was working for a technology company I was getting ready to retire and raise a couple of kids and to the guys I was working with the worst super wealthy\nCame to me and they sent me in this room and they told a story that independently without knowing each other when they were kids they had a big foot encounter and the mountains to the earth\nAnd they found each other later in business and you know we're sort of set a coincidence they started talking about Bigfoot and they found each other and and were shocked that they each had a similar encounter\nAnd they said you know if you have Twenty years or if a police officer you have years of investigating an HR you're the guy really to give it that independent what will finance you go about it at your own pace me no your kids to raise that\nHelp us out with this we really we really want to find out and initially said no and they kept coming back coming back and they said at your own pace you can do it so I I Want about looking for an area that had a few things first of all I wanted Internet I needed a hotel\nAnd I knew that there was Native American history with the topic that Randy and I needed it within say six to eight hour driving location from where I Lived at the time in Los Gatos California\nAnd I coordinate down the area to ... which is about thirty miles south of bluff creek where the Paterson given one film was made sixty seven\nSo I started to do some geographical research some topic graphical some weather and I started to bring us together and then I\nWent up there and make contact with the group of police that a police background I approached them and I said hey maybe you can break down some doors for me I'm not going to I'm not going to stretch the truth I'm going to tell the truth\nAnd every witness to come forward they're going to have to write an affidavit to what they saw under penalty of perjury\nAnd I wanted to raise the bar on the topic a little bit so that that would be no question about what was stated because they sign it and there'd be no question about it for the story was fabricated because it was done under perjury\nThey smell but to a very brilliant scientist who had written white papers before and we explained to her in explaining to her a proper way to go about this\nShe went to some of this but she didn't listen to all of it and unfortunately she put a lot of canoeing\nAnd thought don't belong in a white paper in a white paper but if you ... all of those feelings and thoughts and you stick strictly with the science\nWhich people don't in Ninety nine percent of the people I've never read the paper and they read little news briefs here and there and think it's a true reality is when you sit\nWith a scientist who reads that science behind the paper they know that\nThose hundred and ten sample Phyllis tell a story that phenomenal\nWhen we come back we're going to get into that

H. Y. N. [noise]\n[noise]\n[noise]\nWell come back we're talking with David polite us about big wild man and giants the newest book an archive of articles that go way back to sixteen eighty a describing these creatures people whatever you want to call them\nAnd before the break David Was explaining how he and some colleagues had collected up a whole bunch of samples dozens and dozens of samples that were submitted to very a a very precise DNA kind of testing the paper that was written by Dr Melba catch them maybe had some personal\nUm ... observations that didn't belong in the paper but the the DNA evidence David Was rock solid right\nWell that's the part that I don't think a lot of people understand\nIt a wasn't some half ill treatment it was\nIt was the best of the best that DNA was sent to or certified lab so to ensure that there was no mistake all of the labs got the same results or was analyzed by a series of people it was\nIt went through so many hurdles was unreal there's a there's a couple of outsiders right now doing research on DNA and you could see him on TV and they said oh you know the DNA is comeback bears et cetera\nAnd one of the things that don't but did that most researchers and DNA so called experts are not doing right now\nAnd then they're going to explain that they have certain abilities that you don't understand\nThat you could think that you're around and maybe a coyote or bird is right near you when in reality it's going to be them and they have this incredible ability to mimic anything that they want with incredible strength and five and when they said that there another tribe of people\nThis community and the big foot world that\nIs very adamant that they're an ape throws this completely off the wall and when you dig deeper in it most Native American tribes in fact probably Ninety nine percent say it's another type of people will try it and this article goes right to that point\nAnd nobody was ever written a book before tribal ever brought that out\nAnd when I when I found it I couldn't believe that nobody was talking about it and it it's stunning still that nobody wants to talk about it\nYeah I Wonder what those tribes if they're still around would say about it now\nYears later nine years well I can I can tell you that being around tribes in the mid west and in the west like Harvey and I were it's consistent they still say that it's a type of people\nYou know the descriptions of course as you have noted that the term big but started in Nineteen fifty eight so before then people had other words for ... and then many or most of the early\nClippings and stories that you have elected they call them wild man of course I guess that would fit I mean they they're humanoid shape they're out in the forest there Harry um they don't know what else to call them\nFor walks like a man walked upright and doesn't walk bent over\nAnd their knuckles aren't dragging on the ground like in a um if I I always tell people I said well\nIf it's an animal then it's probably going to be found and it's probably going to be identified and you could probably go view and study\nAnd wild man ... that's a different sort of thing it's a different kind of topic very elusive a ... I don't know anybody that's claimed to have studied them in the wild walking\nInto the wilderness and found a spot and studied them year after year\nSo they have intelligence that's quite a bit different than the average animal quote unquote that you see in the woods and even the animals on the ape gorilla et cetera side of the equation totally different they they act different they walk different they look different\nAnd one thing that everyone has to think about it never in North America have there been any wild ape gorilla bones found ever but we have how I'd while or giant human bones found\nIn ... that you really make you think\nYou know some of the descriptions any articles are\nAre made me chuckle a little bit because the writers who have no ... but the topic of course because it's new to them they're they're explaining it must have been old Fred's so and so who disappeared into the forest a couple of years ago and now he's grown hair all over his body\nThat I [laughter] I traveled with you on those and I think people are scratching\nTheir bringing in some rationality to an irrational observation um and and the parts of the country where these things are seen you know get way way below zero it snows how Fred that decided to leave his farm going to live and that type of environment\nAnd and grow hair all over his body like that a Nick long hair you mentioned in the in the clip that I was reading there from a middle aged Seventeen hundreds you had a notation at the bottom\nThat said maybe this is what Daniel Boone saw ah I didn't see the Daniel Boone any Daniel Boone story in here other than that reference that you made but he had an encounter is a fairly famous encounter right\nThat's correct and uh I I couldn't find in our car news article about it but I saw other secondary and third level\nThings that were written about what Daniel called I I think it was a Yahoo yeah and the description was pretty close and I don't know it's it sure seemed possible\nBut again if you went into the quote unquote credible archives you're really not going to find that you have to dig really deep and and find out what maybe some explores wrote about that they heard in which he encountered so\nBut again in tribal Bigfoot I've written about things where an explorer from the latter day church was coming across country on a horse and he wrote in his explored notes that this thing came up to him while he's on his horse and looked him I'd I actually spoke to him\nLarge hairy by pet he'd never seen before that matched the description of a wild man or a big fight and it came from the archives with the latter day church butter de saint church and it's in there so to say that these things haven't happened ... with\nUh the first entry the oldest entry comes to us from Jacques ballet you wrote about it and have a clip from September Seventeen sixteen eighty it was a reported in his book wonder in the sky a large black wildlife mass\nLanded in a field releasing a huge here covered being that was seen briefly and disappeared now that's the kind of thing that will drive um big foot people who think it's an ape just crazy\n[laughter] you know I I'm not sure how many people listening actually bought a ... book on a about this but when I was going through it\nI I like to think I'm a mile wide and an inch deep I like to read about different things that could be associated with topics I'm doing research on and what I read this I'm a fellow over and said wow I don't think anybody's ever heard of this and uh his book which was a Kickstarter project\nAnd um which kind of did the same thing\nWith the UFO topic that I did on this big topic it was a stunner I again I don't think a lot of people want to hear this\nYeah I I uh I was part of that project and um and supported it and it's a tremendous book and people can find it anywhere they should check it out we're talking with Dave ... about his latest work big foot Wildman and giants

radiolab downloaded now [noise]\n[noise]\n[noise]\n... you know looking back at your your original book Hooper project that it's still all these years later I don't think there's anything quite like it\nIn in the field and you look at these drawings by Harvey Pratt these look like human faces these are individual faces that he's drawn a forensic drawings based on witness descriptions are they looked like a people are just big hairy people but people\nNo I I think that the general consensus that a third of matches what other tribes have dated all across the U.S and uh\nWhen you try to find a group of people that have been here hundreds and hundreds of years and occupy the land to to find a group that says they're an animal I never could find it and you know again I have no dog in the fight I'm willing to listen to anything but that just isn't there\nYou look back at the Patterson gambling film and it's you know if people can argue about it all they want as far as I'm concerned that has not been debunked but that that being in that\nFilm looks closer to a gorilla or ape not exactly a match but it's closer to it than some of the creatures or the the beings that that that you're you have drawings of and this and\nThe beings that are described in the in in the uh the new book as well I mean I'm you know they're very close to human like just much larger\nSo when I did with a game on film it and one thing Harvey has the ability yet if let's say somebody goes into a bank Rob the bank\nHas a beard on as a hat on and they're caught on camera leaving Harvey has this innate ability\nTo take the beard off the face seeking the with the face looks like so you can identify the suspect so apply that to the Patterson gambling film Harvey took the hair off the face of the Paterson given by pad\nIt's in tribal decry and Donny ... works like a Native American man\nI guess the argument could be made and probably has been made there are different types there are different tribes which is why some of the descriptions are so different I mean you have you know in the history of the phenomena you have reports of different colors different sizes in your\nAccounts and news clippings from over the last couple of centuries there are male and clearly distinctions between male and female specimens that are seen right\nWell I I think people forget how different humans are\nAh in my presentations at conferences they sometimes will take a variety of photos of Amazon tribal members of people from northern Ukraine or of people from China and I put these pictures up there\nAnd it it's phenomenal how different human look\nIf they are some type of human as I think they are then it it just follows ... with what we understand about our own people\nYeah if you were a space aliens you came here and and went back home and describe what humans looked like a you know you might have some trouble or they can't all look like that you know from 'cause we we bury so differently in these clips\nYou have some of them that are pretty short I ... I don't remember where it is in the in the book but\nThere was a an incident where somebody's camp fire their camp kept being messed with while they're out in the woods somewhere\nSo they they waited in a work in the bushes to wait to see what came and did it and the as I recall the creatures that came it was one or two they were short they were like\nFibers five or six feet tall not to ten or twelve feet tall but covered with hair and they were just kind of playing with fire\nSo think about uh let's say a twelve year old kid\nWho doesn't have much association with fire not a grown adult comes into the fire is playing with it because they have this unique opportunity that's kinda what I was thinking as I read that article from California\nUh I think from the mid Eighteen hundreds and I think it was a hunter that knew something was messing around but he couldn't figure it out so he waited on originally and they came in and he saw this\nAnd the um it's not unusual that hunters and campers and other things in the woods have seen these things doing an unusual things other times they're they're seen them awake playing like kids in the water\nUm it again the behavior that you read about reminds you sometimes have children and especially when the sizes match proportionally a smaller Bigfoot you think well it must be young kid\nThe attitudes are different in different reports to a generally not hostile shy want to get away from people when they encounter him but they can be pretty nasty when provoked a there's a phenomenon it's reported in several these clubs where they throw rocks\nBig rocks that humans disorder to chase them off a and there's one report I think it's I I forget where it is in the book I'll have to look for a of a big put that supposedly killed a hunter right that was the first one you've found\nOut with and you know sometimes I question the credibility of some of these articles because who thought how did they get to those conclusions um was there any evidence left behind these older article or sometimes tough to get to the root of where they came from or how they came to those conclusions\nAnd I don't I don't put a lot of emphasis on that but in the near term I never found a big foot nowadays that conclusively killed anybody and\nWhen I started writing the missing for one one book\nThere's a lot of erroneous information that I have so\nIt had this topic on pick for with missing for one one I never have I've never stayed at that I thought that pick for was involved in these things why because I've never read a credible article implying that they did and since the fall on on books came out all of a sudden\nPeople have started saying oh yeah you know the campsite these campers were killed this was happening and I get these once a year or say and every time I followed up\nI find that it's not a credible source it never happened yet the myth keep perpetuating on the Internet and they're not true and\nSome people believe all you know it's a cover up\nBut as someone who has spent an enormous amount of time in these rural areas with these rural sheriff's deputies\nOf people did not give a damn about what the federal government thinks about their behavior and trying to convince them to keep their mouth shut it's never going to happen\nThey will tell the truth and you're the feds aren't going to be able to keep 'em clamped up so when you hear these stories I hear these campers were killed by something really mysterious if it was happening I'd hear about it from these guys and they say half the time they say it it never happened it's a completely phony story so\nI get emails I I can imagine what your emails or like but I get a ... ah\nJust because people know that we know each other or why doesn't ... go ahead and admitted big with its kidnapping people and I I wouldn't have to say this a day there are some accounts in this book these newspaper clippings where there are references to these huge Wildman carrying all women and children\nYou know there was never any names attached to it though you know no no and that's a that's\nThe tough part of it how can you how can you leverage it as credible if supposedly they were getting\nCarried off whose side and why aren't the name there and if somebody's writing about it than fat\nSeems to be a there are instances where in in these accounts where a humans who are not aggressive and don't take shots at these animals are not only did they described them as a I think it's it's gay they describe ... gay and I don't think it's in the context of gay\nAs we used the term these days but gay humor is what they said like a friendly\nAnd the number of times I have heard a hunter say there's no way I could shoot it it looked to him and it ... I I have never heard of a hunter\nSay oh yeah I had to kill this thing I shot it in the head or it it looked like an animal I've not heard that and I've heard the human side of it from a fireman\nOr policemen credible credible sources that continually say the same thing and it isn't just one time in history goes way back in history or so there's something to this\nGot gotta skew where they said they started looking like him are apes and animals and as you know Georgia's this segment of the big foot world that wants to go out and kill one and\nI don't have any idea why they think they need to kill one maybe some kind of over loaded on testosterone but they they should wake up to the reality they're never going to kill them it's not going to happen\nReputable witnesses who say they saw these creatures are engaging but cows milking cows\nSo this is the part that really really unusual several years ago\nOne of my best friends their parents on a dairy farm\nAnd I started talking to him about this and I said you know I I keep reading that they may be milking cows\nYou know what do you think about that because you know I'm going to talk to my parents\nTo stay on a huge Jerry for and he went out there and talk to them and there's all this I think he's eighty years old this guy's dad and he looked at him and he said you know every once in awhile Mike how will come back from nowhere completely though\nAnd goes [laughter] I don't understand it [laughter] and then the same man\nTold them he says you know every once in a while I'm On the far corner my property something tells me don't turn around get back on the horse or get back on my TV and Rowley and he does\nAnd then the man said well you know every once in a while I found a bucket way out in the corner of the property\nI don't know how it got their dogs\n[laughter] I I think when you get the trust of some of these dairy farmers way out in the middle they are going to tell you the same thing 'cause I've heard it many times\nUm you know there are some funny stories I they're not in this book but I recall but I think you and I have talked about before about big what are what they eat and they'll you know they're kind of particular this image of a big foot milking a cow a sticks in my head but I mean they've been known to eat a lot of berries and different kinds of fruit\nUm do they eat meat as far as you know\nAccording to the tribal people who are seen them take deer et cetera they're an omnivore and many times when the natives are in the middle of the woods hunting themselves they'll come across it you're\nThat stuck up on a tree and like a two hundred and fifty pound here a native ... could have done it and\nThey don't know how it got way up in the tree and it's a tornado or hurricane zone so how did it get there\nThey polite as big wild bend the giants as the book in a moment we'll open up the phone lines are with your calls and questions and comments white flag into the break your own coast to coast am [noise]\n\nFind out more about two nights gifts to log on to coast to coast am dot com\nThe commercial airline industry is booming\nWith this level of demand the industry needs more aircraft technician we are the aviation Institute of maintenance and we trained tomorrow's technician severe of Labor Statistics report the average aircraft technician in the DC area makes over sixty six thousand dollars a year\nVisit trained to miles dot com or call eight eight eight\n... meeting your sample ballot and pregnant with me and he uses the guy he must have since I was on a lot more\n... than in your home your sample ballot provide that information from the county board of lesson plans\nTo continue their fight for independence at no cost\nSo many of them need us and it's time for a grateful nation\nTo step up to find out how you can do your part\nSigned W.

worst seat disaster in us naval history the two authors are Sarah ... an acclaimed documentary filmmaker\nOne of the world's leading experts on the USS Indianapolis he became obsessed with the story at the age of Thirteen and over the next two decades she met and interviewed one hundred and seven of the ships survivors she produced an award winning documentary film about the disaster\nAnd has a lot of other research still researching this story Lynn Vincent is the number one New York times best selling writer of eleven non fiction books with more than sixteen million copies in she's a veteran journalist and author of more than a thousand articles has done investigative pieces that have been so I did\nBefore Congress and the U.S Supreme Court\nI'm Sarah and Lynn welcome to the program ah I I'm blown away by your book read Debbie here\nHere saying George\nSarah I'd like to start with you how did you get hooked on the story at age Thirteen most teenagers are Thirteen or not reading about the US's Indianapolis\nWell actually it was a documentary that I saw um I was watching it with my dad it was about the Pacific war and they reduced the story of the ship to a single line which was it was a ship that carry the bomb in sunk and add to know more about it and\nSo you know at the time there was no Google or anything like that so I actually had to go to the library [laughter] imagine that\nAnd you know through looking to what was available at the library I still really couldn't find anything so I thought if someone's got to tell the story you know from what I did learn about it it was very interesting and I think there was a lot of mystery surrounding it and so I\nYou know I thought out what I could but thought you know someone will tell the story before I'm old enough to do it and you know flash forward graduated from college and then we'll know ones pulled the story and you know the right way\nSo I sought out the survivors and found Paul Murphy who is the chairman of the survivors organization at the time and he invited me to a reunion\nAnd that's where I actually got to meet the men who survived Indianapolis and I mean you know I was\nA kid who was a meeting her heroes for the first time and they exceeded all expectations and they took me and kind of became like family so you know they have a couple of years later after I had spent time with them and visit them at their homes\nThey asked me to be their storyteller and that's kind of the cliff notes version of it\nAnd Lynn for you how did you uh hook up with zero on working on this project you've done so many other books I I Would imagine that being able to write the true story and correct wide and greet misperceptions a and strike a blow for justice for the\nFor some of the key characters would be an amazing draw for you\nWell it was a very exciting project for me the way I got involved was I had actually been praying I'm I Do pray that my work and I had been praying to have\nAn opportunity to work on an icon of World War two stories\nAnd all of a sudden in two thousand eleven out of the blue I get this email from this young filmmakers mean Sarah Vladeck\nWell what there it didn't say about her journey with Indianapolis with that I'm In being Indianapolis a storyteller she wanted to render the story as a screenplay and she actually did that she wrote a an eight part miniseries than she fits that two major\nProduction company and they said hey this is the best thing we've seen in Santa feathers but we only face mini series on foot\nSo you're going to need the right stuff while she and a screenwriter I don't know how to write stuff so very family and friends she read that and and they've contact with me\nAnd um she didn't know number one that I Am and maybe veterans who didn't know that I had been praying for an opportunity to do a story that's like this one um [noise] and\nMy only problem was is that all she was wanting within five and I wanted to help her write the book\nBell or my joke is is that I had to figure out how to manipulate or into letting helper but a\nEventually over the course of several months we finally met and then ah we agreed to work on it together and we didn't really get started in earnest until twenty four and um and then when we did it like a project pick a three and a half years\nTo Syria where you are on a campaign to right or wrong that the story had been wrong that a lot of the people who were key players had been treated unfairly is that how you started or you didn't know about that when you started\nI didn't you know like I knew a small part of that um that was definitely part of what I wanted to tell but really I mean the major objective of it was to tell the whole story of this ship you know she'd been reduced to\nThinking story or shark story and no one knew she was this incredible ship that admiral sprints commanded you know most of the Pacific war and the campaigns that he participated in from her deck or that Roosevelt took her on the first cruise\nYou know us acting president ever left the country on so it was so much more like well you know everyone's got to know what an incredible shift this was in what she did a besides being sunk [noise]\nBut I tell you grab ... my father was a at Okinawa and he ... he drove a landing a craft from the ship's took good troops on the shores so of course you know that the fact that the Indianapolis was involved in those conflicts grab my attention I'm imagining him being there and some of the scenes that you describe\nI'm Lynn what do we start with you describe in a sort of the ... the ... version of what the world knows about the the USS Indianapolis\nAnd then we'll go to Sarah to uh give us the version that did you guys have helped uncover\nOkay that would be great um Indianapolis as Sarah mentioned was the fifth the Fifth Fleet flags shed and I'm\nA small park that a lot of people don't know is that she was the flagship at the battle is half an hour where your father drove the running fast\nAnd I'm\nIn the weeks leading up to the the actual invasion she was sitting in the shore of environment and during that time and march

I interrupted you before the break we were about to tell me about the Japanese commander a little bit\nYet a commander lieutenant commander hush I'm Out of\nEverything we tried to present the Japanese point of view in a sympathetic way I'm\nMeaning that they were acting out of there since their conscience conviction and so um we were able to make great and men are passionate and um well with it and then more for published after the war for the night in Japanese language\nAnd it was later published by Henry Holt and the and I hear an American English and it was really\nAn examination of\nJapanese submarine warfare in World War two but written from men or ... point of view and there was a chapter on it voted in Indianapolis that because we were looking at the larger or in the end of World War two in general we were able to really develop its personality a lot\nWith ... cared for his men he was the commander who is very very frustrated with technology on Japanese that marine than really against protocol at the time because Japanese had a very autocratic hopped on military\nYou know and they they didn't know who the sharks were going to attack that was not a real rhyme or reason to it\nAnd so they were always in fear\nOne of those harrowing stories was where you know there were about Fifteen men on a floater net and those are the kinds of nets that had the cork pieces\nOf the net to keep it afloat and then we're spread out on this and just this huge frenzy of sharks attacked and there was nothing left\nAnd so reports like this were coming in that you know and even all the way until rescue I mean part of the rescuers that counts because by the time that the rescue arrived\nThe men were really incoherent they were able to tell or know what was happening by that point in the story but you know the rescuers are reporting that they're fighting off sharks are literally punching sharks in the face to be able to pull men bored\nBecause the shark and ... attacks increased as I guess you know I don't know\nHow much sharks realize things but they said it seemed as they were pulling the men from the water the shirt I'm the attack increased and you know this is\nI Can't imagine how horrifying that'd be I think saying one shark would give me a heart attack and imagine hundreds of them you know one of the sailors reported they were so thick they could walk on their back you know from shark the shark that we're underneath them just swimming there they\nCould have there's stand on them there's one account you have the sailor who you sort of go becoming delirious

off and thinking he was going to wiggling toes as bait to learn the shark fin and catch one and then you know he kind of came to a sense is that the last minute and realize oh this is probably not a good idea but you know he was\nNearly out of his head at this point and put a sock back on quickly and managed to stay safe you know so they\nWere doing the worst thing [laughter] so some of the worst effects Lynn are uh happened to those people who drink the water they just went completely crazy\nYeah that was really chilling to me because you know here you know you can imagine they're they're on their ship ah everyone knows it's\nAlmost the end of the war and they were having this leisurely a sale they think across the Philippine see 'em and then you know the next thing they know they're trying to survive this horrible ordeal these these young sailors who were just playing pranks on each other the day before and then by the second day forty eight hours then now\nWe were talking about the hoarding of water but it's Sara mentioned there were only a sixteen rap\nBetween there were there were four groups within three groups that there were four groups of four rap\nOr three groups that for rats in any case\nThere were four groups of four raft but then the one group split apart on the second day okay that's right so so there were so any\nWater that was available with only available on the raft and so there were only about forty men among all these hundreds and hundreds of men who had any water at all and so by you know second day in and the third day and\nThey were starting to get very desperate from dehydration and so\nThere were than men who absolutely knew not to drink the salt water no matter how Thursday they got that there were others who although they knew that the sun and the those are and the dehydration itself with perversely causing them to\nLose their faculties lose their ability to reason\nThat some of them to come to the idea that they could strain the salt out of the water and so you see one sailor holding up a torn piece of his shirt\nA while the other one poured the water through it into the into his mouth and thinking that that would strain the salt out well of course that didn't and then others would you know take mall heard is that the water\nI'm hoping that no one would see them and talk them out of it but then eventually they would just begin gulping it like they were hoping it out of a mountain stream\nAnd what happens with this is a condition called ...\nAnd\nBlood vessels bird\nBlood cells ...\nFrom the brain um brain short circuit just like when a tree branch falls on a high voltage line and they would just go out of their heads and um they died very horrible deaths from drinking the water\nYou know you have the the Japanese commander a who decides oh let's get outta here because he figures there's no way the ship is here by itself something else has to be around you that or it was out of sight all of a sudden and he thinks oh it must have gone away or\nYou couldn't imagine I guess in immediately that it'd sunk that quickly so he leaves\nI'm which is I guess fortunate because they could have surfaced and finished them off\nYou have a somewhere I was a pilot who ends up testifying at the court marshal waiter or an American pilot who saw what he thought was a battle he ended up telling somebody about it but no one paid attention are we going to go to a break in about a minute maybe a ... Sarah you want to talk about that guy\nYeah there was a gentleman by the name of Richard With Francis and he was an army pilot he was transporting a general who had been wounded and you know that the generals up in the cockpit with him and it's a late night patrol you know it's just after midnight\nAnd they see this you know kind of explosion coming from below and\nThere's no reports coming in saying that there is any kind of enemy action so he thinks well maybe this is drills or something of that nature but yeah I guess it seemed kind of out of sorts for him so he said well you know report it and he did actually\nTried to report it a couple of times and you know the army side of things that will let the navy do whatever they're doing just ignore it\nAnd he's still it to you know he asked a navy personnel at Guam I Believe\nYou know hey I saw this should anyone look into it and they said no there's nothing reported in that area don't worry about it and so you know\nThere's actually more to the story with that where you know they his son who you know this gentleman richer live France as he passed away but his son carries on a story and you know there he actually had diary entries of the time and the court and it said when he saw this and it did line up with it but he didn't\nFind out until a few days after when we're ... released about it that he would\nWe're talking about ... about Indianapolis the true story of the worst disaster in us naval history in a moment we'll talk about sort of the aftermath it's amazing that anyone survive but there were survivors and to what came next is a equally amazing we'll be right back\nTo more about just going to go to ... am dot com\n\nThey're not violently from side to side of the rap is a number ... over the edge of ... reached the shura live around twenty minutes after her journey began after a brief flurry of photo ops and speaking engagements Taylor seems cool and she was unable to make the fortune for which she had\nThis week in Nineteen thirty one eight months ahead of schedule your governor Franklin Roosevelt dedicated to George Washington bridge the Hudson River four thousand seven hundred and sixty foot long suspension bridge the longest in the world is the time connected Fort Lee New Jersey was Washington Heights in New York City one year later you to carry five million car you'll\nBe we wish dot org now to help ground more my changing where we can transform large one wish you the time\nYou read you why do you\nFly in and nobody ...

now\n\n\nWe've been since I Wonder if you could discuss for me in a broad strokes are the sequence of improbable events that seemingly combined conspired to make things worse is if things just sort of run through the cracks that made their survival even more improbable\nWell as Sarah mentioned there with the the um\nDeparture message that didn't go through from ... to the Philippines there was a tenant on the Philippines side who had received a message saying that if\nA ... it's a combatant ships arrived there didn't need to be a report made well he wasn't the brightest guy in the world\nAnd that as a matter of fact had received a fitness report saying as much but he thought well\nIf I don't have to reporter rivals of combatant ships I guess that means I don't have to report and non arrivals either and then you know to be fair to the navy the entire focus was on the impending invasion of the Japanese home islands\nSo all of these things along with the lack of a distress signals combined to make it says in Indianapolis slip through the cracks and it wasn't until\nI PV one venture a bomber piloted by lieutenant check when I'm just happened to be flying over the area\nThat the survivors responded in the water\nThere was a very poignant story you tell in the book Sarah ah about these pilots that they dropped all the supplies and trying to get these uh guys on the water or something you hang onto and they're they can't do any more they're out of supplies they have to hit back in there was one guy who's swimming way out\nIn the middle all by himself just swimming is a I don't know where he was swimming too and what he was doing but there was nothing they could do for them\nI mean I imagine that being\nSo terrible to witness you know your did everything you could you find out there's no there's nothing left on your plane to help this loan swimmer\nAnd you know and then I Believe when they got to land they actually found one more life jacket or something they could have thrown and\nYou know speaking to any of these men reading their testimonies later on it affected them the rest of their lives they were devastated about not being able to do more and that was really the sentiment and most of the rescuers you know they were out there feeling like they were playing God you know are these men alive or they\nYou know who do we take if we're in our ship or else the VP the landing craft is full what do we do if we can't fit one more man and he's still alive and you know that was the burden they carried till the end of their lives\nYou know it's war time as we said the focus is on you know Japan and ending the war and a lot of big stuff going on so things did fall through the cracks but uh [noise] is it an accident that the story was kept out of the newspapers until BJ day\nIn well reporters are reporting on at that at reporting on the incident at the time did not believe it was an accident so the rescue occurred\nBeginning on August second uh Nineteen forty five\nAnd the war ended on August\nFourteenth that between the time zones fourteenth fifteenth Nineteen forty five\nAnd they did not announce that Indianapolis had been sunk the newspapers did not release it Washington not didn't Washington did not release it\nUntil VJ Day until they announced that Japan had surrendered and that the war was over so if you can imagine huge banner headlines on August fifteenth Nineteen forty five I mean Seventy two point headlines you know Japan quit the war is over\nAnd then maybe below the fold in a very small article usa Indianapolis cruiser sunk and reporters that time believed that Washington\nAnd the navy specifically did that to divert attention away from this disaster that was you know resulted in the loss of almost nine hundred men\nOn the very brink of the end of the war\nSyria talked to me about the captain McVeigh and what's going through his head and then was the court marshal inevitable couldn't let him slide given that the war had just ended or did they have to pursue this\nWill really there was an enormous pressure from the eight hundred and Seventy nine families who lost loved ones on the ship to have answers to have someone to point a finger at and so you know this is a tremendous loss for the navy and you know\nSo many people and it was a very public you know\nLike Clinton said this was announced when the victory of Japan over Japan\nWas announced to the world and people are out celebrating this in the streets with their families now grieving that their son or their brother uncle is not coming home and people wanted answers and so you know it wasn't obvious that a court martial would be taking place I think on the onset\nBut as the investigation started you know revealing things and who is involved and who knew what was happening and what did happen prior to the sinking and how it could have prevented and maybe not the sinking prevented but certainly the fact that no one knew they were missing and that they were left out there to die you know\nSomeone needed to be to blame\nA lot of people got blamed right\nThere were there were a lot of people who were brought in for questioning there was a quarter of inquiry that was done and you know it's revealing that\nThese are pretty important people that had information that could have prevented this situation\nAnd so really you know\nAt the time these names the you know admiral king Bruins limits and all these\nThese men who were essentially the rock stars of that area you know we won the war and\nIn the American public you know holds these men on this high platform and we can and they are the same time are we supposed to bring them into a courtroom and have them testify in tarnish their name like I don't think that the navy wanted to take that route and essentially you know the captain is responsible for the vessel so the moment that he was\nBrought to cart court marshal there was nothing to do but find him guilty even though it wasn't just\nA limb let's talk about the court marshal or mentioned earlier the unusual step of bringing the the Japanese commander in to testify that had never happened before and then uh I guess the main thrust of the argument against the captain and he was that he failed to zigzag that is the exact thing could have prevented the the Japanese from sinking ship\nThat was one of the two charges on and not only was it unprecedented to bring in commander how she might have to testify but it was unprecedented that a captain with the court martialed at all\nFor having his shit sunk in World War two there were hundreds of vessels funk and captain Charles McVeigh was the only cat and he was court martialed\n[noise] excuse me and I'm\nSo glad he did have to charges against him one was and by the way the navy we we found in a records because we went to the national archives we went to the library of Congress Naval War college uh and so forth and we found these records where\nThe navy was actually casting about to find that charge that they thought would pick 'em and as Sarah mentioned they were all the leading lights of the Pacific war who were involved in that you know\nThe the commander of the civic forces the commander at Guam and these were men who had really been the architects of this new global the power and\nThe state in about well so you know it's pretty incredible the men didn't talk about it that long but then to find out this way but that's you know how your debt served in World War two\nWhen been since ...
