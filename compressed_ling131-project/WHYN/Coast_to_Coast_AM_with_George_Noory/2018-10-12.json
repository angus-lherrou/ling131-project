lectures widely across the globe his latest book that came out in November of two thousand Seventeen zero hour\nHarry what is going on with the stock market in my friend\nOr you know we've been warning you know for years but especially in recent months that were coming into a top either right now and now we've seen signs of that in the last few days or a week and a whole just like a ten to Fifteen Percent correction hair which are pretty close to that\nUm we may make it you know in the next year but but this is the greatest bubble in modern history and it's been extended by six ten trillion dollars\nA free money printed since two thousand nine and now a trillion and a half tax cuts from Trump two trillion repatriated from overseas\nThis stuff just keeps piling in the stock market it's the most overvalued it's ever been even now more than early two thousand the greatest bubble we've seen in our lifetime which of course crashed a\nYou know Seventy eight percent for the tech stocks and stuff\nAnd and this could be the beginning I've got some signs I can talk about and stuff but but this could be the beginning of it and\nAnd this is not something you want to sit through ... you know most of the times stocks go up and then they correct ten or twenty percent that's fine most people should sit through that not I call this a great reset this only happens once in a generation and even more so every Ninety years like a clock and we're coming right on that clock\nIn stocks can be down Seventy eighty Ninety percent and take twenty to twenty five years to get back there you do not hold through this and you do not listen to your stockbroker at this time\nYou buy back in when things hit the bottom\n... you know that's the secret to George a lot of people say well what do I do it might well first of all you can be a high quality bonds and make money which you did all through the Nineteen thirties the great depression when everything else was down\nBut the biggest bonuses it'd be preserved your money or in high quality bonds making some money or or if you're really daring and you're short the market a little bit\nYou got money to buy things when they're down imagine if you could buy the best companies in the world like Amazon or apple or whatever or Coca Cola Fort eighty percent off or Ninety\nOff because they're gonna they're gonna comes out on\nOur dollar yeah oh yeah that will come back and and now we also have demographic research that will tell people which parts of the world which types of companies will come back stronger or not so that's an extra advantage goal you know imagine if you could buy gold at four to seven hundred dollars in next time it goes to four thousand instead of two thousand so\nNo that that's the real advantage when when they correct as much it happens quickly\nThese big corrections happen on and only two or three years and then you get to buy what what my previous book was called the sale of a lifetime that nothing nothing beach that the problem is most people lose all their money or their house goes down fifty percent of their stocks go down ... percent and they don't have any net worth left to buy things\nThe two thousand seven two thousand they subprime mortgage crisis will this be as bad as that time period [noise]\n... well this is worse because what's happened is that we did and we of course we were warning about that George not only two decades in advance on demographics the baby boom picking\nAnd and and and causing a down turn up the greatest boom in history but but also the subprime crisis was the trigger and we also had record debt levels I mean I'm Around the world but especially in developed countries what happened after the two thousand eight nine crash is we had a big debt bubble in emerging countries\nAnd then of course China's been off the charts now for Thirty years and then their dad has grown sixty four times just since two thousand just in the last Seventeen Eighteen years so\nThe low interest rates in the quantitative easing policies of central banks around the world made borrowing easy for emerging countries hate developed countries too but we were already too much in debt so we just kind of like went sideways and didn't elaborate joined it emerging countries want on this free and they added sixty to Seventy ... trillion more\nOn top of two hundred and thirty trillion and now we're at three hundred trillion in debt and financial asset bubbles around the world\nAnd and those are cracking you see turkey blowing up you see Venezuela with hyperinflation runs in trouble\nChina is slowing and and like I said they have the biggest that Bob ... of anybody in any time in history\nWhen China blows that we're we're going to be worse so so my view is though this is going to be worse than the two thousand two thousand nine recession and stock crash because they stopped that with massive money printing they just literally stop that they just filled the pop back up with money that was draining\nThis time more debt everything's more stretch the emerging world is now in debt and they always go down harder than we do and they always have worse debt bubble crashes and stuff and we do so this is going to be worse so instead of uh like I said earlier instead of a fifty four percent crash look for Seventy to eighty per\n... off absolutely

well any time you get a major downturn in a recession or stock crap like that some companies will get under pressure and they will go under or have to go through chapter eleven bankruptcy or restructure and that's a good thing recessions are necessary the Federal Reserve and government the recession's bad thing they're\nGood things um but and then you want to buy the company that survive you know we had the dot com crash that was a super bubble I mean the tech bubble took five years to build but the dot com crash came in the last year and a half\nUp six to seven times kind of like the bitcoin bubble here recently cracked and a lot of companies were not as well which what were the survivors will companies like apple and Amazon if you'd upon Amazon there oh my God I was\nFive and ten years that we used to have both parties used to be more centrist not that far apart now they are extreme far apart there's the far right\nIs the far left and this is around the world but it's the most extreme here and Trump is playing this like a federal\nThat's why how he won he picked off\nThe far right and and win against the centrist Republicans and then the Republicans had to follow him because he now has the baton and he has all the power so so this is this is this is going to make this I'm much more difficult to social and political level again down here\nTwelve years of recession twelve and I think now Fifteen Percent unemployment after Hurricane Maria no civil unrest these people just aren't like that they're not as polarized down here in the U.S we are polarized this Kavanaugh's thing it was just pure partisan you know the Republicans\nBullied him and the Democrats believed her the men believed him don't women ... I've never I mean it this there was no common sense no rationality it was just\nPolitical partisanship and the people the Republicans hated the Democrats for attacking this guy and the Democrats hated the Republicans for defending him and in installing this thing and cutting I mean this is like\nI mean and and and who's got all the guns in the world we do so so this is really\nI think that that social unrest in this downturn\nIs going to top the great depression where it was more people roaming around in their cars and not having housing and no jobs and soup lines this is going to be different people\nThe the blue and the red extremes are going to blame each other for the crisis to Republicans going to say you damn Democrats let all this debt run up and all this you know free money and stuff\nAnd the and the Democrats are and say Republicans you didn't let us stimulate on up and blah blah blah blah blah\nAnd and and they're going to hate each other and and so I I think that's going to be the worst part of this\nThat we really and and and I really think there's a possibility that there's going to be movements in this time in the civil war I compare there's more to the civil war on the social political level at that time the south seceded from the more industrial an urbanized north they were totally different I mean the north was blue\nThe south has read this time\nEspecially with Republicans in charge them I think there's going to be fact I think states like California or the whole west coast\nOr the whole northeast is going to threaten to succeed from the red states because they can't agree on anything there's nothing that can be agreed on to this kind of an odd thing was the perfect example that no middle ground it's either red or blue you know\nAnd his argument in its argument in hatred in ... on both sides\nAnd and even you know the Democrats are always a nice guy I Know that Democrats are jumping up and down and women you know almost the salt and you know ... senators and in the elevator and stop this ... every body yeah there's a very high tensions and\nI tell you I don't feel that here and it's another advantage to being Puerto Rican I'm kind of like watching on the sidelines to see what happens and then if I Do decide to move back to Florida where I'd probably move 'em\nBack to 'cause we're familiar there and know everybody you know I I Will do it when I can buy a condo there for a quarter of the price\nAnd and and and and but I Want to see what happens first and and the thing about that that the next year also George's this is this is when it's gonna\nYou know it's going to happen or not it it's either starting to happen now or ... or the latest by my calculations with every cycle we have an everything we got it or it's ... it's going to start by late next year and that's going to be a Ninety year anniversary of the greatest\nStock crash in modern history Nineteen twenty nine to thirty two and that is one of many of our cycles we cover in zero hour\nAnd in our newsletters that Ninety year cycle is the most powerful for the biggest what I call you know downturns depressions and the biggest stock crashes and this has happened every Ninety years since the industrial revolution cause the greatest boom and global his\nLaw you know here we have had a couple of guests on who ah say very similar things to what you're saying the timing was off some of them said things were going to happen back last September or you know there was one the fellow who is talking about Jewish prophecy and he called it the ...\nOh yeah yeah I remember that guy and it didn't happen it didn't happen then but it could happen now you're saying\nWell yeah I mean we we're in the same position we're coming into a two thousand sixteen the marketed gone sideways for you were saying you know this looks like it made that finally taught and then\nTrump got elected I mean we turned boys I mean when Trump had that surprise when and the markets were had a two thousand point reversal from down nine hundred to apple loving hundred just overnight and end of the morning I said look this is a reversal this is a tax cut coming and\nAnd all this sort of stuff this is going to extend this boom another year or two another twenty to thirty percent or more and that's what's happened but now we're on the other side of that now we've seen most of that\nI'm an we're running out of tricks I mean what can you do now and the Democrats may when the house it looks likely possibly the Senate but it's going to be much harder for Trump to push his gravy train for businesses\nIt ... if the Democrats get more control and I see the economy falling apart by two thousand twenty at the latest and that\nThat's not going to win reelection I was ...\nI don't think Trump gets reelected and he may not even make it we're tracking Watergate on a forty five year cycle almost to the tea which would say you're about to see the special\nProsecutor get fired up elections early next year and\nTrump could be in trouble by late next year so so either were peaking now or at best Trump holds on and noticed that there were going to peak late next year and see the greatest crash in history I don't see any other two options I don't see this bubble laughing path\nNext to the end of next year but there is there's a fifty fifty chance it's happening now and you don't want to get hit by that and the forty\nPursue we know what's happening with overnight stocks I mean can you tell what could happen when the when the clock opens tomorrow\nYes yes uh China went down a little bit in China made the biggest ... was the only stock market that violated a critical point yesterday it went down from orbit came back up even but it's still violated but the U.S markets looked like the ... going to\nOpen up two to three hundred point them are now that minor compared to fourteen hundred points over just the last\n... stay with us

sixty WHYY end\n\nMan walking back to go to grocery done with us we'll get to your calls as well area within the can you predict on five years from now\n[noise] [noise] yes you know we can predict out decades I mean I was predicting this you know the trouble in the economy starting in two thousand eight back in the late eighties I'm\nJust from the baby boom generation when they were predictably spent and when they would stop spending so yes what we see is that the worst of this downturn in what we call the winter season that started in two thousand eight\nWill be over a bout about probably about late two thousand twenty two for stocks uh two thousand twenty three for the economy will be the worst and and probably real estate out there maybe a little longer real estate takes longer to crash and longer to come back\nAnd then we'll start to see a global boom again from about twenty two thousand twenty three all the way into two thousand thirty six that'll\nBe the next global boom the differences George\nIs that it will be concentrated as it has been bus far but even more so in Asia and especially in India and south east Asia most developed countries a lot of Europe Japan and East Asia have continued bad demographics in the United states has kind of the best house and the bad neighborhood\nOr where our demographics are we have a strong millennial generation but not as strong as the baby boom so we'll we'll be in the middle but yeah we can tell about when the economy will turn around and where it will be the strongest the other thing we the biggest Boston bubble burst\nAll ready has been in commodities and things like oil\nAnd iron ore commodities are down Seventy percent it worse so far oil and iron ore eighty percent there's going to be another big commodity boom and bobble which will be driven by the emerging world and they're the biggest commodity producers and consumers they spent much more of their money\nSo you can buy these metals and things like that everything from gold\nTo iron ore and and and copper and things like that and there'll be an incredible boom and again you just wait for them to go down first so yeah the next\nBut between now and two thousand twenty two twenty three\nIs going to be way more on the downside of after that the world starts to recover and again that's when you buy stuff into the only difference orange or does it\nReal estate has a new factor this never had before because the baby boomer so large because older people when they die they are literally permanent shelters if you want to call it a real estate\nAnd more and more countries including the U.S today and massively in Japan\nAnd places like Germany there's more old people dying and selling homes than young people with the next generation coming and buying so when we adjust for that real estate is not going to come zooming back and a lot of countries like stocks will so and then of course the aging baby boom sectors like health care will do better than other sectors so\nIn our newsletter which by the way people can get on our free newsletter by just going to Harry ... dot com and that's going to be really fun to be in the next year that it it's going to be different sectors the next boom is not going to pay for everything eighty three uh two thousand and seven everything went up the next boom is going to be more selective but there will be\nThe next global boom and and we can tell you when it's going to come and we can tell you about when it's going to peak\nEvery what happens if we ever regional war somewhere what's that going to do to to the economy\nWell you know wars are actually stimulate I've been a lot of ways especially if you're not fighting of people don't realize World War one\nWas the greatest gift ever given the United States Europe was at war and we were supplying them with everything from farming commodity products to you know a transportation automobiles are tanks and everything we became a major exporter to Europe over that\nSo you know that goes both ways but wars tend to cause higher inflation\nWars disrupt things and and uh the great depression was followed by World War two the disruption or around the world that makes people angry as we're seeing now and even worse this time\nAnd then when things get scarce and there was a fixed pie countries tend to fight over things we this trade war and we said this and that zero our book you know came out of ...\nOr go this trade war with China and in in a global thing as well this is not just a short term thing and Jack Ma from LA Bob came out just a month ago and said this is going to take at least Twenty years to sort out\nThis is a major war between the leading to countries the U.S and China who's going to be king and that's why China China should be giving in more because Trump's right about this\n... they need us or our trade is three times tilted towards them this is going to hurt them more but it's more important to them because they're the up and coming and they don't want to get in too much because they see this is a long term battle and they think longer term so\nSo I don't know if it's more a trade war but but there's certainly after this downturn coming out of this downturn the the potential for wars around the world will tend to grow\nNot tourists on let's go to Peter and cotton wood Arizona did get things started with us I'm Peter\nHi hey thank you for taking my call this is great I'm sure they're going to be a bank holiday during the crash\nThat's an interesting question what do you think ...\nYeah yeah I mean that definitely tends to happen and and that's what happened in the great depression of course because people don't realize banks can lend up to ten times their reserves and guess what their reserves are ten percent of their deposits and whose money is that that's our money they're pledging they also tend to have you know capital they raise up to about ten percent [noise]\nSo so they're they're at risk or two but yes when when you get problem like this banking system will get in trouble especially when real estate goes down that we saw that in two thousand eight and nine forward\nAnd all of a sudden they don't have money now the new trick and then I'm I'm getting ready to go into a ... city tour in Australia is the big concern there because their housing bubbles already starting to crack a head of ours this time\nIs it banks in Cyprus just said well you know what we need money we're just going to wipe out of the the more affluent accounts were just going to take you know ten twenty thirty forty fifty percent of their count and say look I'm Sorry we need this\nWe're gonna take your deposit and we're going to burn them into equity and are dying bank who wants to equity in a dying bank\nSo this is in in in even in Australia that people are realizing\nThey're not supposed to do that but there's loopholes were in an emergency banks can do that so people have to worry you know you need to spread your money around I tell people all your access money\nOther than you need to pay your bills should be in a brokerage account whether it's in a bank or a brokerage firm on on line from I I prefer firms that are not into lending that's why I like a lot of the online trading firms that\nHave have it in a brokerage account 'cause they can't borrow against that they can't swipe that but they can deposits in savings account so yes this can happen and people\nLost their deposits a lot of people there was a run on the banks this happens and and and and the magnitude of what I'm Talking about\nIs exactly what had happened doesn't happen in a normal recession like we've seen it started to happen in some countries the last global crisis it will happen big time in in in some countries worse than others\nNext stop we go to Keith in Rochester New York He's taken away\nOr Mr ... I Want to ask about Puerto Rico which was already Seventy three billion dollars in for the hurricane struck and because of all the corruption there which is the real reason why the recovery has been slow\nThe former New York governor George Pataki is having to head a committee so that the bondholders\nGet their money back to questions I live in Rochester here where\nA lot of the Puerto Ricans believe it or not or ending up they are lower skilled workers who are not finding work enough tax payers are having to pay for their relief\nAnd uh the you're the first one to say that we're getting the better trained people last not happening up here ah in New York former Empire State and secondly California which is not friendly to business when people flee the state they insist on taking their\nShort sighted left wing politics with them or they go to a place like Texas or formerly all red state which is now only purple or to sum this up ah these people with their left wing politics they're spreading their disease all over the place\nOr anti five the extreme left wing organization has taken over Portland Ore than the official there are ...\nAnti fire run their city and like you to wrap it up here a very conservative guy like me I'm saying flat out we're facing truth civil war and us conservatives are ready to fight and some of what you're saying makes sense but it's much more dire than they were going to be at each other's throats\nAnd a starting with that Puerto Rican example ah and I'm going to say this bluntly if I can too many Hispanics like black Americans vote democratic they will not give Republicans and conservatives the chance and and the same way that all all of these urban areas have been struck\nBetween World War one and World War two with the great depression in the middle with a big trade war with rising tariffs just like we're seeing now everything's happening like happening this works ... it's it everybody does the selfish thing as a country but it works against the whole everybody loses or at least most countries lose\nAnd and that's what's happening now this trade war with China whether it ends up a shooting war or limited like you say in the south China Sea that could definitely be stopped there there's no question there's problems they're Middle East I don't see a major war between like say the United states or Europe and Russia there could be limited because\nNobody's big enough to challenge just the one advantage we have\nIt is there's there is no counter bailing power that could really take us on one on one somebody hit us they would be dead long before we were so I think that's\nKind of a good thing or in in the early Nineteen hundreds of Nineteen hundred no there were major countervailing power that's how you could have World War two but we're gonna definitely have\nA political huge political views this trade war we said in zero hour before this became of it this is gonna last two to three decades exactly what Jack Ma just said and\nThere there could be some physical war but there's certainly going to be huge a political and trade wars and things\nLike rain here each day with us for coming back from final

questions and I want to get a few lick then because I when I started twenty three sixty thinks the path\nI I Do think I mean this is going to have to happen a lot of rules are going to change just like banks may suddenly start swiping money out of more fluent account\nThey're going to have to have forgiveness these loans are going to have to be restructured all loans are going to have to be restructured\nUm except for the most sovereign like U.S Treasury bonds and that may not be but but this is the key to going through this the countries\nThat restructure their debt and we restructured massive amounts of private debt and the great depression it made a stronger coming out Japan never restructured any of their debt and they're in a coma\nOn a mate forever even when they're next younger generation is come along so I I my bet is that they're going to come to a point we're gonna have to say no we have to allow restructuring of student loans there too onerous we went too far and that to me what happened the education establishment I'll even call it a mafia\nBasically overcharging had the greatest inflation next you know of any sector education even more than health care\nThere on a run and win win that got too hard they say okay well if we can encourage student loans then people can afford these higher prices we can keep our bubble going this bubble has burst and and and too many students are never going to be able to pay off his loan so when you have excess loans\nIt's better to admit it just like a drug addict\nAnd then change policies and restructure detox I call it the leveraging go on we're gonna have to forgive or restructure down these student loans however it happens if it makes the changing of the rulings yes I I Would say that's highly likely and the next couple of years\nIn two thousand eight Uri I saw one way to bail out everything would be to give people like a hundred thousand dollars in the voucher to buy some good what do you think\nWhat will you know I don't like money printing except in emergencies like I think they should have done\nMoney printing quantitative easing for the first year in two thousand I like they did just to make sure the banking system doesn't just melt down like it did rapidly in the great depression but to put it on ... or ... you know permanent\nQuantitative easing just perverts the entire system is bad but the second thing I always said if you're going to print money don't give it to the damn banks\nWho got us in trouble and did all this leveraging into rivers and all this crazy stuff in the first place\nJust send it you know send pure to try to get us out of the at least send the money to everyday people send them a check I wouldn't say a hundred thousand but if they just sent everybody at twenty ... every household at twenty thousand dollar check\nThat would have done a lot better for the economy and then in that that would help banks because things wouldn't have been as bad for the economy\nBut it would have helped people instead of the banking system this whole bailout this whole quantitative easing has only made Wall Street stronger only made the rich richer as only benefited corporate including these tax cuts and has not benefited mainstream\nOf the reason why I wanted it as a volunteer as opposed to check the ... because I wanted them to be forced to spend it rather than being you\nKnow right if they don't spend it or do they get you're right that that's much better way the point is to get every day people some relief and and have them spend that money or to stimulate the economy and then that helps that you know businesses and banks and everything but it should have gone to the people and not to the damn banks\nNext up we're going to Harry in Port Huron hello Harry Good to have you\nWell hello there George and that area of that question for you mentioned earlier about the bank and you can't just now but uh the taking the money I I'm wiping my what about credit unions are they going to be doing the same thing or what what's up with those\nOkay I I Would much rather have my money and a credit union than a than a money center bank\nBecause that's where all the leverage is been it was kind of opposite and the great depression a lot of people a lot a lot of the problems which farms were over expanding\nAnd borrowing money and those were in more rural areas and that's where the trouble is and it was rural banks going under more than the money ... this is totally money center bank thing\nAnd and also when you do with bank if governments have takes procreate money or pull ... they're going to do for the more fluent accounts and those going to be in the end the bigger money center banks so I'd much rather have my money and a credit union\nThan you know bank of America Wells Fargo or or ... or city bank and stuff like that\nOkay let's take a call or two before we wrap things up with Harry Dent Hi Barbara North Carolina\nOr tell yeah okay thank you\nAnd I think here I just think that part of one of my questions but the boy asked that are directed and I got one that you might apply in my way around ... why\nI I think not but I'm like hey I'm willing to come back on line ... yup play\nAll about timing\nIt all of that time one of my gardening looming I'm here at talk of that you just answered my question like about the smaller amount so my hearing income that much um I don't have to worry about that so much as ...\nAs a larger account hold her is that what I understand\nYes I mean if they're gonna have to restructure Social Security there's certainly going to take the benefits off on a larger\nAccounts and more affluent people first I mean the everyday person is going to be more protected and whatever's scenario and bank insurance agree that they can insured deposits and they can insure them all that's all right oh deposits are ensure they can't insure everything if you have a major club but\nThe smaller accounts it'd be spread out and a few accounts and you have more money and your brokerage accounts which they can't get at yes you're going to be way less vulnerable than and what happened in Cyprus it was a lot of rich Russians that had big accounts those were the biggest losers those were the ones they hit and of course\nWhen when things go bad people gonna hit foreign deposit there's more Iceland went down and basically stiffed all the foreign depositors in foreign loans and\nProtected their own people so yes the smaller accounts domestic accounts\nAre going to be safer but again I still say have as much as your money in a protected account and your name that is not just the general deposit they lend against those deposits in real estate loans and business loans go back\nThere going against your deposits but if you have a brokerage account with your stocks or bonds or cash in it they can't\nPay they can't pledge doses reserves\nAnd well that's a good

the mental health field a medical degree from the University of Manitoba is a diploma in psychiatry from McGill University and all throughout his entire life\nHe has had many close brushes with that as well starting in the womb\nThese other number of paranormal or a novelist experiences visions pre cognitive dreams auto body experiences encounters with message buried operations is well welcome to the program Dr many basis on coast to coast Dr welcome to the show I'm looking forward to this\nThanks for inviting me\nVery interesting that the somebody with your medical and psychiatric background would be so heavily involved in the paranormal hotter that'll happen for was it the near death experiences that started up\nWell I think it was because I almost died so many times\nYou know when my book the borders of normal first came out many people asked me if the book was based on stories with my patients had told me but my aunt was always no not at all because whatever patient tells the doctor is confidential documents bound by the Hippocratic Oath states that are doctors should not be Pete anything he's told by his patience and I don't\nSo the material in my book was based entirely on my own personal experiences\nPlus stories from my readers and for my audiences and from family and friends and from my own extensive reading research into the paranormal in terms of why I have these experiences I think it is related to the fact that I had so many close calls with that so many Russians that that um you know\nThere's been a lot of literature written about the near death experience\nBut the um term near death experience you know it's going back to talk to him in moody in Nineteen Seventy five so that's over forty years ago that's right now I think he estimated that something like one in thirty Americans is either had a near death experience or know someone who has had one and that's a large group of people\nBut there's an even larger group of people who have almost died but never were pronounced clinically dead and never had the typical near death experience\n[noise] but when I look at how my close brushes with death effected me I see that I have some of the same after effects that Dr moody described in his patients who had the classic near death experience\nIn other words I'm having had all these close calls this death I tend to have a deeper appreciation of life and I I also have overcome my fear of dying and I have found give myself a shift from materialism into spirituality and then they and an increase need to find meaning and purpose in life\nWas that a pretty dramatic shift for you\nKnow not at all I I Would say was gradual\nThe first couple of paranormal experiences I had I was quite young and I honestly I didn't think anything of that might just kind of brush them off you know I just thought well that was weird\nBut I didn't tell anyone about them because I didn't think anyone would believe me and in those days no one talked about those experiences because there was no rational way to explain them\nBut then as time\nWent on and I got more and more of these experiences and then when I went to a um a life threatening illness and and came out on the other side thanks to a stem cell transplant from an anonymous donor oh jeez\nYeah that was that was quite dramatic I'm Better at that point I felt like I Need to share what I've been going through because that would help other people\nIn the ... stem cell transplant so why didn't they let harvest stem cells from yourself\n[noise] [noise] well that's one way of doing it that the the um anonymous stem cell donated it's called an aloe Jeanette transplant mhm with more effective they actually found someone on the worldwide ... computer\nI just feel like I'm the owner bank and they found his name on the computer and he was a perfect match for me\nOr the super ... what was what was wrong if you want to get into that oh sure well I had leukemia ... um\nYeah and I had it for many years well actually I had leukemia for sixteen years and I was in the hospital I had numerous um blood transfusions numerous courses of chemotherapy and then finally the doctor said you can't keep giving you chemotherapy because it's doing tremendous damage to your body\nYou was it was still in remission\n[noise] well you have to be a new mission in order to receive a transplant so they gave me chemotherapy um and I was in remission but then I Would keep having relapses and that's why I eventually they gave me the parents find a\nThat was the person who gave me the transplant she lives in anonymous donation but the rule at the time was that after one year I was allowed to contact him if he agreed to contact them and I did write to him just to thank him for his generosity and\nI found out that he was in the he's the ... was the name of the U.S navy\nAnd when his name came up on the computer he was stationed on an aircraft carrier in the Persian Gulf wow\nSo he was flown back into the donors sent from Washington DC and the team from the city where I live flew down to Washington and took a sample of his themselves and then flew back my city and that's what happened and that was eight years ago and I've been fined ever since\nThen have you still in touch with him the other happened\nYes um I actually met him in in DC and we kept in touch and we've become friends\nThat's amazing you save your life\nHe did I can thank him enough he did save my life and they hear all for them you know he said the way it came about was um they were having a donor drive and one of the bases where he was stationed then he just got in line with his buddies and all is required is itchy swab\nType that's it\nYeah just to ... to get the DNA so that's when his name entered the donor bank\nAnd then I'm years later by name came up on the computer and at that point he's even forgotten that he had agreed to be a donor\n[noise] but then once you know we found out that he was a perfect match for me and he was flown back to the ... center in DC they gave him some injections to stimulate his bone marrow who'd produce more stem cells and they gave him these injections for five days and\nThen he had produced enough themselves so they took a blood sample which contain to stem cells and that was what was brought back to where I live ... yes we've become friends and I just I'm not too long ago\nIn Dr ... the fact that you were dabbling so heavily into the psychic Rome has that help or hurt your psyche has your practice ...\nWell I tried to keep the two things separate I mean\nYou know in terms of the psychiatric patients generally they don't talk about paranormal experiences they have you know serious mental disorders that they need help with and that's why they come to the of psychiatry\nHowever since I have that experience in psychiatry I'm able to help people distinguish between what fake experience and with a psychotic experience\nRight and and and there's a big difference there\nWell absolutely there is a big difference I mean sometimes if a person the something or here's something they don't know what it is they think they're losing their mind but in fact these types of experiences are quite common\nYou know for example um if someone is believed that they've lost it I'm a spouse or a child quite often will be some type of hosts death contact with the deceased loved one\nSo let's say you're a widow might see her deceased husband in her bedroom at night and she might talk to him\nAnd why she might feel his tax on her shoulder or something like that and these experiences are quite common in fact one study showed that up to fifty percent of people who've lost a loved one will have some type of post death\nContact with a loved one even if a person has no belief in an afterlife and many of them don't I mean these these types of experiences are not related to religious beliefs are belief in an afterlife\nUm in in fact you know an atheist and agnostics have these experience as well as religious people\nYou see that everyone is psyche again I I tend to believe you can agree with you OK but uh when you said that what's the basis for that what makes you say that\n[noise] well the thing is the word psyche covers a lot of territory you know they included things such as ESP or telepathy or pay cognitive beams and other things you talk to both types of visions hundred voices and so on that that vision is near death experiences\nSo certain types of fake experiences such as ESP and telepathy are extremely common and a lot of people have experienced that type of thing\nUm for example someone phones you and you're thinking about that person then you say oh it must be fake it was just thinking about you right that's very common um and I think everyone has the ability\nThey're interested to nurture their intuition or their ESP or they have a path a fence but a lot of people are interested in it as I said when I first had these experiences myself I just kind of brush them off I didn't think too much of them was really only after I got sick that I start to think that maybe there was more to it than meets the eye\nWith with the psychic realm out there in the ability to tap into it have you found that certain people are better at it than others\nYes definitely [noise] um well I think the most important thing is whether the person is interested in it and whether or not they are paying attention to it but the other thing I've noticed is that the second ability often runs in families\nHer no that's terrible though or how does he got so interested in philosophy\nShe just always was and there were some things that had happened to her and she just decided to do something to this and she's going to study it and she she went into it and the big white\n[noise] well that's good well I Know there's been some studies done on telepathy at my monitor his medical center in New York where they were studying the to the the the ability to transmit information to people who are dreaming\nAnd in that study they had Sanders and receivers\nAnd the receivers were in a sleep lab and they were hooked up to a needy for um the AG could measure what we call REM sleep rapid eye movement\nAnd then once the ... dream state the senators were given invent and images and they told the country it on the images I Try to send them to me the truth and they found that people were more susceptible to lead to telepathy when they're asleep and it's also true that people are more\nSusceptible to love to see when they're under hypnosis so there are ways to augment leprosy but\nIn my case in most people's cases it just happened spontaneously\nDo you have a lot of patients that have these abilities\n[noise] no I wouldn't say

talking about his work the borders of normal a clinical psychiatrist de stigmatize paranormal phenomenon many let's talk a little bit about the death bed visions and your thoughts about that do you believe they're extremely common don't you\n[noise] that's right a lot of studies have shown that it's it's very\nCommon for someone who is dying to see a deceased friend or relative um that actually happened with my dad when he was in the hospital he saw his late sister he mentioned over there so and so you mentioned her name she was out in the hall and there was one study that was done in a hospice is dying patients and they found\nSo the as you say these ... can be very powerful and and where does this where does this message come from that I've brings up another subject which is sometimes people receive messages and dreams which aren't the cognitive\nAnd who's giving them the ...\nThat's the question like where's this message coming from [noise] you know we can we can speculate you know we can say it's coming from the unconscious or we could say it's coming from something they've read or we can say it's coming from the spirit world\nYou know but some of these\nMessages for example this woman I mentioned who had the dream that should be killed in a terrorist attack where would that be coming from that could have been her fear mhm you know um and maybe it was just a coincidence that somehow when something like that happens it seems to be more than a coincident\nOh there's there was a movie about to a group of people government people who tried to enter the dream state of other government to leaders\nTo to assassinate them and you know the wanted them to die of heart attacks and they were going to put fear into their dreams and stuff like that do you think that really might be going on many\nWell that reminds me of the collapse of the studies that I mentioned that were being conducted at my monitor these medical center in New York is I think people can be more susceptible to telepathy I don't know while they're dreaming while they're asleep I don't know to the point of\nGetting having making someone have a heart attack I don't know if that would be possible if that's ever been done\nWell who knows when people die in their sleep what caused right that's\nRight that's right because you know I sort of take the position that anything is possible you know and I think that's possible although we don't really know and and how\nHow did we know it's right you know um so yeah\nThat could be pretty remarkable\nMhm yeah I was also talking about messages and dreams 'cause I've also had that experience where I received a message but it wasn't um wasn't it the cognitive gene was just a message and I didn't even know what to make of it that I remembered it just clear as day when I woke up this is the message I got\nI I just saw these words that said\nThis is a world of illusion\nAnd the biggest illusion is time\nDidn't Caesar's wife have a premonition about the ides of march\nThat fate\nIn fact she dreamt the night before he was told she dreamt that he was going to be assassinated\nShe begged him not to go to the Senate hey north to please also is this fair told Julius Caesar it'd be where the ides of march which is the fifteenth of march and he he north ... ignored his wife and he was killed so yeah that was a very strong termination premonition is usually a warning\nHow many people don't act on their permission so\nI'd say probably the majority I Would agree because I don't think people believe them they don't believe they're intuition and then they do the water should uh after the fact\nYeah exactly and how many times has that happened I Know\nThat said the majority of people don't pay attention to it because they they think well we live in a you know scientific rational society and we need to think of things rationally and they disregarded things which could be dismissed as superstition is always the fear of being labeled superstitious\nThere was a a movie called let it ride with Richard ... was above horse racing and ... one of his friends apparently really understood who's gonna win the race but didn't back on that horse but on something else some loss\nIn ... in the movie screaming at you knew you knew you knew that's a little like not acting on your permission\nYeah for sure that is yeah and you wonder why I think it's fear I think\nPeople are they don't believe that they don't believe in also they're afraid of getting into something which appears irrational\nTell me a little bit about blind people in a obese and things like that\nWell that that's very interesting story because there's been reports of blind patients who've been blind since birth who have another body experience during surgery and then when they recovered from the anesthesia and they wake up to be able to tell the doctors and nurses\nUm what they thought and what they heard while they were out of their bodies with one patient with blind who when he returned to his body after the surgery was able to describe the color and the patent on his doctor pie and of course the doctor was founded there was another case of a blind patients who left his body during surgery\nI think no he was he was wasn't thirty he had a cardiac arrest and they took out his dentures\nAnd he left his body and ended up serving everything that was going on and then when he when he be covered and they couldn't find where she put it that you\nAnd he wanted his teeth back right\nBack but then then that said I don't know I put them and he said well when I was out of my body I find you put them in that we're over there and she open that door and sure enough there\nThey were they were wow yeah it works it works yeah\nWhat what have you learned many about all of this what do you think it is\n[noise] I think well I think that there's a spiritual component life I have to say that\nYou do I do and you don't think it's paranormal\nWell I think it's related to the I think it ... I think it's paranormal and I think it's ...\nI mean there's certain words that are used to describe these ... these nominate some people call them fake ... some people call the paranormal when people call them spiritual or ...\nOr ... the colder mysterious is well different words that have been used to describe the same event but I think paranormal event and have a spiritual component\n\nYeah but I'm not saying every paranormal event but some do of course it depends on the person having experience how they want to interpret it or what they want to how they want to think about it\nDo you think science should do a better job investigating these things\nOh definitely I think it improves the quality of life for people to feel like there is something more out there that we don't have to live our teen nine to five eight you know day to day lives that there's something more than we don't really know about and I think it should it forward\n... when we come back with Dr many make this we're going to take phone calls your calls you your stories about pretty cognitive dreams and so many other things you've heard us talk about\nHere on the coast to coast they find out more about tonight's gifts to log on to coast to coast am dot com\nIn history this week in Nineteen thirty six harnessing the power of the mighty Colorado River Hoover Dam begin sending electricity over transmission lines sending two hundred and sixty six miles of mountains and desert to run the lights radios and so's of Los Angeles\nThis week in Nineteen fifty six New York Yankees right hander Don Larsen which is the first no hitter in the history of the world series even better there was a perfect game that is there were no runs no heads and no ...\nNo batters reached first base Larson performance angered is dean third straight win against their cross town rivals the Brooklyn Dodgers\nThis week in Nineteen Ninety two Eighteen year old Michele nap is watching television and her parents living room and peak skill New York when she hears a thunderous crash in the driveway she went outside to find a sizable hole in the rear end of her car a matching hole in the gravel driveway underneath the car and then the whole uh bowling ball size media right\nMedia rights are fairly common and media right hitting a car is nice car is after all very small objects on a very large planet\nIn fact as far as scientists know it is only happen twice before once in Illinois during the Nineteen thirties em wants to St Louis and this week in Nineteen Ninety eight the U.S house of representatives votes to proceed towards impeaching President Bill Clinton on charges of perjury and obstruction of justice by December ... council\nHe I Need your head point by the way to find a neighborhood park or green space meaning you ... your body temperature in the U.S play or to\nUse radio five sixty Plainfield news station\nWe fly in and do the wage why NFL ...
