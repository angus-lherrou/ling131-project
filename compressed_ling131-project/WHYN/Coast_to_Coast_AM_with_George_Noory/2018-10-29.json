... kind of a a story or something to put somebody in a costume or a ... an oddity like that as opposed to something that really raised the goose bumps such as story you tell when this book about something called the wind man\nIt's a story from staffordshire England in two thousand nine you remember the details\nOh yeah ... ironically um that was at a place called the kind of chase in central England only about five miles from where I grew up as a kid so\nI Know the area very well and it's a it's a large area a woodland far Iceland\nAnd I'm like certain places around the world that seem to be to the hot spots for power normal phenomena the kind of chase he's just saying you know they become known as window areas where it seems every fit in each brother comes through you know at various times\nAnd this was a particularly weird case but what was intriguing about it was it was taken very seriously by the local newspaper the chase post\nSomebody had seen this um what looked like a humanoid figure sort of literally flying ... would be a better term to use\nOver the woods I'm at a high speed um you know kind of a like a flying mine I'm not unlike I guess the you know the stories coming out of ...\nIn the sixties or with a ... something you know kind of ... in that respect and there were there were a number of independent witnesses who came forward and spoke to the press one of them even spoke to the local police although I don't really know what the police could have done about it but it's um [noise]\nBut it was intriguing that you know you have this spate of weird activity in this area which he's already notorious for sightings of things interesting enough like the dog mine and ah the find some black dogs and also the large black cats as well\nWhat it is you know I'm I think for that reason um you know ... that's the I think that's the responsible way to do it is to sort of look at the day to\n... and ... and that's what I Do I put the diatribe for people to say I mean if I got out and says I tell people if I don't have an says I'll tell them you know they should they should just say ... or ... or or possibility\nUm you know I'm not going to tell people that big forty some strange creature that come from the far side of the moon which you know [laughter] I don't believe he said by the way [laughter] but um you know for someone to specifically states something along those lines is is not the way to go you know\nYeah there's a story in the monster book about something you go that's called that squash and you share that with us\nWell yeah the the the ... is he really strange one and again it's sort of falls into one of the cats agrees that more than anything else is something that\nSort of pops up he's not seen again I'm just kind of I'm just sort of baffles paper that there are a lot of cases like that where um you know something pops up and people who do I want to know who's the facts\nAnd then he'd never seen again but this particular case is an interesting one I'm cutting I pulled Nineteen sixty four in Berkeley Washington and I'm actually quite close to my room there on the witness in mind I'm young man named Brian Khan failed\nI'm a solo these strange ... he was driving along the road\nAnd it was sort of humanoid with a huge wings but\nIt was kind of ... as well [noise] scares me and had the shining a yellow eyes but they sort of the ... the hair angle combined\nWith the large wings um you know the the the ... body and the wings kind of people said oh it's not you know it's not sasquatch because he's got wings but he kind of looks a bit like\n... ... square patch\nAnd um and for a while in Nineteen Ninety four it was actually quite big news in that area and then like a lot of other these\nYou know there's other cases it just sort of became part of the local legend and you know the areas folklore and so\nYou've got a lot of men in black stories women in black story you and I have talked about that before a that might be spooky here than the men in black\nAnd and then some of those cases you know they seem otherworldly just out of place or you know we've we've been accustomed because of the movies are due to think that maybe there are some secret government agents but have you ever had any indications that maybe some of them are\nSort of very human government type operatives who are operating under the umbrella of something like a men in black trying to emulate the the real mistreating and figuring they can get away with it that no one will believe the witnesses who see them\nYeah well I'm going to be honest with you ... I mean I've done five books now on on these phenomena foreign the men in black and one on the women and black and I have to say that the vast majority of all the reports like that don't send anything like you know they stepped out of the Pentagon the CIA all the FBI and say\nI'm a you know nothing like the the concept in the movies they typically are described as looking ... you know go on and the skins live white white\nUm [noise] and people talk about how vaccines have the ability to mind control the personal hypnotized them\nPay for the even talks about when they're in close proximity to them that they fall and sick afterwards almost like a like a soup and actually infection or something along those lines\nAnd um there are cases when the men in black and the women and black of turned up in homes right after paper the news in ... which puts another angle to its\nUm but there's no doubt in my mind again um that's you know this is a real phenomenon but it's not like it's portrayed in the movies it's more sort of like a\nYou know like a gothic horror story mixed in with the X files you know you put those two issues together that's that's how I Would sort of describe they ... the men in black mistreat it's far beyond you know just guys in a black suits walk\nOnly get ... you know I'm asking it into context sort of like with cattle mutilation is I think you know there's there's a lot of evidence that the these animal relations are carried out by something other than just um\nUm humans and helicopters that some of them are truly inexplicable and then you have a whole other wave of them that truly seemed like they are humans that are carrying out the same kind of thing for whatever reasons um this is sort of leading us to where we're going in the next hour to talk about your other book on the alien abduction wells but\nWe're in human agencies and that doesn't mean government agencies but humans pretend to be something paranormal get away with something that's\nAnd they they do it in a way that so that there isn't a lot of serious scrutiny by people like you are people like me or or other investigators\nWell yeah I mean I think you know when you talk about ... you know you've got a really weird and actually a couple of them some rich or perhaps to explain there is a parallel with abetting black guy but in some cases I think the\nGovernment agencies are responsible for them or they think it's a very small gotcha great they really unexplained ones and the way it was\nWhat I think that happened on a few occasions and there is some evidence to support\nIt over the years agencies may actually unemployed elections are demanding black I was amazed to cover their tracks in other words\nMy paper within government you know many black to radio but I don't know what they are but it doesn't prevent them from using the legend among have\nResumes too quiet people who may not want to I've been talking about cases so the government might actually not know who the men in black really are and I don't like to fully\nBut that sort of lead us into where we're heading into the next hour we're going to talk about top secret alien abduction ... what the government doesn't want you to know that ... latest book uh whether or not you believe alien abductions are real the files on the elite abductions are real when I tell ya what might be going on there based on some of the\nReal life a document that nicotine squeezed out of the U.S in the u._k. government that the outlaws take us into the break with maybe the greatest go story\nGoes song ever written a ghost writers in the sky would be right back [noise]\nTo access the audio archives coast to coast am logged on to ... dot com\n\n\n\nMessage do ... if you are considering going back to school I guess the\nFollowing question you need the flexibility to take classes on your schedule\nIraq college credits unique transferred do you want to earn a quality degree from a world renowned university if you answered yes to any of these questions Arizona State university is the perfect school for you\nArizona State university for over a hundred and fifty highly ranked degree programs a hundred percent on line you learn the same degree as you would on campus from wherever you are on your schedule\nPlus assay one line except most transfer credits for information tech school to three ... learned for yourself by the wall Street Journal ranks and he'll stay\nIn the nation from producing the best qualified graduates and white eighty seven percent of ask you grab recruited within Ninety Days of graduation\nLearn to grow learn to succeed and learned at the right at Arizona State university to learn more about ASU online degrees ... school two three five five one seven to C.

George finds hassle\nTrue and bathroom ... all of them had FBI falls out putting on the one of the main reasons pain was because they claimed when\nI'm interviewed by the FBI but yes they ... they are and say Israel eons but they told the FBI that they the Iranians had a governmental governments very different two hours and bordering on\nCommunism and I'm so that really opened the eyes of the FBI to the extent that for example\nGeorge ... FBI file um he's extremely extensively about an inch thick um Georgia ... is about a hundred and fifty pages I'm over ... was about fourteen and so on so you know we have a precedent for the abduction phenomenon\nWith the contact tape papal now\nIn the fifties excuse me in the early sixties things really kicked off I'm with the Iranian abduction phenomenon in September sixty one a with a bacterium Bonnie hill case which is I guess is the defining\nMoments you follow gee when it wasn't the first abduction case on record but he was certainly the one that really opened people's eyes when John full of wrote his book on the case they interrupted journey now in the story of basketball and hail that coming back from a vacation in Canada they say the strange lights in the sky\nAnd then things kind of get waited\nA they don't fail rights they you know everything seems a bit surreal and strange and I get back home and then they start having these weird dreams and nightmares of being taken on board the strange craft\nWould they be strange creatures and being subjected to a stranger and intrusive experiments now what's potentially intriguing is that I found a file in the British\nNational archive on it revolved around among Ronald wild man\nWho was a delivering a vehicle in the south of England and it was like the early hours of the morning about to I Am\nAn essay was driving these vehicles to the location\nThey the lights on the car when I was on the cars started in time to a halt and they should they should become known as the the vehicle interference phenomena where they knew ... what's intriguing is that they\nThey ah British police force actually handed over the investigation because they report to the to the police found it over to a group within the British royal Airforce caused coal they have promised them security services\nAre sort of like the the James Bond they feel like of the of the royal air force I sort of get involved and espionage and counter intelligence things like that\nWhat's interesting is that in the file it talks about how they ... they promised them security services interviewed Ronald wild man of ... to with the with the ... to a halt and the UFOs in front of him and the most telling an intriguing aspect\nIs that he told the police and this is a direct quotes that he was modeled about the time\nWhich is an interesting thing because that's sort of sounds just like you know the whole missing time angle of abduction law in today's world but Ronald while in the fall actually refer to him saying that yes he sold his UFO coming down lights went out of his vehicle\nAnd then he kind of fell to be strange checked his watch\nAnd there was something about it's it's actually you know portrayed completely and the file but he says he was much older by the time which I think you know you put all those aspects together that has the potential for being a significant abduction case\nI think about the contact D's and I remember reading about them when I first got into this subject than thinking\nSort of bemused meant well there were there were a interesting colorful harmless sort of weirdos um\nBut the the more you read about um the more interesting they become a course people like a dam ski then you realize that these guys showing these crazy stories some some of them would say you know they they met these women and went to ... and things like that you have a hard time taking the literally\nBut when you realize that the government is really does followed them around and takes it seriously for whatever reason\nI ... it makes me think of like the Roberts panel where the\nThe CIA scientist studied UFO topic and they include the UFOs themselves are not a threat to national security but reporting UFOs might be because maybe the Russians could somehow manipulate a public opinion is that a justification for going around people like a dam ski bathroom those folks\nOh yeah because I mean Georgia down skis uh first book flying saucers of land they published in the early fifties that that sold him huge fake is gigantic numbers of books were sold\n'em and a a ... went on the lecture circuits are all around the country and he was talking about how the aisle and supposedly had this sort of a communist type of governments um that communism was the way of the future\nAnd the FBI open that file on a damn

in religion and science spirituality and ... church religion new religious movements electronic media and popular culture and is currently a professor of religion at Vassar College his new book other worlds\nSpirituality and the search for invisible dimensions is a spectacular and mind bending a Christopher welcome to the program\nMorning George thanks for having me on the show\nThanks for staying up so late or ... I was wondering the first thing I was wondering when I finished this book was how do you get away with this issue you are a seemingly respectable guy teaching at a grade school and I wonder if you're if you're going to catch grief for doing it\n[laughter] you know it's um yeah how do I get away get away with it it's um you know a lot of people and cultural studies or people who are interested in the study of religion or\nYou know we do we do get a path to study really cool fantastic things right um people um unusual experiences and unusual states of consciousness religious experiences\n... experiences what whatever you want to call them so yeah it is kind of a privilege to be to be a professor and and get a chance to just kind of problem my interest and that's really ... how the book came along um\nIt came out of an earlier book I was working on that look that sort of the science of religious experience and spirituality um but as you know there's something new a new direction by thinking about science and physics and cosmology and how are these sort of fantastic scientific ideas have led to\nUm have led to at least a new vocabulary that people are you now to talk about their death experiences and and the parents and and even after life experiences on\nYou mentioned in the in the beginning uh and of course as a as somebody who studies religious studies and religion and how it interacts with the world and popular culture you mentioned in the beginning how a belief in church or a formal religion organized religion is sort of\n... around the western world but interesting spiritual and spirituality topics or has has remains strong or even increased that that's a that's kind of a challenge for somebody in your line of work to figure out why that's happening\nYeah I think it is I think it is and um you know that's why a lot of us are trying to study these these new forms of spirituality I mean that that was really as you say that was really how I began to book with the puzzle you know the problem which is\nYou know people still an America seem to have a lot of I guess we'll be called spiritual beliefs they ... pretty high numbers in America\nUm believe in and goes to believe in spirits or believe in God I'm and yet on the other hand as you say a participation in traditional religious congregations are affiliation and traditional relate with traditional religious congregations those things seem to be going down\nUm how how can we think about that how can we talk about this you know how how is it the case that\nPeople seem to have a very real sense of belief and other world um and spirituality and the ... are really in the absence of\nParticipation and traditional congregation so I've tried to think about and trying to think well where where people getting that these ideas you know where where people getting their beliefs their ideas about other world and\nI'm kind of a big science documentary person and I'm I'm real you know I'm kind of like a science nerd and an offense and interested in ... book and I think there is there's a lot of sort of fantastic scientific concepts that circulate now in our culture and I think uh you know concepts like\nDark matter dark energy or even thinking about\nInfinity a or thinking about the the multi first with thinking about higher dimension I think all of these fantastic scientific concepts which I think scientists themselves embrace with ... with offensive on mystery and I wonder\nI think those concepts are sort of uh the the bed for for new spiritual connection and I and that's um and that's what I Try to look out of the book\nYou know we we I don't imagine you listen to the program all that often but on this program we talk about some pretty wild stuff and I think that scientists would that our time to normally Georgia through that [laughter] yeah I was pretty wild stuff that I think mainstream scientists generally\nTough time getting their head around a near death experiences out of body experiences encounters with other realities um you know time slips things of that sort of that you you ... reached out to look for a way to maybe make a bridge between science and those kinds of subjects with this understanding of\nParallel realities other dimensions higher dimensions we talk about that those kinds of concepts on the program all the time\nAnd as if it's a given day or a given but we don't really I don't think many of us know I Can't get my head around other dimensions and um it's it hurts to even think about it but you take a deep dive into a sort of\nWhy those kinds of concepts are so commonly held so um\nThat one that was important not only to reach out to people like us to discuss these crazy things but also to science right\nYeah I think so yeah I think so I mean one thing I Try to do in the book is\nUm I Try to try to demystify a little bit the discussion about other dimensions and the and the first couple of chapters the book I I you know I asked the question what what is an extra dimension um and I talk a bit about uh I talk a bit about that and maybe I can just say worried about that for them for the listeners tonight yes yeah I'm going\nTo have a another demand the idea of another dimension is not that I'm not that ... after all I mean we have we know we have we have three directions or dimension three spatial dimensions that we live in and that's linked with and height\nAnd those are are are three directions or or dimensions there's there's an additional dimension that we sometimes talk about is the fourth dimension I'm sin Feinstein in that time so we live in a a four dimensional space time a world and I'm fine I spoke about this but\nSome of the people I talk about in my book talks about an additional spatial dimension [noise] a a direction and space or a dimension in space that's different from the other three so you know we could think of like we could we could draw a line on a piece of paper or a line of one dimensional object has length\nIf you then draw flat square on that same piece of paper it has to directions or dimensions that has links and wet and then you could you could draw cube I'm On the paper or you could hold a Rubik's Cube in your hand and that would be a three dimensional object\nHas three spatial dimensions are linked with and hide and then the then the question becomes is okay what about a fourth direction um or a fourth dimension\nOr in this be a you know this would be an object that has links with height and something else [laughter]\nAnd the the something else as the tricky part something else is the is the direction that we cannot perceive so if there is such a direction to reality or dimension to reality it's it's evidently not something that we can we can see 'em or perceive I'm so this this is the possibility raised by\nMath mathematician and and actually others some philosophers I'm In the\nWay back to the Eighteen century but really the nineteenth century mathematicians raised the possibility right it seems like kind of a strange thing to think about what ... how could there be another direction or dimension to reality\nUm you know and why would there be one well mathematicians in the nineteenth century start to use this idea within the context of their mathematical equations and\nThe reason they do is they want to want to make the mathematics of of the universe of its forces in laws more simple and more elegant 'em and they find that they find that it works um [noise] they find that they find corporate in an extra spatial dimensions\nA fourth visual dimension that the the mathematics of the universe is a law enforcers look better on the equations cleaner they seem simpler and more elegant\nUm um and so on so and in fact just to get forward to today today you still have mathematicians doing the same thing um you still have mathematicians incorporating within the context of their um [noise]\nThere was another space or direction to reality and and I'm\nSo happy I wrote the book just to kind of encourage people to\nThink about the possibility that above our three spaces are three spatial dimensions there might be others um\nThat we don't see we go through our life um you know thinking about our world is the only world\nBut you know maybe maybe there's something beyond\nWell it's a it's fun to to talk about it on to imagine but when you combine higher dimensions and the ... it gets pretty complicated [laughter] um [laughter] I tell you what we're gonna we'll take we won't jump into that will take a break first and we'll come back and get into that\nThe inspiration or some of the stories that you tell about people who are inspired by this idea\nAre very sad I mean people who embrace it and uh they they go through trials in turmoil so in trying to get their head around it as as I have a\n... but we'll we'll get into that in a moment are talking with Christopher white about other world spirituality and the search for

downloaded now\n\n\nWe're back with Christopher white a Christopher I at one of the great things about the book is is how you tell the story about other worlds and our our modern perception of other worlds and how it developed a through by personalizing it you'd tell the story of people who've struggled with getting their own hands around the world Charles hitting as one of those who\nI I guess a brilliant mathematician who went into a deep depression when his scientific use came into conflict with his religious and spiritual views tell his story yeah\nYeah yeah yeah he was his life is is quite a story um but you're right they're they're hinting and there's many others in the book who sort of struggle with the um you know sort of like a habit being raised religious in a scientific time and feeling that they can no longer an or maybe not sure that they can any longer embrace\nThe religion of their childhood and still feeling spiritual for sure and and having a spiritual and tuition and his mayhem\nAnd wanting to find wanting to seek out other ways of of being religious and many of them turned to these you know fantastic scientific concepts like higher dimension and has a new as a new more scientific way of thinking about\nUm you know the existence of other spiritual up levels are worlds to reality I Am hesitant in terms of an interesting story as you say he he grows up he goes Oxford he\nHe falls into this kind of depression he's not sure about anything anymore and then he\nHe makes he makes a move that I think not a lot of people would make [laughter] All right and the situation as he he embraces mathematics and geometry as a kind of a\nHe kinda hangs onto that as the only sure thing that there's a way in which the map provide certainty onto him but I think is his story a little bit unusual in that sense but then he developed\nThat um that our our regular everyday consciousness doesn't have any and he uses a lot of scientific ideas that we can talk about if you want to how he does it but he has a has a set of scientific ideas that he that he uses to think about how this might be possible how could the dreaming self\nBe able to have these powers and be able to lift itself off of our timeline and see\nSee I'm into the future and you write these ideas have been a book\nCalled an experiment with time the book is from Nineteen twenty seven it becomes a kind of a best seller and a lot of people\nA lot of people\nIn Europe and America read the book and get interested in thinking about their dreams as somehow predicting the future and you know like sometimes give talks about this in different places and I always have audience members come up to me I always have people emailing me saying oh I'd had dreams like that\nUm so you know it seems to be a fairly common experience actually that people in dreams seem to get glimpses of things that then happen a than happen in real life\nAnd then you have experiences where people are not sleeping there not dreaming and they happened in a while they're awake at time slips or day job blue or were they seem to be in some other reality and then they come back and this one side of the audio ...\nWhat's the how do you how does that fit into the framework that you explore in this book\nYeah yeah exactly I talk about some of those experiences as well so in that chapter six um\nAnd then a little bit in the chapter on cs Lewis I'm as well and then I have a chapter on Madeleine L'Engle right who's the the famous writer of wrinkle in time just recently a movie made of that\nOf that book but she talks about time slips um and and time travel um and so on and some of her books so yeah how do they make sense of that um\nWhat time is not linear right my like my president could be somebody else's future\nWell for sure I mean I think one thing that one thing that done picks up on his as you say that Einstein has a new way of talking about what time is which is really counter intuitive and weird right I mean before Einstein\nPeople thought about time as just linear or something that just flowed out of uniform rate right we we have a sense of prime flowing and we have this kind of intuitive sense that time flows forward\nUm in fact though you know Einstein had a number of counter intuitive things to say but one of them was that of the ways that we experience time has probably just an illusion and the product of the limitations of our own consciousness that Einstein's equations for\nFor the universe really lay out something that looks a little bit different but they really lay out a universe that could be called a block universe\nUniverse that already exist so um you know all locations in the universe an all times in the universe\nI'm already exist and they're all laid out in this big block\nWe are we are kind of a passing through [laughter] think through that that block right are we occupy little portion of that block but every moment in our path and in our in our president and and our future and and the earth future and in our son future\nAnd and all of our defending future's all those moments are already laid out in the block at least according to the the laws of physics um and and this is actually discussions Scott if anyone wants to look at it just got to my book but you can also look at Brian Greene book he's a professor of physics at Columbia\nHe wrote a new book called the fabric of the cosmos where he talked about this kind of block universe so I'm\nDone and all of his own laid out what does that say about destiny and free will and that sort of questions that you as a professor religious studies talk all the time\nYeah you're right you're right it it lays out these big philosophical issues right like um faith and destiny and human free will and how we are we to make choices um and so on [noise]\nUm so and we can definitely talk about those issues I mean one thing that done did um and some of the other people in my book did as they thought through these problems was they said you know I'm I think what ... what's happening is that\nYou know the fact that these future moments are already laid out somehow in the block universe makes it more plausible or makes it more possible that you know maybe the dreaming self could somehow lifted itself up above our\nThree dimensional world or I should say ... world right because we have three spatial dimensions and one temporal dimension\nThat dreaming stuff he said and lift up out of that block universe and peek into future moment and done believe that um you know using a bit of Einstein here and a bit of you know him thin and higher space last or is there um that's what he believed was happening and some other dreaming consciousness had an additional\nA degree of freedom an additional direction that it could move in\n'em and and we could talk about that as a as additional visual dimension or we could talk about that is now maybe consciousness somehow can move with an additional degree of freedom but that's what he thought and have you thought everybody\nEverybody sleeping so had this degree of freedom and ... you also believe that every one if they haven't kept a journal by their bed of their dreams and and they followed he had a couple of recommendations for how to how to do a dream journal\nHe believes that if everyone did they would be able to see that all of all of our dreams contain bits and pieces of future events and path that I'm sort of mixed up together\nWell I guess the central question for me about higher dimensions is are there people there and can they interact with us or is it us that's over there we're going to get into that ah those topics as well as near death experiences or to talk about the science is a showman remote viewers\nHow some of those ideas that we have discussed on this program before\nWhite fit into our discussion of other world so the book\nSpirituality and the search for invisible dimensions by Christopher

tell me this in the example of bought land where this uh summer hire dimension being reaches down and grabbed somebody from to the world all them up um could someone from sixty or Seventy or eleven de reached out and grab us and pull us up so we can understand\nThe true nature of reality what do you think\nOh sure I mean I think that you know it depends on how you think about those dimensions and what's in them but I mean you certainly have had\nYou know religious and spiritual people over the last hundred years say things like that right I mean in fact you've had people\nUm even even if we talk about you know God in Christ as higher dimensional um and as being like calmed down and insert themselves into our lower dimensional world just like the fear that that and and uh an avid book a ... so\nYeah people are definitely thought about um\nWhat we say thought about visitors from from our realms are rich will be anger angels or whatever I'm as higher dimensional um and as a kind of hard to metro object ... entire world\nThat sounds perilously close to saying that science and religion could coexist that uh you know that the paranormal leaps good cause\nWith a scientific and scientifically acceptable version of reality\nYeah yeah I think so I mean in my book I Try to put you know a number of different people in the story so I have\nPeople who have let's say these kinds of moments of inspiration or who experienced like a near death experience um and then I have them talking about their experience and then I also have scientists in the book as well and some skeptics I have different voices in the book um\nYou know talking about what the meaning of these events are ... and\nYou know there's not just one story in the book there's a lot of different voices they're trying to interpret\nWhat's happening but you definitely have you know the the through line in the book is is are these people who have these kinds of uncanny experiences are remarkable experiences moments of insider intuition or\nNear death experiences are out of body experiences them and so on and and that they are ... than using scientific concepts to to understand what what could be happening and I think that you know figures in my book like like all of us today I mean I think that\nWe all want to use science you know I think we I think science is sort of the authoritative\nI'm set of discourse is that we used to talk about talk about reality so I think I think that's what they're doing I think you know just like jaded up you've done right to have these dreams that seem to predict the future where did he go you know he didn't he didn't actually go to the Bible at that point to figure it out he went to Einstein you know he went through\n[laughter] he went to sort of like popular science book um\nAnd I think that you know that's one point I tried to making the books I think a lot of us are sort of inspired by\nA man interested and fantastic scientific concepts um\nWell I mean humans humans have been trying to reach a other higher dimensions rather realities for a long time ... would be an example reaching out some invisible world there I'm absolutely yeah I Know a remote viewing\nYeah yeah yeah there's there's all kinds of things that would fit into that you're right and people have been trying to\nTo reach the transcendent uh ever since there have been humans on earth right on ... reaching for something else reaching beyond\nOur own subjectivity on and we talked about dreams earlier I think a through dreams and you know in in the sixties and other times you know Americans used psychedelic drugs to open up a what they believe it was like a doorway of consciousness into another realm and\nIn other cultures you might use other plants or substances are losing the chance to to reach a transcendent but prayer meditation absolutely there they're all different all different different methods\nAh so I'm Wondering if the example of remote viewing where people projector consciousness over space and time seemingly independent of space and time to access information that they shouldn't be able to get that that doesn't that make sense because of the idea of other worlds higher dimensions\nWell um let's see I think I think people have certainly talked about remote viewing and other a ...\n... has higher dimensional because uh you know maybe we can go back to Abbott's book flat land for a minute because\nYou know flat line what happens is you know you can imagine a two dimensional world of characters of very flat right sliding around the surface of your desk they don't they know a length and wet but they don't know that third direction or dimension which is\nWhich is um up or down so when you're if you're a figure in and flat land let's say you're just a flat square and you're sliding around on the surface of your flat world and let's say you look out um\nYou know you look around and and what do you see well if you're a flat square sliding around on a flat world you you actually don't see your whole world you just see a line right let's say a friend comes toward you and he's a triangle and he's fighting towards your what do you see what you just see a line on every everyone and flat land\nCan just see a one dimensional line but what happens when the flat square gets pulled off of this two dimensional world\nUp into a higher space a three dimensional space in the story is suddenly he can see the full dimension ... of his flat world so he looks he looks and he sees flat land before him all laid out and he can suddenly\nA he suddenly has powers a vision that he never had right he can look down at flat land he can see for the first time not just lying but he can see A People's homes he can see into their homes right 'cause he's looking down on the whole flat world so you can see\nHe can see all of his friends whether they're triangles or squares or lines he can see all of their dimensions he can see even inside right and it said let's say he has a friend who's a triangle 'em all he saw before was their line coming towards them but now he can see the whole triangle he can even see inside the trial you can see inside homes\nSo I raise this as an example because some people have uses the say aha you know um\nWell if we were raised somehow in consciousness up into a higher spatial dimensions maybe we could look back on our three dimensional world and have amazing power as a vision\nSo um you know maybe we are just like the square right when raised to hire dimension we would look back on our world and what we see we would see all sides of everything at once you could look down on your home for instance and see all the rooms laid out\nYou know you could see the insides of everyone's bodies you could see the outside of everyone's body you can see the top of the house and the bottom of the house um\nSo you would have a kind of a higher dimensional vision um and so people do indeed use these ideas to talk about things like remote viewing right um or or they use these ideas actually to talk about near death experiences because sometimes people have near death experiences they talked about\nHaving this kind of um having this kind of special vision where they can see things they never saw before [noise]\nSo so yeah and so maybe a remote viewing is a\nA you know is a higher dimensional phenomenon I don't know you know I'm certainly people have talked about it I'm that way and I in my book and especially in the later chapters and an epilogue um is where I talk about sort of near near death experiences and some parents Paris psychological phenomena like like remote feeling\nYeah Raymond Moody is somebody I've met in uh oh yeah I was in an interview and it's just you know he's a trailblazer in in discussing that those experiences in so many people have had and trying to put it in context and this I think this kind of idea makes it easier to understand those experience\nYeah yeah I I looked at his his books to ah he's he's really interesting I Love the book um I looked at as books too because I was studying um near death experiences for like the epilogue of the book in the last couple of chapters of the book and you know what you do find or what I found\nIs that people do use this kind of language you know they it's almost like they talk like the square and flat land [laughter] as as a character you know as a character that suddenly lifted off of\nYou know they're limited world they're they're lower dimensional world into some sort of higher dimensional space and many of them use language like um you know suddenly you there I saw an altered geometry before me I'm an end the dimensions of the room changed and shifted and\nOthers talk about being able to see like in a hospital setting right if someone had a near death experience in a hospital setting others talked about rising up above the hospital setting and being able to see into different rooms in the hospital so once again another case in which\nUm you know you you were raised into a higher spatial dimension and then you can suddenly have this these incredible powers the vision that you didn't have before right you can see through walls right you can see in places that you're not um\nSo yeah people people and Moody's book um and and many others you know there's a lot of literature now about near death experiences they people do um sometimes use the language of higher dimension to talk about what they experienced\nI'm not to say on says the same category but you do a address say on this and the people's attempts to reach a higher power or another world um [noise] you know what's going on with those folks are they is there any legitimacy to that or or do you not
