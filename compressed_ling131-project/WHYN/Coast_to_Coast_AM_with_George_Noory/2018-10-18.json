this was a a deliberate\nHit on the part of some group of Saudis and it looks right now like the Saudi Government we're talking about you know king Solomon and that the defense secretary crowned the thirty three year old crown prince Mohammed bin Salman are all denying that\nThis was the Saudi Government operation which means it's going to be very difficult\nIf they continue to deny that for the U.S to implement any type of sanctions against Saudi Arabia and frankly George I think this news story it's going to die and an ceremony of data and it ended and another few days when that comes out\nAnd then fades away Howard blooms theory John he thinks turkey might have been involved in order to create some disruption what do you think\nNo I I think that uh you know the ... we we don't have to you know really leap ... any other conclusion of the ... was a disgruntled Saudi citizen that was ... you you know was being exploited by beach house\nAnd the Washington Post which is you know is a is a hit man kind of paper where you just if you're if you're anti anything especially anti Trump or\nAnti Saudi ... he certainly got a forum for the kind of invective that he engaged in denouncing the Saudi Government for the last few years and I I think they deal with with\nA ... you know ex pats he wasn't exactly an ex pat but he was certainly living outside the country are you know in a very harsh way and I think they got him once a new online columnist dot com\n... now I have five articles posted jets on the show gave themselves and of course uh we also ah you know dealt

YouTube owned by Google\nWent down for several minutes around seven twenty pm after what seemed like eons\nYou to find the released a statement on the issue saying it wasn't clear at the time what it costs the outage but that about thirty to forty minutes later the website was restored our expert on the Internet luring Weinstein with this war and what do you think happened\nYeah Google isn't going to get into the technical details on the the the outage or actually last that I I guess around an hour and a half and that apparently it was a global outage which is pretty much weird\nWell it's interesting because um but we know that the the actual video stream the people from YouTube from different locations around the world that that's about all coming from one place\nBut there are centralized system of course so the fact that this is a global out it's just that there was some kind of access related problem centrally that caused the than my own case it was actually the the website itself wouldn't even load properly if I were to YouTube dot com or you'd normally get all those little thumbnail\nIt would just get the shadows that would typically appeared before the video with them they'll fill that with the wouldn't actually get the video [noise] so uh it's an interesting interesting kind of situation apparently\nUh there were people tracking where everyone when when they couldn't access YouTube but I guess one of the big porn sites got a big spike\nSpike in activity there which I guess you'd expect some of the some of the other other sites to [noise] um but but it's an interesting kind of thing and I'm sure the post mortem that at the post mortem review that Google conduct of\nInternal you're going to be are going to be pretty interesting\nUses a sign of the times learn when the Internet goes down\nIt's well this is to keep in mind you you too is the norm is I mean the scale of YouTube is is that\nOh it's huge we've got our own coast to coast YouTube channel I mean his big\nRight this is so the fact that it's large means that you know clearly this is one of those quote shouldn't be able to happen quote kind of problem or the other hand as big as it is it is it the entire Internet and it is a very specialized kind of application\nSo I don't think there's necessarily says anything about the Internet at large but it does kind of make you remind it does remind you that there are central point that are potentially points of of difficulty for the Internet they're designed\nTo avoid large scale breakdown but for example if you have problems with a DNS you can have a difficult numbers of people being affected\nAnd you always have to do with your building these systems you always have to think about those well just couldn't happen kinds of

you know where he would do interests alone on student loans by the way now exceeds Ninety billion dollars a year Alan ... the founder of the student loan justice done or group\nHe's an outspoken advocate for the millions of Americans whose lives have been\nTruly ruined by the practices of student loan lenders he's the author of the student loan scam the most impressive ... human history and how we can fight back he's also been selected as one of the seven financial heroes by money magazine back in two thousand nine and here he is back on coast it goes Alan welcome back my friend\nOh yard it's great to be with you\nHave things changed since the last time we talked about student loans that they've gotten worse I bet\n[laughter] oh hell yeah they they have indeed uh gotten worse ah we're probably at it and I think I was about a year ago as we've added around maybe a hundred and twenty five billion onto the tab\nWhich is now sitting officially it about a one point five trillion um but quite frankly it's certainly a significantly higher than that even still there's a lot of loans that that don't get counted\nWell let me ask you about the scam first of all you know if you go and buy a car and it's thirty five thousand dollars you know you've got an option here and that is I'm going to buy that car for thirty five thousand or I'm gonna walk away and look for something else\nWe can have your professional license suspended we can even have your driver's license suspended in some states\nThat will be taxed too you stuff like that\nThat's right yeah um you know your income tax returns will be garnished et cetera so huge amounts of power that no no there are no other lending system has are brought to bear on the bar or\nSo ultimately they will wind up ... um hopefully the government hopes going through a loan rehabilitation so this is where they make payments\nFor about for ten months typically none of those payments go towards the loans just goes directly into the pockets of these third party agents that ... this rehabilitation\nAt the end of the process they wind up signing for a much a new are much larger loan say a hundred and forty fifty thousand dollars\nWill these agents and get a sixteen percent commission on the value of that new loan so in the case of this fifty thousand dollar bar or\nThese agents that that compel them to do this alone rehabilitation get a paycheck for what what would that be sixteen thousand plus it's about twenty four thousand dollars goes directly into the pockets of the servicers\nCheese and the ... these agents are collection companies [noise] well yeah these agents are typically\nI'm large sort of conglomerates and there's four of them they're Sallie Mae navy and there's no net there's depends being charged ... systems agency [noise] uh and there's Great Lakes but there are others as well these\nThese companies own servicers they own collection companies and they also own Geron tours so they also have a lot of legacy student loans from back in the day before a President Obama\nSo these companies make out like bandage they would rather see alone that goes into default rehabilitate than ah than alone the remaining just good said and I should probably say here George to all the people listening out there\nDo not rehabilitate your loans it's a horrible idea or according to Moody's these defaulted loan to rehabilitate they default\nAgain three to four times and they just keep growing oh that's right yeah and if you can imagine say that a hundred and fifty thousand dollar rehabilitated loan if that's the fault again and that happens something like eighty percent of the time that the whole process starts again\nTo stay with us Allen let's talk about if there's any recourse here and again

enough to cover the costs of administering the program\nWhere does the lending money come from that one for the for these loans\nWell the money is used to come from essentially Wall Street because the ... it was private banks that were making these loans are today this money comes from the federal treasury because as I said Obama um federalized all any program [noise]\nAh so the federal tax payer puts the money out a and the federal taxpayer 'em\nAnd let's be clear we're not really talking about the taxpayers we're really talking about the department of education a ended sort of crony contractors that's where the money is going and they they keep that\nEssentially away from the taxpayer and they keep it for themselves [laughter] ah but um so yeah this is a federal program money ultimately um comes from the taxpayer who\nAt this point as I said is making something like Seventy five billion dollars a year in profit\nOr and even making a profit on ... I should add so that's a a something that makes this a predatory lending system by definition\nAre their predatory lending laws in various states\nThere are there are state use three laws are in every state in the union and federal student loans\nAre exempted from all of them [laughter] there are also fared collection practice laws federal um a fruit than lending laws [noise] ah and these again are restricted or completely remove a for the case of federal student loans\nWho came up with this scam\n[noise] well the genesis of this the genesis of this really comes back to sort of a swamp the beltway cup ball of bankers a which included\nA it started with a company called Sallie Mae which was a government sponsored entity back in the seventies [noise] uh and by the way one of your other guests who appears on your program frequently Catherine Austin fits\nYes served on the board of Sallie Mae back when it was actually controlled by the government and she was there right at the nexus of when this company\nWent from being a publicly sponsored enterprise to a holy private for profit enterprise and she can\nTell you many of the stories about people like Albert Lord a bill defender for in other executives at Sallie Mae who had no interest in serving the public and at every interest in making money off of this system so you can point to Sallie\nMae and um they're very deserving also other groups like the consumer Bankers Association [noise]\nUh like many of the state run Gehring tours in the country um like USA Funds\nThese people were all in it for themselves and they saw an opportunity to make money and they did everything they could to make these loans as oppressive as possible and here we are twenty Thirty years later living a under than the fruits of their labor\nWhat do you recommend for parents who use child is ready to graduate from high school and they want to go to college\nWell the the only good advice that I can give at this point George is do not borrow and if you have to borrow do not borrow from ace\nStudent loan company so don't borrow federal student loans don't borrow private student loans from a bank you know that they were they were technically it is called a student loan\nBecause as soon as you call it a student loan federal or private you lose bankruptcy rights are and for federal loans you lose statute of limitations you lose spirited collection practices treated lending a state use three laws all the all the rights all the consumer protections but I mentioned\nUh so really don't borrow is the best advice I can have but if you absolutely have to borrow go to a private bank guinea private line of credit [noise] uh and do it that way because we then you'll have you know every consumer protection that exists for every other type of loan\nWhatever happened to the days of scholarship so they still being awarded to people\nWell you know Georgia of course scholarships and grants are still out there but the colleges have been raising their prices so astonishingly much that you know no amount of grants or even state funding has cetera\nCan keep up with their budget um you know I was just in Syracuse recently in the price to go to Syracuse University is now Seventy thousand dollars a year well I can guarantee\n... per year that's tuition room board books um for a four year course\nFor a four year college and by the way it no longer takes for years to graduate George the average time to graduate from undergrad it's now six point two year what happened\nWell again the colleges are sitting in the cat burglar seat vacant because there's this lending program standing behind the whole thing and the federal government and the other lenders are willing\nTo pile as much dead on the back to the students as possible the colleges have carte blanche to not only raised their prices but also really ... the students out and keep them in college for as long as they can possibly do it [noise]\nSo it's it's the time is getting longer the pre your cost is just exploding and that's why we're seeing these just insane storied where people are graduating with\nYou know a million dollars in debt right there was a story just recently we're losing a guy walked out of dental school with a million dollars in student loans\nNo wonder dental or the belt bills are so high\nThat's right you know and and it really hurts the broader economy when you have one point six trillion dollars in debt you know strapped onto our younger workers just out of college um have to charge a huge amount just to pay out that burden\nAnd you know we're seeing comments from people like Jamie diamond a gp Morgan Chase and William deadly at the New York Federal Reserve bank and many others are about how the student loan problem is really affecting the broader economy I mean when you have Ninety million dollars in interest clicking off\nThat's Ninety billion dollars where people aren't buying homes cars they're not starting businesses killing entrepreneurship uh it's really starting to be filled\nAll right we're going to check in with you with phone calls with Alan Collins when we come back if you've got a

H. Y. N.\n[noise]\nWelcome back to coast to coast Alan ... with us we're going to take your calls as we talk about the student loan scam what was it outlet that made you get involved in this\n[noise] oh well I had a um I um\nI graduated and found myself unemployed underemployed for short amount of time uh and I tried everything I could keep my loans in good stead ferment forbearance cetera uh but what I fell into and what\nA probably forty percent of everybody out there was too long as it's falling into\nA is a lineage system that actually want you to fall and so they will lose your paperwork they will give you bad information they'll baffle em ... and ... your loans to default\nIs what happened to me and my loans very quickly doubled or tripled with penalties and interest and\nAnd so I started doing research and what I found was just astonishing uh I took my my ... my findings to first Fortune Magazine ah and then I wound up top story on sixty minutes [noise] uh and this was a peace with a Leslie stall yeah\nA a piece for which Sallie Mae and the federal government refused to be interviewed I might add a and so it was sort of snowball from there I unfortunately I thought this was going to be maybe a two or three year project\nTo get you know justice on this matter a but here we are low and behold Thirteen Years later [laughter] and Congress has not moved one inch\nAnd I'm hopeful that will change and very near future because the numbers have become just so astonishing uh but you know we're going to need a lot of help from the people out there whose lives this is affecting\nWhy isn't Allen that people who have a rough credits or have a a very difficult time to make payments\nSeemed to be the ones that kept the short end of the stick\nIn by that I mean a you've got these payday loan center outrageous and predatory are that are geared more for people who need some money and you know they're having a tough time\nYou've got the student loan situations and one of the worst icy\nAre these um secondary car market a lenders who will finance people who really can't afford a car because they have to have a vehicle so they'll finance them with just what you said they want to default so what they'll do is\nThey'll say All right I Want five hundred dollars down you can buy this used car\nAnd so the person the poor person gives them the five hundred dollars\nKeeps a car for a couple of months makes payments for a couple of months then defaults the car gets repossessed and they sell the car for the same amount of money if not the ... the ... if not more\nAnd with financing and they do it all over again and they make more money on it\n[noise] yeah that's right you know that that's a great analogy George and you know I I make a similar analogy off and I say you know student loans it's like buying a car\nWhere you pick it out you bite on line and say you know look it's had a great reviews you go and so you buy online you go to go to the dealership and you pick up the car and you're driving out of the dealership and all of a sudden you realize that the car has no breaks and you wind up in the ditch\nAnd you go back to the dealership and you're like hey guys you know as far as know breaks what's going on and they go well hey buddy you know what can we tell you\nYou should read the manual because this car comes with no break you know [laughter] uh and in fact is really what's going on with student loans and particularly is used as you rightly say for lower income people um\nYou know a ... what we're seeing particularly in past ten years or so is these sort of fly by night are expensive for profit colleges are marketing very heavily to um you know disadvantaged uh\nUnder privileged people\nUnder yeah under privileged people people who were born with a silver spoon in their mouth and they're getting a horrible sort of a nonsensical education's the joke a and lo and behold they get saddled with the loans uh and this rex their life um\nI mean they should be getting more interest rates better financing deals but because their credit shot and they don't have the ability to make the payments the way most people do they get the short end of the stick and that's very wrong\nYeah you know it's a it's a real cruel irony and and just in general you know there are means test for student loans in the first place so the only people the people that get student loans and it's about I mean let's be honest is about Seventy percent of everybody who goes to college winds up with student loans but still this is a a um a an economically needy group of people\nWho you know don't have a silver spoon in their mouth and\nHow cruelly ironic is it that is these very people that the Lenny system was supposed to help\nUh and it's essentially wrecking their lives you know the default rate across all borrowers by my best estimates is over fifty percent as\nCrazy eat greasy once once the tuition like in Harvard or Yale\nA it's a it's on a par with the the number I mentioned for Syracuse early as probably Seventy or Seventy thousand Seventy Seventy five thousand dollars a year\nAnd there are even more schools by the way um but uh yeah the the ivy leagues are running you know they'll they'll be up at a hundred thousand per year within I'd say a couple three or four years\nI should have pushed my kids into sports when they were younger so they get scholarships to go to university smart\nYeah that's right well you know even scholarships really won't pay the freight anymore I mean the price even at state schools were seen annual cost of attendance of thirty plus thousand dollars a and you know the scholarships really have an increased uh on that\nScale and and so it's you know unless you get a full ride it's a very tough proposition to go to even a state school these days you know we're we're getting stories from people go to community college and wind up with you know fifty sixty thousand\nDollar she's crazy so this has\nJust gotten unreal um this is not\nThis is not your father's a college environment you know it used to be that you could pay for tuition\nBy working a summer job or maybe a summer job in a part time job during college well you know those days are long gone um the colleges have gotten so brazen with the amount that they charge a and I should say their own salaries as well it's it's just stupid flying\nLet's go to Joe truck driving in Indiana the getting started Hey Joe go ahead\nGeorge high on a good thank you\nGot good news where he's the man a Trump rally over there and laugh at it on the other day yeah there was a big fines they support the seal and he looked right at the whole ... oh [laughter]\nI Love it but uh anyway uh I I I wanted to drive a little bit of a trade school to\nA ... a\nCompany I used to work or I got on egg wildly and when a company went under the under the ... the night and a private plane crashed on a mission to\nSeveral years ago probably about seven years now you know and it was a sad time but ah pretty much going on during the late everybody off\nAnd I was one of those people do so I ended up her job over here and I don't want they wouldn't even let me take a while as fast as I didn't have that little piece of paper saying that I'm there without doing well and I think well over ... years ago and\nYou probably more than ... you had more experience than most people\nAnd I looked at the local school there and they were voting for thousands of dollars that go in or oh I think it was a two month course just don't take well you know it's like they're away\nSo I ended up going out and spend thousands dollars on the grades are learning to drive semi thrive\nAnd then I felt like I got shafted on that I found out that I could have done it for about half the price of\nA let's get your reaction to this Alan what do you think of trade schools\nWell you know even trade schools are participating in the student loan program these days and so the prices of trade schools are getting jak through the roof or as well you know when you have this landing system stand behind these schools\nYou know they can charge almost what they want because there's all this quote unquote free money out there\nAnd so for guys that want to pay out of pocket you know what are they supposed to do they can't compete with that uh and it's just a travesty it's it's really shutting more people out of getting an education even at even provoke tax and other trade schools\nAre as it is you know allowing them to actually go to college which was the intent of the lending program in the first place\nTo go to Gordon sorry to hear the Gordon and Lakeland, Florida have already go ahead\nHey thank you for taking my call 'em I Want to publicly thank gallon he the one that pointed out to me\nThat the lack of bankruptcy protecting encourages predatory lending um and of course a tuition inflation I our already knew that the more you set for died the lungs especially the taxpayer on the hook on an aircraft a dollar by the way because almost ... percent of total debt is college dead OK I already knew to do\nThese are executives from Sallie Mae and many other student loan companies that that are running the place now so uh they have no public a benefit a inspiration they jettison all pretense of actually looking out for the

unified documented there it is if they in turn it around consolidation ...\nReduction program and I'm kind of can turn and right now I'm On a ... fan base repayment program and I have no idea what that is that I was going to ask if you heard of this company or and\nScan Jimmy Ellen doesn't it do you have student loans up their gene\nI Do I Do I got my associates I'm you know trying to work on my bachelors\nBaquet well what ... what these companies do these companies somehow have the ability whether they buy the list or not but they find your name and they know you have a student loan and in many cases Allen aren't they scammers\nYes there are a lot of ... cameras out there and I haven't heard of this UTSA company but there are a million of them and the sounds exactly like just another one where they're looking for two things they're looking for people who are in the fall they can assure through\nThis loan rehabilitation a scam that I described earlier where they\nMake you sign for a much larger loan and then get a commission off the top of that uh or they're just trying to get you to re junior year loans and so we uh consolidate your loans or otherwise refinance your loans into a new again larger loan or and make a commission off of that\nSo I Would I Would rip that thing up because it sounds like it's not worth the paper it's written on\nJames truck driving in Texas first time caller Hi James go ahead sir\nHow they're George it's pleasure to speak with you on your way I loved your reading of upgrading to impose a Phil tell us that job thank you and I'm hoping we hear more of it before Halloween\nThat point don't I'm a very interesting I've I've just had a loan and all for a little over a decade maybe Fifteen Years\nAnd they fell off on my credit report and lo and behold\nThe same week this was just last week I got a letter from a company called central research L L C and hope you don't mind me mentioning mentioning them in particular a but their\nInformation is a hundred percent correct the principal was\nSixty four hundred and some change there's you know they're listed a breakdown of all of a a a cost but I've heard\nAnd I was wondering what advice you can give me do I tried to negotiate directly with the the oh he tried to negotiate with these people I mean there's something like four thousand dollars a year in interest and also a fee\nSounds like another scam Ellen what do you think right\nI mean first of all I Would I Would never deal with a third party collection company you know unfortunately I don't have any great advice for defaulted borrowers because they're truly is known to give other than\nHelping us fight for age are twenty three sixty six and getting out of bankruptcy rates back\nSo that they can't steal from is legally a but certainly don't deal with third and third party collection companies I'm the owner of you're alone is probably either a a guarantor or the department of education at this late date I suspect it's probably the department of education\nSo I mean if you can make an offer to them of a hundred and twenty percent\nOf the taken alone he'll take it all the you know that's something you can do but certainly dealing with a close up you know like like what you describe\nHow did they get the information Ellen like you said they had everything down to the penny how did they find this or a public a clearing house that has all these things out there\nNo more than likely they are sub contractors to either a guarantor or maybe directly to the federal government itself so the information they have is good um but I can tell you the dealing with them is only going to add to whatever price you wind up paying\nSo I definitely recommend I'm getting at the bottom of if you if you want to negotiate find the owner of the note rather than these third party collection companies because they're only going to cost onto the process\nAnd I have a friend that had alone with a company that went bankrupt you never heard from them again well you\nHave to be very careful these are some be loans there are no statute of limitations for these loans so you may think alone went away maybe it went off your credit report like this gentleman but I'm telling you they will come back from the dead and ...\nWhen you release down the line least expect it\nThat's right yeah they they are waiting in the wings to to balance a like a shark or whatever [noise] um that's the thing about not having statute of limitations these things can fall you literally to the grave\nWell what you need to do is just say send me a copy of my loan I'd be glad to talk with you and you know what Ninety percent of the time I bet they don't have ...\nYeah that's right I'm I'm guessing that something like fifty percent typically for order loans is probably even higher than that they do not have the original shine\nProblem [laughter] not at all Allen once again thank you for the information truly enjoyed it up next aliens in

I wrote a million and a half thousand would I think was\nScript for this and unfolding in that way I have absolute control of that\nThen literally I went into a recording studio you know you had it often headphones on and I knew right to it the whole thing\nAnd and then I sat down in front of a camera and did it parts of it too to Cameron in that way in that way although there is a director who's done a brilliant job of putting it all together um micro loan\nI but I was very much in the driving seat having done the script and and in that sense\nWhen we look at the final pro dog\nNo one can well I Can't say gosh this is somehow didn't turn out the way I wanted it because I had my fingerprints on it from from start to finish and that's a departure from a ... it's a completely new role to me I I there are people of course who are used to this\nSort of thing or people like ... or just made a a a great movie but um\nYou know I I was a departure from me so it took me to some interesting new territory\nWhat are you hoping to accomplish with the Williams at the Pentagon\n[noise] firstly\nAnd as I say really to try to\nTalk through some of the the confusion about what's been going on and just tell the complete story from from start to finish but another thing that I've I've tried to do this I think we've probably discussed this before but one of the big problems I think that\nThat this field has is\nIt we know young people are interested in in the subject but they don't go to many conferences and and you know it is difficult to engage with them\nSo by putting this out as video on demand we'd go on to the platforms that the young people do you watch these things on when they stream\nAs many people do these days so it's on Amazon and iTunes and Google Play him food you and video and all those\nSorts of things so the the aim was to take this subject not not just to the conventional UFO conference crowd\nBut but to young people and and another thing is you know it's been a year since\nTermed alone ... had his press conference where he got together with the to the stars of people um and it's been nearly a year of course since the New York times ran a story I I did ...\nUh you know in some ways the story I think has pulled down a little bit so we'd aliens at the Pentagon I wanted to reignite this and put it back where it absolutely belongs center stage and under the spotlight\nAnd how is this organization do nowadays like like you said I I'm beginning to feel as if the momentum is waning what do you think\nThat when when you said the organization I'm E. E. T. I. P. O.\nRight yes um well\nThat's a very interesting question and the answer is no one knows because in in all of this\nThe U.S government has said well he always says\nIn these sorts of situations only as little as possible\nAnd we we really have very few pieces of the puzzle from the government itself which is is pretty much profit because we don't frankly we don't even know whether a tip is still an ongoing project\nI think people like Lou Elizondo ran it of course\nSay yes it is it still has its mission it's still continues he of course all though he's resigning from the Pentagon and still has has a lot of contacts and friends that he he says it's still going now other people I think have disputed that and certainly we have been told that the\nA pretty extreme with this\nAnd in the the the individual who wrote that the cat to fight intelligence assessment on on you effort in the ministry of defense code name project ... he would have wanted to go too far down that road he had some slightly old\nBeliefs as well and there's a passage in the Bible\nIn the book if ... if I think it is where it refers to say as being the print the power of the air and I think he's where a lot of these conservative religious people the idea that UFOs might beat them on it\nAnd there were a lot of religious folks Nick that believe that\nYeah and\nIt's frustrating you know than because and and it almost combing Klee ironic in another way that you know you have a bunch of people in in the the the the the IRA\nElsewhere and and in the u._k. and the ministry of defense you got a bunch of people thought yeah this we're dealing with a real phenomenon\nAnd we should be investigating it researching it in a proper scientific manner and we come up again skepticism you might think well that's fine that's what you'd expect\nUm skepticism is for to Nicole a intellectual a human that skepticism that I think most people\nI associate with that concept it's actually it's a the probably trying to do the trick been skepticism itself I mean it to to have effectively the so called UFO skeptics in the end picking 'em\nSay that they don't they don't believe in extraterrestrial with but they believe these things that the more well it's just in one sense it's swapping one on your plea fringe belief for another really these by these people were skeptical told they would believe that they would\nLeave us in some some great Warren having with angels and demons\nNick we're going to take a break we'll come back in ... more right here on coast to coast or you\nKnow you can get show updates and to do with other coast fans would you do in the ...

Ronald Reagan's attempt to get the star wars technology going some people thought it was to protect us from some kind of alien or intervention\nYes and he certainly made of course those remarks are very famously in front of the U.N Security council when he said I occasionally thing how quickly we\nWe would set aside a difference is down here on it if if we face some alien threat and and of course people read an awful\nLot into those remarks and then they saw the star wars program and they read read a law into that to my own personal view is that that was much more about just trying to win the Cold War and buying crop the Soviet Union which to be fair is exactly the way it pretty much play down\nOh that's right absolutely there's been new still talk of disclosure are you you know I
