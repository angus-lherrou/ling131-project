mystery of the end times finally arrived Bob McGinnis welcome back to coast to coast how are you\nI'm doing well Richard thank you for having me to feeding\nMy pleasure let me throw a couple of items that you very quickly and one is that we are we are hearing that us national security adviser John Bolton is reportedly\nAre pushing the president to withdraw from a treaty designed to prevent a nuclear arms race between us and Russia that would be called the INS for the intermediate range nuclear forces treaty which has been in place since Nineteen eighty seven your thoughts\nOf course the Russians are respected and I think I'm a lot of people would agree in violation of the Nineteen eighty seven I in a treaty because they have\nA not only build practice the youth below strict and cruise missiles that have a range of five hundred to fifty five hundred kilometers in violation of that uh we've tractor cruise missile recall\nThe nine and seven to nine or that has um you know not met the um the criteria is violated the criteria and of course John Bolton is on his way this coming week over to Moscow to talk about that but they're also Richard going to talk about\nA possible renewal of the twenty ten new start and you know President Trump said um you know weeks ago that perhaps\nWe aren't going to renew it and that should be a a a really a a shot across the bow of Moscow ... concern is all that you know that has cut back dramatically a nuclear weapons and\n... to Fifteen hundred and fifty a deployed strategic warheads and about seven hundred vehicle so you know this is important in a world that I Believe has really cross the line to a new Cold War because the old Cold War is all about nuclear\nHolocaust and the threat posed by the Soviets in the U.S\nWe're entering that new area right now\nI Want it also dial back to September when Russia began its largest ever military exercise with three hundred thousand just think of that three hundred thousand soldiers or this was a a a drill with China\nAs a rehearsal for some sort of large scale conflict it was called the Vostok twenty Eighteen drills just this kind of really illustrates how China and Russia are aligning themselves perhaps against the United states\nWell it does and in fact\nA really yesterday you had the two defense ministers from Russia and China met\nAnd they're getting ready to uh jointly head a commission on military technology\nUm that is of course being shared a significantly between the two we just sanction the Chinese for buying a fighter jets from the Russians and also the S. four hundred\nA surface to air missile system and the Vostok Eighteen exercises you indicate I had three hundred thousand\nA soldier's thirty six thousand\nA armored vehicles or at least a thousand bombers some of those strategic bombers um in fact flew off the east coast of Russia\nStraight at the United states you know practicing what I Would consider bombing runs against Jimmy a clear air force base and Fort Greely Fort Greely is where we have\nThe mid range nuclear anti\nMissile capability and we have and we're growing that mostly because of the north Korean threat but of course the Chinese have a rising capability and the Russians has never gone away I\nWant to ask you whether there was an opportunity last after the fall of the iron curtain the end of the Cold War\nWhen\nPresident Reagan had essentially vanquished\nOr when he called the the evil empire the Soviet Union\nA and then later assurances were given to the Soviets or the Russian Federation that NATO would not encroach one centimeter towards Moscow and of course that was violated\nSome might suggest that the United states was poking the bear\nAnd given their\nTheir passion for for for a nationalism in in the former Russian Federation\nUm coupled with the ascension to power of some who might some many who we would suggest is perhaps the greatest Russian leaders since the great\nThat that this was an opportunity last that that that the United states provoked the Russians and they could have been allies but now here we are what are your thoughts\nYou know I think you're correct Richard huh we did ... and of course we've continued to do that they considered a Ukraine or the breadbasket of Russia\nAnd of course they're continuing to fuel the anti key of a civil war which I call in the eastern part of the country and that's after having seized Crimea and of course two provinces in two thousand and eight from the republic of Georgia\nAnd they're pushing back against the Baltics against Poland Hungary Romania or the entire a former Soviet satellite\nRegimes ah that's something that I Know when Mr Yeltsin or the new president after Gorbachev stepped down came to this country met with Bush Camp David\nWe had the opportunity to do more than just give them a few crumbs we could have brought them into the fold and I think that that really is you indicate ... you know

jeopardize our dominance in space our satellites of course the Chinese have an anti satellite capability they're shooting literally for the moon and they're building a capability to\nPut a space station up very shortly now they're doing the types of things that maybe twenty Thirty years ago we as the United states we're\nWe're talking about I'm beginning to do while they're rapidly catching up and you know this has caught our attention that's why you know the president and the Pentagon and wrote a national defense strategy that focus like a laser on Russia and China as untrue competitors\nAre near peer competitors across the board and it's not not just the military it's economic it's diplomatic\nAh it's all these other areas that show national capability and national power and we're finding that our adversaries are are doing quite well thank you\nHow concerned should we be with the fact that Google arguably one of the most powerful companies in the world and you're a monopoly on the distribution of dissemination of information or appears to be in bed with the government of the People's Republic of China and is helping them\nCensor information in that country\nAnd they're manipulating algorithms so that they can monitor your own population\nAnd of course they won't negotiate any longer with the Pentagon on you know those types of things and uses the cloud et cetera\nUm that that's disturbing um you know they are a U.S company and you would think that they would have some allegiance to this country and and not become a pawn in the hands of the communist leadership in Beijing and yet that's exactly what they're\nDoing I supposed to a certain degree because they see a rising Chinese economic power and they want to be part of uh\nOf the success of that a country you know they will you know by a lot of estimates or be the world's leading economic powerhouse by twenty thirty five you know somewhere around there\nUm and unless something dramatically happens in a very different way or they're going to achieve that and they're going to have\nA leverage using what I outlined earlier the belt and road initiative which is pouring hundreds of billions you know maybe a trillion and a half\nAcross the world and arguably at least sixty eight countries where they're buying infrastructure and thereby markets and they're controlling information flow you know I ... to the Internet and what can be used and what can be so they're strategically doing some very bright very smart things\nUh but when you look at their autocratic regimes yeah and their president for life under President Xi and the amendment of their constitution and you're seeing something similar\nUnder putting with the possibility of ruling for a long period of time and the collaboration across all these from\nSharing of technologies and kind of they kind of have to love one another because ah the rest of the world doesn't seem to like them except they're holding to them because they're being bought up to a certain degree by the Chinese\nI Want to ask you about\nSaudi Arabia and how important it is to the United states or to maintain this alliance with a bad actor in a bad neighborhood or given of course they showed the um the brutal slaying of of a ...\nUm and how that might mean there is there or dominoes at play here obviously I'm Wondering what your thoughts are on how we should proceed or how the United states where the Trump Administration should proceed\nAh with with Saudi Arabia and how that plays into all of this a sort of his to Cold War scenario\nYou know it's never simple as that uh there because folks sugary situation is is tragic\nUh but if you've been watching Mohammed bin psalm psalm and you know the crown prince uh you know he's probably been cut down a few notches here recently especially with\nThe so called ... and the the desert which you know he was expecting all these uh donors and investors to come over and pat him on the back and giving more money so we can develop a a true economy that's not based solely upon petroleum\nUm we have a lot invested in the ... the Saudis we have a lot of Americans over there are a lot of technology they're totally dependent upon our arms of course now they could go to the Chinese are Russians but they don't want to because ours typically are much better I think the big question and that part of the world one is oil\nA and and how are they going to use dollars in the future but also Iran Iran is not to be a ... with then of course that their their major adversary against the Saudis\nAnd the Russians in Chinese or a lined up with Iran and were lined up with a Riyadh a regime\nUm there were ... they they've got um you know a way of doing things uh\nThat uh certainly in the west where not all excited about uh but the reality is that um you know a friend of my you know my friend you know what the expression Richard a friend of my enemy is in you know my friend or something like that\nThat the idea being that we we have to have partners in that part of the world it's a dangerous\nGame this airplane we see that evolved over the years in Iraq we feed in Syria you

they're talking nuclear power plant in ...\nUh for these sorts of issues are on the forefront if we banned in the ... now I'm you know they will run into the arms of putting important understands that uh or into the arms of chi and to a certain degree that's\nHappening I'm you know we have to recognize and the dark side of the world very bad things happen uh our our own government has been involved

Robert McGinnis stays with is the book is a lines of evil Russia China the United states\nAnd a new Cold War heads the mystery of the end times finally arrived there had been\nA while I'll just see some older patients with the Russians are particularly um ah well I wouldn't call them rushing regular troops these are more like mercenaries in Syria the United states has certainly encountered were had heated battles with them\nA there have been some near collisions in the south China Sea with Chinese vessels\nHow do you see this or what is the the danger of this breaking out into all out war and perhaps as you point out morphing into the unfathomable uh the end times scenario\nWell certainly the confrontations or on the uptick Richard and we had one here recently with the USS a done Decatur a destroyer\nA in the grave and reefs and the south China Sea the Chinese warship came only a few meters away from it\nAnd just in the last day we've had a couple of B. fifty twos that flew over um you know the contested area and the south China Sea people need to understand that um these islets uh thirty four hundred acres that the Chinese have militarized with cruise missiles and\nHere defense weapons and you know created\nNot only harbors for their warships but also for their jet fighters and their bombers that they practice from that\nThese are claimed 'em by the Vietnamese a Taiwanese as well as the Filipinos and there are six hundred and sixty miles or in that range south of China so this is not just\nNext door to them it's really in the middle of that to see but these confrontations are on the increase uh we've had a lot in the south China Sea East China sea\nOr the Russians are being very provocative at sea and in the air is I've indicated and of course they have their neighbors to the west are terrified to the point that the\nUh polish a prime minister is called for a given to us two billion dollars to forward station armored brigades\nSo that they can be prepared and case uh the Russians do what they did a in Ukraine or Crimea or of the republic of Georgia which is a concern and you mentioned the mercenaries yes\nBack in February of this year we kill a couple of hundred and it's interesting we have a a hotline with the Russian military in Syria and we called him and said are these your troops and they said no and so we've killed them um and that's\nThe nature of mercenaries but they were there to represent the Assad regime [noise] uh and of course uh the Russians wipe their hands with that even though we know where they came from and what they did\nWell Syria uh obviously that looms large in any time scenario a it is is that the most likely flash point as far as you're concerned\nAt this point it certainly is a flash point I Would argue that ah you know if you've got into phase ... thirty eight that we're really talking uh the the Gaga mad dog a and that mad dog could be the country of say turkey I Know it's\nInteresting a friend of mine spoke with a\nA general now president el Sisi of Egypt who told him less than a year ago that he thought that\nAir to one who is the current president of turkey is really a seeks to be the collie and to establish a cow of fat and his statements have been very very um conducive to that interpretation not only within the region but\nYou know the release of uh the American pastor Brunson here recently\nAh was after great pressure we put on him a air do want to cooperate with us but yet we find that he's traveling all over the world he was just two weeks ago in of all places Kern cologne Germany what was he doing there\nYeah he was doing a state visit but he was also dedicating a mosque\nNow that's not very typical of presidents of countries going across the world doing that sort of thing but this guy has\nA and he consistently has had over the years a very ambitious\nThoughts about uh the re emergence of the Ottoman Empire he isn't Neal Ottoman and I don't think anyone that follows him closely would dispute that so\nThat these are issues Syria is you know clearly something that everyone is watching he's collaborating with Russians who of course uh even though there is some friction there that they are working together\nUh and of course they're working against the likes of Riyadh but they're collaborating as well with Iran who has a\nLot of forces especially crude forces there near Damascus and operating even drones threatening northern Israel so when you kind of put the picture together you see the Iranians are certainly the Turks are sort of our lives\nThe Russians and the Chinese and the Chinese Yasser ... beginning to show up and even Syria\nHoping to kind of look their chops and and put together that country once a declaration of peace can be found and they can find a political solution so a lot of players here are confused battlefield uh but I clearly see Syria as part of this\nA long term agenda\nYou mentioned her to one and and I wanted to ask you about turkey did they belong in NATO even at this point\nYou know that's a fair question I don't think so my concern would be one you know if you go back to O. three we tried to put our fourth division through turkey into northern Iraq through muzzle to attack\nSaddam you know a good ally would've allowed that to happen of course had her ... her to won didn't want that to happen they blocked us and we ended up having to\nTake all those troops to who was up through the Gulf into Kuwait um air to one is not being a cooperating of course they're purchased the F for hundreds a surface to air missiles from the Russians\nAre they're being pretty cozy with the Russians of late or the even purchased a long term nuclear power plant on the ...\nFrom the Russians and of course as we've seen elsewhere as soon as you have a operational power plant much like they have a in downtown to Iran\nAnd on the coastline there then you can begin to make a plutonium and that puts you on a glide path to having a nuclear capability and I think that's what air to one wants to alternately\nWell it's just too rich and so the the the the turkey is buying um air defense systems that would be at least under the umbrella of NATO extensively used to protect NATO from Russian missiles\nAnd that yeah because we will not connect our a patriots and other fads to a Russian S. four hundred a that's why there's a\nIt's a non ... we just won't do it uh and that is a major a bone of contention and of course that there are others even though we've tried to maintain good relations with the Turks and up until now you know subsequent to the Nineteen thirties when addicts\nAnd people and they have a long history I Would hope that they will replace their autocrats with people that are have a a more a better sense of history and were were they ought to be going but we're not going to eliminate all the tension unfortunately\nWell another follow from that are positive aspect of that might be a liberalizing Saudi Arabia because before the Iranian Revolution I think Saudi Arabia was far more liberal but the the habits were sort of seen as a counter measures to the she influenced so maybe we'll see\nSome positive effects in in Saudi Arabia as well here's van Morrison taking us into the break with the band low stairway will open up the phone lines questions and comments for lieutenant
