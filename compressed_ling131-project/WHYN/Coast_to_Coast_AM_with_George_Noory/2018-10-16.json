Horwitz with us or one of today's most widely known voices\nOf spirituality Mitch is also an award winning historian longtime friend the coast to coast am a coach and Mitch is a very popular voice of audio books as well his latest the miracle club Mitch walk back\nMuch George great to be here\nAlways a pleasure my friend what you've been up to these days\nWell a today is the launch day of the miracle club which is very exciting for me because it's probably the first book I've written that is strictly practical that goes into techniques and methods and ah it's a big bridge that I've cross with this book and I'm very grateful to have the chance to talk to the coast family about it\nIt's a great title to by the way the miracle club it sounds like a movie already\n[laughter] you know it was a group of a cult explores here in New York City and the nineteenth century and they were dedicated to exploring everything just like you do on your show and I really wanted to revive the spirit of that original group ah their motto was try that that just one more try\nAnd that's really been my informal motto throughout my whole life so I use the term in tribute to them\nHow many members some of that club\n[laughter] that was probably about five of them they were just a little group outside of Manhattan and Eighteen Seventy five while we're experimenting with ... and medium ship and\nTalking to the dead end table rapping and so on they weren't around for very long but they formed the nucleus of a much larger and more influential group the esophageal society which is still around today and which is probably responsible for the whole revolution and alternative spirituality\nThat is amazing too because during that era the Eighteen hundreds it seems like the dabbling in the paranormal was different than today Mitch yeah and they really took it seriously didn't they\nVery seriously and they had the spirit of childlike wonder I mean they were delving into mysterious things and they were looking into some dark places\nBut they were doing it with their sense of just asking themselves what is out there how can we understand life you know it was a period of time when a Darwinism was in the attendance and people were starting to think maybe we've been wrong about\nGod and spirits any invisible world and these people said listen we don't want to throw science out we embrace science but we want to use science to try to experiment with whether we can detect things about the invisible world comments at us and believe it or not with a member of the original group and he talked about wanting to\nConstruct a machine that can help people talk to the dead it's not clear whether edits and ultimately did that but he and a major general Adnan doubled day ah we're both early members\nThat's amazing now tell us a little bit about the ... club and and because it's also a practical guide book isn't it\nIt really is you know for many years I've written and I've been on the show talking about alternative spiritual history the history of the occult but I've always also considered myself a believing historian I experiment with the ideas and the methods and approaches that I write about and I wanted to take the opportunity\nTo write about the things that I've tried myself I Believe very strongly in the powers of the mind I Believe that thought are cause of death I Believe that if you walk around with a deeply held emotionally charged mental picture\nThat is going to affect what happens to you and you can use that and there are reasons for this and I wanted to write a book that we give people concrete hands on\nWhat do you think a miracle is Mitch a miracle very simply put is something that is a radical\nDeparture from all natural expectation and occurrence that breaks away from everything that you could naturally and reasonably expect to arise\nFrom circumstances and I've experienced miracles in my own life the very fact that you and I are talking you know I didn't start reading my own books until I was into middle age I Am currently fifty two years old and my career did not take off\nUntil I was in my forties and that didn't happen by accident that was the mental picturing there was a visualization with an affirmation as well as a lot of sweat equity but I Do believe if you can find a miracle as a radical departure from circumstance miracles do occur today\nHence the subtitle of the book which is how thoughts become reality and you're you're a very strong believer\nAnd aren't you I really am and you know it's funny if you actually take a look at your life sometimes there is a long interval sometimes there is a long gestation period between a thought and the event but if if if listeners really sit back and survey their lives\nThey will find an uncanny ... grew in sea between things that they've thought about and things that have happened to them\nMitch have you found the people who dabble with the dark side tend to do some of the similar things that the positive people do but that's something always goes awry for them\nWell it's an interesting question you know we face these ethical questions of how to use our powers\nAll the time in life you know a person could be completely materialist he or she could be an atheist\nAnd they still face ethical questions\nEvery single day about whether they're treating other people fairly and honorably if you take seriously as I Do that our minds have these extra physical capacities that responsibility becomes all the more that responsibility becomes that much stronger my contention is that however we may feel buffet by\nThe winds and currents of life we are much more powerful than we think we are we have a hand in advance mentally and and often shows up in ways that we don't suspect\nSo my messages also be careful be careful because what you're thinking about absolutely has a practical dimension on your life and on the lives of other\n... before you came on and he uses that he was in Israel in of course great mental list and it was telling us the story and how he was commissioned to help the Brits in a soccer match against Scotland and over the stadium they put him in a helicopter in he was supposed to influence\nThe ball and and I guess when the when the Scottish kicker was going to the ball or a mentally moved and the guy missed it or something like\nThat [laughter] now here's a story about or he's an old or a family friend and he was over at the house hold up my brother in law I've and when I was Fifteen Years old\nAnd I've and expressed all kinds of skepticism and er he said to him do me a favor arriving go into your bedroom and draw a picture and so I then went in his bedroom drew a picture came out and said\nYou drew a house and I was shocked and said that's absolutely true\n[laughter] I Know we had ... Michel delayed astronaut when he was on our program\nWas talking about a tie class episode he had a NASA tie class in the ... or or type pin and he lost it and you can find it\nAnd he was telling or you bought into and out of the sky just out of nowhere they heard upping and it was the tight class that that fell on the ground and came out of nowhere the other\nPart of it the the part that class into the the pointed at the end of it yeah was in ... ice cream [laughter] yellow swallowed it I mean it's amazing villa in there for that [laughter] I was just amazing but\nBack to these miracles and we take calls next hour I'd like for people to share miracle stories with you Mitch if we can but\nBack to the dark side of it and I don't want to dabble in the dark and too much but you know that'd be too but you know people dabble in the dark side the curse of other people they put ... on other people\nIn in a lot of cases those things happen to these people yeah how how come than the dark side has that kind of power\n[noise] well it represents something that's in us you know we we we we are being of of of a broad spectrum\nAnd my contention is that thoughts are ... and whether you are using your thoughts through spell or whether you're using your thoughts through a ritual or whether you are projecting thoughts at other people\nSomething's going to happen there is going to be some effect however one of my favorite teachers never God or to grade teacher in the mind our tradition\nTeaches that the only way that you can project a negative spell or thought on to another person is if that person could wish the same thing for someone else is if that person could wish the same thing for someone else\nIf he or she could not get rebounds to use so in a certain sense well we grew up calling the golden rule is protection against evil forces and I want people to listen to that very carefully because we're apt to overlook familiar things we are apt to overlook simple things\nIf you are concerned about negative forces in your life the golden rule can serve as an enormous source of protection there was an esoteric and a cult dimension to the golden rule that we don't always appreciate\nWell that's absolutely true now why do our thoughts shape the reality of what happens\nAnd lower their blood pressure just based on the thought that they carry with them things that we would have thought were unbelievable a generation ago are being validated and clinical experiments today I think this universe is ultimately mental that doesn't mean we don't live under many laws enforces\nBut if one can understand how much that means your thoughts are more powerful than anything you've been brought up to realize\nIs that the power of the brain or are we dealing with something outside of the physical body\nWe're dealing with something outside of the physical body and I think we could say that conclusively today because we have a natural experiments but the thought change the brain your sustained thoughts will actually alter the neural pathways the electrical pathways in your brain that's demonstrable by brain scan it's literally mind over matter so\nFought changes the brain and fought has to be something that's extra physical that goes beyond the brain\nWoodward's human beings sometimes things work sometimes they don't that Iraq if they don't work what does that mean\nYou know it's very important that that's an extremely important point because people will sometimes try a method it works they're thrilled they try it again it doesn't work and then they feel project one of the things that I read about on the book is that we live within a cosmic framework where we experienced many different laws enforces\nThe law mind is constant as a law must be but so is the law of gravity but you're going to experience gravity differently on earth\nThan you would on the moon around Jupiter doesn't mean gravity isn't there doesn't mean gravity is an operative but it's affected by mass the mind is the same way circumstances are\nGoing to intrude upon how we experience these things so we're working that we experiment very clearly and very carefully\nMitch we're gonna

to\nSelect announcing a reality that you want to select and a great time to use an affirmation that just needs to be spoke it does not need to be spoken out loud a great time to use an affirmation is those few very relaxed moments just before you drift off to sleep at night\nSleep researchers call that the hitting the gothic state it is a state of time when you could not only reprogram your own psyche\nThrough repeating affirmation Z or prayers or holding visualizations but but cyclical researchers have also found that those few moments before you drift asleep at night are prime time\nAnd ask them to protect the path or extra sensory activity mysterious things occur\nWhen people hold affirmation in mind or silently repeat\nThem to themselves in those few moments just before going to sleep at night that is an exquisitely unusual supple suggestible time it's a time that each of us experiences every day you also experienced it just as you're coming to consciousness in the morning\nUse that time that is the prime time for silently reciting affirmation stew yourself\nIn seems to work doesn't it\nThat's been my experience George when people ask me for a simple step to take that is always the step I give them again my monitor is never neglect simple things we have a habit of overlooking simple things used them there's more depth there than one might expect\nOne or some of the positives of mind control methods we should use\nWell one of the things that's most important is writing things down right down your goals\nAnd I don't mean on the computer I mean get out and old fashioned pencil and paper and do it because once you do that you've actually created a physical manifestation so to speak of the things that you're looking for the actual tactile act of writing something I think not only helps\nPersuade you mentally and in terms of your neural pathways of the goals that you're moving towards but you've actually done something empowering you've done something real if you sit down and for a sustained period of time make a list of things that you truly want in life\nAnd you know these are things you want with all your heart there not diversionary but they are essential life goals\nTake that list put it on to some sort of a laminated card or something that you can carry with you look at it morning noon and night think about it as much as possible and when things on that list come to you and over time they will come to you and they may come to you quicker than you think\nJust expressed gratitude and most important of all don't tell anyone what you're doing remain silent but sometimes you share these things with other people and the roll their eyes or they'll say it's nonsense and they knock you off your resolve remain silent make your list carry it with you review it three times a day\nMemorize it and when the results arrive express things that the method we can all do and it's easy isn't it once you get into it\nIt is easy that the the the important thing is to do it with consistency is to do it with silence and has to do it with total stark honesty arriving at a definite aim in life or a ... a small number of things that coalesce\nAround one aim has enormous power an aim is really another way of saying focus and we know that\nWhen you focus the sun's rays with a magnifying glass were prism\nThey become enormously powerful what is a laser other than focused light natural laws are consistent your mind is powerful when it is focused which is why I keep emphasizing and the idea that you have to really\nNail down what you want in a very concrete way and be very honest with yourself that's we're focused comes from\nMitch since you've been doing this have you use these techniques for yourself\nEvery day every single day George\nAnd I must tell you you know I my life has gone in directions that I never could have expected I've done television then narrating\nAnd and and and written many books and articles including in places that are not known\nFor their cult enthusiasm I've written about these topics in the Washington Post the wall Street Journal the New York times I never dreamt that was possible and so I feel like I'm an example of the effectiveness of these\nMethods and everything that are offered to the coast family\nOr things that are protesting myself I Would never ask somebody to do something\nThat I hadn't experimented with myself\nOr you could tell you love doing what you're doing\nI really do I really do I mean you know it's a dream come true in the most literal sense you know Fifteen Years ago this is exactly what I pictured myself doing and exactly what I wanted to do be patient sometimes things happen quickly but sometimes the gestation period is also necessary\nIt is amazing work how people get this membership into the miracle\nGlide the miracle club I used to say that anybody can join the miracle ... he didn't have to\nSign your name up any where there was no magic decoder ring in anything and of course that's true everybody who's listening is automatically a member in the ... of the miracle club but I got to thinking you know speaking of magic decoder rings maybe it would be fun if people had a little membership card so I asked a friend of mine a great artist named Tim boat\nTo draw up a membership card in America club but anybody who emailed me and I'm super easy to find throw my name into Google it'll take it in my website and my email email me and I will send you your own membership card to be in the miracle club you can find that you could folded laminated carry it in your wallet\nJust something fun to have with you to sort of keep you on course throughout the day to keep your thoughts\nSteady and productive so I I thought it would be fun for people to have an official card a designating their membership in America club so send me an email you get America club membership card\nWe're going to take calls next hour with Mitch or what's in of course we will take your miracle stories as well I Would guess Mitch it's surprising how many people have miracle stories overwhelm you know\nYou know we have to understand that life is made up of of of joys and and sometimes great tragedies but in as much as we do experience catastrophes in life and let's face it that's a part of life\nWe also experienced extraordinary absurdly unexpected moments of good news there are in fact times George where we get just what we're looking for and I would say that's more than just the turn of the roulette wheel our minds play a role in\nThat again a miracle is a departure from all expected and all reasonable circumstance\n... will come back with calls next on coast to coast they\nFind out more about tonight's

[noise]\n[noise] [noise]\nIt might come back to coast to coast George story with you along with Mitch Horwitz Mitch told me about the power behind writing down a goal women going for\nIt you know it's interesting when we write down a goal and really\nMan that we pull something out of us that's authentic and that's kind of magic key to all of this material I Would say that absolute passionate intensity is the one the hidden key behind every self help program with it something will work without it nothing happens\nNow one of my contention is that we really need to have one absolute definite chief aim in life and that could be something that we very often resist\nWriting things down can help us with that because if you write down what you really care about over a course of days are over the course of weeks you'll see that it will all tend\nIn one direction and my challenge to the listener is whether you can come up with one overarching goals that facilitates all of the smaller ones what would that be if you can come up with one chief aim you have arrived at mental focus\nAnd mental focus is the open sesame so to speak to everything that we've been talking about\nInteresting work miniature what's with us and Mitch did you get some professional help when you put those together or did you do this on your own\nDough all on my own you know this is really my tribute to the thought of my own heroes and the mental healing tradition or things that they've thought about things that I've experimented with ideas that I came up with myself a you know I view the miracle\nClub is something that we all belong to all of us who are striving for all of us who are experimenter is we're all automatically in the miracle club and my idea was just to create something around which we could all gather and experiment with our mind\nWhat would you say would be a great miracles story that you've heard about\nA great miracles story that I've heard about was a financial miracle I had a friend in New England who was recovering from a very serious disease and he was facing financial disaster he had only one hundred and two dollars left\nTo his name and he was on the brink of losing his health insurance one night I challenged people like challenged people to make a marathon reading of the book George that I Know you love very deeply the magic of believe\nIn ... and ... yeah\nAnd my friend rather than reading the book decided to get hold of an audio version of it that I happen to narrate he listened to it over and over and over for about five days on the fifth day he got a call from an old boss\nWho said to him you know you left behind a four O. one K. account here have you checked that account and my friend said on that you know you can carry thought it was a few dollars and cents\nHis old boss had to have you looked at it there's over fifty\nThousand dollars genes in that account ... yeah I can only tell you that that's what happened and to my friend it truly felt like a miracle that is a miracle it really is you know it's exactly what the experience and it was quite recent that when you least expect it you know one yes\nYes that's why I tell people you know again George it can sound sort of Hackney to say never give up with these things do happen when you least expect it you can always give it another twenty four hours you have no idea what twists and turns life is going to take in as much as life visits catastrophe on us and it does\nIt also visit extraordinary absurdly good news on us and you never know you never know what life is going to take in twenty four hours I always in poor people who feel desperate among other things among other things give it twenty four hours more\nYou are a believer in visualizing before something happens aren't you have\n... absolutely I think that if you can get yourself into a quiet meditative state and we all enter this wonderful drowsy but still conscious and Congress and state just before we fall asleep at night\nEnact in image in your mind enact a scene of something that you want to happen but don't enact it is if you're looking at it on a movie screen and acted as if you're in it if you want to climb the ladder for example don't see yourself climbing the ladder like climb climb you know really feel those runs\nIn your hands really feel the weight of your of your feet pressing on each run as you climb put yourself in a simple scene and then run that seen through your mind over and over again it's important to choose one simple scene in order to keep your mind from wandering because you will find that your mind wanders\nAnd you always need to bring it back if you can feel the emotions\nOf what would be happening as you're acting out that scene like somebody shaking her hand and saying congratulations maybe your boss telling you got a promotion at work\nIn time and time that will Congress ties into reality may be in ways that you don't expect there may be a long period of gestation or an interval but in time it will occur stick with it you were ... harden into fact eventually\nLet's go east of the Rockies to begin Joe when Clinton township Michigan Hi Joseph go

that even a yacht for that I heard a lady and a lot of how well you\nWell good for you but they do happen Mitch don't think\nThey do happen and it's also very important that we pass things on you know what we wish for other people rebounds to us because in effect\nYou know if if the mind is extra physical and then we all belong to some great over mine Ralph Waldo Emerson called it the oversold pneumonia and he'll called an infinite mind\nIn a sense once we've determined that the mind is extra physical we determined that we're all connected that separation is just illusory so what we wish for others were in effect wishing for ourselves and it is at a depth to the phrase pay it forward\nFirst time caller Sharon in Sioux Falls South Dakota is with us now good morning sharing go
