O. two which is a greenhouse gas\nAnd that would warm the planet even more so much so that the frozen water those those glaciers that we're talking about they start to melt they start to flow and this was much Clinton fresh water in those glaciers is there is a north of Mel\nOceans fall I bet\nWell ... planet why there is in those particular glaciers probably as much as to the American Great Lakes [noise]\nUm and the the um but\nYes the waters on Mars that's frozen at all kinds of places would start to melt the dry rivers on Mars would start to flow the lakes\nAnd seas would start to fill up and they would also be rain and once you have that kind of planet with a thick CEO to atmosphere liquid water rain then you can start spreading plants around\nNow if we were using that kind of plants we have on earth now which are only about one percent efficient in capturing sunlight and I'm doing photosynthesis or it would take a thousand years for them to make enough oxygen for Mars to be read the Bible but\nIf we're talking a hundred years from now it's really not too far out to assume that we can do genetic engineering of plants to make them instead of one percent efficient five percent efficient\nAnd in which case this thing could happen much much faster and um so I think Mars is going to be tariffs formed within two hundred years and my guess is it'll probably be done by ways that are more efficient than what I just described to you because they're going to be doing this with technology is we don't know about\nAnd who's going to do with what country\nThe Martians\nOr they're going to do with them so you\nKnow when we talk about competition I don't see Russia as really pushing it space program which I mean they want you as soon as I as a and they bring us back almost set a tragedy a few weeks ago with a couple a cause more than astronaut that had to abort\nBut I see China and India is coming along strong how about you\n[noise] well uh here's the thing I'm the revolution in space flight is really going to put the question to these people I'm a\nThink India's gonna rise to the challenge but now China and Russia gonna both face it a real question\nWhich is are they going to allow private space launch companies my guess the Chinese will because they've seen the benefit of a of privatization in terms of their very rapid progress since the\nMoved away from command economy [noise] um but Russia [noise] the the issue there is not allowing a private space launch companies but allowing space launch companies to believe that if they got started they wouldn't get stolen by the government [noise]\nUm and because you know the Russian government is basically a organized crime I mean\nYou know Russia is not a country with an organized crime problem it's an organized crime family with a country\nAnd uh the the uh and so if if if they are going to have their own space and they're going to need to have them if they're going to be competitive that's the thing um\nHold on Broadway and we're at the top of the hour we'll come back we'll talk more about this at will open up the phone line with Robert Zubrin next on coast to coast they\nSign up now for ... or ... ... email newsletter today a coast to coast am dot com\n\nDr Blake ... is a program manager at the defense advanced research Projects Agency better known by its acronym DARPA says safeguards had been put in place the insects have what we call kill switches we didn't just ask for one kill switch we didn't just ask for to kill switches we actually asked for\nThree Dr ... says his program is intended only for peaceful purposes but in a recently published article in the journal science a group of European scientists argue the program could violate the biological weapons convention and easily be weaponized for hostile purposes something Dr ...\nOn the way you do ... safely and in complete control nice you know combined secure communications with private browser virtual credit card editor by security deters thing you can search and shocked cell socialize put out corruption I think you're probably ... ... email or credit card again use your identity to stay safe secure\nThe mouse you know some warm store today and get one year free\n... wage why they bring with John ... weekday mornings from five to six on use radio five sixty W. H. Y. N. [noise]\n[noise] [noise]\nWell go back to coast to coast Robert ... with us we'll get to calls in seconds Robert we're talking about the other countries that are out there blind to do things in space or how far advanced is China right now\nWell [noise] I'd say China right now I'm\nIs about where the U.S was around Nineteen sixty seven and\nA I mean in terms of manned space flight or you know they've been to earth orbit they I mean there are a bit\nBeyond that I mean they haven't gone to the moon of course on the other hand they did launch a small space station which we did not have them\nDo they have the rockets and the capability to do that\n[noise] to go to the moon mhm um they can have it pretty soon a I mean but the thing is this okay\nIt's once again um there's a new\nParadigm now and then these entrepreneurial space companies which have shown they can do things that a state\nRun space companies can't too and they can do the things that those companies can do in one there at the time at one tenth the cost and if uh other countries took on it uh keep up with the United states right now they're going to have to have their own space access\nNational space programs are not going to be able to match them and um and that means that for example Russia is going to have to come to terms\nWith understanding that they're going to need to have a rule of law there that they cannot have a government at simply steals whole industries for people because I'm no one's going to make it if someone else can take it\nAnd uh so potent once Russia to remain a I'm a strong in space which by the way is a military necessity or if you're going to be a first class power it's right or you have to be first class in space\nUm Russia's gonna have to change and it's interesting I mean\nYou know a a a reason is a ... in a certain I mean ... ... ... the reason why the um the Russian government or promoted mass literacy and the twentieth century illiterate armies can no longer cut it well\nThey're also going to have to go beyond that they're going to have to enter the modern world in other ways and um so that's another good thing that that Iran must has done for the world\nThat's pretty dramatic I think the fact that the privatization as doing what it's doing do you ever see the day Robert The privatization could backfire and all of a sudden some of these companies could go rogue doing all kinds of things\nGo rogue I don't know about ... and all like a James Bond movie where all of a sudden they try to watch a weapon or something like that\nWell I'm I I\nI Know I I I don't think they're going to launch weapons\nOr the um [noise] you know I'm\nA less we hire them to do that well yeah well the one weapon okay\nI mean because what after all is a state but it is a a military force that exists well a presumably to protect its people but also it controls its people by having a monopoly or a near monopoly on force\nAnd um the you know um but no I\nI don't think that I mean it's such a different objection people sometimes have is that uh you know if if space becomes totally privatize then gee it'll just the uh the rich that get to go to Mars well [noise] um [noise] it's frankly easier to get rich than to become an astronaut or right\nAnd um and also I think that um you know if they open the path to the moon and Mars\nIt will get cheaper it will become something that I'm increasingly not just super rich and rich and the middle class and ultimately the working ... to go\nAnd um you know once upon a time you really had to to to be in the high income level in order to fly on airplanes you know into a and now everybody\nDoes it what about proposed\nWe're we're going to do better than the kind of propulsion rocketry propulsion we have today\nWell sure well I'm now that there's two different issues here one is earth orbit and the other is in space propulsion now earth orbit is is a pretty hard thing to do right now the only thing we know how to do is with rockets [noise]\nBut um if we could create air breathing propulsion that can operate at those speeds or they would launch vehicles could become much more efficient because most of the propellant you know in the rocket is the oxygen it's not to feel\nIf you can get the oxygen from the air the way a jet does it become much cheaper to fly to orbit [noise]\nUm that's going to require some um technological advances but you know who knows a\n... you know the next new kid on the block who may ah ah you know knocking on Moscow office a perch by saying well I'm going to do something that you've never done I'm going to create air breathing propulsion too are but\nI'm so take that Mr mosque um and ah because you know there's always something new and then in terms of space travel\n[noise] um [noise] well um\nWe could I mean the the ultimate would be in my view fusion rockets um\nThan is using fusion power to create very high temperature very high velocity exhausts a would allow us to travel around the solar system at much higher speeds and even attempt interstellar travel\nLet's take some calls here for you Robert bleary in Los Angeles to get us started Hi Larry go ahead\nAnd George great show as always thank you sorry Thumper ... to talk about the office after I listen to your show like anyhow\nI'm enjoying the show the light of though it and the idea of the question though in a moral issue as far as Mars I'm Wondering when we get there if we find someone intelligent life do we really have the right to invade like America deal like uh Europe did on the American Indian or\n\nOK well there uh-huh yeah yeah a lot I can hear you sir go ahead Rob a okay All right well here's the thing I'm\nThere there isn't intelligent life on Mars now okay there may be\nMicrobial life and for people to say ah for us to land on a planet and take it over when there's already microbial life there is really a gone off the deep end okay because uh what we did to the American Indians was wrong because they were people\nRight and\nYou can even make an argument that what we did to the American to nature wild nature on America was wrong because you had these magnificent herds of buffalo in redwood forest and all this and and and we destroyed most of that in order to create what we have here now now I actually believe that while we did destroy some things that were\nWorthwhile we created much more and I would not\nUndo the settlement of America but on Mars\nThere are new Indians there are no buys in herds there are no red woods there's just a desert with maybe some microbes in it and and I submit to you that if there have been nothing here when Christopher Columbus landed but a desert with some microbes under the rocks\nUm nobody be picketing Columbus Day parades today\nRobert de ... we were talking about the course things that could happen\nYou know how far out in the future ten years going to Mars can we get to that fast\n[noise] yeah I I I Do I I think that at the rate that space sex is currently proceeding or having the first people on Mars before the end of the twenty twenties is a very realistic prospect\nWhat do you think of these Japanese plans to mine asteroids I don't know how they're going to do that\n[noise] well um I I think that's a little um futuristic at this point uh I think though that if we have laws that allow people to state mining claims on asteroids say in return for surveying them to a certain degree of of detail\nOr that we could get privately funding asteroid prospecting missions\nAre being launched a ... in in the very near future that is because of mining claim even if you can't mine it today if if you think you're going to be able to mine at Thirty years from now or fifty years from now\nOr it has some value and uh\nUm but um\nYou know we do have a kind of I mean you ... you can ... the reason why spacesuits are white is because they they can overheat from sunlight and they want to reflect most\nAs much as you can man right uh\nOn the other hand things that are in shadow even in earth orbit can get cold to uh you kinda have to watch that uh but space itself\nDoesn't really have a temperature but certainly the power of the sun is much more when you're close to it you get hotter much faster I'm now second question\nProfiles of people well okay\nHold on for a second the

Braun and some of those incredible mine's\nWell they had some pretty good wants to uh they had Cora left a who was a great rocket engineer\nSo is German technology that help the Soviets to\nWell they they captured some vie to split\nA as did we but I I got to tell you well I mean you know I mean there's no question that von Braun and his team were top notch and and we actually got the real rocket engineers\nSoviets captured a lot of the two rockets but they they mostly caught the second tier kind of people we we got\nWe got the cream of the crop as they say\nWe did um\nBut um you know by the sixties we had developed our own rocket engineers although the German team continued to play a role through about the early seventies um I met a few of them\nWhat's amazing to see people who are born in the eighties for example Robert or even the nineties\nNever had a chance to experience what a lot of us went through a lot of people who are listening to the program right now during those some critical time periods I mean the moon landing spot neck all that stuff was just so historical\nAh we really lived and we have lived through some incredible time several we\nYes but I'd I'd like to see America at once again to become a country whose Creigh Deeds are to be found in newspapers and not in museums\nJust a you know and so you know like the Apollo Thirteen movie or just now the movie last man effort not last man first fan\nFirst while there may be the last ... now what\nYeah yeah well I think it's a pretty good movie by the way I just saw um\nWhat'd you think about the lack of the American flag being in that movie\nWell no they do show the American flag on mark on the moon they just don't show them\nPlanting it oh okay okay that this movie\nSome people found it a bit slow because there was a lot in there about you know Neil Armstrong relationship with his kids and his wife and so forth\nBut I thought it was pretty strong especially you know the scenes with the ex Fifteen and the Gemini and Gino flight\nAnd uh the actual moon landing itself I thought were absolutely riveting and they really gave you a sense of of the risks that were taken the courage that was needed and just the and the spectacular nature of of of this\nThing and this this this and the daring of America at that time\nAnd um but anyway I mean that's that's that's who we are that's who we have to be we can't be these people who you know say well we don't know how to go to the moon I'm you know I mean that'd be like them in the sixties saying we don't know how to fly airplanes so\nLet's go to David the Salem ... said David go ahead sir I didn't ask you both and thanks for taking my call George ... thing\nUm okay so it's interesting to me how\nWhat what you're talking about a few minutes ago it was really played into my question we you know we've talked about how how life could be sustained and things on Mars and already might stay life but\nWe have any plans are there any theories on Austin which can be leading an atmosphere stimulating a life's just learning environment a drilling holes that would be trapped gas is eating the\nAtmosphere with and we have her as many Iraqis her plans for that\nWhat we discuss that earlier in the show but yes terra forming Mars the idea would be if you warm the planet with greenhouse gases she could form a lot of the costs a lot of atmosphere to help us out of the soil\nI I've got a book called the case for Mars which um you can get on Amazon and it talks about how we can send people to Mars how we can settle Mars and how we can terra forming Mars that transform it in the way that you're a suggesting because marshals wants to warm and wet planet which means by the way it had a thick atmosphere\nAnd um it could be made so again\nAnd you believe we must go to Mars don't you\n[noise] well I\nMust I I I Believe we should uh I Believe that it's going to be much better future if we do I believe that if we do we don't just get another planet we proved to ourselves that we don't need to be fighting over this one because there's an infinite number of world out there for us if we work together\nThe port Arnie in Roseville, California go ahead Arnie\nYeah Hi I'm ... and ah I just have a question I thought it'd be leaning towards privatization but are you waiting towards privatization on the colonization of the ... of the Mars\nOr the planet I mean are you looking at this and be a free for all whoever land grabs whatever they can or are you are you with the government should be more involved in\nIt hating how a possession of real poverty as it was would be more than we ever got a point where trouble with the\nRight go ahead and rubber minute left so\nOkay well I'd like to see a lot of new governments on Mars I'd like to see people go to Mars and set up city states on Mars with lots of different forms of government so we could see which kind of government works the best\nBecause that's how we make progress on earth you know America was a noble experiment we prove the value of democracy and human rights and\nPeople all over the world came here because this was better and other countries around the world eventually copied us because it was better well if if it if you have people go to Mars and they're not forced to be under the U.S government to the Russian government or the Chinese government that they formed their own governments\nThey'll go there with their own ideas of how government should be in some will be good ideas from would be bad ideas and the ones with bad ideas that are not workable those counties will fail but the ones with good ideas immigrants will flock there those places will grow and they'll become an example to the rest of humanity\nRobert thank you again my front

about while\nHe has a graduate degree in political constantly from the University of Toledo psychological research methods from the University of Edinburgh, Scotland is research at the University of ... ... email ...\nOr mental sensitivity and grossly donors Brandon has been fascinated by the paranormal for years and here he is with his work all the dos studies Brandon I'm looking forward to this welcome to the show\nIt's great to be here George I'm excited to\nMy gunshot in a clinical therapist get involved in those studies\n[laughter] um well actually I was interested in a ghost in Paris psychology before I was actually a clinical therapist\nUh-huh yeah so it it actually\nI actually got a day job and then I study the parents psychology and goes part of thing\nWell that's something then you went to the University of Toledo which is not too far from my hometown of Detroit\nOh okay yeah yeah I spent a lot of time at the casino in Detroit but we won't get into that [laughter] how'd you do by the way not very well [laughter]\nThat's good well let's see they didn't have casinos there when I left I left in Seventy eight when apple was here in ... at that time it was just the booming city but what we do have is the Detroit Lions and that's the great thing there\nYeah yeah good good teams up their sports wise\nShe'll tell us a little bit about your work and then we're going to digest ourselves into the Gulf studies born to give us an overview of what you've been doing brand\n[noise] well um\nYou know I uh I have a degree in Perry psychology or when I was at the University of Edinburgh I studied uh\nI'm basically it the environmental sensitivity and goes to the encounters um and then when I got back here to the states I got back into the clinical part a thing and then that's what kind of got me going and and I'm interested in in writing a book and that's when I came out with a ghost studies\nAnd you know I'm sure the listeners to your show no it's it's um no mystery that science is sort of dropped the ball when it comes to explain and goes to my encounters\nA oftentimes mainstream macadamia will explain these things away as to lose the nation or patients are overactive imaginations which you know it's not really true in my eyes so individuals who have these terrifying encounters kind of struggled to find the answers and they're kind of left with\nReality television shows to provide insight into these life altering experience is\nSo you know there's millions of people out there including myself who are looking for things are books with more than just ghost stories tales of locations are outdated views um and that's when I wrote the book and I just thought\nYou know I combine real life goes the encounters with the satisfaction of some new perspective and insights and the cause of these throwing encounters\nUm it the book comes up with concise and competing theories and what's great about it is it's based on data rather than faith or belief\nOr even experience and you know it's you know these goats I been taking our interests for millions of years and it's and I think we're at the point where\nThere's becoming new perspectives on these things and that's what the book really goes over you know there are several firsthand accounts of ghostly encounters um you know I spent years just getting firsthand accounts going to anyone he would talk to me about goes normal conventions everywhere and then I started noticing similarities\nAnd that's when I came up with some of these new theories are and that's where I came out with the book so you know I really combined a little bit of my\nI took elements from psychological research clinical interviews eyewitness accounts and I sort of piece them together and come up with this uh these new theories and five and I also review the right the the greatest or the latest research in a ghostly encounters of the book\nWell then you bring a dose of real science to the picture of your brand new no I think that's important\nYeah yeah and I think so too I mean the great thing is is out there you just got to look a little bit harder um the journal articles a pair of psychological journal articles and even some degrees you know I'm narrow psychology of fitness a physics they're starting to kind of go into that realm of consciousness and\nI'm entanglement and non locality and how electricity affects us and I'm ... and\nWhat it does outside the body so there's a lot of that research out there it's just you know I think a lot of people maybe don't know how to find it or when they do find in a hurry to research article a kind of like oh this is boring and I don't know what's going on but I'm a lot of great research is out there it's just a matter of finding it\nWouldn't have you concluded today Brandon about what the ... experience might be for someone real big into their imagination what do you think's happening\nI actually think um ... majority of the ghost encountered that that are out there I Believe are there's some paranormal phenomenon happening\nI'm you know I think that when it comes to counter it's such a complex process and there's so many variables going on um you know there's environmental stuff there's um a internal bio electrical stuff going on\nUm but you know for the most part these these experiences are genuine and um you know obviously there's some fraud and there's some misinterpreting stimuli or whatever but I think the majority of these experiences are actually like I said genuine experiences\nAnd what do you think conscious to\nOne of the hell I think there is I'm In my in my view I take them more by ... view on goes\nSo that's a inside is basically um pull up at the extra sensory perceptions those types of things I I really think that a lot of goes way encountered that happen out there um the base of it\nHas to do with um ... or\nI'm sort of 'em are coming in being real sensitive to the environment and picking up something that's in the environment and other people on my main theories in the book go over um what I call a uh tell a path distress signals and sort of how they play a role and goes way encounters\nA so I really think that um people's ... the ... is a real or was a real important part of it goes way and count\nHow important then is the person as opposed to the vet for something like this\n[noise] um\nI I think that it's um\nIt's kind of a fifty fifty thing I Know that's kind of a\nWeird answer to say there but uh I think there's so many people out there I think there's a lot of people out there there are more prone to go slowly encounters\nBut I also think that the event is sort of a\nCatalyst to everything that's happening\nYou know I I think if we look at a lot of the ghostly encounters that are out there the catalyst is usually a crisis of some kind right I'm a death or life threatening events or some sort of trauma or something like that is the catalyst to these ghostly encounters\nA so the event is an important part of that it's what happens after that event\nUm and I think when you have the advantage when you have this trauma I think it it it sort of there's a lot of things that happen after that and one of those things is um\nYou know emotional distress so you have an event you have an emotional distress trauma life threatening or going to have all these emotions that are associated with it and then that leads to sort of these by energetic shift that happen inside us I mean we're all electricity and when that happens I think that it actually triggers\nSort of our innate ability to send a distress signal to somebody else\nAnd and the great classic example of this is the crisis aberration All right so\nWe probably heard of these this is when I'm sitting in my room on a random Tuesday night and I look to the left and there's a\nAn aberration of my aunt and she says\nYou know um I Love you goodbye\nAnd then I get a call the next day saying you know my aunt passed away right on time that I had that\nRight and I and I and I think that that\nYou can sort of see there was a trauma life threatening event with my aunt she was dying I somehow she sent 'em a tele Patrick distressing though things are to me\nAnd I picked up on it and they showed up as an aberration of some kind\nOf as you say some people don't get these experiences why not\nWell I think it actually comes down to something I'm\n[laughter] I there's a lot of research out there in something called environmental sensitivity\nAll right and um\nWhat environmental sensitivity as it's not like psychics sensitivity it's not like I'm chip coffee and Sylvia brown and and those types of psychic sensitivity where your mediums and\nUm you have psychic abilities but something as simple and concrete as sort of our ability to taste touch and smell and that's where the environmental sensitivity is I'm so those who are are vying mentally sensitive are simply picking up on the environment to a higher degree than the normal population\nSo if you think about this as humans man you we both experienced the world differently we're both affected by and react to the environment in different ways but the physical environment affects certain people more than others and this leads to all kinds of conditions and dysfunctions\nSo usually whoever classified as a team and um you know a regular goes I think there's more but just kill\n'em that's why I usually when I meet them at all it's just they're they're very well but just as well um but I think there's a little little that labeling going on to me it's an experience\nUm some people perceive it it's good or bad I might perceive one experiencing really positive you might have the same experience be terrified way the negative and then you go towards the demonic part of it so I I really enjoyed not joy but I have the experience of research experience\nAnd I don't try to put the female label on any\nWell

was feeling the same way too normally she's pretty calm in the morning but she was like scratching they get outside\nI'm like yeah you know my scientific brands going just take a shower and go to work and don't worry about it and I'm like you know what I'm going to go ahead and I'm going to follow through with this\nSo I open the door the dog and me went outside in the back yard and she sniffing around and I'm like I still got this feeling and then I looked over at the pond and I saw something like in the pond floating\nAnd I started walking and then I started running and it was a neighborhood cat had gotten into the pond and somehow\nYou know drowned in there by you know like dove into the ... you know all that stuff [laughter] but I Am myself this is it's not so much scary looking back on and it's a little scary but something drew me out there you know I I go to work every day you know it's the same thing and I never got that feeling or that desire to go outside\nBut something happened and I kept asking myself\nWhat what happened what made that day different and was there some sort of like distress signal sense to me with the cat and distressing they've kind of linked with me and the dog and then I you know but that's it's not scary in a sense but looking back on it it's kinda like this so many cool things happen there it's really amazing experience\nHow many people are normal experiences occur Brendan because the person who died comes back\nNever had someone tune as business had they had to tell somebody wanted to get something done\nI\nYou know I don't know a percentage on that um\nI I Would say that you know a lot of the a lot of the cases out there\nOf ghostly encounters have to do with easing are coping with a psychological injury like the death of a father or something\nRight you know I'm\n... you know you're sort of struggling with the death ah there's all these emotions happening um\nSo you know the body sort of the the electricity or the emotion signify a psychological injury and that sort of sets in motion a plan to sort of ... psychological wound through with other whatever means possible\nSo maybe if you're not able to cope through normal means you might use unconventional means you know and if if collective unconscious and there are collective consciousness exist and memories\nOf personalities and experiences of all of our humans are sort of stored in the atmosphere\nUm you might be able to tap into this field um and and get some sort of resolution like your father showing up and saying don't be sad I'm at a better place you know and and I think these things\nI the research out there really says that I think it's up to eighty percent of elderly people experience these um bereavement operations associated with their debts spouse one month after their death um so that's a pretty high number eighty percent\nOf the huge no yeah yeah and and perhaps these bereavement operations er visits from the deceased shortly after death are are kind of more important to our individual psyche and perhaps ... could be sort of a way\nThe process of emotions and ensure that our cycle like psychological well being of the survivor you know a final goodbye from the deceased could help us move on through crisis or grief or maybe if we didn't have that when the person died it might be a good way to sort of move towards resolution\nAnd I will and when I talk to those these people that have these encounters they often report feeling more at ease\nOr accepting of the loved ones death after these operations\nAnd I think on TV usually ghost or negative negative negative negative negative but there's a lot of positive um it can come out of it goes to encounter you know this idea of wait a minute there is something more to life where there is um something to look forward to it's just not all negative and demons and things like that\nAnd what have you concluded above the people who are\nReceptive to these kinds of preparations and encounters than others what's so special about though\n[noise] that that's a great question I Wish I had a definite answer for that um I think\nYou know something narrow biological is different about them\nWhen they put them there there's a pet out there with people who claim to be really sensitive to electricity and things like\nOh like human magnets or something or\nYeah yeah exactly you know they're just kind of sometimes if you if you want to think about that thing that\nThis phenomenon exist doesn't exist but there's some really unique experimental design um you know where they're actually doing that and what they're finding their their brain is actually in their bodies are reacting\nElectricity at very low level so there's some sort of\nObjective evidence that they can't detect that are more than ... other people and the general population here you know so and this is true for what we all we all experience and differently\nRight and they've shown that arise as well so you you know you know I like it with a pen and to me it's a horrible painful event for you it's not\nReally that it doesn't hurt at all say
