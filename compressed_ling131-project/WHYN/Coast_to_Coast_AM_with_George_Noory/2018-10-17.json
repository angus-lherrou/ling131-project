imagination and Nicholas I got to tell you I'm looking forward to this\nFact that George I thank you very much for having me and I think for that very nice in the introduction\nI thought ... was an absolute genius was any\nHe was he was I mean there's no doubt about it and not only was he a genius but he was a prolific genius he um he proved it over and over again a he was just unbelievably productive and he just wrote so many great great shows for for television and film\n[noise] ah one of our friends marches decree I wrote a book about the twilight zone in his subsequent book the twilight zone companion he said that rod Serling you do write most of his shows by dictating in a Dictaphone while he was floating in this pool\n[laughter] well he he definitely wrote most of the shows by dictating he did dictate from pretty much from Nineteen fifty five on word um I don't know if he did\nMost of them in the pool in the pool but he's certainly dictated most of\nHis scripts and and honestly I I don't know how he did it I I don't know how anybody can write that way but certainly with a rare breed a he was unique and he was able to do it somehow\nAnd that's you know posted on my uh my board in my office\nBut raw didn't write all the scripts he oversaw things but he did right he had some writers like Bradbury\nSure no not listen nobody could write every script on you know a rod wrote Ninety two of the hundred and fifty six twilight zone episodes over five seats that's pretty prolific\nThat is that's ridiculous I mean nobody writes Ninety two shows in a five year five seats imperious just if you know and and at the same time he was doing other things you know so the amount that he produced it's just it's just off the charts I I'm just convinced you never slept you just never swept from Nineteen fifty Nineteen Seventy five that was it [laughter]\nHe smoked a lot though didn't he\nYeah he sure did unfortunately he was he was just addicted he was just addicted to it maybe he got that in in the war as well um but um it was ultimately a big part of his mother's death\nUm yeah I absolutely had heart issues and that's what's finally did he meant you said that brought the wrote to well over two hundred and fifty total scripts on some of the things he did I mean that's amazing if he wrote Ninety two twilight zones and two hundred and fifty others the total shows such crazy isn't it\nIt it really is you know when I was researching the book it it's you know this couple of things that are really really impressive it's that well first of all yeah you run Ninety two\nTwilight zone episodes you also wrote thirty eight of the night gallery stories ha ha so if you know they do is that's a hundred and thirty scripts right there so there's a hundred and at

episodes were there\nTake that up a notch and make a color than again then you're completely in another universe and you're not for me you're not in the twilight zone anymore\nWell that's why I think ... gallery that came out in color after the twilight zone didn't quite have that twilight zone magic to it\nThat's one of the reasons I think yeah yeah the other reason is that rod really had no creative control over that series unfortunately what was his role well\nHe he created the series um he he wrote the pilot film which was called night gallery was three stories and it was a it was kind of a ... movie of the week kind of\nThing and even hitched it he's the one who probably pitched it to the network ...\nAfter that was such a success he pitched it and they kind of mutually pitched each other and and he did so he he wrote a lot for the series and he hosted it obviously but he had no say in cast and directing and editing and all that kind of thing and and you see that kind of his absence come up all the time in episode where you say a rod would have done this or\nYou know and he didn't have that freedom to do that\nHow come you never wrote a book well he never wrote a novel\nHe did write your collections of short stories\nAnd storage sure but I'm getting the closest\nThe ever came to writing anything that was novel length was actually the stories that made up the night gallery movie\nOr they originally were developed as they were long short stories I'm In a book called the season to be wary I'm ... but he never had the time you know that's the simple answer he ... he was so busy with television and he he wanted to write a novel he really did but he just never\nCould get away for long enough period of time to dedicate to writing a novel\nThere's there's going to be a ... to the twilight zone\nYes it's it's already in production and it's just supposed to be coming out or ... or early next year I'm Jordan Peele who are the director and writer of get out\nA is in charge of it he's going to be hosting it and producing it and from what little I've seen so far in terms of trailers and things I'm I'm cautiously optimistic I think they may actually get it right to some extent this time\nWe're the what's the venue for where they're gonna ear and\nIt's going to be on CBS all access so it's not going to be on regular TV it's going to be a pay you know like um [noise] you know Netflix or Amazon Prime that kinda thing so CBS all access and the interesting thing about that is they launched the CBS all\nAll access network with Star Trek with a new Star Trek series and now they're adding onto that with the twilight zone so it's like they you know they're going way back to get these shows the to launch this new network so it tells you how you know how classic these shows are they can be reenter reintroduced to uh you know a whole new audience in this way\nNicolas wasn't around surely one of the co writers of planet of the apes\nHe sure was in a lot of people still still don't are surprised when you say that but yes he was\nHe didn't really get credit for it to well he did get\nLiterally get credit for you on the screen it's ... it's the the credit is written by Michael Wilson and routes\nYou um you know today there's so many shows that are that are are so adults in scope or you know I don't even have to name them but you know Mad Men and Breaking Bad and\nYou know not just cable but but um but network television I think he would be thrilled with how how uh the with the quality of those shows now of course we have many more channels now and he\nThere's certainly a whole lot of you know of of junk too but um but I think in general he would be happy with it and one thing I can tell you for sure he he would hate reality TV\nOn the um he and and I don't say that just you know that's not just like me saying that at the time you know I guess reality television for its time a rod had some very negative things to say about a show called this is your life if you remember this is your life\nUh this is your life with a show where they bring somebody onto the show it in a normal you know regular everyday person and they you know a trot as family members out there and they would go through his you know scrapbook and look at you know it was kind of reality television for the time and he just despise the the show or\nYou know he thought it was just the invasion of privacy and everything else so the reality of it and he would hate but but I think there are so many shows now that he would absolutely love\nWill an old time television to knock a really\nDid not understand racial mix ups demographics when you look at some of these old shows way gone back or even the comedians are the game shows they were all older white guys\nYou know in and I'm not I'm not talking like a middle age I'm Talking the older white guys [laughter] where did it television you know it would be difficult to get that kind of a person like Jimmy Durante for example you you think of him\nHe was a big superstar very talented I don't think he would make it today\nYou might be right yeah yeah you could be right I mean well listen to the ... the um the field as has grown so tremendously there's so much more competition that uh you know there'll be there'll be but it's kind of like\nTalking about now major league baseball before the before Jackie Robinson you know and you know they didn't have the competition from the from the black player from the Latin player from\nAll these places and they were certainly people who played in the major leagues in Nineteen forty one who may not have made it in Nineteen fifty one because there was so much more more competition\nWhat would I Would say about all the different channels available now in his day there was just three major networks now my God you've got hundreds of channels\nYeah well he would he would love the freedom that it that it gives to ah to writers and creators that you know in his day you know if those three networks didn't want to hear it that was it I mean you know and in some cases if he was you know had on the contract to CBS\nCBS didn't want to hear it that was it nowadays you know you can go to so many different outlets to get your creation\nOr seen and heard uh so yeah he would be thrilled with that aspect of it for sure\nI mean Netflix and Amazon truly rival the networks now don't they\nOh absolutely I have some of the best television being made right now is on on those platforms\nAnd it's amazing let's take some calls let's go west of the Rockies cursed in Boise idaho or to get us started Hi Kurt\nHey George I'm Glad he got Nick I Can't wait to read the book you mentioned earlier when you were talking about the impact of the fact that the entire series is in black and white and of course Nick mentioned that you know the film or look but I've always been amazed at what I was able to do\nWith regarding the size of this sets which to me was as far as the visual impact was which is a testament to the you know the cinematographer and the lighting directors which I just I was just blown away with what they were able to accomplish was ordering from Nick if he knew how many cameras they used during the actual shoots\nOkay Nick do you know\nI Do not know the answer that question by will absolutely agree with that it that's one of the striking things about the series is\nIs that you know of course the production level in terms of budget\nYou know it was a fairly of generously budgeted show at the for the for the time but of course in terms of special effects they weren't going to be able to give you the brilliance you know spaceships a shooting across the sky and that kind of thing so they ... had to work with a you know more a relatively modest a set\nAnd the so and he did he got the most out of out of those particular sets and and every now and then to actually because budget was always a concern um he would write a particular show that only took place in one the one room because it was going to be cheaper to make you know there's one room and that's it\nAnd he would do one of those after they had a couple of expensive shows like eye of the beholder or\nYou know and I married twenty thousand feet or something and then he would do one of these shows that we've got kinda got the budget back under control\nHe jumps started many careers to did you not\nYeah I think so I mean it's it's certainly there are a lot of you know stars and soon to be Robert Redford yeah yeah ...\nActually got his first job not on the twilight zone but in another show that rod Serling had written cold in the presence of mind enemies on playoff Ninety it was the very first appearance by Robert Robert Redford on television a and that was a great great show when he was very good in it too\nYeah in the twilight zone episode he was a cop in the lady thought he was a death coming to get her yeah I'm not going to see what the ending is but that was a great show\nYeah was it was very that was written by George Clinton Johnson actually and that's a terrific show what\nWas the name of the show and Nicholas were ... more head was a woman in her house in a small flying saucer landed inside her house or something like that and she beat it with a broom\n[laughter] it's called the invaders and and that was written by Richard Matheson or the late great Richard Matheson uh he wrote several episodes of the show and that's one of the most well remembered\nEpisodes of the series is it's largely dialogue free there's almost no dialogue in it until the very end when the when the you know spin a person you know ha says a few things\nI found out who they were in the other one I like to was the lady who was having plastic surgery or because everybody thought she was ugly in a she wanted to look like everyone else and uh we sure found out what everyone else look like and that's\nThat's the eye of the beholder and that is um you know if there is a quintessential twilight zone episode I think that's that's it that's that's the one on again one of the most well remembered episode\nAnd the one that really gave me the message of people was the shelter above that fall out shelter\nYeah the shelter is a great a great episode a Serling wrote that one\nAnd uh yeah it's about the idea that there's going to you know there's a there's a bomb threat a nuclear threat and what this what does this community do when there's only one bomb shelter and they all want to get into and they can't get into it and they turn on each other and it was yeah that was a terrifically a wild on episode\nRenee in San Francisco is with us Hi Renee go ahead\nI I you know um there's an episode that's a very rare episode that it was highly or at least ... years later I was called miniature\nMiniature I don't remember that Nicholas dealer\nRobert ... absolutely right another great you know a great actor who one of his early early performances Robert Duvall a that was one of the hour long episode was the fourth season of the twilight zone they were all in our long as opposed to a half hour I'll rarely yeah okay yeah and then you sure it was one of the hour long episode and it it was involved in a in a lawsuit at the time that\nUh the series went into syndication so it was not initially syndicated so it was not seen for decades or at least Twenty years\nOr in so that was long long settled and um there was a special on called the twilight zone silver anniversary special and they showed that particular episode along with a couple of others that had been similarly left out of the syndication package\nWhat was the tragedy when they were doing the twilight zone movie a helicopter crashed or something like that\nOh yeah it's a horrible horrible incident a helicopter crashed after an explosion you know special effects explosion and killed the moral starring in that particular story and two young children who are on the set\nA it was yeah yeah cast they pull over the entire movie of course\nHorrible horrible situation on Long Island New York is with us they just go ahead\nI make a couple of questions or one would be the first one would be that seemed like it was very escapist well then maybe someone stay back in the sexism just speculating\nHad to write for a job and he came home and watch the twilight zone\nThat would be almost like an escape from your daily reality and I guess people might have wanted that and I'm Wondering if there any other shows really light that my second question would be about the mysterious endings which\nWhere local businesses that I mean as Steve mentioned and yeah he would actually go and and you know going through his\nCorrespond to the wire rod Serling kept everything he ever ever sent ... every letter he ever wrote he kept in that they still exist and you would think he responded to every single fan letter he ever received personally a personal letters
