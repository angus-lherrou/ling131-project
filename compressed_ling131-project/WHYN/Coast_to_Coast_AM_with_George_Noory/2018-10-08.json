and I have been discussing the flu for six years now and it gets even more confusing or the big flu virus now is called age three and two and the ... it's the big hitter especially on the the elderly but George\nThe numbers fly all over the place so the CDC is scaring us that a hundred and Seventy five children died last year but fifty percent of those had preexisting conditions you look on the flip side\nTwelve thousand children died in accidents like cars fires and so forth the confusion gets even worse when um\nThe vaccine last year was only thirty four percent effective and now they've

Las Vegas outside of Las Vegas Nevada and um\nI I I sort of gave everybody a heads up and then when I found something that surprised me um it went viral I mean I I made the international news with this discovery I've had with the Newsweek inside edition and ABC NBC CBS Fox News\nMedia in Russia China basically I discovered some type of a space time anomaly between Las Vegas in area fifty one at this nondescript site on the side of the road out in the desert\nAnd so it seems to me that there has been a space for us all ready for a long time and that space force serve the dual purpose\nI mean it can make\nA the defense of earth against other earthlings\nI'm much stronger but at the same time you're defending perhaps all earthlings from some kind of outside potential for invasion and I think that even if you are listening to this show tonight and you believe that there are aliens or ... or however you want to describe it\nSome that are coming here and you think they must be good because if they weren't good they would've destroyed is already if you're in charge of the military if your job is to be suspicious if your job is to protect the people of your country\nThen why would you take a chance and say okay well maybe these beings are benevolent\nBut still why don't we do what ever we can to have whatever we can muster together in place just\nIn case you don't you need to send ourselves because they have a change of heart or they've been deceiving a better to\nBe safe than sorry right\nWhy sure you know and and we it might be Utah file I mean you would think that it would be that if the if there are being out there that are coming here that are are so advanced that they um they they would otherwise destroy if\nA if you know if if that was their plan but you know here's this is getting dark this this is very dark but I honestly this is a a logical point of view\nWhat if George ... if they were going to come back here these beings that ancient alien a theorist talk about talk about this kind of thing many times on the History Channel\nUm if they they come back and they want to enslave us again because a lot of people believe especially if you look at like Zacharias ... work and all that that they came here\nAnd modified our our genetics and our DNA to end slavery and treat us as minors for gold or whatever\nIf their goal is to come back here in ... it might be a better fate for us to commit global suicide\nIn other words and again I told you this is going to be dark what if a lot of these governments actually have some kind of plan in place where they say rather than have these beings come back\nAnd put you know colors on us and and work like animals we hit the buttons and we just annihilate ourselves spooky but what if that okay\nSo do stay button basically\nAnd an end to the idea is that we're not necessarily as concerned about each other as we are about the force from outside and you're going back to Ronald Reagan I'm I'm sure you recall that kind of eerie comment that he made\nA one of his speeches I Believe it might have been before the un you know what if there was an alien threat [laughter]\nWhat did he really mean by that you know he was he was just being facetious to try to talk to people about banning together or does he really knows something at the time\nWhen you look back at all of these people who have made deathbed confessions who are related to raw as well and um you know the whole suspicion that surrounds researchers to this day who goes snooping a little too much and digging a little too deep\nI mean there is something\nTo this idea that we may be up against potentially a some visitors here if you want to call them visitors they call them are just as easily invaders\nBut there may be some some ah beings that we have got to do our best to defend against and they're using space time manipulating technology\nIn order to completely I'm Out maneuver anything that we can do\nAnd so once we see the possible examples like I'm perhaps present thing that maybe now we humans are experimenting with some stuff sadly enough weaponry which also may have a space time manipulating affect\nAh this could be a particularly worrisome for those beings if they say okay we made a little trade off we gave them if you little nuggets of wisdom but boy the the the the earthlings have run with it and so we need to put them back in their place\nJosh tell us about your event coming up in October this month\nYeah fake it which is this Saturday it's October the thirteenth this is going to be my final wishing

I mean they had ... votes in mind that too but\nI never told anybody this at was reluctant to say anything that it would it till two of my close friends and I'm Out of the way that not that I have\nA show and they have the\nDish and up until now I hadn't told\nMe in the in the morning was just not to be in that car as opposed to you driving the car\nYou know well I didn't want to get out of that he told me down and\nBut you didn't think it would carry on to them no no no that was\nThe idea they may be and you get my car but they were ... they weren't killed but that was a time I ... and ... like a ... you get all the same thing as well because then there's CNN\nJosh why does spirits come across like that in warn you\nYeah well you know John ... thank you for that that's a great call and it I Believe represents one of the most interesting aspects of the spiritual realm [noise]\nYou know scientist who are the smartest folks among us right now who are are you know the astrophysicist the cosmologist a quantum physicist they're telling us\nThat we have the mathematical models we have the experimental data to prove that all time is happening at once at least on this particular time line that the past the president and the future are all happening at once the problem is that we humans are\nSpirits in the material world it's like that song by the police\nAnd so when you are spirit trapped here in this material body you're only able to process what's happening on the timeline little by little a minute by minute hour by hour a day by day week by week and so on\nBut once you are no longer in this body it seems like you're able to have an awareness of things that extend far beyond what we physical or physically incarnate as humans call the presidents\nAnd so it would make perfect sense that if you have a loved one especially one who has recently passed into the spiritual realm that person may be astounded by the fact that he or she can now\nSee the future to a degree that you cannot or it might almost be like comparing the perspective of an app to the ... to the perspective of an eagle ah they're both physical beings but they just have a different point of view and then when the eagles way up high he can see the storms\nThat are coming that the aunt can't see that the aunt is more sensitive to what's happening on on a lower level\nSo anyway all that said your relatives or friends or loved ones who passed over my definitely be able to see beyond the scope of the temporary situation and see somewhat into the future\nAnd that would certainly be great motivation for them to come and give you a warning and in this a case John and it seems like that's the most likely thing that happened to you\nAny updates with Robert de hunted dull Josh\n[noise] you know Robert at this point lives like a king and and and this is very funny because he still down in Florida\nYeah yeah I mean I I haven't seen him in a while now but Robert I think really became famous or some would say infamous ads are Robert\nBecause that a lot of people were sort of a chiding him and uh I don't want to use the word abusing him but basically there they were taking him out and cathartic Lee releasing their pent up frustrations\nOn him and it was when the shock wave of curses and bad luck started hitting all those people that suddenly word began to spread like okay this call here ... you know\nRobert was fighting back\nYeah and it's because of that that um he I Believe now is so famous because the word has now spread for so long that if you go to see how\nYou have to be respectful people now take it seriously and I don't think that there are nearly as many people who are going to see him now who are having bad experiences or even paranormal experiences because he seems to be at peace\nSo you get more ... people seeing you out of time slips scripted all that kind of stuff but\nIn its role as form it's almost like Meridian on planet earth that acupuncture is might compare it to the Meridian of energy the flow on a human body\nThese are places that conduct electricity and when that electricity manifest and ... Iraq at in certain angles at certain cliff\nIt can create what similar to to ball whitening\nAnd so you have so much of that which is creepy around western North Carolina but at the same time it almost seems sometimes have a conscious but and so we're still uncertain as to whether or not the ball the white\nArt just merely and simply a raw natural phenomenon like ball lightning or they might also have some sense of intelligence and uh this is what makes this such a great mystery\nJoshua his website Joshua ... worn dot com you've got the information coming up with a Saturday Los Angeles event at his website\nIf you get there the first five to ten people will get free tickets there if you use the code that Tesla or by just typing that in there and that's all they need to do when will they get notified Josh\nWhat you need to do is go to my website Joshua pie Warren dot com and I and sign up for my ... a newsletter I'm going to send a newsletter out sometime this week and said the first five or ten people can apply to this newsletter with but work Tesla will get the free ticket\nLet's come back and just a moment here on coast to coast am it takes some final phone calls with Josh and the next hour we're talking haunted World War two\nSoldiers spirits ghost planes in strange synchronous cities with math new swing\nSo getting ready for that and don't forget the lights on Facebook followers on Twitter emailed me a George ... coast to coast am dot com here's our next emerging artists Christopher ... from a round rock Texas with a song called morning over the ...

... and I was in the ... or ... or log in\nAnd I'm cleaning and I'm often it's called the day room you know where the ... people come they do their activities and all of a sudden I say this will nine year old boy I Would say\nMaybe ten eloquently I cooked steamed directly straight you know just that core I perfectly\nAnd he's looking at me and I start mouth and they continue mop like okay this kind of eerie any ... going to be pretty hard and so I was wondering it seems like since I've been working there for about a month like he think it's maybe\nAround October is that we're in the spirit to really show theirselves or and he wasn't supposed to be there was he\nI I don't think so I talked to the CNA in a couple of the nurses and they told me\nThat they everyone who goes in there by their cell or maybe two or three people they feel like someone watching them and I was just wondering like huh Josh or what do you guys think 'cause like it seems to me is October because it's not a full moon because it's full knew I could tell you what it gets really crazy around the hospital for whatever reason\n... do you know a little boy died there\nYou know I asked them and they sent from what we understand no loans have died there but they said we don't know a full history\nOf the ways in hospital where do you think Josh\nWe'll call thank you for that call and yes I think that this time of year has more prominent paranormal activity for at least three reasons\nReason number one goes back to when I was saying earlier in the show about the earth tilting away from the sun and subtle energy filled being magnified or at least being more perceptive ... so that's that's number one number two is that\nHere again in our part of the world in the northern hemisphere\nMost places have a colder\nDrier environment and I know that's certainly the case in Utah\nSo that means there is a larger build up of electro static charges so when you lay down at night and you pull your sheets up you might see those little blue sparks flying around the similar to when you're drag your socks on the carpet and touched the door knob\nAnd there is a definite relationship between enhanced electro static charge and the ability for paranormal phenomenon to materialize and interact\nOr in my laboratory over the years I've been able to reproduce many of the things\nThat people talk about when they encounter the paranormal using electromagnetic charges such as creating luminous life forms making objects move without any visible source or creating the sensation of a cold spot or a cold wind where they call an eye on when\nI'm making your hair stand on end these are all things that you can do artificially with electro static charge and yet when you go to these places where people are often experiencing extreme paranormal phenomena you find that there are these very strong electro static\nAnomalies in the area so there's some connection there\nRegarding how that the non physical realm of the spiritual might be able to temporarily interact with the physical realm and that reminds me of how something like a magnet has this invisible filled around at that creates a physical effect\nBut then the third and final point of course is that this time of year we're talking about it more I mean you go to the store you see all of these things that remind you of the paranormal spooky the afterlife\nYou see it all on TV you see the movies coming out and so you combine those three things together and certainly it means that again at least here in the United states\nThis is the time of year when we have the highest likelihood of experiencing something ghostly spooky creepy paranormal or at very least metaphysical\nInsurance don't you get energized during this time of the year for some reason\nWell I Do and I think you know part of it goes back to the fact that you know I was born this month and so you know that's always been a time a celebration my mom and dad have always been fantastic people have always been a really cool arranging nice things for me and growing up in western North Carolina\nUh especially in Asheville when when the leaves are splashed with color and everybody is becoming very festive um it's a great reflection of that original celebrate tore mood\nFrom the old world in fact so many people of Scots Irish descent came into the mountains of western North Carolina because they found them familiar\n[noise] that ah every single genealogist I've ever talked to says there are more people for example Scottish to set in North Carolina then there are in Scotland\nAnd uh we should remember that the very first attempt at an English Settlement with in North Carolina on the coast\nAt a place called Rowan Oak island and they all manner so we now know that today is one of history of the greatest mystery the ah last calling me and so I was born in an area that had um an enormous amount of influence\nFrom the early you know Scots Irish who originated these ideas about celebrating fell on Halloween and so that combined with my birthday makes me very excited and I'm sure contributed to the fact that uh I Love this time of year\nThirty

journalism\nAnd his interest and bolts ghost Lauren the paranormal to collect and tell stories all about the supernatural he was with us a couple of months ago with Richard talking about some haunted rock and roll that was a classic mad welcome back to the program\nThank you very much thanks for having me on\nVery background hot as a journalist get involved in the unusual in the paranormal\nWell the simple answer was I was born that way\nOn Halloween or yeah yeah oh happy birthday coming up\nYeah thank you very much so that really kind of started my interest in it I don't ever remember a time where I wasn't\nInterested in ghost stories horror movies and the like so I just learned uh I I never really wrote about it until I started to work as a reporter\nAnd uh every Halloween I Would try to write a a a feature story a Halloween feature story and so I started to write a story about um local ghosts legends around the area where I was born\nAnd ah the reaction to that story was so overwhelming that I thought well there's really something here and so since then I've I've combined my interest in history and folklore and go stories and just kind of combined them altogether\nDid your birthday cut into Halloween or did Halloween cut into your birthday when you're you\nKnow it it sort of a made my birthday exponential I refer to it as the season of Matt now\n[laughter] I Love it kicking off the year I Love this quarter October November December it's it is the best absolutely in how how did you get your interest in World War two\nWill I after I wrote you know I wrote three books about a music in the supernatural and at a certain point I wanted to find another project to place with my publisher and initially I thought I I I'm you know to be completely transparent I consider myself more of a civil war geek\nUm but I started to look around at writing a civil war book but what I found is that there's just so many so much good stuff out there already a and that people have compiled a numerous books so I didn't think I could really add anything to that\nArea of ah of ghost stories in the supernatural so I just started I turn towards a World War two uh and started\nTo research whether there were any good stories and and sure enough there were there were plenty of good stories that I could compile in a way that I I like to do it I like to do I like to couple go stories with\nYou know tales of secret in cities and and forty entails so a haunted World War two it turned in to be just a really a deep area for me to explore and that's that's kind of what I like to do\nAnd he ... onto the world war two were these ghost stories and events from World war one that overlapped in World War two or with these things happening during the second war\nSo most of the stories that I I compile our stories from World war two not between the wars and and they occur they continue to occur believe it or not\nWhat creates the difference between these kinds of ghost stories I Would call the military haunting as opposed to regular guy\n[noise] that that's a that's a great question because um [noise] you know\nMost of the stories that I wrote about before a university ... stories haunted rock and roll go stories of country music\nThere is there sort of a light hearted aspect of the stories compared to what I found myself into when I started to research the world war two goes for 'em and I think when you're dealing with war and warriors and victims of of atrocities and\nWorld War two probably set a new standard and violence and atrocities\nSo there is a deep seriousness about the material and I really want to honor the sacrifices especially from the soldiers and sailors Marines\nUh you know when you're dealing with this these acts of Vail valor on on Normandy and you know uh all of those stories you want to make sure that your your ah honoring or what\nThey they brought or the other thing that I found a little different when I started to research hunted World War two was that um [noise] you know you want to make sure that you get the history right a history serves as a backdrop for a lot of these stories\nAnd I think ghost stories are are one way that people help preserve the past\nBut sometimes they're not perfect in history so what I found myself doing is a lot of times is is uh finding these ghost stories and then trying to confirm to make sure that history was correct or you know I've been I've never looked for whether a\nA ... or was available to German troops in ... during the Normandy invasion but\nYou know I found myself looking looking at those types of details so I think those are two reasons why the these stories are a lot different from the stories that I worked on before\nWhat isn't Matthew about the battlefield that seems to enhance the stories\nIn and they could be anywhere they could be I had a friend who just went to the little big corn oh we're customs less than ones and you know he's convinced that haunted to Gettysburg Reno was on to write I'm sure there are other battlefields that are but what is it about war that creates these hunting is it because\nSadly enough these Soldiers Die so suddenly and they just still hang around what what's going on there\nYeah there there are a lot of theories about why battlefield seemed to attract these ... more so than than other places um and and they're essentially is two camps on this so you have on one hand you have the paranormal theorists\nAnd they say that this ... and in one case a they say that this violence and trauma of war\nAh causes these um almost in the event almost in beds itself in time and space and it gets repeated over and over so that kind of explains what they would consider residual ...\nNow on the other hand there there are some of the arrests that also say that\nYou know the shock of war happens so quick that maybe people have a hard time transitioning maybe their spirits have a hard time transitioning from one plant to the next that's\nThat's the other theory now there's a whole skeptical side of this too and what the skeptics would suggest is that because these areas are profoundly moving emotionally when you talk about the sacrifice when you talk about the\nDeath and the tragedy that it raises your consciousness that maybe you mistake normal ah activity normal phenomena for paranormal phenomena so those seem to be the main theories behind why these battlefields are so haunted\nUse their own specific battlefield that you would say is the most ...\nI think the consensus wise I Would say a Normandy is extremely haunted um there's just doesn't stories are especially in it might be because there are a lot of\nTourists are that are visiting that area and so a lot of this towards their documenting what happens but\nThe bunkers the fortifications uh seem to be haunted one of the stories that I found a particularly interesting was that a [noise]\nA father and daughter visited the battlefield\nAnd that's part of France for people who don't know where it is\nRight yet Normandy, France uh and uh the the father and the daughter visited the Normandy peaches and we're exploring some of the fortifications and went into a bunker\nAnd when the daughter and and father said that when they came out of the bunkers they they didn't really talk too much about it but then later\nThe daughter said that when she was in there she solve these figures are these people actually in the bunker somewhere laying down somewhere looking out the window and then she started to describe their uniforms and the father who was a World War two buff\nI immediately ... ah recognize these uniforms is German uniforms\nAnd later he decided he wouldn't press the issue on a writer right away but then later he talks to her and he brought out a book of weaponry and and uniforms in and asked her to look through it and identify what she saw\nAnd he claims that she had no access to any World War two history books she ... he tried to keep that away from her because she was so young but then she began to describe the guns that were there the uniforms that were there\nAnd they all matched or what could have been in that bunker at that time so you do have stories like that from a pretty credible sources that they've had these experiences in Normandy and that certainly wasn't the only one that happened in those bunkers\nFor a an airfield during World War two was ... I Believe I'm\nA somewhat a flight mechanic for the for the uh R. E. F. so definitely would have known the difference between let's say a modern\nI get from Hercules aircraft and something like a beat twenty four or uh Lancaster Bomber and and this person described it either as a Lancaster or is it be twenty four bomber so a pretty peculiar and and there have been other what they call goes plane flaps\nA throughout history and I think there was even one as I was writing this book so two thousand Seventeen um pretty interesting\nMathieu did they describe how the planes would disappear how would how how they would leave\nIf the one couple of just said that it flew overhead and they thought it was going to crash and I believe they pulled over to see you know see if it did crash or at least I hear it and it just it just kind of disappeared\nJust to like that yeah yeah like they want to do a different time warp or something right\nAnd the reason I looked into the these uh\nUh goes plane stories is when I was young my parents woke up early one morning it was a sort of a misty foggy morning\nAnd um they went for their morning walk and my parents came back in and said that as they were starting their walk they saw an absolutely huge aircraft coming down just a few hundred feet off the ground and it was very foggy\nOr you can make a sound went overhead and it just kind of disappeared into the mess that would be Yuri\nThat what it was my mom was still telling that story over and over and that's what made me think well England was just a huge aircraft carrier back in World War two I wondered whether they had any\nAny stories similar and sure enough it's a it's not that it happens all the time but it it's certainly a rather common occurrence for these goes planes to be seen\nI bet they handled hundreds were going to come back and talk more about how to World War two next hour you'll share your questions and stories\nGlucose website is no conveniently optimized for mobile devices if you're a ... students ... you can listen to live in his shoes right on your phone just visit goes to goes to um dot com on your iPhone or Android\nMonday October eighth what's new today on the free I her radio a radio\nFor decorating the house for just setting the scary movie by the playing field tracks with labor is fine when you know after a day\nSwing mainstream freak out all our Greenville ... whether you're at home or the city of new I our radio ... collections that come out now\nChosen based on vocals he added two or three song instrumental demos that the ban may\nAnd this week and twenty twelve record label bosses at him I recall the vinyl anniversary edition of the Beatles single love do after discovering they had accidentally printed version that included session musician any white playing drums Ringo Starr copies of the disc featuring the wrong version reportedly selling on ...\n\nThere's this\nIn your head start and I am temple in the euro going\n[noise]\n\nNa\n\nNa na na\n\nOh\n\nThis is coast to coast am with George Nouri\nGot some free videos for your coast to coast am dot com you can see are beyond belief shows bill ... takes us on a guide to a journey through space and time doing explore ancient mystical rooms go take a look at it in our highlight reel the coast to coast am dot com you just click it\nAnd take it away and have some fun\nLooking for ways to preserve views here symmetrical way\nThere are things about the states that so many adults complain about it at the age namely bags under the ice cores grows feet fine lines and wrinkle finally there's an immediate fix its called instantly ageless an age defying micro cream that acts in less than two minutes no needles no pay just a happier\nYounger looking you it's simple to use pick a small drop lightly applied to target areas leave damp until dry then apply cosmetics it necessary it's great for men and women people are amazed at how fast at work here some reaction with actual instantly a bliss users\nI probably know that in the past five years that my I have gained a lot of fine lines wrinkles make ... have gotten deeper while I was hoping for five years but I think that my I think ten years ago that it's\nReally a little wrinkle gone [laughter] it's easy to just put it on your finger and go I Wish I had more down here because like the one thing to me I Am an emotional turning forty I didn't think would be a big deal to me\nBut that looks like me that I feel like inside instead of\nAnd when I when I was\nInstantly ageless today go to our exclusive website H.

I didn't want to leave our our sailors out\nNo nine years maybe for me so let's not leave aside well\nYeah I'm going to make sure I have those in there so\nThe interesting thing about uh after World War two was you had these battleships\nYou had ... ah aircraft carriers and they were engaged in so many activities so much a honor that uh the sailor served in that\nIt was a shame to just got all them or to reduce them to scrap but luckily for us a lot of um people got into preserving those um ships those aircraft carriers and his battleships as living museums\nAnd they brought him back to different ports and and also when they brought him back to these ports\nThey brought a lot of a ghost stories with them and and some of the ones that I collected the USS Yorktown which is now in Charleston Harbor\nUm there's a lot of activity or a witness their shadow figure is probably one of the ones they call him shadow ed and Ed's stands for enemy designated which was a World War two term for when you come in contact with the enemy\nOr there's some pretty dramatic stories of ghost hunters chasing the shadow creature around the the carrier USS Hornet I think is probably one of the most documented a ship base a haunted sites\nUh there there is a story about a man dressed in white naval uniform who are wanders around the deck some of the battle ships the USS North Carolina I worked with a uh a few a paranormal investigator from Port city paranormal\nAnd they basically told me they they have a career documenting the ... on there\nUm and of course we mentioned USS Arizona all of those uh and there there are a lot more I was finding them even as a I was starting to publish this book so yeah there are a lot of World War two ships are haunted and I'm just glad that they preserved them and have him back here go send all\nJust an amazing series of events that have been happening that seemed to all of a similarity in that has to do with tragedy ... for some reason tragedy makes these ghosts or whatever we want to call them hang around don't you think\nYeah I mean absolutely that seems to be the one common element of uh you know I'll say not just the ghosts of World War two but when you talk about haunted rock and roll which I investigated and even some of the ghost stories of of country these tragedies\nJust seemed to linger it's like either the spirit doesn't want to let go uh somehow this is a a\nInteraction between consciousness of reality or maybe that were just so primed um to to when we hear these tragedies to maybe hope that that uh the spirits go on or the spirits linger there's probably a lot of different reasons for that those are just some of the ones that I've come across\nOur special guest of course is Matthew ... we're going to take calls next hour with him stories and questions of course and uh let's get into when we come back also after the break math you a little bit of your a haunted rock and roll stories those are those are fantastic too\nI Love them that's one of my favorites\nAnd they just keep coming more and more and more they just never stop like you know people like Michael Jackson who passed on now when prince and folks like that have they come back you up to a ... as a ghost\nWell there are definitely good stories about Michael Jackson uh there were a few a video anomalies\nWhen a when I Believe his brother uh believe it might have been germane was being interviewed people said they so Michael Jackson walk up behind him there are stories from a neighbor's of a former ... home owned by Michael Jackson who claimed to hear music coming out of it at odd times\nWhen there shouldn't be anybody at home so that definitely\nA Michael Jackson coasts have been seen there are starting right now a lot more good stories about prince who just died I think back in two thousand sixteen I'm his Paisley Park has his recording studio several of the workers there claimed to hear people shuffling\nAround to hear voices fans have also blogged about how they believe like they've had an encounter with it goes to\nPrint out they seem to be everywhere will come back we'll talk more about some of these altered rock and roll stories and take some calls next on the coast to coast Dale\nJoined the coast to coast am Facebook page\nWhat's going on rock and roll lovers is Danny ... why don't we take a trip back

H. Y. N.\n[noise] [noise] [noise]\nAnd welcome back to coast to coast Matthew swing with us Matthew a it off Hitler ... 'cause he was was also interested in the cold did you come across anything that the dealt with that\nYou know I did and I came away with a little bit of a different perspective about Hitler in the cold [noise]\nUh you know initially I thought that Hitler was a a cult practitioner throughout his life but what I found through my research and this is pretty controversial and I'm sure there will people have have different ideas and I'd be glad to entertain those thoughts too but it sounds like\nHitler's early a philosophy was influenced by a cult groups like the whole society in the ... society very prevalent in a pre World War two Germany in that area\nBut what I think happened was that Hitler was of all things are not an occult theorists but more of an incredible sociopathic nurse assistant I don't think he could think\nThat there was any type of power a worthy of him I think he thought he was the ultimate power and that the state was the ultimate power\nAnd so what you see later is that a Hitler begins to purge a lot of it is a cult groups he starts to go after fortune tellers\nAnd astrologers so I came away with a little bit of a different opinion on the cold in in Nazi Germany uh likewise I was sort of fascinated that the cult played a much bigger role in my opinion a among uh\nThe side of the allied side so there were the wiccan in England who ah try to get together to uh spiritually\nOr go after the Nazi regime or they held um meetings and the ... got together with the express purpose of trying to to stop 'em Germany from invading England and likewise uh and I really picked us up from a frequent guest on coast to coast Mitch or with\nUh the allied a new thought ... a movement those a lot of the\nPractitioners for that group were very involved and to try and use spiritual techniques a cult techniques to stop Hitler from uh from succeeding so those were\nA different ways that uh you you know when I tried to write a book I'm I'm really I Know a lot of people write books because they know a lot I like to learn a lot\nSo I go into a some of these stories with really preconceived notions\nAnd then as I delve into it I find twists and turns that that I tried to bring out uh in in the book\nNow in your stories on haunted rock and roll told me the theme about those\n[noise] well the theme about haunted rock and roll is that I'm really when I started writing hunter rock and roll and again another I listen to our Gary Patterson on your show many times ah\nAnd ah you know I started to investigate and what I thought initially was that rock and roll had this special cult power and maybe people that were into the Cold War attracted to it\nBut after writing the country book and then revisiting rock and roll for more on a rock and roll what a ... a ... I came away with is the thought that music is really just to consciousness raising tool it's used in just about every religious service are out there it's\nAlso a key part of a lot of um historical movements like the civil rights movement there's something special about music that I Believe raises the consciousness\nOf both the listener and and the musician that I think makes either people more open\nTo things like the supernatural the cult or maybe a you know actually can kind of promote these these types of powers in these types of of of visions so that's really the theme that kind of runs through all of this book in my opinion\nWell that's pretty dramatic stuff and like we were talking earlier the current rock stars that have made a haven't shown up yet but they will I think eventually don't you\n... yeah I sometimes this is a matter of what I find is that it's a matter of\nThese stories in these tales in the supernatural usually start out than to than musician to musician\nA person the witnesses it talks to another friend and then for me it usually bubbles up on line and blog posts and then uh newspapers will investigate I'll look into it goes counters will be attracted to the site\nSo it takes a while I'm I'm Still waiting for some good ghost stories about David Bowie for example\nJames Dean of course died young in a car accident and was in his car chopped up into little pieces in the soil the parts and apparently they were haunted\n[noise] yeah that's a ... the name of his car yeah he um he had a car was a poor spider or was involved in Iraq and then\nA pieces of it because it was really a race car a piece of it were salvaged and I know there's one story about um uh he uh one race car driver used a piece in his car and a car fell on him and I think crushed him to death\nBelieve it or not there's a parallel to that in the haunted World War two book there was a\nI think it was a beat twenty four that crash landed in the desert of North Africa pieces of it were recovered are that are now in the national I think air force a museum\nA and pieces of that plane were report it to be cursed in that uh I think some of the pieces went went into a\nA a a plane that later crashed I think a couple of planes crashed based on and so so there is a connection\nAll right let's take some calls for you Matthew let's pick it up by going to Frank in Hollywood, Maryland again to start in any Frank\nI think you're back with you when you made any subject India I I I I think they would be some hard things at the\nA and a and not the Nazi Germany but what about\nA remote places where the Jewish people were murdered by by not a I once saw a film where they were just shot three hundred just shot down over ... going to get that they were shut down\nA credible a male was found and I'm Wondering if any any hunting and in a remote places where you're not you're not take my answer off air okay\n... thanks for that that's a that's a great question and I believe I Know exactly which\nWhich footage you're talking about and believe it or not one of the stories that I came across a is I think from that area because I I Believe that might have been taken in Poland Czechoslovakia\nAnd there are stories about some of the victims of the Jewish victims of those atrocities um that still hunt those areas again I I I felt out of a difference for those those people are that I Would leave them out of the book and and wouldn't try to try to um\nYou know we looked at like I was making any money from that so I I left that out but yeah definitely those stories crop up and I guarantee you if you were in those areas you would find a lot of go slower a lot of folklore and a lot of stories about those places\nNot stop we go to Charles Janelle ... in Texas said Charles go ahead\nEither yeah well I was a ... at the uh me and my dad were a a ...
