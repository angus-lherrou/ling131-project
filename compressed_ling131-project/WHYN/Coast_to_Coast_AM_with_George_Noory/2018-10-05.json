you were a kid haven't you\nWell actually and and and briefly let me just say that William capital wanted to direct a Rosemary's Baby but he has such a reputation gimmicky movie that they didn't let him do that but yeah when I was\nA I was terrified of I I I I was like in my Spiderman pajamas a you know just sweating under the coffee table\nShaking with year I'd have to go into the other room I was the kind of a kid that when the skipper we yell at Gilligan during Gilligan's Island I Would have to get out of\n\n\n\nAnd even with this new are are are with this new Halloween movie\nJamie Lee Curtis is the hero she's she's going to kill a Michael Meyers when she gets a hold of them she ... she was praying for him to take that as being asylum so she could blow it brings out\nAnd I think that having heroic women in these movies that you don't Star Wars you know and now Dr who was a woman\nI think that you know if a if it's a these are women are still spending their money on media physical media on movies and they're they're controlling that dollar and I think we're going to see a lot of wind five five films with strong female role\nThrow throw out some percentages I'm going to give you some age brackets here among those who are Fifteen Years old to twenty what percent of them do you think go to movies\n[noise] probably [laughter] not really [laughter] Fifteen to twenty\nFifteen to Twenty years old yeah I thought I Would\nI Would say forty ... twenty to thirty twenty to thirty I Would say uh I Would maybe I maybe I knew that a little higher maybe maybe fifty percent thirty to forty percent usually [noise]\nThirty to forty I Would say I would say larger I Would I Would guess maybe fifty by\nReally okay now I think it starts coming down forty to fifty\nYears old forty to fifty years old I thank you yeah I think it would really come down I Would think that maybe maybe a twenty percent fifty to sixty and I would have probably even less and I don't know maybe the Fifteen year old by the hang in there but I think maybe the six year old and and beyond are probably\nA much much more likely to um enjoy a film in their home and the trouble was going to a theater\nOne of the things we'll do just for fun next hour when we take calls for you is we'll ask the callers if they want to share their age it's up to them and bone on well and whether they go to movies or not\nI Can't remember the last movie I went to\nI mean I I look at a lot at home on video I ... when you know they come out as a news new release or something I'll watch it uh but I I Can't remember the last time I was in an actual lily I\nDo enjoy I Do enjoy seeing a film and theater with an audience by a lot of time\nAnd that's you know and that's your ... your business so I I I'm\nI'm biased because I'm watching the audience but I\nThat's what you do so that's one of the things we'll do folks who'd take calls next hour in addition to your question your horror story of your favorite film if you want to give us she'd give time your age when you call in and uh let's ask you if you ... when the last time you went to a movie\nOr you know what's interesting too about movies how they have changed over the years I mean in the thirties and forties you had these grand musicals and these incredible songs\nAnd people were dancing on them in the movies man see those days are gone\nMaybe they'll come in never know maybe they'll come back you know maybe George you know maybe you should dust off your tap shoes [laughter] you and I could make up all singing all dancing supernatural for\nA dime a single George never was a tap dancer [laughter] to me I just saw a clip on YouTube\nOf Frank Sinatra and Gene Kelly dancing or to take me out to the ball game they sang it has to do what and they were magnificent together I didn't know Sinatra can dance like that no no I was surprised when\nI was seeing hundreds of years in the cartoons that rail thin swaying next to a microphone I don't really think of him dance\nNow it's truly remarkable now are they still coming up with good horror films these days\nI kind of do you know you had mentioned the conjuring a movies\nI watch five years ago it was good that was two thousand Thirteen wasn't I guess\nThat's true but they're still making them yeah they are on the but I don't know third or fourth conjuring spin

to walk into a store and and buy it are you left out you know that might be the kind of thing that you know kind of attract that mind set us up collecting ...\nWhen I did about a year ago is I went

WHYY in [noise]\nThat we would actually have a spoof show in the theater and so we had a you know uh we basically have swam me bringing Bela Lugosi back to life and then we had a uh the people dressed as it goes\nSo flying through the audience and touching people and and uh\nUh we had a a you know all kinds of the gimmicks nurses in attendance and uh you know prize giveaways and I'm a lot of shtick a lot of corny stuff uh but those shows used for wall they would travel and it pretty much was the birth of the midnight movie because\nYou know the the theaters didn't want to give up their eight o'clock movie or their ten o'clock movie\nAnd so um you know the the the people who are flow walling they would they would buy the theater out you know they would they would show up in town with a film under their arm a scary movie and they they they would rent the theater out\nA after hours and they would show these uh shows mainly for teenagers are usually teenagers who wanted his neck a and sometimes rowdy ah rowdy teenagers too\nAnd sometimes they did have matinees for kids to 'em but then they would they have these amazing blackouts where they turn the lights out and they would have ... and asked him ghosts made out of a\nMosque that were ... phosphorus and [laughter]\nAnd they would they would uh you know they would have these chain that would be wrapped through the bleachers and they were rats with them back and forth but it would make all the chairs vibrate and they'd all these great uh you know that they would put the they were put weird the strings and ice water and\nThrow them out in the audience and they go down to the back of people's shirts and people will be feeling with cold\nNoodle going down the back of their shirt you know um there was so many fun kind of carnival type gimmicks\nThat these guys did and they would go from town to town town and sometimes they do three movies back to back um with all these great gimmicks there'd be a magician and by show act you know people putting nail through their nose and all that stuff\n[noise] what's the appeal of the Rocky Horror picture show remember without\nOp so lovely absolutely I think that that did have an audience participation aspect to it you know when when they have the toast everyone throws a piece of toast at the screen\nOf people have call and response where they're yelling things up at the screen or you know there's rice prone during the wedding and I think it's an immersive experience but I also think because of the sexuality of the film you know people who are sixteen Seventeen years old and are kind of emerging into their adult life\nIt's kind of an ... thing that they can go into with their friends and you know they might uh\nAccidentally see a little skin or something [laughter] so I think that all that factored in and and you have a you know people who who met met each other is sixteen year old a Rocky Horror and ended up getting married as adult than I ever\nAs I've I've seen that that I've seen the shadow cast in the states for a purpose\nIt goes along with the movie performing very very different markets all over the country and over and over again I blew people who were mad at that show and gotten married so I don't know what it is about that but you definitely find your people with you if you really are into that\nHouston, Texas regal Robert's with

black Christmas uh there was a a a killer that was terrorizing sorority sisters who all lived in the same house and\nShe he was calling them from inside the house\nOh wow that's where we pie that's creepy\nUh and uh but uh there was also yeah it's it's a very creepy film a really well made structured horror film John facts and it's amazing in it\nAnd it I'm a template for a lot of those kind of

looks back with a PHD social anthropologist writers speaker\nHas been a leader in the field of consciousness studies for more than three decades Dr ... serves as a president emeritus and a senior fellow at the Institute of ... sciences at the late Edgar rituals foundation\nAnd her latest work deaths makes life possible revolutionary insights on living dined in the continuation of consciousness and Marilyn welcome back good to have you get\nI think that George it's great to be here and how are you what's new\nI'm Glad it's been a wild ride I think that we're living in an extraordinary time thing right now and\nThat just trying to balance and stay on the cutting edge\nHow did you end up doing what you're doing how did that I thought well I started\nWhen I wasn't a rebellion head in Detroit and feeling like I wanted to change the world that had no way to do that and that I had a couple of experiences started with being somewhere I shouldn't have been what somebody I shouldn't have been with\nA closing time and the bar on the back of a motorcycle and we got hit by a drunk driver oh really my\nBody a motorcycle and um\nI had a real physical tangible\nOut of body experience and watched my body tumbling through the air landing on the concrete and I think there was something in that moment that suggests that any way that consciousness is more than just their physical\nBloom and then I went home to heal and they had talked about possibly amputated my leg and I lay there and I used my imagination to visualize my immune system healing me\nAnd I was you know really aware of the tangles up my lab ... you know now I have two sturdy legs and I think that consciousness is something powerful\nAnd we're going to talk about you your first experience near death experience you were just a year and a half year old weren't you\nKnow that's true I\nWandering around my family's house in my ... ... ... and being a good and pure assist which means you investigate everything\nWould you have those little feet pajamas I think so I don't really remember them on [laughter]\nBut I've heard tales and ah anyway my father had inadvertently left a can of lighter fluid sitting on the kitchen table\nAnd you know I did what good Eighteen month old kids do and I put it in my mouth and I ended up in and out of intense\nDrink I drink it and it causes massive pneumonia and almost didn't make it so I think that there were some seeds planted then too that got me on this path of wanting to understand consciousness somebody once you were wrong mine I guess that's a nice way to think about\nYou do know I was born in Detroit and raised there in Las there when I was twenty eight years old\nI think I knew that but I didn't remember until now so tell me where was\nThat I was born in the city and then we ended up moving to Dearborn Heights a war we spent most of my childhood and then the marsh first places I was in tumor Michigan Farmington Hills\nAnd then worked in all three television stations in Detroit to four and seven\nAnd then in Nineteen Seventy nine I moved to Ninety civilians I moved to Minneapolis Nineteen Seventy nine I moved to St Louis knowing back and forth between St Louis in Los Angeles how about you know\nWell I was right in Detroit right near city airport and ah it was about the time I figured out I could leave that I left and you know I still have a lot of nostalgia for Detroit and a lot of admiration for the people that are trying to make a difference there\nFamily still there I have some family um they moved out to Harrison township where I had my modus motorcycle accident while you're born ... really yeah well he\nTold me where cars you must remember this the the street\nOh I don't I don't know who\nWas ... was it a busy street\nYeah it was a busy street but it was late and I think the trauma kind of over ...\nI'm going to I'm going to close my eyes and yes you'll remote viewing now that you were on telegraph room\nThat sounds that sounds about right near Michigan viewing skill near Michigan album yeah that sounds about right I Can't remember exactly to say for sure but I'm sure there's records of its roots in your book you're my gosh yeah well thank you my friend I appreciate it showed\n... really steer you in the direction where you are now um and you get a PHD in social after apology you've just been elected a vice president of the psychological shows you usually get into the but is this would lead the foundation for you\nWell I think I really started when I got to Wayne State University in downtown Detroit which\nYou'll remember I Do and there were times worse the Detroit\nUh-huh good one oh really so that is right downtown no\nUm [noise] well I discovered to books when I got into college in the first one was Thomas Coons book\nCalled the structure of scientific revolutions and that book said that we live in a paradigm or a world view I kind of social construction of reality and that that world view has changed periodically through history\nAnd that was a big empowerment for me because I felt like well maybe what we're experiencing in Detroit this you know kind of civil war that was going on the race war and class war and gender war and ultimately a worldview\nConflict I think that um maybe it wasn't permanent and maybe wasn't defined by ultimate reality\nSo that was liberating and then that led me to the second book which was psychic exploration by Edgar Mitchell the Apollo fourteen out and then I read and I didn't apply for the job at no attic sciences but it was about\n... Fifteen Years later that they invited me to come and be there director of research and worked my way up the ladder from their\nNon Europe show for your university no\nThat's right we're looking at trance personal experiences and from a psychological and\nNow what is the trench personal psychology what is the\nStuff you're interested in George it's all that kind of notion that there are\nAspects of our experience that transcend the physical\nThat people can have these kind of altered states or near death or out of body type of experiences and it doesn't mean it's pathological it means that may be a catalyst for some big breakthrough the understanding more about who we are and what the nature of reality might be\nMore with Dr Merrill Lynch ... just like the beer right\nIt is really only well you know it\nComes from an old brewery village in Germany ... but uh actually strollers brewery what she'll remember\nI remember the Troy lists and so the beer that made\nMilwaukee famous actually is now a Detroit beer at least last time I checked\nThey do they do they still college which beer you know I don't know I haven't really ... yes well I'm\nSure right although micro breweries have taken over\n... whatever you want to be learned about near death experiences of all the other side what to do what can you conclude at this point\nWell I Know that culture takes a big role in defining what we experience so if we're told our entire life through our educational system and our families are work environment\nThat the only real valid reality is the physical you know that which we can measure and manipulate and touch and pays a sin that's usually what we see and if we are brought up in a world view or a culture that except extended\nRealms of possibility then more and more likely to perceive those realms of possibility and some of it may be a cultural construction but I also believe very definitely that there are\nMore aspects of our human experience than just our physical embody met\nAnd if people can tap into this and use it in their living life I think they can do some remarkable things with that don't you\nI really do I think that if we start to own\nThe power of our intention you know the fact that the intention is very important principle so from the morning when we get out of bed and we intend to ... you know make up a path or a plan going forward that's an expression of intention\nUh and then what about those big intentions where we want to achieve something you know beyond our normal capacity that becomes a tremendous empowerment and so to the extent we can begin to cultivate these abilities I think the more we'll be able to accomplish\nThose dreams that many of us have\nHave you come across any during the ...

get triggered by some reminder of their mortality it can lead to very pathological types of behaviors\nBut if you can bolster their sense of um personal worth their their value in the world and you you enhance their self esteem you'll see that when you trigger them they actually become more altruistic they care about other people\nSo I think if we can approach this idea of death and the great mystery of it with an open heart and that kind of skepticism that is productive\nI think you can become a great exploration and a wonderful adventure for people\nProbably could win no did you did you know agree Mitchell before he passed on\nYeah very well regarded worked with him for years wonderful person Edgar said in the interview I did with him for death makes life possible that you know I mean I was really interested in his story because\nHe was a person who had been fighting in Korea he had been a test pilot and he talked about you know being on those aircraft carriers where\nWhen they would go off on a mission and then they had to come back and find the aircraft carrier in the middle of the ocean it was like a needle in a haystack\nAnd so for him that was a scary moment when he got in the Apollo capsule and went to the moon he said you know there was plenty of space on the moon and it was hard to find [laughter]\nUm but you know his thing that he said that I thought was so wise is that he\nFelt that was much more important\nTo live a good life and to be a good citizen I'm to be loving unkind toward other people than it was to spend a lot of time worrying about what's going to happen next and I just thought that you know it's a powerful notion and he was a great man\nUsed we're descended of evidence to prove that there's life after death if you were like quarter law and she knew this was challenged debts was challenged could you prove that there's life after\n[noise] so this would make a great reality show and I love Ina courtroom let's do it\n[laughter] so you have a judge in a jury and you have people representing different points of view on controversial topics so take this one you know life after death and you have these people arguing their various position\nWith witnesses that come and go\nExactly giving their own personal testimony based on their experiences\nWe ... put it right there and then you get into this question of what would shift to people's mind about\nThat question and is it that data is it the fact that in Stevenson collected these you know nearly a thousand cases and showed that thirty five percent of them correlated with the birth mark is that what's going to persuade people or is it the personal experiences that somebody's reporting\nYou know I had a conversation with my departed dad and he told me to go to this closet and find something you know that's really persuasive for people much more than accumulating a lot of data I think\nI I think so too Dr Merrill Lynch which were those were going to take phone calls next hour\nAbout life after death let's talk a little bit Marilyn and the time we have remaining here about consciousness and how important it please which rule but employees with all of this what would you first of all say consciousness is\nWell I think\nAgain we can have many definitions for me it's been about our awareness\nAnd also our lack of awareness of what we're not aware of so by that I mean when I first talked about Thomas ... book on paradigm shifts\nWe live in a paradigm or a world view and the interesting thing to me about world views is that we don't even know that we have them\nAnd yet they're the most important thing that shapes her experience so it's like we're walking through life with these colored glasses on and it it Shapes Our experiences and so we can't see those things that lie outside of our expectation\nAnd I think part of the process of becoming aware is becoming aware that we're not aware and that we have what's called an attentional blindness for example\nWe are primed to perceive those parts of the world\nThat we expect to see and if we don't expect to see them we simply don't see them and I think that that is a remarkable uh aspect of what our consciousness is all about it's a lot of a functioning on auto pilot at the unconscious level and to the extent we can\nYou know turn the light on what those experiences are and what Shapes Our awareness where are we placing our attention that then offers us a point of liberation into expanding what we understand to be true\nDo you believe that the consciousness Lou ... outside of the brain\nI Do I think consciousness is\nSomething that has intelligence it is self correcting\nIt is reflective and so you can go into a rain forest and see that as consciousness manifest in the forest because every ... is filled with life and with that intention\nTo manifest life and so I I Do believe that consciousness as something much bigger than our individual brain\nI don't think it's an ... the phenomenon of the brain and at the same time I think the brain is kind of like you know the radio that is taking the signal and so if you destroy the brain you may destroyed the radio it doesn't mean you've destroyed the consciousness\nOr the or the signal exactly teach moment ... will will science ever meet\nThe spiritual ...\n[noise] I think so I mean I think we're getting closer and closer all the time I just spent time with Sophia the Android she's a robot\nNew Hartford was her yeah she'd be great for you to interview 'em and see if they would do it in a way that doesn't give me Warner's a talk show host and she's going to do I do worry you're nobody better than your George\nComing back with phone calls your calls next on coast to coast to find out more about just going to
