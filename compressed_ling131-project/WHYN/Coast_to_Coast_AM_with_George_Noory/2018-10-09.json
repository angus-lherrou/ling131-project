we feature a number of podcast ... who are doing some incredible things they just need to develop their audience and get more people to listen to them tonight fringe investigations\nSo some things you know seven hundred eight hundred pounds\nGonna leave a whole lot deeper than it is in the mud so you know you don't think there's there's solved walking fast lots and you're\n... you're not going to have a ten foot sasquatch leaving a quarter inch footprint that you know seven eight hundred pounds it just doesn't work maybe they take ballet possibly you never know but anyway I say that it is there's different kinds of proof\nIs different kinds of evidence and everyone thinks something that might not be you have to be ... again it goes back to using scientific method\nAnd looking at all

you yeah I mean that's how we measure we measure lane measure with that and then we always try to show you how deep it is\nAnd I think when you do something like that it's a little more scientific than just having a cat that something that you think they print but when you start looking at it in the scientific method it just doesn't pan out because it's probably put someone that slips and then it along gated and that's why it's only a quarter of an inch deep insult around\nThree talented people put on the fringe investigations broadcast the first is the cryptic guy Christian McLeod

Kevin I was surprised when you called me and said you were also getting into crypto currency is what's going on\nWith George we've set up a specific program that allows people do hold crypto currency inside their IRAs well\nAre you suggesting people have a bitcoin i._r._a. instead of a gold or silver IRA\nNot at all we give investors the option don't both in their IRA\nNow explain that force\nWhen I first heard about it pointed treated for pennies in fact there's an incredible story about how one guy by two pizzas with ten thousand bitcoins\nThat we're about twenty dollars at the time but here's the shocker today those ten thousand bitcoins are worth more than sixty million dollars and we stories like that more people are interested in owning it\nWow that's quite a pizza [laughter] and that's where you come in\nRight bitcoin is a little tricky to buying holding an IRA so we make it easy we do all the work\nKevin is bitcoin or currency\nIt can be used as a currency but right now we see it being used as an asset like gold and silver but in digital form\nHow much is bitcoin right now\nJust over sixty five hundred dollars but at one point Georgia was worth over twenty thousand that's why people on on it\nYou say you make it easy to own bitcoin in your IRA talk about that\nGeorge we do all the work we buy it for you holding insecure account and sell it for you any proceed

high technology artificial intelligence Byron Reese with us his book the fourth age Byron Ilan mosques delete Stephen Hawking they were petrified warning us about the dangers of artificial intelligence is it that bad\nA well I I Would say that I don't think so but I Will say this what what they're worried about a was what we mentioned earlier which is kind of artificial intelligence we don't know how to build a general intelligence\nAnd that's we don't know how to build it but the idea that we could build it is based on the simple a supposition and that is that people are machines\nIf if you are a machine and your brain as a machine and your mind as a machine and it stands to reason at some point in the future we can build a mechanical you\nAnd then over time that will become better and better and better it'll have an IQ of a hundred and two hundred the two thousand and two million and then it won't even know what you are um I find\nThat idea that people are machines to be very pervasive in Silicon valley um my probably cost about it I I I find that the one person in twenty that doesn't believe that and you will be take surveys on my website asking synch with the same question about eighty five percent of the rest of the country\nWe know these technologies can do an enormous amount of good they can they can feed the hungry and diagnose illness and do all of these things and I'm not sure that introducing an element of like it may turn on is a\nBit there may be more\nThat that may do a lot more harm\nThan than than good if it's ... it's very little suggest the machine would do that now through through accidents are absolutely you know you had a had a rocket blow up because the single one was a transposed with the obese transposed with a zero\nSo a lot of our systems are quite brittle and that is very true you\nKnow if you had a um you could out an airline pilot had a heart attack and that's bad for one ... air airplane full of people\nOn the same time you got the co pilot right there you go but if you have a um if you have a computer flying a network computer fly all the airplanes in it quote has a heart attack like that\nYeah that may that may propagate through a systems may be much much more brittle much one better\nThey may break in big ways now that being said they haven't done that yet and and and we come you know we're better now I think uh at writing good software that we were a few years back\n[noise] what is fueling the grows in the ... and just really the incredible growth on this kind of technology\n... ... is it the human being\nThe main thing that fuels that technology is it's actually finally working\nA hey I even the term was calling to Nineteen fifty six by a man named McCarthy McCarthy and uh he got together with a few other computer scientist and they said you know we work really hard we can solve artificial intelligence and one summer or they thought that for a very interesting reason which was\nNewt and you know three laws of planetary motion laws magnetism laws of physics laws of electricity very few simple laws that explain everything and they hope to find that with intelligence we did\nThat being said people get excited about a bunch of money came and everybody was disappointed funding dried up all the people you know took a nap for ten years\nThen there was a breakthrough more funding everybody\nNeither a winter it kept going well now for the first time in space up his face up to space up his face up to space it's delivering the goods it it can it if you out of business it can make probably any department in your business ten ten percent passed didn't protect better ten percent more profitable\nOr it can it can do all of these things you couldn't do before and so we're never going to have another one of those winters we now have the technology that we know how to do some cool things if there were no more advances in a ah ah we probably have twenty five years worth of stuff just to apply what we know today\nTo the world but of course we're going to have you know more dense has a ... they come to light speed almost\nJust amazing now will we ever have a series of artificial intelligence soldiers by the millions sending them into warfare in battle\nIt's a fantastic question um\nArtificial intelligence the simplest definition is it's a system that response to its environment so land mine is the kind of artificial intelligence if it were a program that is if something weighs more than fifty pounds explode\nThat's a very rudimentary very rudimentary a A R if somebody came out with a landmine just hypothetically that said ah there's a camera and it can make sure it's somebody wearing a petite ...\nOr carrying a gun mhm and then it blows up you would say well that's that's that's better isn't it\nAnd then if you say well it can also sniff for gun powder and you know it can do for other things to make sure it's blowing up the right person you say well that's better I guess that's better right\nAnd you you eventually get your way all the way up to um if you could have ... to to an artificial intelligence\nThat fights wars and instead of people\nUm there's there is a quote debate about whether we're gonna make autonomy Skilling systems I think it's disingenuous the debate is I personally think it's disingenuous I think you've got twelve or Thirteen countries that are ... that have significant military budgets that are spending good money on these systems and no one of them can say\nYou know I let the other guys all have it but I'm not going to do it I just don't think that's going to happen or the south Koreans came out with the forty million dollar automatic Gunter it that\nCould could shoot people at a distance automatically and it it's required by law to say you know leave before I shoot 'em and it now requires a person\nTo approve it's tiring but originally I didn't uh they only put that in because people requested it and so ah it could easily be turned off so even if you make decisions that require people to make decisions\nYou can always disabled them so I think it's inevitable that we're going to for better or worse whatever you think\nThat we're going to build a a weapon systems it's going to have well for for three very easy reasons you can argue that ah they're they're better they're more effective it their mission and there'll be less collateral damage and wherever they are\nYou then argue that you will be saving lives are soldiers ... or ... whatever country you are\nAnd and and third you know they won't they won't work and be effective and probably cost effective will enable unfortunately to lower the political cost of going to war which uh is is not not necessarily a good thing\nWell it may not be a good thing but in the long run if we don't do it some other country will\nUh absolutely absolutely I'm just saying that it isn't necessarily good for all nations to feel like oh well it's just these weapon systems fighting each other it doesn't really matter and and\nYou know if if he has no cost a then perhaps it's entered into more rationally\nI mean I Do you see the day though by run that you know we're coming up to the top of the hour we'll finishes up when we come back next hour but\nYou know we've got drones delivering packages were talking about artificial like cars with driverless cars you see the day that you know all the entire post office system will be done because they'll deliver and with artificial male people for example but think about that will be back\nTo

ever a robot uprising\nJust wait Fifteen minutes out of batteries there'll be dead 'cause we can't even you know make batteries that power these things for very long so right now heads down and and I think for for decades to come a people\nAren't going to you're not going to make machines that had the same range of movement you're going to have a robot electrician who comes in\nAnd look at your house silver and figure out where to punch your wall out to run the wires it's just way beyond you know when I called my airline of choice and it tells me you know say your number\nI'm happy when it gets that right when it doesn't get a and ate and ate all mixed up so that's kind of wherever that um but like you said that oh you know yet um\nAnd that's it and that's a big yet because one day at the progression we're going we're going to get there\nWell\nWith physical robots maybe that's true it's an open question on intelligence it's an open question whether a computer can be creative with their computer\nAnd it may be that\nThat you have to experience the world\nIn order to do a lot of the things we have and it's it's unclear that computers will be able to do it and let me let me say real quick thing about our brains you know we have these brains that we don't really understand and then we had these by ...\nWhich is kind of all the things the brain does that we can't really explain like I have a sense of humor you know your liver doesn't have a sense of humor but somebody your brain does\nAnd then we have consciousness and people think we don't understand the brain 'cause it's just so stinking so many neurons but people who spent Twenty years working on something called the open worm project to try to take this little worms we've got three hundred and two neurons in his brain they spent Twenty years trying to modeled out of the computer\nJust take a worm that lives in a computer with a brain of three hundred new neurons and even among the people have been working on it they're not even sure it's possible so there are so many we we are so spectacularly\nAmazing uh beings that that\nDuplicate what we do with the machine is you know of one leading a researcher said worrying about those kinds of things like worrying about overpopulation on Mars yeah maybe some day we'll have to worry about overpopulation of bars but it's like that far out\nSo you call your book to fourth age because you believe we've had three ages beak already going way back but tell me about this\nSo we learned this trick humans did\nWhich is technology which is multiplying what we were able to do\nAnd and we've used it to overcome scarcity because\nFor law of human history there's just never been enough to the good stuff never in a food and medicine never enough of any of the good stuff but we learned this trick technology and sometimes we learned something so\nBig and knew that it just changed the trajectory of humanity forever and the first of these was a hundred thousand years ago I think it was a language that this thing we do where we coordinate action about what it means is that you know twelve humans working together you know man of was a match for us anymore 'cause\n'cause we could all communicate and the man it's couldn't um then the second one I think is when we got agriculture and that actually wasn't the big deal because agriculture give us the city and the density gave us a division of labor and the division of labor says you know you specialize in I specialize in we're all better off because of it so\nAgriculture indirectly gave us prosperity and that changed everything we have prosperity\nAnd then the third time things changed I think it was five thousand years ago when we got two technologies coincidentally at the same moment\nWe got the wheel and we got writing and when those two things happened\nOr you invented a nation state and that's why I dozen years ago you can kind of shut your clock by it all over the world\nA giant civilizations emerge ... Mesopotamia missile America and just go all over the world and so I Do think that um that robots are another thing of that magnitude\nIf you if you actually can take human thought and put it in the machine and human action and put it in a machine and and and multiply us both you know we're number one on this planet 'cause we're the smartest thing on it imagine if you can just make a whole lot smarter huh I don't I Can't predict what that's going to what's that's going to do but it's going to be a big one\nWell we know for example that machines called 'em robots or revolutionize the automobile industry with mass production I mean they they did things faster than humans can I'm coming from St Louis\nI've been in in in ... Bush factory and I see how they bottle beer or by the thousands in the bottles humans can't do it that fast or\nYou're ... you're right that the artificial intelligence and it is to be\nFrightening if if you saw if you were a skilled across person and you saw unskilled people making more stuff better and cheaper than you like how purifying once that and yet we don't look back and say that was a bad

you've got a lot of people who need to feed you still have illness that that kills everybody you still have poverty which I think's a technical problem you have all these problems\nTechnology can solve why do I say that\nBecause they don't have to be that there are there are lots of problems that aren't technical like there's hatred bigotry and all of that but there are certain things we just haven't figured out how old are you in disease how do you\nSlow down aging how do you do all these things and so they're suffering people around the world that just are waiting for technology to come through and and finally deliver on all the utopias people used to dream about whether it be great if\nAnd now finally we've learned district and we can now make enough that all the good stuff for everybody and we just we're almost there and and so I don't think we I Would speed it up if I could there's there's still too much suffering in the world\nRichie ... so much for the last thing you know we live in a world a universe that looks looks vaguely looks burying the uh it looks like it's waiting for us to pay a visit you know I think our ultimate destiny is a billion people each on a

we carry ... balanced on this you know pale blue dot\nGonna Ritchie in West Virginia now Ritchie taken away go ahead sir\nThat morning and thanks for having me on the show interesting topic I I just wanted to ask your guest there and if you think that the way technologies progress thing that we may get to that and you're going to be an age where we only have to work just to better ourselves as human beings as working alongside with technology\nI Love that question you know you don't Maynard Keynes the economist in Nineteen thirty wrote an essay and he said in a hundred years so basically our time GDP will be up eight fold and real dollars and people will only work Fifteen hours\nAnd so you have to ask like well what happened because GDP did a poll just like you thought so why are we still working all these hours and what it turns out is that if you want to live\nThe way somebody lived in Nineteen thirty Bel Air conditioning six hundred square feet no medical insurance no higher education vacation grow your own food make your own clothes\nYou worked Fifteen hours a week and live like you did in Nineteen thirty are the people decided they wanted more and so there is no limit

we're not completely materialistic interestingly the the time we save at home but not hauling water up from the well and not run washing her clothes at the river we turn that into hobbies but it turns out we've always worked forty hours a week\nIf if if our productivity goes off we just work more to get more\nAnd we always talk at the time we save at home I'm with labor saving devices\nWhere do you see this fifty years from now this technology\nUm\nI I think that question I ask earlier which is you know if you can imagine a machine doing a job I think we all have machines doing the kinds of jobs you can imagine a machine doing you just start looking around you and say\nYou know who to machine a fixed by rote probably couldn't machine teach kindergarten probably not a ... or what we want it to

bart is entirely right we are using a economists weapons that they killed decision of course we've done that since landmines we drop drop dumb bombs uh I mean\nThe nature of warfare is we build machines that they kill\n'em so I didn't mean to say\nThat uh that we that we don't do that we've always done that we built machines that that we push a button and we don't know who's going to die\nOr the debate that is allegedly going on is whether are we going to\nYou know make more dense systems that operate completely economists say that you can just release in an area and it will go and decide that's a non combative that's about it I'll kill them and so forth a it's a subtle distinctions but bart I agree with you\nThe fourth day smart robots conscious computers in the future of humanity where do you get the book Byron\nWherever find books are sold I think is the expression Amazon dot com Barnes and noble or just visit by road rage dot com and they'll be a lot of like\nSo what do you see is the most dramatic change coming for us through artificial intelligence\nWhat's going to out Trump to very simple things one uh individual worldwide average income per capita for the last two thousand years or if you look at it for Seventeen hundred and fifty years from say the birth of Christ Seventeen fifty nothing happened\nWhat if you look starting seventeenth fifty shot up like a rocket um why because we learned how to system because the acquisition of knowledge we made the scientific method and there's no limit to where that line is going to go so vast amounts of well created a eliminating poverty and then the second thing I think will happen\nIs all purely technical problems like disease and hunger you will live to see the end up I Know that sounds like a I'm dreaming all kinds of people said it would be possible but um you know this country the United states already Throws Away enough\nFood to eat all the hungry people in the world no question isn't it the world's strains to feed them or we just need to get a little better at it\nWell and I hope we do solve all these kinds of illnesses and diseases that wouldn't be traumatic more to come on coast to coast as we

that the craziest title called their book that goes for dogs for\nWhat some of your peers say about the fact that I mean here you are you were a corporate executive doing some great work and now you're writing a story about the ghost photographer\nGet out and it it it's a great question I\nI think because what I Do day in day out you know rooted and data\nAnd and I'm and I'm now ... you know within the organization thing you know very direct honest kind of person that when I started telling these stories and they couldn't help but believe even if they were kind of on the fence because they're like way you make it up\nAnd you're that you're that nerd we went and [laughter] and you know and I would say Ninety nine point nine percent of the people and have kind of gone with me on the journey and I think that's a very small you know\nPoint zero one percent\nUm you know they they just\nThey can't make their way over right to our mind um\nBut I'll tell you at least half if not more than half the people that when I started telling them one of my stories they could interrupt me fast enough to tell me there's [noise]\nAnd I realized you know during this time that I was kind of thinking about you know put it writing it all down\nLike oh my gosh people don't want to come out about this like there in the closet they're afraid to tell the stories because they're afraid that they're going to sound like they're crazy which is one of the reasons I actually wanted to write the book\nWas so you know people could feel liberated to just to tell their people talk about their experiences because\nSo many people have had him and I also wanted them to you know what I wanted to write it so people also will believe in themselves and believe that it's actually happened and not you know their their brain playing tricks on them or something\nWell what's so amazing to is that people\nAre all into the ... like you said not a lot of ... minutes well once they feel comfortable with you or somebody who is going through the same thing when you open up\nOh my gosh they talk your ear off and you know just just for your listeners and because I Am a nerd do you mind if I roll through just a couple of stats for them to go because I you know when this started happening to me um I didn't know a lot about it you know I didn't understand\nUm a lot about what really anything about goes photography a little bit about medium ship just you know some of those things are a little bit about but I started um I started researching and there is a Harris Poll um that says that between forty and forty five percent of Americans believe and go\nSo we're almost the majority\nAttorney were barely a minority and that's grown\nAnd and you know what I think it was done maybe three years ago four years ago something like that\nWould be over fifty percent\nI I Would think so and the second is that um I worked with my friends I'm at Google um to get this and\nEvery two seconds\nTo say it again for everybody every two seconds someone in North America is Googling the word ghost not all sing yes every two seconds\nSo none of us are alone I think everybody knows they're not alone because of you whose whose listening um but they can also now use them statistics to tell their friends hey I had a way I'm barely a minority and I'm probably a majority now\nYou have nothing to hide\nAnd have nothing to hide\n... journey started for you because of a personal situation\nYes did you did\nThis started from me I'm I'm I mean the book really is a journey Adderall transformational Journey Through grief\nUm I lost my mother to all timers are and you know I I you you'd only deal with the the eight to ten years prior to it 'cause it's a very it's a painful disease for everyone um and when she passed I was devastated I was broken she I was her person in this world\nAnd not long after she passed\nI started seeing ghost and photograph and at first it scared the heck out of me um\nI actually want to I'd open a like a ghost portal because you know I Do live in the world of movies so everything in my life I think about tends to get exaggerated when it's like oh my gosh it goes world holder guys what am I done\n'em and and then I started staging you know the house the perimeter everything um and kept taking photographs and I now have a crazy collection of nine thousand photographs with us\nYou have been doing several things were kind of cameras\nAnd iPhone\nI used in what a great ad by the way right shouldn't apple say have an ad that says shot on an iPhone and have scroll through a bunch of pictures of ghost [noise]\nUm it was an iPhone I I ... at one point and and the journey I bought a real cameras like Sam son Kamron out of phone but like a regular camera and it was interesting because all I captured on that um we're ... not that ... you know aren't important in special in our ecosystem\nBut I wasn't getting everything else interesting no\nWhen this was going on for the entire journey looks looks good into your mother's situation and the old timers but how did that really gets you going\n[noise]\nHow did you I'm Sorry so you mean get me going through\nThis year I mean how did I start to heal from that you started to get the strange thing\nYeah I Am you know I I was I'm very lucky I um have found some phenomenal\nAh women actually in this world that are incredible psychics and they were like my psychic sherpas through this and you know how how make me understand that I was an absolutely crazy and then I wasn't running up and down the streets the Sherman Oaks screaming you know hide your kids had your wife we got ghost in the neighborhood\nAnd um so ... so I had some guides I ... you know that that were helped me understand it and an album investigated and\nUm I I started you know after I saw the first coast and the photograph I um you know I kind of panic was intrigued because I I got to be honest with you George I was a little bit of a skeptic before a skeptic as and it's not true\nA skeptic that you want to know\nRight right I ... it wasn't a this can't possibly be true kind of person but you know it was like really really take pictures of goes\nUm so I you know\nI I read a lot I investigated I talked I I I mean I I think I did what any but he would do is just trying to understand what was happening and\nYou know I I think\nLooking at the underlying aspect of it is I I I think when people\nAre in grief and people are experiencing grief\nI'm wearing chaos and when you're in chaos um you're able to open up and shed would ever rigidity or get over yourself or get over it whatever skepticism you may have and and I think you fall into things like this\nAnd sales really great crystals and stone so either way than many in Los Angeles as interested and so I call Patricia and\nAnd I tell her story and she goes oh my that sounds\nLike that was your spirit guide because I've never heard such specificity she goes you know Julie we're born with spirit guide to kind of not just through life and if we're willing to be open in less than they are there to help us and I said well it's a really good thing because I had a heart that woman in the car in front of me and she has no baby\nIt wasn't a woman in front of you their life that your guide was saving it was yours [laughter] that's right\nOh okay\n[noise] does that change you well\nIt it in a second it did so I go to work have a weird day [laughter] 'cause I'm thinking\nYou know what a crazy morning that ... that night I get my car and I call my friend Pam who lives in Cincinnati and Pam is Mona sister who was killed in the car when it happened so is pants husband who sustained permanent brand brain damage as of today from that accident\n[noise] so I called him tell the story and she says huh just want to hear the other half of your story and I said sure\nShe said you know and get depressed and stay in bed I said yes and she goes I was in bed when you called this morning I had the phone in the bed with me I saw you calling I went to reach for the phone but I was paralyzed couldn't move\nShe said imagine what would have happened if I Would have picked up the phone and I said I'd be dead today\nShe's like yeah you would and so yes it completely changed me because I firmly and fully believe\nThat I'm going to but I Am on a bonus round sure and the big lesson is about paying attention people say what's your book about and I said I can tell you a lot of things but the number one thing I'm going to tell you the pay attention and trust yourself\nWhen you take your picture ... ... are you aiming at something or does it just\nIt's both I learned early when I started staging everything one day I set the stage pot

Adam and Eve away from God to me to get them scratched out of the book of life\nAnd so clearly he's not a nice guy right so my theory and it's just a theory that's all it's a theory is that\nYou know if you subscribe to the idea that we're spirit having a human experience that when we sleep it's our physical body that needs to sleep not our spirit spirit goes off and parties in the actual space I'm sure many people have talked about that show planes\nAnd you know when our spirit is getting ready to land back into our body I think what happens is that it does\nAnd fully land and there's like a full face and I think that that's a little space before it lands properly and you are a line on is when this can happen\nAgain it's just a theory which are pretty good or\nIt's not terrible so I really consider it more of a spiritual condition that I Do a medical condition and it's not that people who have at our bad\nBecause you know what the light doesn't need more light or the dark doesn't need more dark but dark needs a lot you know the the the darkness one flight so I think it's you know people are\nAre these bright lights that I think that this entity kind of makes its way and and I don't really want to spoil for folks cause I I Hope people read the book\nI'm a at what happened that last time that alec saw the ... man because of that is probably the most profound event that have happened in my entire life\nWould you want to duplicated duplicated experience yeah yeah I can handle it now you would really yeah I could put you couldn't though um it\nWas um oh let me just tell them I just tell your audience what happened what happened I'll do it if you want me to George and like\nAll right I'll tell him oh we have a couple of minutes yeah oh\nIs it something about the blackout oh I'm Sorry I mean is when you say you're going to tell us\nOh yes Oh yes so I I thought how am I just tell everybody instead of is the thing about them having to read the book to find out because what happened was that Alex called then one night and that I saw that happening again\nAnd and he spoke to me\nAnd what he said to me was how her my name is Ron\nAnd I went he he said what\nHe said how hurt my name is wrong because I noticed that the message for you and I said yeah that's the name of I accept that it\nWas not very nice cheese and I said and he's trying to scare me away from you\nYou think that was him\nI don't think it was like that but I think it was that man who knows I Would say a lot about a lot of people\nThere to say um but I think that you know if anybody tries to if if there's any darkness that is trying to scare either going to find that thing that triggers you right there and find that deep dark thing they're going to\nFind who is the antagonism this person's life and mine is my accept that and and he brought that up and Alex didn't didn't even know about my accepted didn't even know his name\nWhen all this was happening to [laughter] we went weird yeah I mean\nAre you under control which is now I mean do you feel as if you're in control of what's happening\nI I Am I Am I Am I Am now because I now\nUnderstand that I Am in charge I completely understand\nThat I Am also I've become here with\nThe photography all ... it's almost like that's the hobby will you do the ...\nYou know that goes with ... feet and um and ah and storytelling it would be considered um the inciting event it it's that event is what triggered all this other stuff happen\nOn the photography with you know a little scary at first because I it's weird it's it's it's weird there's no data\nDo you know who the subject matter is or ... or these random ghost [noise]\nUm [noise] I Do have a picture of my mother has a um I didn't include it in the book because it felt a little too sacred to include that in the book or doing um but other than that I don't recognize a single one I've had a couple that have come back twice\nSome of them look like they're in Eighteen hundred garb\nThey do they do yeah no I I don't know with all of them are there is some of them um you know I feel like I've gotten a few that looked like they had a rough time the last time they come and their bodies like a guy looks like he's been beat up a woman who looks like she's very sad\nMaybe that's how he died\nIt could very well be\nCould very well do they talk to you you know I'm after a while and after I got past the I Can't believe this is happening to me face um when I Would be able to see them I Would I Would start to ask\n'em I I was better\nWeirdly by

side\nI'm I have found a tremendous amount of peace\nI Know that there was more than what you see with your ... and I think it actually have\nIt you know it it actually doesn't bring me chaos it brings me peace um there's a lot more at work you know there's a lot more work like this story you know from the four oh five but I think is so\nI'm profound about that is all the coordination\nCollaboration that had to happen on the other side in order for me to still be alive you know my spirit guide you know talking to me and and I had to listen\nAnd believe too not just Pam my friend who I who I Believe is actually her sister who was holding her down where she could not answer the phone or the other four people I called that you know their guys or their spirits are there fast somebody was distracting them not to pick up the phone\nAll\nWith the you know chance that I Would hear in less than that is pretty incredible when you think about it from the flip side dramatic yeah it is and as I I Believe that's happening every day all day all the time to millions and millions of people\nDon't choose to listen don't you think it's pretty stark if you did not believe the other side that that's all there is\nYeah I think it makes the world really small and I think it and I think it also probably leads to a lot of depression and a lot of abuse\nLet's go to those who are
