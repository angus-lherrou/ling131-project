thoughts on whether those global warming climate change we don't muscle you because people have different views Steve New book outside the green box telling me about the title personable\nSure well that's the book that tells you what's your green consultant doesn't tell you a written for general audiences and businesses and a one popular business a phrase years over and over and think outside the box so the [laughter] the title was think outside the green bucks\nBecause businesses today are are really trapped in the green boxes sustainable development there\nThey're forced to do many things\nAh that don't really do anything for the environment and so I go through a what I call first before horsemen of environmental apocalypse a which are overpopulation the idea that humans are growing too fast and and are populating the planet too fast\nAre the ice caps melting or not she\nWell we've had a gentle warming again we've had a degree in the last hundred and Thirty years and so there's a little bit of ... at the north pole and in Greenland but the amazing thing is the ah the south pole ISIS getting thicker I Love the show a picture of the Amundson Scott station\nIn in my presentations that I say this is the uh the third station the United states has man since Nineteen fifty do you know what happened the other two stations\nAnd occasionally somebody come up with a right answer the answer is the other two were buried by snow\nAnd they leave built\nThey built this last station on stilts at seven modular buildings and they they Jack up each building every year over accumulating snow\nAnd that's where Ninety percent of the world's ice is and the south pole climate models cannot explain why the ISIS getting thicker in the south pole but on that we've lost a little bit um if you add it all up but there's there's really no concern or that we're losing large amounts of ice\nIt's a ... it's incredible when these stories come out saying that huge sheets of ice and falling off the shelves are melting away and everything else\nYeah I mean well you know they knew I knew it was\nAn ad Arctic ice sheet but but usually what they don't mention is there are about a hundred volcanoes under that ice sheet so it is possible that west Antarctic ice sheet could melt if we have big volcanic eruptions there but uh this is not being caused by carbon dioxide it's another natural factor\nWhat about the city's not want renewable energy [noise] plus or minus\nYeah this hundred percent renewables thing as I was as I was mentioning the the biggest problem with wind and solar is their intermittent and they can't read if you're going to maintain continuity of electricity supply\nThey can't replace traditional nuclear gas or coal ... when you put in solar wind a you only get about ten percent of the total capacity as far as adding to the capacity of your system\nSo if you want eighty percent renewables or a hundred percent renewables you have to build a vast amount of wind and solar and people are saying batteries vast amounts of of batteries\nSo this means you you've just added a huge expense to your electricity infrastructure or some of the studies say that uh in California for example they were going to triple\nA the cost of a wholesale electricity and that's gonna\nDouble or or or two and a half times or your total electricity on top so this hundred percent renewable energy sounds good uh practically it's going to be very very very expensive\nMuch talk for a moment Steve again about pollution how bad is the pollution out there\nActually it's a pretty good news story as I talk about on my book you know we talked about landfills landfills used to be a mess yes\nOr no they uh all modern landfills and in Europe and the U.S are lined with a with a a waterproof barrier to keep things from leaking out they're covered with dirt every day to keep a\nA rats another room and the other way um our air is very much a a cleaner since Nineteen eighty are six major air pollutants rolled down at a combined Seventy percent those are the ones I mentioned the carbon monoxide nitrogen oxide so for dioxide\nOr water is is a is not where it ought to be but the great lakes have been cleaned up many of the offshore areas have been cleaned up\nIn Europe at the Rhine River is making a comeback the Daniel rivers is may come back\nAs a matter of fact the interesting thing is people say well energy use as a big problem but it's funny the nations that use the most energy per person have the lowest levels of air and water pollution today and those levels are declining\nSo this idea that using energy causing ... causes pollution really is not accurate\nThe nations that are not able to put energy use effectively um can't use it to reduce their air and water pollution and so they're they're in a worst state\nSo it's really a good news story what we need to do is get get nations have become more wealthy and then they will start cleaning up there and start cleaning up their water and uh so it it really is a good news story a from a pollution point of view\nNot what's going on Steve because regardless what side of the fence you people are on with climate change why is it so bitter as opposed to dialogue and hey this is my opinion and I appreciate yours it's screaming matches\nIt is kind of remarkable I have a I've spoken at a couple of universities and done a couple of debates but I get turned down about ten times the one I'm going to be up at a grand Valley State Michigan on the twenty fifth of October in a little thing but it's fairly rare now that that a university will invite\nA climate skeptic to a climate discussion I'm so it has become very polarized then\nDo you get booted no I've never had a disruptive situation and you know I'm always very respectful and the theory is plausible of man made climate change and we do have a greenhouse effect but over the last Thirty years the data showing that the climate models are wrong they made some assumptions which are wrong so\nSo a natural factors dominate um and we need to go on reducing real pollutants but not not carbon dioxide\nWell see that's what's so important people really need to distinguish the difference between pollution and climate change brought on by cycles and the sun is heating up the solar system itself is warmer than it used to be\nAbsolutely there are the earth is dominated by long term cycles called them a lot of age cycles which are uh\nThe tilt of earth's axis changes over time the procession of earth's axis are are they orbit around the sun changes and these are like twenty thousand to a hundred thousand year cycles they cause the ice ages\nThen we have a medium term cycles every Fifteen hundred years or so that uh scientists believe the sun causes and those are they're they're fluctuating temperatures so we've had the medieval warm period a thousand years ago when I was very warm\nUm the little ice age in Europe uh about five hundred years ago when they were actually burning people at the stake they thought they were witches and they were causing the cold weather\nAnd our modern warming and then we have short term cycles as well El Nino is an example than the regular cycle every three to seven years cycles in the Pacific cycles of the in the Atlantic so the statement climate change is real is like saying water is wet\nLet's come back in a moment Steven open up the phone lines and what people participate with you\nSign up now for ... or ... ... email newsletter get it today at ... dot

back Steve Moore and ... what are the views worldwide about climate change\n[noise] well the uh the world leaders are pretty much signed up to this more than a hundred and Ninety world leaders of a a signed up to this ah the ah ah most of them signed the Kyoto Protocol in Nineteen Ninety seven\nAnd um it was I was at a conference at the University of Chicago today and they mentioned it all the

not living up to their\nTo their uh commitments it's very very tough when you need to uh\nTo impose a things on your nation and you and you uh uh I have to impose costs on renewable energy and also there's there was this big demand that the world set up to the United nations they wanted a hundred billion dollar annual\nClimate payment to go from the wealthy nations to the uh developing nations a hundred billion annually quite a big amount\nAnd a year and has that has completely collapsed a matter of fact the guy who was ahead of that just resigned this last summer and with the ... with uh the United states cutting its commitment ah they're nowhere near that they're down about four or five billion dollars a year\nWhich scandal among some of the scientists who were ... you know pro man made climate change with the emails and things like that\nYeah the east the climate gate it was called the University of East Anglia back in two thousand nine\nOr they don't know who ... somebody released thousands of emails either end in sight or or a hacker\nAnd these emails showed some very bad ah behavior or there were a uh guys that are or were saying I'm a don't tell anyone that the United kingdom has a freedom of information\nAct or there are people are racing emails uh there were people a trunk catering or data or there were people trying to you know interview or to influence the peer review process\nI'm just I'm just not a tough situation you know and and my thought is by interpretation is that that the scientists to these things and by the way this was a this was the primary mentioned before the climate research unit which is the primary keeper of the world's temperatures are\nThese folks I think we're we're trying to do whatever they could to try and save the planet to try and convince the world if you think the world is going down the wrong track of they were pulling any means to try and do that but they were they were following very very poor a scientific or

stone popping the cork the ball in Wyoming in Kentucky or is it very possible that the ban in both of those movies that very well happen\nYeah I don't know about the two thousand twelve is Yellowstone and that full Cain although I understand there's a big went under their young call during\nThe day after tomorrow is based on the idea that\nUm manmade warming would would stop the Gulf Stream basically slow down the Gulf Stream which is part of a the a\nA global uh uh overturning a circulation there's this huge ocean current ah which which carries a\nMillions of square miles of water of the gulfstream goes north goes up to Iceland and then it sinks into it flows down deep and then it goes down into the deep underneath that goes down to the south Atlantic the Indian in the Pacific the the theory basically\nWas that are warming would cause a cause of water to melt up there the ice caps to melt would stop the current and it would cause a U.S move us into the next the ice age\nUm I think most scientists now realize that that that is very unlikely we just don't have enough ice up there um to to affect the current so are there ... there was a fair though a number of years back that that was slowing down but after they looked at the data they found that the no the gulfstream wasn't slowing down it's really not happening\nIt was a good movie though [noise] yeah okay this whole thing right\nSo let's go next to John in Hawaii west of the Rockies John I'm not hearing much about the volcano these days what so what can you give us an update on that\nAll egg and they'll make it and\nStill doing its thing well okay go ahead John\n... but in order to uh to quiet down I just want to stay you we're we're talking\nAbout wind field ... when I when I was\nLiving in Oregon\nOkay and I used to drive by the wind they'll hack and I think he out in the meal that they had a big fat and it was up by twenty four what booth plane\nYou know they were were burning off about methane gas or where you\nNow why don't you put a generator on that and what do you know Christianity now come back and they had no no no it's going to cost too much I Can't have anything out now that can't be the only land they all in the United states we know that\nAnd they're all going to be burning off methane gas now I Wonder why they're banned anything done about that\nWell I think there are recapturing that are in some place as a matter of fact that's a big push in California they talk about they talk about that being renewable gas\nOr they also want to get methane from water treatment plants and even a dairy operations and and uh uh agriculture\nUm the problem is though it is really more expensive um gas from landfill is about twice as much as our natural gas regularly and it goes up from there um water treatment of three times as much I think there he gets up to about ten times as much\nSo they are capturing that and some in some places they're capturing the gas from landfills\nOr but it does tend to it does tend to add to the expense of things that's that's the only issue\nNext let's go to Michael in Virginia Beach I'm Michael\nHi are you arguing thank you for having the bomb you're into spoken to him several times are hurting on any shows and he has a breath of fresh air in inside and that accuracy or there is one point\nThat ah other guests on coast to coast have brought up in the past and I think we should warn are good\nSaid not to make the same mistake that he's a climate game hopes there's a are using a bag lady I Believe you said a one point three billion people on this planet live on two dollars a day is that correct\nYeah I think it's about it's I think it's actually about two billion dollars I'm Sorry two billion ... it's quite a few of those are those are United Nations numbers I mean I haven't gone out and counted them\nOkay well I was using the one point three billion a papal so two dollars a day comes to point six billion dollars a day or we would have just been nine hundred and forty nine billion dollars a year just to double\nTheir two dollars a day just four dollars a day and I'm going to come to the point that people like frosty will reject may end or\nA ... a a young child than a here's the point if you've already said that we're willing to do a hundred billion they're certainly not going to be willing to nine hundred and forty nine billion right and and so\nSo what prostheses told us is that's just sat in thinking that we can be your ah that by doubling people daily\nA dollar allowance or were somehow going to a massive really improve their lives they're doing All right with out as a boss will rich\nA lot of them are are counting illegally into this country because they had been tricked and

Europe Russia China we have forests growth are stable for us\nSo there are some good science the trends are good but yeah we're not going to go back to the days when most of the world was uninhabited we had all forests and we had all the vice and that just won't happen\nWhat's happening with rising sea levels\nSo sea levels have been rising for the last twenty thousand years you can go to\nTo NASA or their Web site in ... and see that data they've written a three hundred and Ninety feet a hundred and twenty meters since the last ice age no scientists can tell you when natural sea level rise stopped and man made sea level rise began\nUm right now the rice is about seven inches per century that's been going for the last couple of hundred years\nOr any politician who tells you he knows how to stop sea level rise to hold onto your wallet oh we need to adapt to rising oceans are we're not going to be able to stop that and that is a largely driven by natural factors\nThat obviously has happened in the past because there were discovering the ancient cities that are under water\n[noise] um there have been some well yeah there were a\nIf you look at a I think it's emphasis in Turkey or if you look at a a piece of both of those cities are about um uh there are some some um indications that the seas were higher at one point in time as well\nUm those are about five miles from the coast with historical accounts peace or used to be a big court or a big uh port\nOn in in the northwest Italy an excuse to be a port as well so there was some times when the oceans were higher\nBut again this is something we need to adapt to a we're not going to stop the sea level rise will matter what they what they think in California\nRoost in woodland hills California is with us I grew screwing up\nGeorge thank you for taking my call Hi Steve odd routes you know before I ah I Want to talk about the word climate change but before I get into I just kind of like a mentioned I perhaps to a lot of listeners that aren't aware is a global elites that run this country are masters\nKeeping us completely oblivious and dumped what's really going on\nThe word climate change the narrative we hear all the time the weather stations and news articles scientists that is not the proper word the word is abrupt climate collapse\nAnd we never hear about the word climate engineering these are programs now that have been in effect for over seven years and they've been ramped up over the last Twenty years and this is the aerosol injections\nThey're spraying God Knows how many millions of tons of aerosols anyone could just look up in the sky they no doubt this a lot of Temperance and what harp technology is and you know if anyone wants to prove this to themself I can tell you how to do it\nFirst of all any time you watch the news you are watching at Emanuel factor why you're not seeing the real no a weather satellite map that we used to the many years ago\nWe're seeing animated cartoon\nBut there is a fight a it's a YouTube one Pacific redwood that this guy is obviously a former meteorologist he keeps anonymous his name but he is showing actual weather satellite map but here's the thing that's interesting\nYou can see storm front hurricanes tropical storm low pressure zone\nComing directly in the California and they're being blocked\nAnd it's being blocked by heart technology which our ground based atmosphere heaters anyone could look this up they're very powerful I Believe they can put out as much as three billion watts of power and can have the upper atmosphere to Fifteen hundred degrees they can steer hurricane they can start hurricanes\nThey can blast thunder head they can break up low pressure zone and this is what's happening this is not\nAn act of nature it's an act of the military industrial complex would have in our with our weather ... when I hear about it in the new\nLet's can Steve's reaction to the Bruce IQ\nBruce uh some I'd have to research I'm really not up on that I Know there's been some quotes eating attempts but to the rest of it it's not something I've run across um and there's been a lot of discussion about the climate engineering but to my knowledge there's not been anything done on a large scale that something I'd have to look look into it further\nLet's take one more caller may be too if we have some time in in Tulsa, Oklahoma he did go ahead [laughter]\nOh well let's go higher than men just said is exactly right I Want to these conservative it happens to believe\nThat the way to add on is being gay oh engineered the Kim trails or a proven fact even the discovery channel show now George should recently a gentleman on his show talking about Kim drill team put out a video called Franken's guy\nAnd the idea behind it was to create a canopy over the earth blotting out son well people are so much heck\nShoot word hick about the fact that they're doing this so they're going to back off of it now what they were telling us that they said that are going to back off the Kim trail we don't have the weather's going to get real radical now they have they have the ability to geo engineering this weather\nDown to earth science I mean it's it's to the point now you can go to Wall Street and bet\nOn the stock market on the weather if they want hurricanes that they want to intensify the hurricane through the aid of heart\nAnd now on top of that then you got the geoengineering of the soil and the crops which is destroying the honeybees are almost becoming extinct and if they go away you know that's pretty much gonna destroy everything now I Do agree with you about the nuclear power plant that was a\nFoolish idea that may never come up with man is not smart enough\nTo harness that power safely okay now I Do agree with that\nBut here's the thing with Trump I'm proud of him he got us out of that climate accord 'cause it's a sham men they want they were doing a stripping the wealth of industrial nations away\nDescribing it into the pockets of the global elite and meanwhile China fits all their with their sky completely online with pollution not paying a dime and do it either as Russia\nBut the United states of America was going to play the oh okay now I don't blame a Trump one bit I grew in fact I was proud of him for backing us out of that sham\nLonger he somebody had to

I've given you from this point forward in spite of knowing what we're going to discover after the fact\nSpeaking of books I got from you too volumes of books on amazing but I was afraid that you sent me you're originals\nWell here's what happened in Georgia in this kind of humor is um when you\nProduce that had contacted me uh I had an order in four foot they're actually made to order on Amazon\nAnd I had given all of the copies out I had and I had what I mean I I had it in order in fruit punch bowl [laughter]\nEither that or I have nothing to say George [laughter] so I said I could

personal theories are on that or to fold a number one in the physical realm\nThis is a creation this is a creature that out there uh how many of them all day or we don't know nobody knows\nBut based on the fact that they leave print from both hands and feet a according to some testimonies\nThey bleed having been shot a and they die as well getting into a little later on a which to me make them a living breathing entity like any other creature\nUh be the greater small on the planet or I have no doubt whatsoever in my heart any way that they do exist and that people have every walk of life are encountering them uh having said that\nUh we will get into a little story later that out of hand picked for the coast audience\nA and I have a couple of them are that do involve a UFO phenomena\nAnd my take on that is that there may be some mimicking going on here\nOf the natural okay the UFO suit soon I think I think is true I think one's almost like an imposter\nAnd one is the real deal\nHas anybody reportedly ever been hurt by one of these creatures [noise] physically hurt\nWell or not to my knowledge I don't have I have people that have been a scared out of their wits I have people that had been rushed by these things are but not attacked\nI'm you know things of this nature they um they seem to be creatures of habit\nOr I Will say this getting back to human or non human dimensional on non dimensional\nOr you hear again and again\nUh and it's not just me but many people are have heard from individuals that when they saw this thing basically was grinning at me\nA a like a demon

us\nAnd on this particular day he was standing there and the noise or the falls and on the opposite bank of the creek which was rewarded with toll kind of pointing spruce has inspired a pines\nHe sees something going up and down in the trees that he described as like a chimpanzee so he's watching this thing going up and down and think to themselves\nWhat on earth is a monkey or a chimpanzee doing up here\nNow he couldn't cost a river and when the thing came down on the tree it went into the the trees that surround again in other words there were like low gross ten Fifteen feet and then this big tall tree standing in the middle so when it was up in the high tree he could see it\nAnd went to climb down we couldn't see it so obviously you're out there this thing has your attention when he's watching this thing going up and down and at one point it comes up\nSits there and one position and staring at him so now he's looking at it it's looking at him\nAnd then it lowers down again well moments later he sees them less willing in the bushes on the other bank which kind of came down a hill\nAlongside the fool's and here is this little big foot sitting on the shoulder a daddy coming along the bank and going out of sight in front of him into the woods so you had one carrying the other one who knows\nIt's anybody's guess what this little critter was doing maybe it was like you know I I Know it sounds ridiculous but I think of it in human terms like when we used to go down to the monkey bars or something to play with your kid in the park you know\nAnd that is right now you mentioned earlier about a couple that moved on to their house to get away from big what happened\n[noise] well I've had a ... there's been a number of people that moved houses are a United\nSooner aren't and rural areas right\n... yeah for the most part are people who have backed up against a wilderness\nAreas or for instance when we talk about man this is a very interesting a story a involving no sighting but evidence like it's nobody's business uh these people and when you talk about me\nI don't know people really realize his main if the size of the rest of New England combined\nAnd you're Ninety percent of it is uninhabited so when you talk about wilderness it's not just the Pacific northwest British Columbia Canada here we have a lot of wilderness in Maine we have a lot of wilderness right here in New York state\nAnd so these people had moved from one house to another house in northern Maine\nOr the money was right the property was right the people that had lived there before them we're gardeners they will gardeners\nThis was like a match made in heaven well as it turns out over time they found they were accusing each other of losing the gardening tool the wife is saying the husband was to shovel with the rate was so finally the husband get the idea\nThat they're going to gather together with the tools they have to an inventory and then they were going to keep them all locked up with the exception of two small hand spades\nSo having accomplish that they realize they were missing some tools and they started they leaped to hand spades on what she called the ... the wife called the heat stroke table on the patio and they were using them for partying plants and\nNo sooner had they left them out there a couple of days went by and now these hand spades withdrawn they had actually called the police report depth on their property of you know tools and this and that\nNobody could understand who would come on their land and take tools and take two of them is ridiculous you're going to go to jail for taking a shovel you gonna run the place Rob the place well [laughter] sure bright TVs and things like that [laughter]\nSo they actually went out into the property in the woods\nThey found one of the shovel leaning under a tree and the wife spoke out nine feet off the ground one of these and with one hand garden trials with a rubber handle on it showed into the side of a tree\nNine feet up nine feet up\nSo they went back to doubt they got a I guess an iPhone something took pictures of it they brought a ladder out\nThe husband couldn't porch this thing it was buried under a tree several inches he couldn't budget\nSo they had recalled the police and told them the story about finding the shovel in the woods and showed the cop shovel in the ... everybody was baffled by you know the turn of events you\nAnyways the long and short of it was\nThe cop told them look if you have any other problems get back to us I'm not sure what happened here I'm going to pass it on to the detectives\nWell as I said the long and short of it was a couple of days later\nThey came outside and the guardian behind the house\nHad been trampled down there were huge footprint in the bed or tomatoes were taking the head of lettuce one mashed\nAnd whatever had done this which was obviously a big foot I stepped right over the fence not using the gate there was a gate on the garden and it just step right over the warrior went and had it's full of feed and then left\nThey recall the uh the police over to see what had happened that would have transpired\nAnd he actually told them that this was pretty much the best evidence he had ever seen a and that they had had reports periodically of people saying they show these big tall creatures coming in their property of walking now so it\nIsn't convincing yeah it's not like\nIt's not like these things on being seen\nIf they're not being talked about which is a very odd thing you know you don't you think

although I'll tell you something really interesting uh\nI had an account of was told to me by all things a Russian professor who was\nOut hiking with his landscaper that he had befriended because of this vast knowledge of things but time nickel and they form this unlikely friendship and turned that into a hiking partnership they had run across\nA couple of big for its\nMessing around with some trees are in the woods and they got close enough to them where they could hear them ... and the professor\nSaid that it sounded like\nA Siberian dialect that he was unfamiliar with no this is a Russian speaking immigrant\nSaying that what he was hearing sounded like some type of Russian that he was unfamiliar with so when you\nTalk about the the ... or the abominable snowman it's hard not to think of the land bridge that was once they're above the Bering Sea\nAnd did these things or or had these things go back and forth I have no idea but it was just really unusual\nTo hear this gentleman\nA speak about this on dialect that other people have said they've heard a voice as I had a couple that uh was canoeing in Minnesota and they talked on a pulled the canoe up on a piece of the lake where they thought to look clear and they could sit there and rest for a little while\nAnd they ran across some sasquatch and the trees structure in there or they will unseen by them they walk by through the trees they heard them ... and they said it sounded like when you stand at the counter in a Chinese restaurant and they're shouting orders back and forth to each other\nSo it's very very odd but as far as the ah the ah yesterday and the abominable below snowman I have no idea uh I have a Sanders since ... book the abominable a snowman come to life\nAnd uh you know that thing is like reading or an encyclopedia on the creature\nA and yet getting back to what I said earlier none of this stuff means anything to the majority of people around the globe that book is a hoax all of my stuff is a hoax all of the conversations about Bigfoot or a hoax\nThe film is a hoax all over the uh uh a durable ridges on the footprints taken everything's a hoax to them so you know we have to just keep doing what we do\nA in spite of uh what the majority of the people out there to think about it and that's one of the things I Love about coast you know uh uh we all tune in because we're hearing things that we can get in Oklahoma ... nobody's talking about what you're talking about\nYou and photos and big could encounters where's the time\nWell I've had a couple of them are one of them are called the dead falls incident but one night I'll share with you a ... was named the orb\nAnd it's really interesting uh these three scout leaders had four young boys that were all working on their uh Eagle Scout badge and they decided to take them or to this mountain in a mountainous area or in uh Pennsylvania\nTo do a weekend of survival training\nOr on the first day they were pretty much focusing on building huts lean twos and and different things like that and and the second day or the focus was on that of ah getting attention being saved so they were\nSpending their time in an open area spelling out the words help and SOS uh using branches and bows and then they were making Smokey fires using a green a green bows and that night they decided to go on a night hike\nTo see what it was like a navigating around in the dark and\nUh now during the day they had climbed up the side of the mountain to look down and\nSee what they had made to see what it looked like from a higher elevation\nAnd they had gone up into the same area or at night for the ICC but when they got up there it turns out that the one scout leader was it you will fall on Tuesday is which was very bizarre considering what you're about to hear he had a pair\nOf military grade night vision or by knock you lose your own monarch yellow or that he had brought along now when they get up into the trail one of the kid says hey what's that and they noticed in the distance\nOr light moving around in the woods\nNow of course the first instinct was it somebody with a flashlight or a you know a battery operated lantern but then they realized that this thing started to daughter around in a crazy fashion which immediately told all of them this is no human being and what it is we don't know so they started moving closer\nAs they got closer they got the night vision on it and they could see now that was in orbit around bluish white light moving around in the forest\nAnd now this really had their attention so they got even closer they were trying to get ever closer to it they didn't know how big it was because they didn't know how far away they were from it finally they got to a place where they believe they were about Seventy five yards away from it and when they put the night vision on it\nThey could see that it was about two feet wide bluish white or but it was about uh ten or twelve feet off the ground and it was a looming aiding the trees around it\nSo that their parents and to resent bright\nYeah I mean it it it it's a glowing orb of light show darting around in the forest and now it's stationary and what happens next is absolutely out of this world\nThe one scout is holding it and he says to the leader hey Mr so and so you better take a look at this thing it's still something really weird\nHe described a picture this George a two inch wide let's just say beach ball a two foot wide beach ball he describes a globe blood coming out of the size of this thing\nAs being like when you blow a bubble through want as a ... okay\nSo this thing is coming out of the side of this orb and making its way down to the ground [noise]\nAnd what blew their mind was the fact that what was coming out and go into the ground was like\nTwenty times for thirty times the volume of the orbit self and yet the war was on changed and this thing was attached to it now they
