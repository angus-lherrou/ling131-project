Bush started the conversation about putting men back on the moon to Ryan program the ... the crew exploration vehicle by two thousand eight\nKnow we're supposed to be a working towards going to the moon getting there by twenty fourteen normally no later than twenty Fifteen didn't happen\nWhy because in two thousand nine actually when the two thousand nine round two thousand nine rock Obama pulled the plug but\nUh it was because of a a a failed mission that we had to go to the moon with the LCROSS a rocket\nBull cratered and see if there was water which didn't make any sense because we already had surveyor and landers and an orbiters the mapped the moon Clementine actually mapped the moon in Nineteen Ninety four and a crime in China was able to deliver more than one point eight million digital images of the moon back to the ground\nAnd uh\nThere was the interest satellite they were ground tracking stations are ... they were had the ... a ground tracking satellite station was picking up on these images so everything is accessible to the general public via the Internet\nAnd one scientist reviewed the data from Clementine they already found the existence of ice within the moon's crater so why did they did as well you know it was a failure nonetheless the LCROSS mission was a failure\nBronco bottom upholds\nThe funding from uh this a constellation Orion a project which kept us from going to the moon and a nine billion dollars is cut from the program and a slow this down now here we are in twenty team\nWe've been told that the moon is the goal again what's really cool\nIs it today it was reported that Seventeen scientist often to report stating that searching for signs of life should be part of every future national NASA mission at the briefing was authored by National Academy of Sciences engineering and medicine it says it says in the briefing and said that uh\nIt's very important\nThat the new NASA missions include\nA studies at astrobiology studies of how life originated on earth and how it might have evolved elsewhere in the universe in every phase of all NASA missions destined for space from inception conceptualization they have to plan on trying to find a way to discover life in space\nAnd I think it's obvious the reason why they're saying is is because yes they have confidence that they found these techno signatures they found the grammatical waves are in fact Russian scientists to colliding starts thinking he was armada I played the tones of the stars coming out of the Senate south alarms all over the country so I won't be doing that again\nBut um\n[noise] and in fact this awful arms of shutdown radio station so if I had that air it was because of that ah but in recent years we and then the show's been discussing that\nThousands of exoplanets and biologists were actually uncovering new insights to the complexity and diversity of life on earth and and also a these discoveries would bolster and Louis closer to the chance to life could exist on other worlds and therefore\nAll space X ray exploration missions now should incorporate technology and find traces of alien arguments\nSo you know with the number of exoplanets they've discovered with all the ideas about life on other planets scientists recommending that NASA accelerate the development of technologies\nTo detect the microscopic organisms citing the current lack of a single flight ready instrument meaning there isn't anything ready now nothing that can fly on the space to take care of this problem nothing that can travel to distill rose and measured the composition of its elements minerals organic matter that sort of thing\nSo they report suggests that direct imaging systems to suppress star like should be used outside our solar system to improved detection a bio signatures from planet that might orbit those stars NASA also or is being told that they can plan for more missions appear under the surface of exoplanets however\nThe average to locate extraterrestrials either in our solar system are light years away is going to cost a lot of money and you need new advanced technology to do it well here's the deal\nNASA space launch system the S L F the new rocket they were putting together to go to the moon was supposed to be the the design to go to the moon and then the ... and then eventually go to Mars was a very powerful rocket\nApparently um it's running years behind a schedule is a lot of major cost overruns and it just got slammed by an internal audit\nTwelve point two billion dollars to develop this launch system or Wednesday the auditors came in public to report highlighting problems with the work of NASA and Boeing\nAnd the report five sixty four million dollars in extra fees they were given a NASA they slammed bowling for poor from a poor performance and question the long term sustainability\nOf the super rocket program and the report even calls into question the sustainability of an entire project meaning that even with all the bright ideas and designs and the idea that we can go out and find aliens now this rocket won't even make it off the launch pad for years won't even make it to the moon\nSo this whole newly manned moon project they were supposed to have going on but twenty twenty ... may not happen now so I don't think space forces going to happen either I mean so you know once again we have this movie first man\nA big old infomercial for NASA and they can't even get a rocket off the ground sure we can sit up satellites probes robots but a man to the moon with a new rocket yeah we can't do that\nDon't have any more I mean we're going to do it but we were gonna do it in twenty Fifteen but Barack Obama made that go away and it was just and we're still supposed to send them out of the moon by twenty twenty\nAnd that's not even be able to do that\nIran must companies rebuild the first private citizen to be sent around the moon but guess what [noise] bad and build a rocket for that yet either so the question is whether or not the first space tourist will ever get off the ground [noise]\nWe had the technology in sixty nine [noise] can't we just go back I mean some of the scientists I'm sure are still alive [noise]\nYou know ... ... this is kind of like the old joke remember that old moron joke and say hey you hear about the more on [noise]\nAh they didn't uh there wasn't that they couldn't find ice for his coke [noise]\nAh the reason why is the guy that invented it died [noise]\nIf it's the same thing I mean look you wear why can't we do this\nWhy can't it be done and doesn't this like once again raise your eyebrows sort of the possibility that we never went to the ... or even went to the moon ever [noise]\nIt just it frustrates me we got all kinds of stuff out there waiting for us we can get to it\nDon't have the technology or the money\nTo really fix every three thirty seven hundred will be back [noise]\nTelling your weight joy

I was\nBorn with the ability to see spirit I thought everybody could\nIt was shocking to me George when I when I was young in in elementary school and grade school\nI thought I saw spirits in the classroom some were standing over students and essentially trying to help them with their homework and help them with a school work in film or looking at me like how can you see me\nWhat are you doing I don't like this and these are the one I had to watch out for and they'd actually come and start walking toward has been in the classroom when I was very uncomfortable\nStay with us Jeffrey we're

your favorites for this week to\nThis week uh we got a really fun story up on the website or then the number to spot of the carousel it's about an eight year old girl in Sweden who was skipping Roxanne stones and an sticks across the lake and reached out to grab another stick\nAnd and pulled out at three foot long sort out of the out of the mud\nJeez yeah yeah yeah and you\nCan see it in the number to spot in the carousel as I said it's huge and and ... and it turns out uh they they called local museum they examined it and the sword is at least a thousand years old and it may predate the Viking a\nMarch gosh maybe it's one of the sorts from Arthur who knows huh\n[laughter] yeah so the joking that she's a she's the new queen of Sweden perhaps perhaps uh uh and\nAnd the other great story we got on the website I Know you're gonna like this one a lot uh I I think you're familiar I'm sure you are with the ... ferry\nBoat I loved that for them and it's one of my favorites and when I was a kid I thought that I was amazed by they look like little kind of ... but you're just not quite sure\nYeah yeah absolutely and amazingly ah I'm not sure how they passed down you know how it got passed down through the years 'cause either from the Nineteen tens but they went up for auction last week in England or two of them\nAnd amazingly these are these photos they thought they were going to go for about nine hundred and Thirteen hundred each they ended up going for ten times that amount while the one on the website that folks can see the number one law went for a jaw dropping twenty

stabbing I tell me nine ... every day on your favorite ... make a fifty dollar Omar beauty or frankly and you get a free make up the tree out and then I think I tell her mind so you can help to breast cancer research foundation and making an insect any sense\nWell how many do you think Jeffrey believe how many people believe that demons exists if you went out and pulled people\nNot I think would be Fifteen twenty percent would be my guest George but important thing to remember is that there are there and they certainly believe that we exist and so the the old game is is that\nThey don't want us to know that there was there they want us to think that this is our own feelings our own thoughts and some of it is\nAll of the violence author is not caused by demonic spirits and negative spirits are but certainly there are there to amplify and right now everybody's got a target on their back everybody\nHow did they possess how did they take over somebody's body\nWork on them for on people for a while you leave these things happen over a period of time people who are depressed people who move into a home a and there's a lot of negative emotional\nEnergy drugs or something I practice something called modern actresses and and that is that\nCame out of the idea when I started going into people's homes I I found out many years ago that\nHomes because people have lived in there they generate both positive and negative emotional energies which are unseen but we feel ... and the accumulated in the environment\nAnd demonic spirits actually feel stronger and become stronger and these kinds of environments and so do negative\nSpirits and so they uh uh attack people and homes we don't take care of our homes we\nClean them wash windows when you move into a new place the carpet paint everything but we don't clean the atmospheres and so essentially were living in other people's emotional energies\nAnd so to monitor spirit's just play on that\nAnd they come into the our environments and\nGenerate huge amounts of energy that is negative and the air thickens with emotional energy especially negative energy at thickens and so it's easier to transmit negative emotional energy hatred\nThose kinds of negative thoughts and emotional feelings when the air is sick with emotional energy and so I get calls all the time from people who you know say hey I just moved into this new home apartment whatever it doesn't feel right\nDon't know why but you know the kids are crying that dogs are barking in a certain area or we're just getting into more arguments why is this happening and so modern extra citizen deals with the idea of that first the negative emotional energy has to be removed by somebody like me\nFrom the atmosphere of the home that makes the spirit weaker than I deal with a negative spirit or that's the second thing that I Do that's modern exercises different from traditional actresses and in that I don't always go after the spirit first\nSometimes I cleared the atmosphere to make them weaker and then I attack the negative spirits\nAnd you're not you're not ... you're not a priest in Santa Fe which you do\nI Would not say that I'm not a priest I Would say that I'm an independent police say Sean freeze exorcist I don't belong to any particular religion because I work with people from all different religions or no religious\nThat all people calling me who are agnostic atheist everybody calls me and that's the thing you know you don't have to belong to a particular church to call me and a half of your home cleared\nAnd these days I Do it by distance as well because when I was going through homes and doing strictly in person and work for the Internet ever came about\nUm I wasn't touching anything anyways personal ... I wasn't touching anybody anyway is really it's not necessary there's no such thing as as a\nDistant on a non physical level doesn't matter as long as you have focused each one of us is a complete individual and so anybody can be\nCleared from anywhere you know how to do it and it it it has to be done you know we we move into apartments like I said and there's lots of emotional energy from maybe people living there\nFor Twenty years forty years a hundred years ending on where people are from around the world it builds up it accumulates and spirits need to be\nDealt with you know times are already in the home sometimes they come into the home they then family that's having a problem because of emotional energy in our living environment and they're ripe for attack\nAnd so it's it's best to call maybe a professional but have it we're one and I then I teach people how to\nMaintain the clarity of their bodies are energy field\nOr and also how to maintain the clarity of their living environment's so it's kind of like having a carpet cleaner come in first and then you can simply queen her own carpet once that's done\nSo it really is something we all can do to a certain extent in something I think we all should do I'm not going to be around forever and certainly there are great exercises every religion\nNot the only one that are qualified actresses and just about every religion but they but they don't work for people and other religions\nI get that all the time you know that people call up and say well I I called you know a local parish even though I'm not you know I don't belong that religion I'm not Catholic and they won't come over and help me I help everybody so I that's why I don't belong in the religion but I remember doing this kind of work and has live\nUm I have deep contact with higher spirits\nAre also this universe is filled with fires and around those stars are planets and there are the universe as I said before on on one of my appearances universe is teeming with life you asked me that question you\nKnow do you go into these exercises with a crucifix at all\nNo you don't do that no but when I'm working a with Christians which haunt me all the time I'm even evangelical Christian have you know they need help to everybody\nKnew everybody needs help hold on Jeffrey we're at the ah we're coming up to the top of the hour we're going to come back we'll talk more Jeffries website ... dot com is book is called power protection will come back and take your calls as well perhaps you've had a demon exposed situation share that with us to\nNever missed a detailed numbers show or a gift sign up for the ... ... email newsletter available for free at coast to coast am dot com [noise]\nAnd [noise]\n\n\n\n\nFamily makes such a big difference\nEvery day your actions could help save a life learned how you can help and veterans crisis line dot net\nUse radio five six lane fields and you can see\nWhy in and do the wage why NFL ...

I Can't it's dream possible to describe it was not any kind of it sounded like some kind of evil law by\nAnd it was right above me and and the spirit was essentially you know head to head I was laying a night in the bed woke up in the spirit was was singing hello Patrick week and I could hear it loud and clear this horrific song slowly and I just I you know\n... shot up immediately got up out of my bed at ... kind of went right back into the wall immediately because I was going to attack right away first thing I knew what it was\nI did I have no idea how long and had been there a you know essentially putting some kind of\nIncantation are spelled immediately on me you know I wanted to change me from being very happy and sleeping very well to suddenly being very um self conscious than and frightened I actually felt really sick\nI sat up immediately went to the chair sat in my room and said I Am not going back to sleep in this house now I was not working at this time\nI was just you know sleeping after hard night of giving speeches and talking about all these things and I said I'm not going to sleep again in this mansion and actually went down into the basement which used to be a speak easy and sat down and they're\nNot out of fear I just wanted to get out of the room\nYou know you you just sell to lose an exorcist\nIs not safe I don't go into homes and uh in in to entertain people or just to give speeches if they're negative spirits in somebody's home or negative energy\nI get rid of it how do you know you've gotten rid of people say so I I go completely beyond the client I give a report on what I see and what I did and suggestions I have but I go completely on the clients\nWhen did they get back to Egypt for you I mean how many days after you were there do they call you back and say I think you got rid of this thing\nOh it's usually right away or you know sometimes you know a week or so later but on the calls come pretty quickly you know in times immediately you know it's like you know we feel better right away especially when I Do a personal clear I mean I Do these things by Skype I work with people all around the world I don't have to travel everywhere Skype telephone\nOr you know whatever\nAnd so people say hey I feel better right away because I work on a lot of individuals that just working negative environments and they need a clearing\nAnd and I teach people how to protect themselves and and so I Do a lot of this and so they feel better right away I get that right away and they called up and say hey our family is no longer fighting I feel better at work I'm Better able I go into business meetings and I'm no longer coming out feeling drain\nBecause I'm not getting hit with negative energy for my coworkers we all generate negative energy and we don't always know what it's subconscious and so people don't know they're getting hit they don't know they're sending out negative energy you don't know something like a demonic spirit is around them or a negative spirit\nSo you know people call me families call me and sometimes it takes a while and sometimes it's a media but I always get a caller and email thanks a lot Jeffrey really really helps you know very very seldom out of the thousands of clients that I've helped or the last\nAlmost three decades now have not said that you know it's it's not a matter of ego or bragging it's just what happens you know I'm very good at what I Do and I make sure that the client isn't the best shape possible so personal clearing might be forty five minutes I Do thirty five different things and forty five\nMinute already by different things some remarkable it's almost like a checklist\nEvery clearing has different George depending on what is going on with the client and may just be negative energy a nurse works in a hospital or psychiatric ward or around ... people that is coming in from the six month clearing they're calling me up you know buy Skype or something or is most common\nUh you know and I don't have to look at them for forty five minutes how I was I always work with my eyes closed unless I'm walking around really on the business or a house and so\nYou know or they feel better you know and and you know the fight stop\nBecause the idea of a negative spirit or even just negative emotional energy that's accumulated over a period of time in a home has no effect upon the family more arguments and they can turn violent this attracts negative spirit is attracts demonic spirits\nAnd so negative emotional energy attracts negative spirit demonic spirit is also happens in the workplace far more than people think\nAnd are these are the complaints that I get and so my job is to remove the negative emotional energy from a person's energy field both deep meaning that the from the very first day that were born we generate emotional energy\nAnd also things we pick up today yesterday last week as well and also the homes we move into apartments were lived in by maybe a hundred different people generating emotional energy schools\nPeople go to the school I went to this this is the same school both elementary and high school that my parents went to\nIts old very beautiful but I mean think of the moon she did her elated\nAnd so people will be calling uncomfortable they don't know why\nThe body picks up emotional energy regenerated you don't know how to release that I teach people how to do that you know and and so\nSometimes it's a teaching session and sometimes it's a clearing session it all depends I Do both and you know a clearing session a forty five minutes first standard adult you know maybe you know thirty minutes for a child and maybe Fifteen twenty minutes for pets\nNot so good looks like some costs just for you know ... more than people do\nNext stop let us go to the J in Minnesota Welcome to the program I DJ\nGood evening gentlemen I appreciate your time thank you thanks for calling um\nGeorge it's always a pleasure I've I've called

problems a depression anger issues unhappiness ah overconfidence\nAll sorts of things that are going on and so it does happen and and we have to watch out for that and and so a demonic spirits\nAre experts\nAt reaching across that dividing line and being able to reach into the physical realm\nAnd affect people when the wind is right usually meaning that there is emotional energy in the atmosphere or a person is feeling weak they're not protecting themselves properly\nAnd they can reach across and damage a person physically and they can cause even something like that usually what happens is it's not so much of an immediate that but actually\nWorking on them for a long time\nAnd they can cause physical injuries even happened to me one you know I I woke up\nOne morning I was getting dressed in my office my girlfriend was asleep at the time\nAnd I was getting up and ready to work out doing what I Do here and all of a sudden\nDemonic spirit appeared behind me I knew I could feel its power\nSuddenly a light shot out from it hit me right in the back and it caused me to have a centrally a pulled muscle I actually had to go you know get in my car and drive to the hospital and you know I haven't looked at in a you know get some light medication for it is it the\nDemonic spirit had pulled muscle so it can happen to me and I'm good at protecting myself so all the people out there who are not protecting themselves which is you know most of the population of our planet are very susceptible to attack\nAnd it can be a physical because demonic spirits study how to do these things the non physical universe heaven the other side whatever you want to call it which is a wonderful place but they also have dark realm was that are negative\nVery negative what we might call help and and especially that is very connected to the physical realm of the physical realm as something like the trust of the bread and heaven and the other side being inside the bread itself which is much larger\nLet's go next to Jim in Portland, Oregon while we have some time here Jim go ahead\n... on my question is is\nIt possible for one of these evil spirits quit being evil or you know a good trip pan sort of like I\nGo to the other side gets off drugs\nSo many psychics back in the Nineteen nineties asked me and said hey Jeffrey as long as you're doing extra citizens and teaching people how to protect themselves why don't you help the spirits and I said what I say now I Am not a spirit psychologist\nUh it's kind of like if somebody calls and your window and wants to see her steal your stereo or worse you don't sit them down on the couch and say look we need to talk about why you steal things it's not my job\nYou don't have time for the spirits out there that actually are very good at trying to help negative spirits demonic spirits are hopeless but the idea of negative spirit's just negative people who are dead and doing negative things and trying to get them to look at themselves and see what they're doing\nBut it's not my job and people who hire me I worked for them\nMy job is to get those things out of their home get negative energy out of their home out of their bodies energy fields\nI don't have time to do it and if they're not going to listen to me anyway\nThey're they don't have to there's going to go someplace else they're just not going to do that anymore the physical criminals going to sit there on the couch is that he or she is going to get up and walk out the door back out the window\nI I just don't have the time I have to immediately focus on getting rid of the emotional energy or in a person's energy field of the average person\nNot everybody's everybody's disaster or anything they just have negative energy issues and also getting if there is some kind of negative spirit attack but not necessarily living in the house they could just be going from house to house every night or apartment to apartment or condo condo or pub the pub whatever and getting them out of their fast\nAnd making it work sold the family or the individual is safe\nThis is my main concern not are dealing with a negative spirit's there are\nMillions and millions of spirits out there you don't just sit on clouds or walk the streets of gold actually do things in one of the things they do is work for higher spirits and help other spirits look at themselves and stop doing what they're doing if they don't there are other measures that we can take\nJeffrey are you glad you have this ability disability to see demons to maybe even get removed them\nGeorge I am I was born with it and at first it was really scary because when I reported it the teachers you know I'm seeing these spirits and you know I'm a mom so that could you know you know tell her when my grandmother my grandmother was going to call and you know two days and all this kinda stuff at first it was real scary\nBut actually I I started as I went along in my life I started and and I'm fifty nine now I started to remember doing these kinds of things and pass lies helping people\nThat to me is the greatest gift um I could ever be given is the ability to help people it's dangerous work\nBut the idea is is that once I teach people how to protect themselves they can go off and and not be so susceptible they can go to work and not come home so drained\nAnd I bet they really appreciate you while they love it you\nKnow and it it's just great to hear them say hey thanks Jeffrey but you know the real the real reward is them feeling better

he'll pass them on to us we'll get going with that too but let's go to the phones let's begin to going to keep in Virginia to get things started Hi Keith welcome good morning\nI George ... warning thank you sure and or on your topic I Can't believe that actually want to talk about a related to that kind of places in which people who do believe that they do believe that they saw that\nBut actually did not and perhaps for just why that can be um some possibilities okay um I I Want to talk about a an example of that including I'm\nA doctor Christine Blasey Ford and I'm Brett Kavanaugh who both appear\nTo be very certain infants fear in their claims they did a they did and in many people yeah many people felt like Dr Ford was very credible and she said she was a hundred percent certainty of a her accusations against him\nAnd uh I Want to mention um several years ago the late ... cold a magazine regarding Prozac I'm alarmed at the monster that I created\nShe joined the board of the international coalition for drug awareness which was founded by a coast to coast am guest and played Tracy\nWho wrote the book Prozac panacea or ... or I Am for Thirty years says research government approved scripts and mind altering drugs regarding your previous guest she actually says that ah another name for sorcery which you mentioned in the holy\nBible or pharmacology yeah I Believe in and she said that that actually among some of the bad effects of\nThese government approved prescription mind altering drugs including ss her eyes an average crafting or that they create actual portal scoring negative dark and he'd been demonic spirits but they also\nA interfere with people's ability to have a spiritual\nThing positive spiritual experiences including belief in God some people when they go on the drugs they stopped believing in God\nThere is a boy who uh is featured in a Youtube video and like Tracy that I Hope everybody could watch why it took them to school and in that he is uh\nBasically described is when he went on these medications um\nWas you know waking dream state and\nUh he he didn't know the difference between reality and um you know his delusions what he was doing and it almost ended up very tragically hit it going to jail for this this this boy\nLots of people do yeah but he he later you know got out because the people knew that there is really something wrong this\nThis boy didn't belong there they didn't believe that\nHe really was responsible for that and sure enough you know that it was linked to the medications that he'd\nHe'd been but they believed him but the people\nBelieved him yeah and and what I what I Want to talk about is what he believed that he was experiencing in this waking dream state which is common and Blake Tracey says about\nAll these cases and David which includes suicide and domestic violence workplace alive and she said only suitcases with the school shootings are involved for kids that were not on not on these drugs so you know and so the bottom line is what I'm suggesting is that it possible\nThat because some of the side effects are\nA delusion hallucinations and I am black Tracy has a false memories center article about a Roseanne Barr who accused her parents of\nMolesting her mhm and later and that was after she was on the medication is right and then later she she realized that that was not correct at all and she was really certain that it had happened but uh but but then you know she\nAnd she would only ask one off of that she would have passed the lie detector test because she believed it\nExactly and so this is what a I think it's important for people that know and and have as a documented thousands of cases over the thirty years of the things and what I'm saying you know in in my previous called I I didn't get to\nInclude all of this but I but basically I had a dream in which it was very vivid I had mentioned that you know I was told by somebody who had a twenty five days before that he would feed me and Thirteen months and I said how do you know and he said the holy ghost told me\n[laughter] and and I I you know I knew it was the dream and\nBut the I didn't I didn't know when I was dreaming that it was a dream and it wasn't a loose a tree but afterwards I woke up right after and so sure enough that there's only a dream but what I'm curious about is\nSomebody like Dr Ford in the area of psychology and whatnot I Would would not be surprised at all but\nShe has and consuming these drugs we don't we don't know that\nDon't know but but\nWhat I'm saying is that it could very well be that she instead of what this young man had with a with a well he can dream sure she hers was more like Roseanne Barr they can read on 'em\nYou're you're absolutely right but that's that's something that nobody asked either one of them\nIf they were on the mood altering drugs I don't believe everything I ... I've seen in the in that case that never came up but uh I'm sure that's a possibility or even though we don't know for sure what it probably happened key thank you for that when we got open line calls\nLet's go next to Jason in Bowling Green Kentucky west of the Rockies Hi Jason\nOn Joan okay where are you\nA ... um I had a a thing that I couldn't believe that I saw before I had a I had done a little stint in gale and I had gotten to read the Bible a little bit you know and uh and I was at a bone in my life where I didn't really know\nIf God was real or if the devil real all this you know and I started reading the Bible and then uh\nGoing back to the point when I was out of jail or whatever and uh I asked God and I was like well if you aren't real angel on everything Israel you know show me because I Would like to know I Would like Willie Mae so\nIt started at ... at first nothing really happened except until about a week later than what happened when I started seeing these little things like with people like a Beagle like these little spirits and stuff and I'm a well I I think this one guy had three of them\nRight ... it seemed like everybody and when he had Koreans he everything he did he touch with no I mean if everyone like in in you know what I'm saying in and then I think it's one kid he didn't have nine okay now these kids that you know no\nIt's a glass of water without knocking over something breaking it up and told me that\nHe was going to get an angel hair but he just didn't have one at that time and I'm leaving it was kind of be just to show me that you know how it works or whatever you know and then we'll go out go to church and uh I tell my uncle buddy\nTold me oh you don't want to go to church in planes to know and I'm so we'd go to church well why would they church I woke up and I started seeing real real big angels like\nIn the early on the church all over the place\nAll of them around it you know a new like there was a state of behind the ...
