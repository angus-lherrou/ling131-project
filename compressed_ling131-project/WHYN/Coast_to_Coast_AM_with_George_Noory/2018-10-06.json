you to funerals so that I could talk to the relative\nThat died and Italian [noise] ... everybody's related somehow and so you know I was Graham a special granddaughter they could come in and talk to the dead the only thing and I was never scary to me I mean the person was just standing there and yeah I could see his body and the gas it\nBut he was he was talking to me and I you know there was no question but would ask the question or the relative would ask the question what they want her to know and I did not have to repeat it because the goes target but they would just give me the answer and then I Would tell whoever asked the question\nThe thing that scared me George and all of this was\nI'm definitely old enough but that back in the day they had way ... and these\nYoung did they did

like a hospital or an airport or restaurant where there are ten Fifteen twenty goats waiting to cross over the county morgue um gosh there was all kinds and there\nAnd I just have to learn how to keep it open long enough and it was it was the last thing you had to learn how to do this and it was trial and error because I really couldn't ask anybody about it and it's crazy as the found our youngest daughter terror can do this\nAnd that she doesn't do it my way because she just that one of the the people in our eyes she just wants to hear them so everybody does it differently I think everybody has the ability it's how you develop it how you use it\nEvery time I've talked to you you've been upbeat about everything you do have you ever been scared to death with something that has happened\n[noise] I ... this past year been unusual and um I was afraid of one thing oh maybe twenty five thirty years ago that happened a goat actually flipped a red handled act\nIn front of my

you had no idea how loud that was when it yet\nAnd it was the three steps into the house from the attach courage and I remember sitting on the top sitting down and going\nMaryann what are you doing here and then it dawned on me knock it off because all I'm going to do is get them more energy I Can't walk into a house and be afraid\nBecause that's what they don't eat they don't sleep they need

and she says none of this would have been allowed in James they it's a mistake of some one of the cameraman said who is that and James meets mistake of saying some old time movie actor\nOh no oh yeah I mean you know better than that of\nCourse he did but I think he was just let's get this you know let's keep going I literally I I had to talk her into letting me make the white light and go into it\nAnd I she says I got to keep things going here and I said and how's that going for you is anybody listening to you and she just looked at me and I says and how many people have you talked to since

a couple of producers that had a ghost in their house and sell\nIt turned out that they knew who the ghost was which is actually sort of unusual because usually the person doesn't know they don't go

you know not so as to draw attention to myself it calms me down and I think it makes people feel better too\nI think so too I'm reading a book on Frank Sinatra and you talk about energy this guy\nEither way either ... direction I mean he was on or off when he was on a lot of people love to be around him when he was off\nA lot of people wanting to be away from ... who was amazing how that kind of energy works both ways positive negative next up we're going to rolling in Springfield, Ohio we used to the Rockies hey Ronan thanks for calling\nMorning our way today\nWe are fine thank you hope you are to\nA Yes sir I had a weird experience at a\nLocal like\nI'm not far from where I live probably within an hour has friends come over the\nPerson I work with and said hey ah or going up to the lake you want to go and not a well I just had a scan acts that my name was all swelled up and I dislocated\nIt I thought well no and he goes well you might as well get up and\nMove around on it all as otherwise it just goes up\nSo I have talked me into it I went and uh\nLike I said it was about an hour away and we got up that direction and\nHung out with people for a little while and uh they all want to go to a bar\nProbably I don't know it may be\nAnother thirty miles from where we were there and uh\nI was like well whatever you know I got to be late afternoon but time and the early evening and a wintertime\nAnd we got out there and I got this real strange feeling after I got into the bar\nOr they knew people there I didn't know anybody other than who I drive with and it was just weird it felt like every body in there that was in that far we're focused on me\nI didn't understand why at the\nTime you know and I thought well what the heck with about\nLike a bar full of empires or something yeah exactly and it's like well I mean I felt like a a lamb or at the slaughter bright and sign up on a rope or something\nYeah and and I I got real uncomfortable and I told him I said hey look I'm not very long ago I Need to go so they they agreed and and we left that place then they went to this other place that way out in the country\nAnd it was an old I mean this was an old dad gums heating bar yeah and I went in there with them\nAnd the play and that was a bunch of old\nPeople that there again I felt that are in the in the air and\nI told him I said hey look I'm all just go sit out in the car\nBut these these folks who brought you there they felt comfortable right\nOh well I've known him because I worked with him um and uh yeah there are to me it didn't you know I didn't feel any threat from them it was just in the places that I attended they know where they took me\nAnd I'm like I said it ended up being a night of heavy snow and it ended up being a level three is no warning which means that you're not even supposed to be out so we're out in the country after I go out back to the second bar I probably go out and sit in a car\nAnd they finally decided well come on let's go\nWell we go down the road a little bit and next thing you know a were off on the farm and the car won't move forward or backward or there was like six or seven I was in the car and uh they tried pushing couldn't get no no momentum\nSo they decided they were going to walk up to this house and see if I could get some help on the house was completely dark and you know I sat in a car I couldn't walk so I was I was I was stuck no matter what on there is no way I could run away do anything\nAnd I think that was you know part of what people were fencing when I was there you know in those places earlier in the evening\nAnd the more time went on time went on\nI've started getting nervous around these people and and so I just thought to myself and the only thing I could think to do was ah are farther art in heaven hallowed be thy name leaders are doing that under my in my mind over and over and over\nThe Lord's Prayer and it was weird because those guys are this one girl that was what this dude and I went up there with\nShe looked at me and I was an eye out during a word she says are you pray him and I the ... and she goes even better she knew what was going up\nI was like oh my goodness\nAbout ten minutes later here come the people at walk up to the south\nAnd says any luck you know the telephone nope instead and I was like wow that was weird so they get in the car started up and pull out with no problem like I didn't understand that we're in a car pulled out of the bomb while we were stuck\nNow at any point did they try to hurt you or anything\nNo no but you know I just kept I just kept that that bothers the lord and Jesus in my heart\nWhich we had these strange Myers about nothing\nIs going to be stronger than the the like it's in may\nWhat do you think that ... role in what do you think their game was what were they trying to do\nA lot I don't know maybe trying to um where they want to somebody and do\nUm where they're going to kill you I don't think so no I don't I don't think so but I think they may have been trying to\nUm when me over somehow or another\n'em like they wanted your soul\nYeah it was weird I I had talked to this only to my therapist one other time but I definitely felt an odd present\nI'm I'm very uh intuitive anyway mhm and uh it it just something that struck me as odd\nI Hope you didn't hang around with them any other time [noise]\nUh no actually you know the only run into one of them since then and uh they're still around but um [noise] wow it was where\nNow that are struggling to stay over there\nAnd I will never ever think it would be you\nWell that's the thing with my up the energy which is right now I surprised me Joe or I was in a state or depression that's actually where I hate\nTo say it but the added a
