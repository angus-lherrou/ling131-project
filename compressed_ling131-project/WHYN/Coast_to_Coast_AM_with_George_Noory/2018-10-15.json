talking about the inventories tell and the dream Stella right before the break and I want to get back to the dream Stella briefly before we started to move forward\nAnd in the dream still up a ... most of the forum says mentions and in illustrates too ... says there\nThe pay per that my new published last week is on his website we're going to be discussing this uh tonight on the show like on my news website over and coast to coast to I'm going to take his street there there are a list of papers on the right hand side\nThe current paper is the one that is on the town now with your uh analysis here minute it gets a little complicated a little technical\nBut the idea behind it is actually quite simple in an elegant which is is that some of the layers have a different thickness in stone and take us through bad\nYeah um when when you when you're standing in front of the pyramid and you look up the walls are you when you stand close you don't notice there's so much but when you go further away let's say you're in your hotel and you have a pyramid view\nYou start noticing that there is a strict texture to the pyramid and I'm a review or a who was it was very well known a jump on people who don't we were my paper or he calls the waves and I call it sort of a federal effect\nUm and so when you look at the details of that which was published by plane has petri a hundred and fifty years ago who actually measured each individual course as a function of total hide\nYou then you actually see the numbers and so there is these uh you know you you start with really thick courses and as you get to the top of the courses get dinner but every once in a while there is a jump\nSo you have a much thicker course and then the thickness tapers off and then it resumes the overall trend which is a thinning trend\nAnd then you have another sudden jump in sickness and just keeps on going and going\nFor twenty three times as far as I'm as far as I see there's plenty to eat pizza like that\nUm and ah and then before each one of these jobs petri noted that uh if you calculate the surface area of course and you divide that surface area by the surface area at the base\nSome of these leaks have rounds\nFraction of twenty fifth so you know one twenty fifth to twenty fifth ... so you found that there are round fractions of twenty fifth associated with some of these ... courses and that was it uh it was not for the interpreted what does it mean\nAh it was just noted but uh it just sat there until I took a look at it again\nNow how many layers total and ... and the forty two story Great Pyramid how many rows\nYeah two hundred three left and probably two hundred ten uh originally\nTwo hundred and ten originally is there and I have\nTo have to immediately say there are some researchers who said the pyramid was not completed there was a they say that was that was uh\nShort top so it was actually a lot at the top\nAnd the rest was a maybe a fear and you know one of the the most prominent researchers proposes is Robert ... by the ... and the paper it's on I think it's on a Robert Duvall a\nAcademia a page and it's also in cosmic womb uh his brother vote to upend the season the back of the book where he explains\nThis theory so there are some people that think the pyramid was not coming to a peek a and of course other people\nSay it was and so theoretically at least you can say two hundred and of course now we have\nIs there a consistency to the uh repeating of that Ficre layers\nUm\nIs it every ten steps is that every twelve is there some kind of ... you\nKnow I that's a great question I I that was the first thing also I was looking for it but\nUnfortunately unfortunately no it's not that easy it's it's kind of what you know to me it's kind of haphazard has to be honest with you I I'm I was just struck when I first saw that I was just struck why did they do this\nOr because you know you were you just you know simple minded I thought that\nThey were just a applied the uh the pyramid and go you know in Egyptian Egyptians designed their parents with something called they called ... which is the pyramid and go and it's a\nYou know when you walk up a staircase basically for each amount that you go up you go a certain amount forward and that's how they ... a pyramid and go so I thought you know each course\nIt should be the same amount like you're going up a staircase each step is the same and and it's not and and uh and all of a sudden you know the steps gets much thicker\nAnd chew question again there's low regularity even to the thickness so would you know it's it's completely off hazardous but of course now I think I Know the answer it has to do with the interior architecture it has to do with bases inside\nAnd we'll get to that uh after the break but what is most amazing to me about this is that with the different layers of which there are\nA couple of dozen veteran decker yeah that the orientation for the pyramid that it still ended up at the right angle on all four sides yeah a to complete the pyramid correctly without any errors\nWell that's an engineering feat that is just beyond comprehension\nWhich which to me I wanted to correct something I said in the shape to block interview I think I said that a bill ... to ... I'm sure a sharp tooth and effect we published that al ... was disappearing or during\nThe twenty seventh century so I I wanted to correct that it wasn't al ... in the paper\nIt was a star Iraq\nSo it was starting to disappear in the southern part of the country and because of that because that constellation\n... there was so important to chip shows that the authors propose that therefore they began to oriented oriented monuments to another part of the of the big the upper and we why the pyramid ended up in that in the north south uh orientation\nI gotta jump in right there the ... coast to coast and we got to take a break my new this ... church we'll be right back stay with us\n[noise] get\nDaily Show updates writes your inbox for free was a coup soon newsletter sign of today's ... dot com [noise]\n\n\n\n\n\nNothing to rape me apply when did it become OK for men to be lazier so Oscar fatter we need to bring them into this country back to greatness and it's easier than ever with age loose male Macs a patent pending formula with an agreement that helps boost your total testosterone\nPromoting greater increases and muscle size and twice the reduction of body fat percentage that exercise alone plus an amazing sixty four percent increase in nitric\nOxide we take a journey back to this week in sports history started way back in the Eighteen sixties where the first professional golf tournament is held a press with golf club in Scotland golf or by the name of really park\nWhen tournament this week in Nineteen oh to seven iron bowl is played for Auburn, Alabama twenty three to nothing in Birmingham today the Auburn, Alabama rivalry has had eighty two meetings in Alabama leads forty five thirty six\nWas one time this week in Nineteen sixty seven major league baseball's American League both still allow the athletic to move from Kansas City Glen and expand the lead to twelve teams in Nineteen Seventy\nYou wait for nations the entire archiving thirty for thirty dollars\nThe wisdom of rock on what's on these frequencies from noon to three today one W ... and ... radio news radio five sixty\nGreen fields whether she should\nWhich way in and nobody wage why NFL ...

and get the reference at my news website it is a chi ops pyramid dot com the links around coast to coast am and go to the right side scroll down there's a list of published papers right there we're talking about the top one\nNow my new I Want to jump ahead and let everybody know in that PDF\nIf they scroll down to page three twenty six you strike three hundred ...\nA a scrawled on page three twenty six where you have an illustration there\nOf the layers and with a kind of way showing the grand gallery and of course the kings chamber and the queens chamber the descending passage way and the ascending passage way up to the grand gallery and so working from the bottom the first layer up\nA which we're talking about a road number eight Seventeen Twenty one and of course thirty for these must have been for you and I want you to take the audience through this\nBut these are game changing moments when you see these on line ... layers weren't they\nThat was a game changing moment you're right I'm I'm I'm this thing all the peaks you know the total number of peaks was twenty three some of these people are were specifically noted by peach tree\nTo have surfaced a ratios that were around ... a number of fractions of twenty fifth so you know six twenty five twenty fifth\nAnd I'm a and those are also this that and it turns out that those courses that are associated with these round fractions tend to run\nA over feelings in a in that of course we don't have a lot of feelings but the few that we have it seems to be a correlation and thirty four is the most striking one it goes right across the queen\nA chamber and based on this ... this observation that there is seems to be a correlation between round fraction twenty or you know courses that have a surface area that has a round number fraction of twenty fifth\nI Am proposing that the top part of the pyramid where we don't know of any spaces and were but where we nevertheless also see these type of round fractions of twenty fifth that there must be space is just the same up there and I'm saying at least six if not then\nNow we're going to get to that ... ... exactly that's on page three twenty eight yeah but staying on page three twenty six with this kind of way yes you need to have if you are going to propose these extra chambers above the kings chamber where there\nIs supposed to be nothing right but then you have to have some basis for this and clearly\nWe have a I I'm just looking here one two three four five six seven eight absolute definitive uh marks on these roads starting with the descending passage way all the way up to the top of the king's chamber\nRight so for example of course not a Twenty one which is a ... which has a surface\nArea that is around fraction of twenty fifth of Nineteen twenty fifth that alliance with the uh the uh you know the ... ones that are that guard the entry of to the great pyramid show right that that cost on the Twenty one is right under the V.\nOr so it is in other words if a soldier where they're feeling than the than the one that we just talked about is a course on the twenty four also has a round fraction of twenty fifth sixteen in this case and it runs right over the feeling of the queen chamber\nOr then the other courses don't don't have round fracture the twenty fifth and they're not associated with feeling so it works out very nicely\nAnd then we go to the top and then we have eight a we have eight twenty fifth\nAh and that goes across the ceiling of the um off the granted power\nUm now there are ... there are two courses nine twenty fifth and twenty fifth and those ... line up with a with a two of the relieving chambers in fact the tower\nUm and and then the final point I wanted to make is that the possible avoid which I marked in here um that was found last year is also aligning with eight twenty fifth so it's possible that that causes marking not just that granted power but maybe also the possible avoid if it's for real\nWhich we are talking about a rose sixty eight\nA that would be a that would be row eighty four\nNo role eighty four is at the top of the king's chamber am I reading this correctly I\nYeah you are it's not the top of the king chamber and that also happens to be a you know within the resolution of this and that they were publishing that also is approximately the top of the book the big boys\nI got it yes yes of\nCourse we don't know exactly but we just it's kind of have the image so I just kind of like you know paint it that into this illustrations just to give a raft guide\nI Want to jump back a really quick I don't want this to get away from me there was a tweet earlier that is a pretty important and this is from eddy\nYeah and and he says does ah does my new see any connection between a dynastic Egypt shouldn't use of the lion\nAnd the use of the lion and go back ... taffy and everybody's talking about go Beckley Tempe today and its relationship with ... and the great pyramid and and the other things throughout dynastic Egypt is there a connection\nYeah that's a fantastic question um and I am actually I'm I'm currently looking into that uh with Robert shock we are um we're trying and but I'm not ready to make a statement yet\nOkay but the the use of the lion see this is what I find fascinating when we go back on these dates\nAnd weak constantly land and ten thousand five hundred BC for a variety of reasons one of course\nUh what was going on with the stars we understand that but then we have all of the uh cataclysmic event the end of the ice age the construction of Beckley tabby\nThe erosion on this thing's all of these things and Leo Rising right all of these things happen at ten thousand five hundred BC\nYet which makes go ... not an accident no within references of course with the lines too as well extraordinary\nYeah no absolutely it's a fantastic question and I don't want to you know jump the gun because I Can't really speak with authority yet I'm so maybe the next show um maybe we'll have something more but it's a great question\nLet's go to a I'm going to get to the top half of the pyramid and we're going

Thomas Say Hi to my new\nJeremy thank you for taking my call Manu ... research you know my question the as we have ... and the paramount thanks have there been\nAny\nIntention to reconstruct the original pouring up key subplot to do and I know that sounds radical but for example the great pyramid is missing the capstone and it just seems to me that\nYou could bring in architects archaeologist perhaps what specialty sub\nRemote viewing\nInto it and tuition and actually reconstruct temples repair the temples have spent discussed\nYes and as as a great question I'm so there's two answers to that the first one is that uh the minister of antiquities is trying to harshly restore the monuments so you get a feel for what it may have looked\n'em but they don't want to cover it up all with you know modern construction they just want to give you a sort of an idea so they may may they may do affection and then they leave the rest on touched\nSo that's the first part of your question but there is something even more exciting going on and I have to reference a a Harvard or it's called digital visa and what they're doing and this is I Lived direction of Peter I'm a new alien um\nThey are basically recreating ... a a a ... in in the virtual world and I predict and a few years you'll be able to ah defend into a virtual world and it will be exactly like the way it looked or the the way we think it looked and you'd be able to go into all the chamber's\nLook at the inscriptions and it'll feel like you know a real thing and they're working on it\nNow with these additional chambers in the upper half of the great pyramid where did you come up with the number six or eight\nRight so because we have we have a sequence of ah courses that conform to this uh you know that the simple rules at the surface area is around fraction of twenty fifth and so and I am pretty convinced that they that the architect wouldn't just\nWaste I'm you know energy to create the sticker courses unless there is a purpose for it so for every single of course that has a round facts about twenty fifth\nI think there is a space associated with that\nMore and more phone call before the break let's go to go out west to Daniel in eureka California Daniel you're up next on coast\nHigh a I had a quick question about the uh selling he'll watch uh\nI've heard many times interviewed on coast to coast over the years and yes apparently he controlled and very closely guarded access to researchers in the public or\nOr to the pyramids and for research and just general public access and I had heard that after the um spring Arab Spring uprising or he resigned what is access like now with the new minister and our researchers are given better\nAccess for research in the general public and I'll take my answer on the air\nGreat question Daniel my new what's it like there now with that I saw you\nRegarding talked to have a lot so first of all I had a few email exchanges with him and he's been always very nice very courteous as the questions and so I've had good experiences with him I've never met in person than he probably doesn't know why I'm\nI'm regarding getting a permit so we are currently applying for a permit um for a small study Robert Robert shock and I are\nOn and I think I'm so I'm hearing mixed messages so on the one hand it's also like investigators are being invited to come\nOn and on the other hand I'm hearing is that the uh they've become more selective so you know it probably depends on the project they have certain areas where they won research to happen and other areas they feel like it's a it's been exhausted\nUm you know so it's really in their hands and there's nothing you can do about it other than you just try it and see what they do\nWell do you think that the the ... research would be ongoing like it is it ... yeah how was she was still the director there\n... I think he is actually involved a Jimmy he's on the he sits on the on the uh the board of directors that reviews the data so he is involved or at least not maybe not publicly but behind the scenes he's involved they asking for is at by a is input\nUm you know I think they're sort of a mixed bag you know there's the public's eye of us who you know comes on TV and gives announcements and then probably there's the\nThe scientists archeologists who loves what he does um you know it's difficult to kind of sort it all out but I think um you know they they have to strike a balance between protecting the monuments and allowing people to search them and\nI to be honest with you I understand it and you know some of the projects that ah you know you want to do you can't do them because they might destroy the monument so I'm\nWell you're being you're being shaped him political right now and I I understand that my new and I respect that\nYeah I mean there's the other part of this where we had been told for so long that there is nothing to discover there and that they have not moved from that stance and now it looks like it's going completely in the opposite direction that's why\nAre they gonna have to ... open right now are they going to have to back pedal\nYeah so it to the to the listener's question I think I forgot than was Daniel I think right yes\nUm yeah so I think what you you said two thousand eleven so I think that has something has changed or they're sort of a you know people are even each opposes that talked to some of some of the scholars they have the local scholars they feel like you know they have more of a voice that can you know\nA Fayette they can research and I think it's been I think it's been good for the country and I think it's\nGood let me jump in right there I knew I going to take a quick network break this is coast to coast am more minute when we come back stay with us\n[noise]\n\n\n\nHe\nOr loss of a loved one\nCan hit harder than expected\nTo contribute to the mix of\nReasons thoughts of suicide or\nThe risk of suicide is even from in countries\nLike white support from friends and family a big difference in every day you were actions could save a life\nIs behind this ... year old on top of their head or anywhere along in that area or maybe the bottom of the paw in the back\nSomewhere like that that has access to an insight chamber of this of the things that I'm holds or something very dear to humanity that we're uh\nWe're not being told 'em all the details of have you have you guys heard any anything like that\nWill ... you're in luck because many who's been researching some ... paper about it so I'm going to it now my new before we get to what's underneath the the ... on the left of parental love from palm\nUh there has been photographs of the top of the banks fried in the ground up or what appears to be a hat\nYour whole life and I have also read a lot of research about uh the right here uh an entrance behind the right ear that Jay is referencing year she was talking about uh the head of this being spurs and possible entrances\nYes so there is that there is a space or in inside the head of the things and it's been a basically locked up there's a there's a little hatch\nAnd I'm I'm I think Robert de ... was telling me about this I think ah you can\nThere's you can't stand in there it's maybe six foot deep I'm but I'm not sure it goes anywhere I from my understanding is it's basically a blind LBJ but um but you know maybe there's some maybe there is a a hatch hiding somewhere but I don't know about that\nUm I can tell you that the uh you know the roasted ... um they have a ... of course they have an extensive labyrinth charted under this beings are and this was published in the thirties by\nA a chronic a person that was chronicling the ... was the cushions\nAnd he has a chart that shows all of that but you know to my knowledge there is no physical proof of it um there is a a there's another blind pouch in the back of the things I'm One of them was caused by\nSolid proof of it but I think it's on the table\nLet's go to the international line Robin Vancouver Rob really quick before we hit the brake what do you have per minute\nAbsolute honor to speak to does really quickly a notion struck the when you talked about structured space a look or make a quick a couple of quick jumps and laundry\nLooking at the idea of a Greek scare the architect from all the tremendous ... super big John talking to parents were a farming old knowledge building big golf ... structures\nUh who's to say I mean we could do you know I guess people in the criminal the ah periods are solid\nBecause you know maybe just as you say it's structured spaces be a bill ...

conclusions are that by new is presenting in this paper my new we mentioned already six to eight and voids could there be more\nYeah so I I have to you know I've been I have to mention shop you know so he of course propose an internal ramp years ago um I think it was Eighteen years ago with Bob Brier they published a book\nAnd he proposed this is the the just the basis basically to get the stove up the pyramid and this can from last year didn't show it but I think the theory is that I think it's possible that the scandals that sensitive enough to detect those spaces\nAnd then of course I'm proposing that this that there are spaces that are not necessarily logistic I think that could be illogical and chop you're dealt with probably disagree with me\nOr you know you're you're the paper a but he still thinks it's possible that there were logistical spaces in it but you know be that others may so we agree there are probably space up there and um I just want to ask you a quick uh because the pyramid of course who it's it's\nIt's hot spaces inside research is in the sixties when I first year of it because they thought can how can it be that we have all these bases inside you know

features that we know about the great pyramid\nYou can find them in the ... in the dimensions of the ... of him you know and you know we don't have time to get into it today but the papers on my website Go check it out and tell me what you think but I think the answer the question is yes I think is the world's first example of an architect using his own to him as a blueprint for monuments\nAnd thank you for the call Joe and that paper is underneath the latest papers the second one listed over on my news website and one last question from Twitter before we had to the break this is from dino\nAnd do you notice is are there any other pyramids in central and South America that carried the same traits as Egypt genes\nTraits meaning\nThat's just what it says in the winter we don't know yeah um\nI I assume there would be a couple of things I Do know is referencing here one would be size in orientation or to true north and may be uh something astrological ah within the alignment\nWell let me let me put it this way so I think I you know I I watched a documentary or which is intriguing they're basically saying is that all these monuments are lining up a across the globe and I find that fascinating I and I don't know how to explain that\nIf that is true that would definitely suggest that master plan that you know people were coordinating this this this is building activity and of course that's what Graham Hancock\nOr has been writing about four years and uh so I I think it's possible yes but just specifically some of the trades I I Can't really comment because I don't know enough about it\nWe'll let me help you with this idea\nWhen we look at the the tops of the the the pyramid in Mexico in Mexico city and the mind structures\nThroughout Guatemala and Honduras 'em and believes at the tops of these pyramids there's always something there what about the top of the great pyramid is what do not not the top top but could there be a chamber\nOr something at the at the upper levels\nYeah well I think so I think that could be that that could be a space or that um\nConnects that connected to the summit er and of course the summit itself I'm you know like I said before John a drop off ... vow has proposed that the summit of the great pyramid was not at peak was basically\nA virtual top and a\nAnd it would have been a you know as fear and it's interesting that the diameter of that's here is a meter\nOr it's a very interesting a very interesting theory I and others have proposed similar things\nThere's even a hero cliff I think I'm a this was first mentioned by a stitch Jeannie in a night in the Nineteen Seventy one book by Peter Tompkins that there was this fear on top of the great pyramid so not a pyramid Ian by this year\nSo yes I I think I think those theories out there I but I don't know how you would otherwise prove it I'm\nNo you've got to anomalies in ... uh and and one is clearly defined edge row one Ninety six and do you do have a ratio there could there be a chamber at the very top\nI acting so\nHow big would it be way I'm looking at those upper rose or the dimensions of the pyramid at that high um how big could that chamber be\nI think a chamber like that would be maybe no more than five feet something like that five feet by age and height I'm saying right you know maybe maybe a five six courses or something like that\nUm and they would be it would be difficult to detect it may be on a on the ... and especially if you have a grand gallery in between which you know the last year ... was from the queen chamber\nSo I think in order to protect these spaces you'd have to put the place up in a in the uh in the or the chamber of that's off limits right now\nYeah and how would you how would you detect more than one chamber\nWill the new one scan show multiple chambers that were stacked up on top of each other\nYeah maybe not if they're stocked up maybe not but uh they might not be stacked up um they could be you know like the one for example I mentioned that\nUh Rudolph guns and bring a is suspecting that will be a chamber that's in the southern part of the pyramid maybe close to the face you know so they may not all be stocked up I'm a one way you could do a Jimmy is by putting the plates into that knowledge that we talked about you know the one that\nAh who Donnan buyer investigated it up on the south it's on the north east side\nYou know the north east corner right\nIn the north east corner it's a fairly sizable states you know I mean I I don't know how big the plates are but I Wonder if you could set up the place up there and then you might be able to\nWell actually the ... the different chambers that made it might be possible\nHow expensive is a ... perform these ... studies\nIt seemed like it wouldn't be that expensive because you're just placing the the wage throughout the pyramid and then of course running a computer system it's not like there was any efforts excavations or right right it's not that expensive\nYeah they I think they've already spent the main capitals already been basically a you know making the play\nAnd then you know that you have to pay the people to experiment I'm guessing multiple a million dollars I think maybe ten ten million or something like that to do this project I'm a and most of that money has maybe already been spent and now like you're saying you know and now it's just you know you're just to repeat studies\nUm but I think if you do any kind of invasive a project or in a project like this is spending several million dollars a which if we want to go back to the things and hope things that's a kind of money that will need for a project like\nThis is coast to coast am I supposed to be church it's been an all Egypt

our guest tonight my new safe side they published a paper that you can read all of his papers\nOver on his website Chiapas pyramids\nA dot com and the links to that are over at coast to coast am now my new before we get back to the calls I have talked to before and I mentioned this in my opening little rant here tonight on coast to coast which is an knees you we seem to have amnesia\nAnd it's all over the place but it's it's ... it's not represented any more plainly than what happened in Egypt after Cleopatra\nAnd we had that ah example of it but it was going on before a you know she was the last pharaoh in Egypt before she committed suicide\nThe amnesia had already set in and what we need to and you mentioned this uh last week on my other show fade to black\nWhich is this that Cleopatra\nIs nearer to us than she is to ancient Egypt there's three thousand years there there's only two thousand years I'm On this side\nOf of Cleopatra and that's an insane amount of time we don't really understand how old the Egypt is until you look at it in those terms right\nRight and then going back to go back to ... and the time when we think the original things was built then you double that entire time period one more time and more\nWhy is it that we we are so quickly to forget the past\nWell I think because it's a ... a crime and cook a Robert shock Robert Duvall\nAnd other office and you know have proposed that there was a catastrophe on earth and it wiped out the evidence of this uh these are earlier people and the only thing that survive or how about these monuments\nUm and so uh I think that's probably why we've forgotten I I always remember those great movie planet of the apes the original one with\n... uh you know when he lands on the planet that he thinks is another planet but it's actually earth\nAnd then you know at the end of the movie he finds out the hard way that that this earth has an easier and that you see the statue of liberty bird in the sand and I just had such a profound impact on me that movie\nUm and I think that's sort of maybe that's the story that we're living in in reality\nLet's let's head back to the phones it's or
