been any lights on our bathroom floor she walked in the window and looked up\nAnd to use her term is George tour utter shock and amazement\nShe saw a rectangular craft with eight rows of lights running down the eventual surface of it moving over or how slowly headed for a row of trees and within thirty seconds or a minute it just disappeared from her said\nYes she did hear a home and that raises the specter of a possible blame\nWe haven't checked on blimps yet but a very interesting report\nPosted to our website and her illustration of what she saw on the bottom of that craft is posted

couldn't see any wings couldn't see a tailor windows\nAnd he pulled it it was so intriguing they pulled his car off the roadway and stare and looked at it and it was at that point he realized that it was symmetrical it was tapered both in the front and back\nIt just strict off across his head into the northwestern sky and disappeared from from his site\nNext report was from the next day October

Foy\nLooking forward to this ... this tragedy that happened when you were three would you tell us again what happened\nWell first of all my mother took me from Melbourne, Australia where we live in West straight at to see her on the opera singer and the psychic medium of mean caliber\nAnd she looked in the tea leaves the old fashioned when she saw it might that she didn't tell us she went out room came back white face while she was right that when ... when my father had been transferred to the straight an army officer\nI got pneumonia and I died and how do the old my parents that I had died as pronounced clinically dead and then they look to get and they said oh you boy died and he came back so that that is one of the first experiences of my life involving the stuff that goes into the new book\nI must tell you George I don't remember anything much from what happened when I was out by buddy age three members rather hard living under the afterwards what happened afterwards when I was eight nine\nWas I died again pronounced dead again on the ... and the conditions and this is an appendectomy in an operating room and that time I remember what happened it sounds like the classic

I didn't know that goes straight maybe\nI'm drawn into another world and we're I'm deceived by very beautiful very very lovely people and they raised me is that right and I forget that I've got a buddy in hospital bed\nBack eventually opt to seeming to live a whole life of Ninety years old so and I'm shocked to find myself in the body as a kid and and now the hospital and from that George comes my lifelong understanding\nThere will be on the physical you know nine years old who do you talk about this she tried to talk it out that the medication\nYou're hallucinating or something\nThe first person who could explain to me what happened in any way that made sense was an aboriginal kid from the indigenous tradition is it oh yeah we do that we get really sick we got to live with the spirits and then we come back and sometimes we have the same\nAnd sometimes we're not so the gift of these experiences which rings my cold dissociation was an ability to travel beyond the buddy traveling consciousness without psychedelic club drugs quite easily and an understanding that there are well beyond the physical and they are the ...\nYou must have been an amazing little boy Robert\nWell I was on loan me a little boy you know I was sick I on my father's in the army and so we're moving all the time I'm Brett situation I'll tell you one of the things that kept me going is it amongst ... companions a phrase probably most of us remember of childhood was a big man and a lot of white hair and upping face\nCome and sit on my dad didn't say backup Robin you know you've got to make it through you'll survive I can promise you that you're learning now that you know go and they'll like you and one day all day you can't tell your dreams are easier right now people want to hear you\nThat invisible companion George was the older rubber younger than I Am now traveling across time to cheer up his younger self and help him come through one of the things I've learned is\nWe are time travel in our dreams and when we develop the odds of conscious or active treated me as I call it\nOne of the cool things we can do is we can actually go back to youngest self and be cheerleader and counselor to them in the right time and going the other way we can sometimes managed to talk to a wide itself who sees what life looks like a bit further down the road that we have gotten and can help us to get the right perspective\nAmazing now let's get into your latest work of course mysterious realities a dream travelers tales from the imagine all realm you call yourself a dream travel or what is that\nWell it means that one of the things going on in dreams is that we traveled beyond our old and read dimension of reality into other will we traveled a parallel worlds for example\nBut it will lead in parallel lives this isn't as weird as some science tells us in the many worlds hypothesis for you and I live in right now in one of many parallel worlds well how do we know about that in human terms while we might know it from our dreams in which we find ourselves for example\nIn consecutive episodes living a life a bit different from what we're living right now on may be radically different so that's part of what dream traveling mainstream traveling Olson means\nThat in our dreams in sleep creams and then in conscious elusive dreaming we made travel to places where the dead or alive and this might be the source of understanding that solar consciousness survived physical death isn't it pretty pretty important area\nUh so the idea of dream travel goes beyond the routine idea about dreams as little bubble up from the U.S no subconscious that's all that's going on a this was the ancient an indigenous on the standing as lived in my life and told and stories from that life\nBut in dreams we traveled to other places and we received visitations from people who've come cooling those people to come calling my employer include a loving family members around says to the spiritual guy some kind or another\nSo dream travel means we get out that we get beyond the body and the brain we get into that whole field of non local mind science tells us about to get in contact information field to get into the ability to access sources of information beyond the old ... and also part of this is that we are definitely time travel is\nAnybody who follows their dreams for wild and write them down will notice that they dream of events before they happen one function of time travel we see the possible future we can reduce the challenges and opportunities that lie ahead\nBut we also traveled into the ... from this my mother lives you've learned about connections with drama is playing out in the reality is now the time periods in the multi dimensional universe\nSo this is the key to the U.S and understanding of what the multi dimensional universe is all about this is the path of direct experience this path of dreamed travel\nAnd my stories in the book come absolutely and entirely from my experiences in these areas and the experiences of some other people who worked with me and they're giving me permission to use this story\nRobert if we did not dream of course we all do not everybody remembers him but if we did not dream what would we be lacking as human beings what would happen to us\nI think we'd be locking quite often a sense of purpose a sense of soul than the spirit because you know one of the things that dreams do is they connect us to keep a source of knowledge of wisdom actually beyond the old and remind this was one of the reasons why\nMost human ... human couches across history about dreams and dream of they believe the dreams put you in touch with a God or got us if you like\nBut you can talk to with nature with the ancestors with the big ... all the highest ... so we might be lacking that I'd say terribly relevant to our time is that we might be lacking conscience stickers dreams\nCan be the voice of conscience and dreams can be a ... a magic mirror that shows us our actions and attitudes from a bad time and more objective perspective than we can manage for our filled in indigenous\nPeople say if you lost your dream you've lost a vital part of your sold your dream sold in fact has gone missing and probably the scariest story in my book mysterious realities unquote dreamed takers and which takes a look at what it might begin to mean if you live in a society where people are divorced from their dreams have lost the sense of conscience\nHave lost the sense of a deep up ... percent of that by the gun to lose a sense of what it really means to be a human a fully alive human I think it's actually as important as that\nI was mentioning Robert that some people don't remember their dreams what makes them not remember\nWell first of all we haven't made it socially rewarding fun to share dreams I mean we don't have good ways of talking about dreams most of us when we were a member of something a bit in Paris how do we talk about this how do we tell us\nSo one of the things lacking in our society is a way that makes it fun and as I say socially rewarding to bring a dream to the table I invented the very simple false step prices to sharing a dream of a story that makes it fun you can get it done and minutes\nYou get some help ... feedback and you're guided tours action but there are other reasons\nWhy we're losing our dreams I mean bad habits of pots and that is out of the lead also to rush out to sleep by the alarm clock but the need to get the job of deal with the family\nWe think that we should lie in the U.S in bed and don't pay and it took eight dollars or whatever and they pay any attention to those in between twilight states of consciousness you'll between sleep in the wake\nThat's a good time to catch it means good time to back on the list of dreaming but many people don't realize that it just seemed to 'cause they're awake in the middle of the night yet ... set of losing that others\nSometimes we close off our dream because they're scared of what they might be telling us we don't want to know that we might get sick we don't want to know that our actions may not be okay we don't want to know the relationship is in trouble so he'd slam the door and say no more dreams tell sometimes this is very interesting\nYou know if I'm a mistake on the practical mystic George I think you know that I Want to take away is this that in power out everyday life and one of the thing I Know from my own life and both like what is the dreams show you the future in a way to do actionable I mean this is very important dreams show it\nOpportunity challenges lie ahead they hope is a big we don't yet know about\nBaking save your life they can save your job ... said marriage I couldn't be talking to you today\nIf I did not know the ... and show that I had that I have avoided death on the road tree dates with death fatal accidents\nBy coming back from dream forecasts but it's happening harvesting the information acting upon it so I didn't have that head on collision with the Eighteen wheeler coming down the hill to fall on the other side of a blind\nSpot for example so that's one direction but time travel time doesn't move into a new one direction and in fact to understand what our relationship with time is through dreaming we have to know that in dreaming we step out of the time altogether we step into a different place and in between place\nFrom which we can access time passed future or parallel so you may discover that in your dreams your getting really interesting experiences\nOf what's going on in all the time together in those parallel times we're leading a power life this become very interesting when you begin to look at give lessons you might have learned in a parallel life that you can apply and you present my how to avoid things went wrong and not at all the power alone I\nThink it's very interesting when you discover

I was in a graveyard this week and I look at him\nAnd I was in a grave yet I've never been to before never been in this place and just having a walk\nAnd I'm thinking about a girl I loved and could never have from Thirty years ago and I looked down on the name of a headstone is her name the full name and there's the dates this person died last summer and I can't believe it's her but I call\nShe's never beat in the air as far as I Know I make some calls I discovered she died last summer and something drew me to head start he says what do you think of that I said it's a great story the very great story I mean that introduced this whole thing about\nYou know the energy and the connection that might exist between the living in the dead and how someone who has died my coat and to sudden close to a certain place might even be an age of ... but\nAs I'm telling us it's also an example of how like attract like I like stories so even on a day when I'm staying at the airport I don't need a new story today I'm given what else to live as a story immediately just like that and in that these examples proliferate so\n... you know what it how it works is that the the attitude and the energy you are carrying again to have results\nYour attitude travels ahead of you in life shaping wanted waking for waiting fuel round the next corner which is a very good reason every tuning in light to pause and check your attitude check what is playing when you're in a soundtrack\nCheck what you're saying to you so Trump the negative mantras and self limiting beliefs\nAnd be open to something more positive coming into your life\nRobert is there anything physical about this I mean I Know we need the brain the dream but we're also tapping into I think the subconscious and it does its thing outside of the physical body but how important as physical body to all of this\nWell I think there's a good body is very important that the first of all I mean scientists telling us there is no barrier between mind and matter anywhere in the universe mind to match up into leave at every turn in every level in fact some scientists tell us about how to matter of reality as a dense of consciousness so\n... there's no hope of separating mind matter they're always play together\nBut when we think about the kinds of messages the kinds of discoveries that they're exploring we have to remember the party has its own messages discoveries there's the phenomena that used to be called pre sentiment which I experienced a lot and maybe you do to what it means in terms of the body is the body sometimes seemed to know\nThings that are going to happen if all of the mind of the brain can recognize\nWhat is going on the body reacts\nTo something ahead of time for example I go to the doctor for routine annual physical one time my blood pressure is much higher than usual even though it's controlled it's surprisingly high and there's no explanation for this until the nuts trying to get get some blood for a blood analysis hit but gosh are\nMy blood is they're going to have you lived in pants and after\nThat I'm completely common my blood pressure is normal and she and the doctor trying to understand what just happened I said well this is pretty sentiment it's what's called an Alice in wonderland the the white queen can but the white queen screams\nBefore she ... her finger so she doesn't have to scream when she actually picks a thing where I just did the same thing I had a reaction in my high blood pressure to it in the Ford took place\nAnd the doctor says my goodness that probably is a scientific proof of a sudden the phenomenon ... sentiment or anticipate symptoms he says but I couldn't possibly be reported people think I was looted you\nWell you know I said so I think the ... we know in our body also the thing we knew everything we know what the bleep we don't know that we know enough about the sudden medic response was we pick up things from a distance from other people and\nWe feel what they're feeling in our body as well so that's part of the story\nNow you teach active dreaming what exactly is that Robert\nActed dreaming is a way of getting active with dreams in the sense that you again to remember your dreams are going to share them the right way to you're going to take action that will empower your life and bring some healing energy and guide in July from your dreams I mean that's one aspect of it\nIt's also method of elusive dreaming you'd call it shut medical use of dreaming we ... my favorite way of talking on the loose and dream adventure\nIs to start out lose to the state lose what does that need it means that we use shut many drumming and the workshops\nAnd we might take a dream that we remember as a starting point we might decide okay the romance an adventure still in the stream let's go on with the dream let's get back inside the treatment have more we might decide okay it's time to brave up to a nightmare terror and stuff that stuff going on\nBy going back inside the dream and facing the scary based on its own ground it might mean I Want to talk to someone who turned up in my dream whether it's spreading marrow someone else\nSo that's an example of traumatic looser dreamy another example is that I encourage people to spend a lot\nMore time in that drift twilight state to eat and sleep and wake because that's where creative connections made where we are extremely psyche can intuitive and creative naturally so I encourage people to instead of complaining about being awake in the middle of the night\nRelax into that state make it a state of horizontal meditation if you like a ten to the images that ride the ball and see what he wants to make one of the themes that will come to you the cultural beliefs of dreaming and finally\nActive agreement with the method is all about treatment with your eyes wide open we ... how to look for the outlook beside the books in the world around you so this is also a program on a method of attending to the dream like symbol of everyday life\nRobert did the dreams ever mislead us trick us basically\nI don't think the dream and self misleading I think that I've been on the dream can often be misleading we might be in a rush to interpret it might have to interpret according to the wrong standards I think I don't think the dreams and the ...\nI mean we can pick up things in the night of the problems with a floating around that we don't watch around we can pick up some of the other entities from whether they're just a bit confused or militias\nThat that can be confusing or deceptive but I think that any image that belongs to us that it's truly our own\nCan be worked in the hope and healing it might not be great to begin with it might be horrible for you but some are obese but by learning to go back inside the dream and confront these two on the ground you might find the behind something that's scaring worrying and you and\nYour dream is the power power of understanding of power that might might give you a kind of spiritual ally or life guide a life coach if you're willing to work with the material I I think as I say that the dream is not the ... but
