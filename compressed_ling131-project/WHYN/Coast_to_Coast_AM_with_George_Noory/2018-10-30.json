the law school at Seventy thirty\nI mean think about really isn't that high\nOn that's a flood of flip from Twenty years ago right\nOh yeah I I said let's say you want you you wanna hassle of women there so you don't do it but what you have to take into consideration is is that women\nAre going to run things there's there's absolutely no question about that because they are going to be the most educated I mean the glass ceiling has been shattered for a long time but we're starting to see many many more women come into CEO positions and they're going to want us\nAll excellent and was

that they have is is much smaller in generation X. generation X essentially the parents of Gen Z\nIt ... what we're watching is is is a at a new crop of kids and and I tell folks I feel if it ... ... people say well these these ... that they complain about the new kids they complain about generation y they complain about the millennials they caught complain about the\nThing you know the kids don't want to work there they're entitled to it you know there's all kinds of things that are that I'm hearing about them and I said let's let them grow up\nAs soon as they have to feed themselves they're going to be fined or just going to be just like the hippies that everybody hated as as soon as they had to feed themselves and and and face reality I'm In my joke is they became Republicans so\n[laughter] you're gonna get blasted for that and\nI don't care listen it is what it is\nWhat led listed here here's how it works is zero to a hundred years old when you're a baby you want what you want when you want it you want it now you don't you want it for free you're a liberal and then once you're about ten years old and you have a some positions at the other kids don't deserve suddenly become a conservative\nSo what you have is you have conservatives at one end of the population and you have a a liberals at the other end of the population where we're gaining a liberal every eight seconds because they're coming of age to vote and we're losing their conservative every sixteen seconds because they're dying\nSo on all ... we're we're going to be a nation of liberals\nWhy can't people just care about people whether you're a liberal or conservative who cares why can't they just do the right thing\nYeah what he told me that makes me crazy you know this whole division that we have going on now in our country and it's horrible\nYeah it it troubles me it really does we maybe not it's not what we're supposed to do I mean when you have a I mean ... unless it I'm I'm I'm a I'm a Republican but when you have a president\nTakes on a porn star in public and they have a fight on Twitter give me a break\nThat's the problem yeah that's and that's part of the new technology again did anybody ever anticipate that\nDid you think a Jack Dorsey when he founded Twitter thought that it would be used for tools like that I don't think so\nNo that when when when you think of the mind that people in like the Eighteen hundreds there's more information in a in a single Wall Street journal than somebody would ever think about an individual would think about in the Eighteen hundreds so I I don't know if\nWhen you talk about the trends in change this is what we're losing Ken we're losing the ability to debate question discuss without people screaming at each other\nI mean those days are gone I mean I I heard a couple of people in a restaurant tonight I'm instead of just talking about something they're screaming at each other because they didn't get ... they didn't agree with each other and in I've never seen that this bad to have you\nKnow no I haven't and it it's called diplomacy and I wonder where it's way where it's gone I I I just simply don't know you know people\n... ... I I Can't tell you the number of people George that say to me I you know why don't we run our our government like a business and and so we you know where you want to have these huge deficits and we won't make all these mistakes\nIf you think about it I'd rather have a government that runs like the government a diplomatic government or a Republican it's based on a constitution\nNot one that's based on business principles we used to have that\nYeah we used to have that but now we have a government that's essentially run on business principles and it's it seems like there's there's no\nYou know we we've just taken all do we have removed the rules\nBut what we've taken away the the we've taken away the diplomacy that was necessary to be a diplomat and what will what's going on with China

years old which is like three years ago they they changed the policy let now they're letting their populace have as many kids his novel desperate put a how's it going to catch up\nNow you can't fix it because you you you you can't suddenly um you know people are born is babysit\nTheir newborn as adults do not buyers that's for sure no\nSo which which you have is is they're missing now and this is a

billion consumers\nAre and the the ... the starting in about twenty Fifteen twenty sixteen their labor force is starting to shrink it had been expanding for years and years\nSo what's gonna happen

as they go to war\nYeah they well they they they may not go to war because you know how many wars China has one and in China's history zero they've never won a war\nI don't know what's gonna happen there but but it's it's it's a it's essentially the same thing that's happening in South Korea and it's the same thing that's happening in Japan and that is a they don't have enough people to to feed

things started Hi Dana\nHi Hi George I hope you're well I Am well I Hope you are too high okay thank you thanks guys hey can I have\nI called because I have a phone compact with you I'm just here me out and then I'll listen to your response\nSo two things um that irritated me one was at a you mentioned the president having a Twitter war I'm Keith not up on that so all of those politicians that have worked\nIn the I Can't do that\nAs a human being or as a Christian but I'm saying this as a Christian and a woman I wanted to see two things you first of all I'm he called her a horse face she was trying to jump start her career uh um the\nOrange star because she had nowhere to go and needed cash path and that warrior here's what Italians referred to as an old fashioned Greece ball he thought he was actually going to that he would he would run and possibly when\nUm the presidential nomination for the Democrats um this was sold the words self serving isn't strong enough for ... both of those guys yet and all the yeah was temporarily side tracked I'm a booming economy or try to and bring down this man but\nMore importantly that man has kids especially a little one still at home not little one buddy young wide include and his wife and\nWe had a president and did something so by all it can even be talked about on on on radio in the oval office while I was aiming for him with my tax dollars and everybody said oh he has a right to a private life this guy did pass if he did that\nWas over a decade about so I don't have a problem with him saying whatever you want because you have to remember\nFrom his reactionary he doesn't bite you look at everything from his campaign going forward he has reactionary you pick on him he's going to come back at you that's human nature that second thing I disagree that is sad is that\nI'm ... now I'm not a senior in high school I'll buy it and it but I'm I'm not that old either\nWhen I was a senior in high school I said that this country is nothing more than a big business\nAnd it should be run like a business I have started to successful business is myself is that men and women don't have time for non Stein\nYou'd get a deal done we're not going to have a meeting to have a meeting to have a meeting and then to pick a committee and then that and that we don't have time for that they're spending our money and\nSo the fact that you're saying we need more diplomacy opponents the death when ward diplomacy doesn't have money we need a businessman I voted for him because he's a no nonsense that is that anyone that was bankrupt it four times and they had\nThe audacity to get back up on the war I that I I have\nIncredible admiration for people that are fighters in\nHis ... he doesn't care if people call him a racist\nBecause God Knows what time it's hard and other people know that ... ... it doesn't matter about this policy he knows well yes as I as a man on and uh and as a prize of that so I disagree with you on both of those I'm saying\nAll right let's get let's get his comments data in your comments are warranted obviously and you have a right to say these things would get anyone to jumping\n[noise] well ... ... regarding running the country as a business I think you need to run the country as a country [noise] the the single biggest enemy to any country in period is corruption and the business model does not protect us from corruption\nI think one of the things that when people say you run the country as a business let me give you an example I I think you know most businesses are bottom line oriented\nYou're not going to pay thirty thousand dollars for a screwdriver or toilet a fair market value or even try to get it for less when I think when people say let's let the country run as a business they're talking about things like that we're much not waste money as a nation\nYeah I Would I Would respect that I I Would I Would agree with that as well but it would also say that that our country is a republic with the constitution and the constitution works where we have the best country on earth we have the best system on earth\nAnd the thing that frightens me about it a bit of a government run like a business is that the business model cannot protect you against corruption but the but the um Republican Ken that that's that's my position on that\nRight and you want to comment on or do you want to comment on the president's tweeting\nYeah you know I I don't disagree with with uh the fact that this you know porn star in it and our attorney are are self serving they absolutely are self serving what I Wish our president would do is just not areas\nYou know this dirty laundry in public I just wish it wouldn't happen now\nBut let me let me ask you this devil's advocate in by the way I've commented on his tweeting too because I I think he needs to be a little more presidential he's got some great ideas I'm a a lot of great ideas I don't agree with everything he says\nBut I'd rather be a little more presidential will move more dignified when in back off the tweeting and stuff like that but\nIf he let them spot what they did without defending themselves then what happens to when\nI I think that with their punishment will be [laughter] what they've said and and um [noise]\nI I don't know I think what he has done his dignify but at the argument and I and I don't think there is one I really don't\nYou know remain in place and remain as as a major issue going forward because that was precipitated by a small labor force that essentially demanded a you know their their own way but what we have now is a huge huge biggest labor force than we've ever had\nIs a very young right now and just entering the process\nCan I Want to talk with you about

perspective it's an exciting time to be alive it really is I I'm I'm enjoying this I think the best days are ahead not behind us I think the United states is going to see an economy that it doesn't understand and that that's going to be a just launched\nBy generation y that this monster generation that's fourteen to thirty three years old that it's going to start households and by dish soap and and by vacuum cleaners and furniture and automobiles like\nThe old days yeah incidentally uh in in talking to the you know I talked to all sectors and talking to my automotive sectors are cars that drive themselves are not going to happen\nGood good day already killed some old lady in Arizona for crying out loud\nYeah well in the trucking trucking won't touch it\nWell no I support our truck drivers I don't want to see driverless trucks\nAnd I really don't have enough truck driver you know what that what we\nNow would you like to have a truck behind you would know drivers sitting in it\nOr not going to do it might you know we I have many you know what I mean he has little mini Cooper right\nI Am a mini Cooper GDP which is a high rise and I'm thinking to myself I the first time I pull up next to a a semi with no driver\n[laughter] I mean jeeze icy day could you imagine that truck barreling down behind you know and if there's one tactical full paw just one it's going to rearrange you and you're out of it in a mini Cooper ... year history\nThat's that's what the truckers are telling me that people in the trucking industry say first time a truck takes out a school bus it's over it it's just not going to happen you know we're we're we're dreaming\nAnd a lot of truck drivers helped unload whenever they're carrying you know I've seen I've seen trucks at night stopping off at the let's say like subway in there you know the truck is parked there in the truck driver guy is loading everything in the store\nI mean how how is he has a driverless trucks going to do that\nIt's not it it just not going to do it you know hey hey can I go back to China for just a minute yeah please okay one of the things that that\nA A R is troubling demographers about China right now is there are\nA from a forty years old and under there about Ninety million or um men are males or without that have no prospect of marrying because there's no female counterpart because of of either gender based abortion or is simply infanticide\nNinety million where are they they're in the military\nAnd the it's the there there is just a ton and and that that is what happens when you have an imbalance in your population\nSo that's another factor that China is dealing with\nDo you see another major war breaking oh\nNo I just I I I ... and ... yeah I just don't see any reason to do it well\nI'll tell you what what what I Do see is I think the future of the earth or is the Americans and that is a you know Canada United States Mexico central and South American or we're self sufficient we don't need a Middle Eastern energy anymore we don't need the oil\nWe we've got water yeah we've got water we've got fracking we're we're almost impossible to invade because we're surrounded by water it it just it I don't know\nI Am one of those always missiles into guinea [laughter] yeah yeah but I I don't know it just doesn't seem to be any reason for the for for that to to to take place even even with wackos like like Kim Jong hut on and on North Korea I don't see that happening\nAre and if in fact I say I what I see in in Korea is going to be a unification\nOf the north in the south [noise] do you know that the south is not having children\nThere for ... heard that oh you sound like about one to\nHere's my concern though not for my country but from some terrorist group than obtains new ... or something like that and they do it and trying to planted on another country\nThat could happen that concerns me\nYeah that that could happen but what concerns me is a demographer is if if you have a South Korea with you know what I'm saying is that even one child per couple you cannot maintain a market economy on a shrinking population you can't possible it has to grow\nSo I don't know what's going to happen here with the north and the south I really don't North Korea is about ... their their rights that are just above replacement level fertility\nMichael in Jamestown North Carolina hey Michael go ahead\nYes Hi uh George and higher against um Hi my question is that uh is the trend going to continue where people are moving out of the northeast into like down south and at West because Florida is now the third most populous state out raking New York state and also a Phoenix has become the largest city out raking I filled out here\nPeople are moving to the warmer weather Bruce Kenny\n... that that is exactly correct in in in my new book the book that came out last year called upside profiting from the profound demographic shifts the head we cover every single state if you go from Virginia all the way down to Florida\nTo go over to ... California Nevada uh uh [noise] Arizona and a New Mexico or the populations are going to increase the population of Florida is going to go from twenty million to thirty million while or to buy real estate in Florida now and just sit on it\nAnd said I was in the the uh uh an interesting concept is the fact that the the the senior citizens in Florida are now Seventy five two Ninety five I had a real estate journalist\nOr give me a bus and she said what is the baby\nBoomer influence on Florida real estate going to be going to ask what is it one more to\nBegin to you know ... and I told her I said listen it hasn't started\nAnd I went to us and it's going to be huge ... it's going to be off the charts with the same thing that's happening with healthcare elder care and death care what our Vegas is that a good market\nOff the charts huge can't believe it I it it for one uh it it's cheap there are plenty of job uh uh I go there all the time my brother has a house there\nUh yeah Vegas this is unbelievable\nShow ...

professor back in two thousand three at the University of Trump show in northern Norway Bruce founded the veterans' program at ... college and co founded the boots to books transition of course\nNow that's the first college course in the country designed specifically for recently returned veterans\nBruce first of all I Want to thank you for that and for sure be my friend I really appreciate that\nWell uh yeah thank you very much and uh yeah thank you for having me on on the program I I I Love this show\nI'm looking forward to this is just as you you got to tell me why me with the incredible background that you have in so many different things how did you get interested and involved in the paranormal\nWell it ... the paranormal has been happening to me my whole life it started at age four with my first paranormal experiences and Angelica experience\nA near death experience and just from that point on it just the the things have been happening randomly but quite frequently\nAnd uh I've always had it on the back burner I you know I've been doing all these other things and have a lot of different interests and it's always been on the back burner but it wasn't until recently that I decided to\nFinally put these all these experiences together into a book and a and then started talking openly you know not just with a couple of friends or Family Matters but to to students than actually I I teach a class now at the college I'm On the paranormal that's been a very popular just started this this semester\nA lot of people Bruce or a little hesitant to come out and talk about their paranormal experiences some of them you know pilots they don't want to talk about UFO experiences as there's been a problem for you since you've come out and talked about this\nAh it it hasn't I understand the the the nervousness it or the fear even that they would have it I was a I was afraid of that that maybe people wouldn't take my work seriously or or that I'd be ridiculed or the administration would find a way to maybe I I get an early retirement or something but\nI haven't found that to be to be true at all I I think what has happened is that people now see me as a safe person to share their experiences with and they often do so privately\nOr some of them actually I have two colleagues that are taking the paranormal class that I'm teaching a two two of my colleagues at at the college so I it's been a very positive experience I guess the most\nNegative thing I can think about there was a\nA a friend of mine her daughter's a graduate student in history and she told her mother that uh well I think he's just committed academic suicide [laughter] you know that was the perspective of a graduate student I can understand that you're just starting out in your doctoral program that something you probably don't want to tell your your graduate adviser\nYou know as as it's happening now Bruce and as you probably know the field of the paranormal and the activities and the studies it's really growing now isn't it\nI I I I Believe it is and it's and it's gaining acceptance and it's it's always had that in the scientific community up of which you know I I I have friends in the scientific community I'm not a I'm a social scientist you know historian\nOr but from what I gather there there's always been a tremendous interest in the scientific community but it but are reluctant to uh to do much with it in fact\nI think ah my friend dean raped and who is the chief scientist at ions good guy he uh yeah seven he said there's Seventeen thousand five hundred institutions of higher learning in the world and there's only fifty\nFive zero academics openly interested in studying site and some of those are skeptics\nSo that's a very small percentage fifty out of at Seventeen thousand five hundred uh schools uh in in in ... or colleges and universities and from what he told me there's only five or six paranormal courses being offered in the United states right now which is very surprising\nOne point Duke University had a department that she got to eat all of this under GB rind\nAnd now it's not there anymore but there are still the ... Institute thank God you to study some of these things\nYeah no I it's it but I I think there is an eye confirmed this with with dean because he's doing and and you know he's traveling around the world talking about his research in very actively engaged in this research and there seems to be a and I suggested to me seems to be like a paradigm shift\nGoing on of of gaining acceptance and I think people are are increasingly you know professional people are are are increasingly\nAre you supporting the research and and talking about their experiences more more openly\nWhile and I and I look at this program you know six hundred and twenty radio stations we're on we're podcasting were on the Internet are there other podcast he was out there dealing with the paranormal\nUh millions of listeners it's growing it's getting bigger and bigger and I think people Bruce are looking for answers that they can't find and other traditional places\nI I I think you're you're right and that's exactly what I've seen as people have come forward to you know colleagues and uh I've I've made a I'd make contacts\nWith our um our custodial staff or at at that work at the college at night and they have incredible stories that I've just that ah it's just as kind of blown me away and I never would have\nKnown and less somebody had said oh you should talk to a you know Mr D or whatever he's he works in this building at night and he's got some stories so it's like they're telling their friends who are then calling me and and saying hey I got something I Want to share with you so I think it's\nI I I think once\nMore people in positions of authority or or you know academics are professional people uh express their interest in and their support I think it's gonna it's going to spread a lot faster\nWith Bruce ... latest book is called timeless a paranormal personal history he relates thirty four issues and cases that he had and just incredible thing because in the beginning you say that it's not that you don't believe in ghosts they believe in ... to tell me about that\nYeah I I think that uh it it well in fact it's my my my uh spirit friends who I I I Do have contact with a they told me that experience is believing and believing is experience so this this initial experience I had at age four\nKind of open the floodgates for me and\nEven though I tried to every once in a while put it on the back burner\nOr because I didn't seem to have much control it just happened randomly these things\nAh it just kept coming back so they just kept coming back instead of a you know it it you know ... regardless of whether I wanted it to or not and then I just kind of accepted this is the ... this is the way my life is going to be and I just proceeded doing other things but it was always there in the background I think I was always destined to\nTo explore this at a certain point in my life and it and in the last couple of years that's that has been the the point which to do this\nFirst one did you have if you can remember your first paranormal experience how old were you\nYeah that I was very young I was four but I Would try and uh we had traveled to northern Norway or to an island two hundred miles above the Arctic Circle my parents are are from northern Norway from that island and we were staying with my grandmother for lived there about nine months so it was a winter time\nAnd I was playing outside and I remember very distinctly what was going on and I I was a I got very sick very suddenly I I just my body was getting stiff and achy Mike I couldn't move my head from side to side my neck was totally step I had this fever coming on\nAnd I went home and I got home to the old farmhouse we were staying my grandmother's home\nAnd uh she had this little bed in the in the kitchen and the old farmhouse kitchen because sometimes she would you know it should be baking for a long time and just wanted to take a little nap and it's too hard to go up the steep stairs to the upper part of the house so anyway I was lying down there and I just kept feeling worse and worse than my\nBy the relatives came over and they said oh this is what happened to your eldest brother and then the next day he died and somebody said oh and that's what happened to\nUncle ... then when he got polio you know they would just scaring the heck out of me and my and my parents and my grandmother and um so I just I drifted off to sleep or you know crying myself to sleep and I thought I was going to die and then in in the night uh I I I woke up and there was this\nReally bright light up in the in the ceiling and uh between the beams and this old farmhouse kitchen and uh it I felt like I it it was an angelic presence ... it was it was very bright it was very warm I felt like everything was going to be OK took away all my fear and uh\nAnd I went to sleep and I slept soundly and when I woke up I was completely fine\nAnd and my mother and my grandmother said it was it was a miracle and that it was the guardian angel that had had saved me\nSo that was the first experience and experience and I never questioned it I just said okay that's that's what happens and I think that's what open the floodgates and and and also my mother was very psychic too she wasn't a practicing psychic right to see 'em\nThere's always there seems to be somebody in the family who has this ability and it kind of passes down genetically doesn't it\nI I I Believe it does because her mother was also that way she was an herbalist she was a healer so and and and this is a very remote island at that point\nAnd and that that's what I felt like and I and then I thought this is probably this is an example of a fork in the road of time because then another dimension which\nWe might have had this horrible accident knows it it it potentially at least the potential forty five miles an hour oh at each other like that or you know that there could have been people killed and it's at least seriously injured and ah and we were unscathed and so or the other two cards thank God\nI'm so it so I I I\nThat is what I'm Talking about and I had other experiences that you know when I was younger I I at eight years old I had another uh experience where I I uh uh was playing around it was in ah I'm\nUp at deception pass I'm from Washington state and deception passed in the north end to with the island there is a to bridge fans that go from the mainland too\nWith the island the north end and there's a middle island called past silent and we always used to stop there when when we went camping and we we'd run around and it was beautiful you know you could overlook the narrow channels that that that separate the island from the mainland and\nI was running around and of course in those days early sixties there were no safety fences or guard rails to speak on for the\n... ... and\nI was running right towards the cliff and I remember running off the cliff\nAnd then everything was I was just like suspended in in in in in mid air was like everything stopped and once again I felt this\nThis light in the warm and the next thing I knew it was like everything it stopped and then all of a sudden boom like in fast motion I was back on the trail and my dad was grabbing my shoulders and was\nYelling at somebody's watching Uber's there's a there's some helpers up there for you I Want to

kinds of paranormal stores you had a a lifetime\nOf activity Bruce\nYeah I'm kind of I've I've kinda been a a a lightning rod for the paranormal that's how it someone described it and I agree with that description\nTell me about the open casket story\nYeah the open casket or\nThe title alone kind of makes you shiver\n[laughter] well I grew up in a in a I'm In a region American community and we had this this older man who passed\nAway and he was a good friend of the family and I he was a very very nice man and uh we were at his funeral was the first uh open casket funeral it I'd ever been to and I was sitting next to my mother I'm not sure exactly what my father was a he might have been there too but I don't I just remember my mother sitting next to me\nAnd as we were going through the service and you know I the widow was crying and you know that that all the emotion of it all of a sudden I heard this a very distinct voice a very heavy Norwegian accent and it was the man who had died that was in the casket and he was home to me and he said\nAh ah Bruce it's it's it's OK I'm OK there is nothing to be afraid of uh uh I'm okay and uh I I I I looked I kinda\nI looked around and looked at my mom and she you know and I didn't ask her if she heard it I just kind of looked at her and she kinda nodded at me so I'm not sure what that meant but ah I didn't actually ask her about it but and then he said it again there's nothing to be afraid of everything is going to be okay\nAnd he said it in that that typical you know Norwegian accent and uh but I was looking at him and of course he you know he was just in the casket and and dead but so I I definitely heard his voice and um it it it was\nKind of comforting in a way but very uh I'm not going to say frightening but very bizarre\nIt would be weird when it\nYeah it was weird I Can't say I was afraid but it was it was very enlightening knowing that okay he's I don't think he's lying I think he is okay wherever he is and I wasn't quite sure at that time\nI I I think I Know now but uh uh often times I've heard that um that people who have recently passed away do like to uh appear at their their funerals just to check everybody out\nSee what see who's there very curious I think I Would be curious to\nTell me about your paranormal class at the citrus college\nSure um well it's kind of paranormal ended up itself that the college let me do it but uh\nWell do you have to fight for it\nI didn't really have to fight that was that that was the thing now it's a it's a community education course so it's not like for college transfer credit but it is not for death at the college\nAnd I am a tenured professor there and and I think there are a little bit surprised that I I proposed it but this is part of my plan you know that started two years ago with the writing of this book\nSo I I've always wanted to do this and I I approached them and I said well they said well we've never done this before but we think it might be a pretty popular I said well I Hope so let's give it a shot and so I thought well maybe I'll get\nMaybe twenty people in there you know maybe if I'm lucky and that's about the standard size that most of these classes get\nBut ah as it turned out we have thirty five people and there was a waiting list\nI probably could have had a hundred people if we could have accommodated them in this classroom but thirty five is a pretty is a pretty good number including two of my colleagues and and these people are from all walks of life I mean just a cross section of of of Southern California\nOr younger people and and older people of different ethnicities and\nAnd uh and and and races and just it ... they all have one thing in common they\n... they've either had these experiences a lot of them or they're very curious about it but there are a couple that are a little skeptical including one of my colleagues he's no longer that skeptical I'll tell you that after six weeks in the or seven weeks in the course into the course\nUm and uh it it it's been a wonderful experience and really what it what it turns out to be is you know I I present different theories about different to you know types of paranormal phenomenon I relate my experiences they they read my book\nAnd we talk about that but the big part of it for them is having a safe place to share their stories and that's the biggest thing that I've seen that's that's what they like they like to come there and they like to share their stories and it's a safe in an environment where we all we don't judge anybody we just listen if they ask for any comments or\nYou know what are your perceptions about this we we relate to them and\nSo it it's been a ... it's been a very bonding experience wonderful bonding experience and uh actually tomorrow we're going to have our last class and we're having a farewell dinner at a haunted location here in a nearby a steak house which will be fine\nAh that's a hunted and I'm so that that that should be a lot of fun tomorrow night\nWednesday night we have our annual goes to post euro Bruce and it's amazing the amount of colds that come in of ghost stories I mean there is you know it's amazing give me your scientific explanation of what you think the ghost might be\nWell I'll I'll tell you the I've had two full operation experiences and I believe that those those full body operations are just echoes or a I think they're a reserve what they would call a residual hunting I suppose\nThey that they weren't interactive with me I couldn't communicate with them it's not like when I\nYou know communicate with with those that are um in the spirit world it's say the\n... at least the full body operations that I've seen the to where I could see the translucent ghost in front of me one one was in Austria and a very uh in the Alps was a beautiful location\nAnd the other was in uh in New London New Hampshire when I was on a a job interview there before I got the job here in Southern California and uh in both cases\nIt was it was shocking to say the least but uh\nIt uh it it it wasn't interactive I couldn't\nTalk to them and they well I was talking to them but they didn't talk back and they didn't seem to react to what I was saying I think their purpose was just they were tied to that location so that that's my impression it and my explanation for what's going on with that now it's different than when I\nAm visited by someone who's passed on and I I might see an image of them in my mind but not\nLike out in the in the open kind of a thing\nSo I think there there is a difference between an intelligent what they would call and intelligence spirit and a a kind of a residual or experience or residuals spirit\nPsycho ... the ability to manipulate mind over matter happened to you [laughter]\n[noise] I was the uh the unfortunate victim of well I don't want to say victim but it happened to me I was I was in Germany a lot of

rooms to rent up above it either for the night or for in our case we were a GIs so we were living there near the base\nAnd a one night I woke up and I I felt like somebody was pulling my legs off the bed it was it was very frightening I mean I felt like they were actually trying to pull me off to bed so I got up\nAnd there wasn't anybody in the room and uh I I tried I just kind of walked around a little bit I had to go get something you know some water or something and then all of a sudden I I went back into the bedroom and on the night stand there was everything was vibrating\nLike there was an earthquake but there was nothing else in the room that was moving it was just the stuff on the night stand there was my wife's ah my wife at the time or her hand mirror a clock and a few other little items that were on the night standard vibrating and some of them fell off and I put them back on their end\nTiffany Haddish teams up with ...
