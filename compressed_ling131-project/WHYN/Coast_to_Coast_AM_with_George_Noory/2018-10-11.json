parking Aziz MS Lou Gehrig's disease hunting is these are all kinds of the same diseases different parts of the brain are randomly or more severely deficient and things and you get different symptoms based on the different part of the brain is more severely affected\nAnd so what I like to do for people with essential tremors where there was diagnosed with Parkinson's disease or essential tremors

the author of several great books including the field and the intention experiment in a way it is the power of eight\nLynn is the editorial director of what doctors don't tell you and also the architect of the intention experiments and she has conduct\nMany Lynn won't come back to the program hey George it's great to be back\nYou two are you still doing intentioned experiments\nI Am I mean we just had two amazing ones last autumn and we just calculated the results a few months ago\nYou know I did an intention a bit when the several weeks ago a Hurricane Florence was heading toward the Carolinas uh the topic of the category four or five and we did a little much bring it down in a ... a tropical storm really fast\nOr something happens your work so they\nDefinitely does work I mean I worked with a group in Florida to keep that uh the last hurricane not this latest one away from Tampa Bay and it just skirted around it\nSo there's something going on and I mean now\nWe've run about six piece intentioned experiments trying to lower violence\nUm last September we ran a six day experiment\nTo lower violence in the most violent place in America which is believe it or not a U.S a neighborhood in St Louis Missouri um and we calculated the results Georgia and it was amazing um we looked at and I had a professor of statistics look at this from University of California\nAnd she saw that crime went up at St Louis has a whole property crime went up in St Louis as a whole property crime went up went up in fairground the neighborhood we we concentrated on the violent crime the thing we were focusing on went down by forty three percent from now before\nAnd it just completely bucked the trend from the time we did the intention so something's going on\nHere what do you think this is one of the people tapping into of course you touched on it a lot with the book the feel of what's out there\nWell what's out there we're in a collective consciousness and I liked I called it the field it's a quantum energy field\nAnd what seems to be the case is we can shift what's going on with our thoughts I mean you know the bottom line is our phone everything is energy and our thoughts are another kind of energy when there\nAre worked together collectively we have an amazing power that can change things and now you know I run thirty three of these experiments and we've done everything from trying to make seeds grow faster to purifying water\nHealing somebody of pie TST to lowering violence and you know of those thirty three twenty nine shown measurable positive significant effects designer\nTrend the odds\nWell yeah because you know there's no drug out there to be honest George that that has that kind of track record you know pharmaceutical drug has his good record is that in terms of studies so\nSo as I say what really seems to be the case his thoughts are things that affect other things and when you get a group of people doing thoughts together there is a collective field that seems to be created that has great power\nTo change things now maybe he'll thing\nThe experiments you been working on a blade are primarily piece intentioned experiments\n[noise] yeah we did that one we did that one in St Louis\nAnd then I tried something really amazing I had the chance to work in a studio in southern England that had where I Lived in the u._k. and we had nine different screens with the studio I can be beamed down to nine different locations so we had cameras and nine different locations\nAnd we had those cameras in eight Arab countries I was working with a guy who's like a deep pack of the middle east and also a very prominent Israeli\n... a documentary producer so we had eight and Arab countries you know Saudi Arabia Bahrain cetera on Kuwait and then the ninth one was in an audience of Israeli Jews\nSo these are guys who have been brought up to hate each other and I also beamed at this live over my YouTube channel to um my followers around the world\nSo we all did intention to lower violence in Jerusalem there was an area of the old city that was suffering a lot of violence and we chose it because it's you know is the seat of all the major religions and we thought everybody would come together\nAnd what was amazing is afterward I could call on the people in the different locations you know I'm just calling their screen and they could talk to everyone else\nAnd the Jews started saying to the Arabs we love you it's time to you know\n... and all of this and the Arabs were saying your God is my God and everybody was crying and everybody was sending love and it was amazing it made the papers all over the middle east it was historic\nAnd it was incredible to me to see what was going on with these peace experiments wasn't just the outcome it was the effect on the participants\nHow much does attitude play ... in the if you're a beach in positive will that generally work better than someone who goes into these experiments as a doubting Thomas\n[noise] well I thought so but no I mean and and when I looked at\nWhen we've done intention for individual for instance we didn't intention once for a kid called Luke who is Fifteen Years old who tried to commit suicide he threw himself off of forty foot structure after his he broke up with this for a serious girlfriend\nAnd he'd broken everything he had brain damage he had a you know he had nerve damage and so I got my my community to start sending intention to him\nFor three weeks while his stepfather with keeping notes and careful you know tracking what was happening when we were sending intention\nLoop got better in record time the doctors didn't even think of is going to live\nBut he got better he got out of the hospital a far quicker than anybody could have estimated but here's the funny thing of it you know he's Fifteen Years old and like most teenagers he thought his parents belief and the power of intention was pretty stupid\nSo it worked for him and he didn't believe a word of it\n... with these experiments how do you start conducting them how do you scientifically put it together\n[noise] I get a team of scientists George I now I work with a lot jar ah Gary Schwartz at the University of of Arizona's a noted psychologist and a Jessica us who is a very well known professors statistics and has been doing working consciousness research\nI worked with the late ... I worked with people from from Penn State university water expert um I worked with um people from uh uh I'm from Princeton University you know just really prestigious universities so we'll get an all kick around ideas with them and see what's measurable\nAnd then the team will talk about well how are we going to measure this and how to set it up and with some of them you know we do it in a laboratory like with Dr Schwartz we did some seat experiments where we had four sets the seeds\nAnd we sent intention to one set of seeds and then the scientists didn't know which ones who were sending intention to so we had you know real scientific type of experiment and they planted the seeds and carefully measured them so it's all done with the scientific protocol that they really helped me set up because they're the scientists\nAnd then I just invite my readers all over the globe and we've had people from a hundred and fifty countries participate\nOr I'm an audience if I'm speaking in front of a large group to to do the intention and I'll be made out of my uh Internet site or YouTube or on Web TV or radio you and I did one together\nAnd um and then we calculate that we wait a while and we calculate the results\nAnd the reason we wait a while is safe for the peace\nExperiments if you just do it a week after well could you know violence could go down but if you look at what's going on for a couple of years before and then look for about six months afterwards if you have bucked the trend then it starts to get pretty interesting\nNow loom the title of your newborn no power of each has to do with the number of people you put in the ... the test why ... why not three or four Fifteen\n[laughter] will the town of eight really came about when I tried to scale this down remember I was doing these big experiments I wanted to know what happens if we put people in groups of\nSo these are basically bring with signatures somebody who'd feeling a sense of the static one and when we compared these signatures when the earth scientists who work at the doctor said Stephanie Sullivan um we looked at\nOther things like the work of the University of Pennsylvania looking at the masters and and and Buddhist monk any static prayer they had an identical brainwaves signature\nBut the only difference was I had you know it takes years to become a Buddhist monk or a Supreme

wanted and was wanting to do a Web site and set up a business to help other people not feel bad about their birth marks\nAnd she's down through last two hundred dollars and she suddenly hears from Lloyd's of London ... she had been a former employee to say that she could get a special amount of money because she had been part of this again out of the blue so this happens so often that it it\nHas convinced me is not just luck is not just happenstance\nAnd you know universities are studying the power of what are they doing\nWill we did the um we did the brain study you know and then we found him as I say we compared it to things like meditation and we found that it's not the same old brain state during meditation still makes you feel like you're you\nThis one makes you feel like you're part of something much much bigger power vague you feel like you're part of you you kind of feel like you're part of the field that you're not this little lonely individual anymore you're part of something much bigger and granddaughter\nUm and again we've looked at it compared to other um mystical states and its\nIdentical to a Buddhist monk and ecstatic prayer\nBut now we're moving forward um life university the one who studied this the ... largest chiropractic university\nUm has their nearest scientists and we're planning a study with their biology department to looking at immune system workers so what changes in your immune system when you do this [noise]\nUm but one of the other big pieces of this I talked about it with ...\nWith the University of California Berkeley who did this big study of what goes on when you do something else rustic when you do something compassionate like our piece experiments\nAnd they found something incredible that goes on a with a thing called the Vegas nerve it's the longest nerve the body and it winds its way from your neck through all the major Oregon's\nAnd it has a big effect on um things like releasing oxytocin which is that hormone that gets released the feel good hormone when we're when we caring for babies\nAnd then the result of this activating is that it has a really positive effect on the immune system so when we do good or feel compassionate or ... something like that we um you know we we actually get healthier\nBut the other big piece of this which is why that Middle Eastern experiment\nCame about and the Arabs started you know sending love to the Israelis\nThey found that when you do something compassionate like be part of an intention experiment or power of a group [noise]\nUm that Vegas nerve also makes us more tolerant more tolerant of people not like us so that was a big piece for me George because I started thinking wow\nAmerica America is so polarized now what if we started doing intention experiments where we had Republicans and Democrats together would that\nWould be ... that would be an interesting for them\n[laughter] will you know we're doing one this at this Sunday on doing a pilot experiment like that in the Dallas County in Florida um we're going to do something about lowering violence\nBut we've got Republicans and Democrats as part of this experiment in the same room together to see what happens to them afterwards and we're planning to roll down in a big way next next spring\nUm we're we want people you know of the different political persuasion in the same room together to see what happens to them afterwards\nYou talked about a mirror of what is that\nWell the mirror of fact to me was the biggest piece of this George because\nYou know we weren't just seeing affects among the receivers of stuff and the receivers of the big intention experiments you know the outcome of the biggest change all that was amazing to me was what happened to the participants in these intention experiments\nSo when we started doing these these experiments I started surveying the people to find out you know what happened to them and we're able to get on the Web site and all that kind of stuff\nBut more amazingly I asked them how it was for them and I'll be getting answers back like this\nUm I felt like I was part of a higher network you know my body was shivering and I was you know shaking uncontrollably and crying I felt like I was in the tractor beam in Star Trek and remember these are people who are participating in their own\nHome in front of their own computer by themselves but yet they were feeling this extraordinary energy and the extraordinary emotion but more interestingly is after they participated in a piece experiment their lives became more peaceful\nThey were making up with relatives they were getting along better with their partners they were getting along better with their bosses in their co workers\nThey were and they were hugging strangers about half of them said I feel more love for everybody I come in contact with so that to me was the amazing thing about it the mirror effect\nAnd when we did healing experiments we had loads of healing when we had peace experiments we had loads of people finding their lives were more peaceful\nSo in a way that's probably the more the most powerful part of the intention experiment if not the outcome that's pretty interesting definitely but it's more the active participation and what happens to those people need changes their lives being part of it\nWhen we're gonna come back in the moment and take phone calls I've still got a few more questions for you as we talk about the power of aid but we'll take phone calls in just a second I'm close to ...\nSo stay um limbic ... with us the giants in the field

not a good calling card for a psychologist\nSo he had tried everything conventional an alternative to try to get over this depression and he couldn't and so being part of the group they intended for that and what they intended for was that he would find the source of these in these depression\nAnd soon after that he got a brain wave to go to a Chinese herbal is\nWho worked out that one of his
