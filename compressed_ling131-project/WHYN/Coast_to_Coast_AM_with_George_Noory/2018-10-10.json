his disclaimer before we get going go ahead Lauren\nRight that I did consult to Google several years ago so now what is Google Plus for him so hopeless\nIs is a Google of a social networking platform it it is the equivalent of Facebook or Twitter in the ...\nThat I've been using it since really became available ... years ago I'm going to be missed\nWhat it's going to be missed by millions of people you know there's this story that's been going on for ages though with a ghost town there's nobody out millions and millions of people use it very happy with it I've been very happy with it really in a way that they were sort of a victim of their own success because when they when they started Google Plus and throughout its entire run\nGoogle decided not to put an ad on it\nSo there was no ... there was no way to buy sponsored posts right these are both things that drives people crazy or his book so there was no separate income stream coming from it\nIn the meantime everybody got kind of look or by Facebook into thinking well you gotta have the ads you got to have the sponsored post you got to have these things that are manipulating your your time lines and everything\nAnd they got a massive number of people onto their platform now of course a lot of people to come to regret it given what's\nGoing on but sizes everything was social media scale is everything and Google just never really got that scale now this brief that occurred ... all the right at the top uh they currently found out about this for a month ago they should have publicly about that at that time\nApparently there is that they really didn't is they found that in a during a as I understand that during their own auditing their own security auditing and they didn't have any evidence that it had ever been exploited in other words it with a theoretical bought her ability but apparently nobody knew about it outside of school\nAnd the kinds of information that we're that we're a theoretically vulnerable where like name and email address no credit card numbers of financial information nothing like that while that stuff that people have with Facebook so they said well\nWhy stir things up when there's so much going on right now I mean that's my interpretation and they kind of sat on it and write and now of course it kind of makes it a convenient I won't say excuse but ... it convenient to kind of a rationale\nFor setting a demotion to fund the setting of Google Plus over a period of about a month but they they should've\nDisgusted publicly of the first place you know\nUm and uh it would've been a lot better all around if they had in the meantime all of us who have been using Google Plus all these years or try to find other places to go where experimenting with other things\nAnd I mentioned that there the Google commercial version of Google Plus which operates further Gees we the the the business systems where you pay about five bucks a month per per head using it that's going to continue so Google Plus we'll be continuing commercially\nUh and then we'll just have to see what happens competing with Facebook probably a ... and facebooks turf was probably not a good idea and the first place\nAt the time at ... at the end at the time well it seems like a logical thing to do you know you don't want to miss out but as we've seen the way Facebook did it to to

would science back us up\nTo my book in the scientific evidence suggesting that that idea is true and there are a number of phenomenon that suggest that there is a consciousness existing independently

nation that happens when someone about to die like a evolutionary mechanism that allows people to feel better before they're going to die\nI started looking at the research and realize that it's not that simple uh first of all what's described it in near death experiences is typically a very lucid enriched type of consciousness it's not one that you would expect when there's minimal or no brain function at all\nAnd even more than that we find instances in which people accurately report what happened during the time that their brain with either not very functional where it was completely off like in cardiac arrest\nIt's known as they ... out of body experience so the person out of his or her body when their bodies not functional and they're seeing things in the room they come back to

I Would say yes they were very surprised to hear that but I think as I told people about the evidence that I was referring to people perked up and we're interested in the fact that I was taking the time to research and write a book on this topic\nNow let's talk a little bit about some of the things you uncovered that you didn't really know about the foreign telepathy ... mission tell the ... cycle conditions you you of course learned a little bit about them but you learn more as you did more be research didn't you\nLandscape like a mountain or river\nWant something that wouldn't arouse the body\nWhat we find in the study is that there is a very subtle again highly statistically significant effect think Jeff thing that the body is responding in the direction of the picture eventually shown seconds before the picture show\nYears ago during the television days they would hire anchor people lose people are based on a system called the ... skin test and it was a series of electrical impulses\nThat they would ... audience members to and then they show videotapes of various anchor people and the the one that showed the most remarkable response\nOr from the audience because of the skin test they're the ones that got hired a they were looking for some kind of reaction from people\nAnd the person who just you know didn't register at all on the meter or with the people in the audience they never got hired I I don't know if they still use that or not but it was amazing technology back in the seventies\nOr that type of technology that is being used in pre sentiment experiments measuring skin response\nMuseum work no cycle Comey says is the ability to move objects with your brain what did you want to cover their\nRights again this is something that doesn't make any sense at all under the material is paradigm consciousness is considered to be at the phenomenon of the brain it comes out of the brain has no effect on the world what I found in my research is that that might not be true and\nI think the most compelling studies that have been controlled are once again that show very subtle effects\nAnd they were actually done a primarily at Princeton University which is interesting because I went to Princeton University and I had no idea of these studies were being run\nA Dr Robert Johnson who was the former dean of engineering a rocket scientist ran a lab for nearly Thirty years running these studies and he also looked at remote viewing but he also he looked at like ... which is this ability for the mind\nThat matter the classic study uses random number generators these machines that spit out\nThe heroes and once in a totally random fashion\nSo again if we look at probability overtime a random number generator will have fifty percent heroes and fifty percent one over time\nWhat the experiment does is asked people to put their mental attention to the machine to make it produce more ones and zeroes for example and the person doesn't even have to be in the same room\nSo they say hey I'm pleased put your mental attention to the machine and make it produce more ones and zeroes again what do we find is that there is a small but highly statistically significant effect where it seems as though the mind is is changing the what used to be random behavior of the machines\nRandom generators picked up some incredible response is during the tragedy of nine eleven in two thousand one they did not know what the time what was happening what was going to happen but they felt something was going on because these random generators more just went ballistic\nAnd and people do people have that ability or yeah\nThat's right George ... those to me or perhaps even more remarkable and this is part of the global consciousness project with which was an offshoot of the Princeton study where these machines the random number generators\nWere set up around the world that people weren't even necessarily aware that the machines were they're generating these numbers and what the experiment yours have done is looked at the behavior of the machines around the world\nAround an event that we know are produced heightened emotion and nine eleven is one example of what we know that people had heightened emotion and it happened at a constant ... basically at a time I had a single moment\nSo we can look at what was happening when everyone was focusing their attention or many people are focusing their attention on the events\nWhat do we find that there was a spike\nAt nine eleven but in the case of nine eleven which is even more fascinating to me is that the spike happened before the plane hit the towers before the event that before the event which suggests almost a global pre premonition that this was going to happen\nFor a yellow her you know that name of course and incredible ability or if you believe what he did for psycho Comey says she had the ability to bend spoons keys and everything else with his mind now there are some who say dollars trickery its magic\nBut the the if you believe that he had that ability he did some incredible things and a candidate be taught to cycle can ... be taught\nWell I've heard of a spoon bending party which sounds ridiculous but ah I've looked into it and it appears that people train themselves to be able to use\nTheir mind and ways to to affect matter beyond just a random number generator where it's actually bending metal for example\nAnd early ... is an example where many credible people have suggested that what he can do is real including um Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu who sat in two thousand Fifteen television interview that he saw\n... then and there are many people who have suggested that this is real I'm a side note on your a gal her very interesting I mentioned the CIA documents earlier\nThere's another document that I include in my book an end to upside down thinking that talks about Ehlers abilities but not in the context of spoons pending it's in the context of remote viewing abilities and what they say again this is a direct quote from a classified document\nWhere he was he was put under very I mean they were watching him closely what the documents that is as a result of ... success in this experimental period we consider that he has demonstrated his paranormal perceptual ability in convincing and unambiguous manner\nSo you know there has been a lot of debate about him but these documents suggest that studies were run and he was able to perform which I think should open up to the possibility that maybe he was able to do things using his mind that town totally crazy\nMark would you give out your website and we're\nPeople can get your book\nShorter my website is my name mark over and they

H. Y. N. [noise]\n\nWalking\nBack Margot over with us and we'll get to your calls as well this hour mark the near death experiences again and we were talking about whether the brain hallucinates shows that light that everybody seems to see going into the tunnel or whether something is really going on here\n... is a difficult call isn't it\nI'm Glad you brought this up your this is a really really important one because if if there is some truth in what\nPeople are experiencing beyond that Lisa nation perhaps it gives us into a window into a reality that we typically don't eat with our eyes\nBut I I think we should explore this one further my perspective on it after having looked at the evidence to me the most compelling pieces of evidence are the cardiac arrest studies known as ... cardiac arrest studies\nSo this is where people have are in cardiac arrest there is that the ... and the experimenter is talk to them soon after they're able to uh soon after they've had the experience rather than asking people to remember something that might have happened twenty or Thirty years ago\nThat either cardiologist for example Dr ... a ... from Stony Brook is another one the real scientists are looking at this and what they're finding is that some percentage of people who are in cardiac arrest\nHung back and describe this near death experience and why is that significant\nIn cardiac arrest severe physiological trauma in many cases the person is clinically dead we know that when the heart stopped after a certain amount of time there is no blood flow to the brain and the brain stopped functioning\nSo if there is minimal or no brain functioning we would not expect people to have these experiences that are so vivid to them and as I mentioned earlier sometimes what they report during the near death experience when they're out of their body in verified as being accurate later\nI'm One example in particular is from doctors and party up in a peer reviewed journal called resuscitation in two thousand fourteen one of the patient in particular had a very vivid out of body experience where he heard something in the room it was later found to be that the federal later\nAnd we know that that happened during the time he had no brain functioning because of the time were being stamp and we know when the defense for later went off and it made it very distinct it's down\nAnd yet this person came back and describe the sound in the room that happened when his brain was off\nWhere they've been cases as well where somebody is literally gone through this near death experience there floating above their body they see the nurse and the doctor and everybody in attendance\nTalking about the person you know well sorry we're losing enemies dying or whatever then they come the person comes back into his body Intel's the attending doctor exactly what he heard in boggles their mind\nAbsolutely it doesn't make sense according to this material is perspective that we need a functional brain in order to have conscious experience memories of but what I found is that there are very credible scientists that are looking at this for example the University of Virginia the division of perceptual study that the med school\nAnd looked at the very closely and Dr Bruce scraping his one person in particular\nWho is look at these phenomenon and is is finding that something is happening when the brain is not functional and people are able to report things like what you described where they couldn't have known about things through normal means and it seems as though their brain was off and they said something that was accurate which is not by definition if not who's the nation\nMark ... six hundred and twenty terrestrial radio stations as we speak and they're all sending out signals in the cities and markets that they are in you can't see those radio signals\nBut they're out there is that a little bit what what this is like consciousness were sending out signals that you can't really see what they're out there\nThat such an important point I think we tend to be biased by what are ordinary\nA perceptual systems can tell us particularly our eyes and ears but we know it's not even controversial to say that our eyes fill a small sliver of the electromagnetic spectrum and what we're dealing with here may be something totally separate from the M spectrum but we know that our eyes only show us a very small sliver of reality\nSo I Do think that maybe there are things beyond what our normal ordinary perceptual systems can show us at our existing but we just don't perceive them\nAll right let's take some calls here for you as they begin to line up and I've still got a whole slew of questions for you mark and by the way for a non scientist you're doing an incredible job on this topic you've learned a lot damage you\n[laughter] I have and I hope to summarize it in a way that a general audience and absorb it\nLet's go to bill from West Hartford Connecticut Connecticut bill by the way is an amateur astronomer and an atheist hey bill\nHi George Hi Hi Mark yes I Am a rational ... than a materialist\nHowever I Do think that there is something to near death experiences I Do think ah\nThere is this phenomena going I just think regarding and the ... ah where where the mind I Would use the word mind not sold but mine are conscious just goes uh or or exist temporarily during the ... is not heaven or hell in a religious sense just like there is no God or no devil\nI Would call it an energy dimension or an energy universe and I have a new term for it I Would call it may be\nSeeing your lab already know space no time a dimension but my question to you is specifically\nI liked it shorter question your whole premise by talking about site medications explains psychiatric medications medications for either anxiety or depression whether it's anti anxiety drugs clouded than Xanax her aunt antidepressants or major tranquilizers or electronics\nBack chemically the brain and therefore I they do affect chemical have the\nIt's just us meaning of the mind so by changing biologically biochemical you the brain to these medications or even an aspirin or Tylenol ibuprofen can it can step debris and the truth that headaches going back to ... it can affect the brain chemically we know that positively\nAnd in the mind and that's my first part my second part of the same one question is\nAlzheimer's disease dementia affects the brain does affect the conscious of the minds of those things that show and here's my question for you it doesn't show that if\nThe mind and the brain are not the same thing at least the brain is connected to the mine is connected to the brains and I'm trying to say\nThank you very much for your question bill\nAnd this is something I Do address in the book and I've thought a lot about personally because we do know that there's a strong correlation between what happens in the brain and the type of conscious experience we have whether it's take medications or if someone gets in a car accident and then has cognitive impairments we know there's a correlation\nWhat I argue and and some others argue this as well is\nThat correlation does not always imply causation in other words just because two things are related to one another we can't automatically conclude that one causes the other so here's this simplistic example from Dr Bernardo Castro when when I mentioned in my book\nImagine you have a fire lots of firefighters show up you have a larger fire more firefighters show up\nA very strong correlation between the size of the fire and the number of firefighters that appear at the scene\nWe know however that the firefighters did not cause the fire that's not the nature of the relationship\nBut the firefighters are highly related to the fire so I've used the brain in a bit of a different way with a grain of highly related to consciousness damage the brain you you take psych med the brain and consciousness will be affected but the brain I view it more as like a\nFiltering mechanism or like an antenna receiver which similarly which show a strong correlation between what's happening in the brain and conscious experience but it's not the producer of consciousness\nWhat do you think mark of reincarnation\nWell I have a chapter on that in my book and I know about the studies done at the University of Virginia I think there is evidence for it\nWe we've had some incredible stories too of people who have talked about their past lives including little children uh and it just is remarkable when they're checked out there's no way that they would know certain things unless they experienced it is it's it's mind boggling isn't it\nGeorge I agree with you it's chapter eleven of my book and I think the most compelling cases in addition to children being able to recall thing that they shouldn't have any way of knowing\nA man or sometimes verified by medical records by the UVA professors is in some cases the children have\nBirth marks or physical deformities that are very specific that matched the way the trial describes dying in the previous life and in some cases and medical records are found so it's it's something that's beyond genetics beyond environment which are the two factors typically considered to affect the physical\nSomething else was going on and the researchers call it a third factor\nOr a person's petrified of water and then somehow in hypnosis they died in the past life by drawing let's say\nExactly so it's preferences and fears that somehow or transferred to something beyond the body seems to be a transfer from wanting to distance to another ostensibly\nWe have Monique in Southern California with us I'm On the go ahead\nIsraeli descent from what I can get\n... who I dealt with over there mhm my question is that again I don't believe in any of this other stuff but I Do believe in a remote viewing because of his I guess you would say non English or non American ... uh I guess it's so she was ...\nIs there any research or anything where there's a culture or a nationality that is more than ... ... you are\nNot necessarily not not not because of nationality or anything like that I haven't come across that mark I mean there were there were great remote viewers all over the planet or but it doesn't skew anything specifically\n\nI Would say that consistent with what I've seen so far but I think more research it deserved on this topic isn't being research widely enough to understand if there are certain trend there are certain brain configuration that make people more able to do these things\nAnd in your case mark the definition of remote viewing would be what\nThe ability to perceive something with the mind alone\nIt's almost as if the mind the loan has our he's outside of the body\nCorrect going back to the whirlpool analogy it's like somebody is able to accept another part of the stream even though they're localized in their individual whirlpool it's like they open up their whirlpool and they accept water the outside\nI wanted to go back to John are veteran here and ask him a question John you're still with us\nYes or a ... so you do or you you believe in remote viewing\nBut it's it's it's tied into all these other things it's all part of the whole show what would it take to get you to believe the other things outside of UFOs 'cause you know that's that's subjective to everybody\nOn unfortunately with me only because of my background it would be you know personal experience I

and ... you know again I'm a scientist okay so it's not that there is this something there that we don't fully understand\nThen can we say that it's the ... the person or is there some other force behind it\nWell let's suppose let's suppose that ah the Dow is er and I've seen it with three different methods brass rods willow sticks and ... over a map mhm okay I'll watch pendulum over a map

science cannot ignore this cannot ignore this going all the way back he your your guest mentioned William James okay\nAll that whole period when all of this a lot of his early early research started

feeling\nYeah they can feel it\nIt's their reading but to the ... the head of the native folks that lived in that country that made that animal pretty sacred animal\nAbsolutely let's get a quick reaction from you mark is the time was clicking by here no there's no question that if science skin say the things steam and just said we're on our way isn't it\nYet even raises a number of really good point about the need to study these and I'm and I'm much more to understand the nuances of how it all works\nI don't think we understand some of the mechanisms because it hasn't been studied widely enough and that's largely because it's so taboo particularly an academic institution even talk about these things I've talked to scientists you say that it's a academic suicide effectively to talk about these things before getting tenure\nSo that's another reason I really wanted to write the book and put the evidence in one place for people to hopefully open up the conversation so that it's not such a taboo topic\nWell Steven as a scientist admits that there's something very strange going on even know what it is but he's open to at least say that it's unusual in different than you know something could be happening mhm\n[noise] well we haven't talked much about quantum mechanics here but it's a field\nThat has been around for over a hundred years which is accepted in the physics community as being real but it's totally counter intuitive\nThere's a phenomenon known as entanglement and the very basic phenomenon is you have to particle two pieces of matter that are physically distant from one another and when you affect one you affect the other simultaneously like an instantaneous effect\nWhich suggests that there's some hidden interconnectedness now Albert Einstein did not like this at all he called it spooky action at a distance because he thought the speed of light what the faster than anything the travel and yet here we have an instantaneous connection between ... articles\nThat there are things in the ... of reality that are totally counter intuitive but we just don't see\nThem in our everyday lives has this changed your life\nIt absolutely has I think from the standpoint of understanding human potential and what we can do like ugly this it opened me up completely but also it it introduced the notion that interconnectedness the idea that we're not actually separate even though it appears that we are\nAnd that takes on it brings a whole new meaning to think like altruism which if we're all connected than helping another is really a version of helping ourselves to me that it has implications for interpersonal relationships all the way up to world peace\nAll right my friend mark thank you again in one more time you bought your website and

chronicled stories from the wrong with the unknown the unexplained it'd be unbelievable let me tell you about marine fifth generation psychic transfer medium for as far back as she can remember\nShe is communicated with the deceased at the age of Fifteen\nHe was introduced to a person who studied with laureen Cabot was the official which upset with Massachusetts and she took Maureen under her wing and Guided Tour and ways to doubt only understand\nBut also control this gift\nAt the age of Fifteen she served as the medium for adult San says she's practiced studied and instructed metaphysical studies for more than twenty five years more has been with the New England ghost project since two thousand one and there's a company the group on more than one hundred investigations\nHere she is on the coast to coast Maureen welcome\nThank you so much for having me we could afford to this Fifteen Years old all this happened for you\nYeah I Know as you're reading that I'm thinking oh my God that was only a few days ago right\n[laughter]\nTell me about Lori Cabot the official which of Salem\n[noise] you know he's very a wonderful woman when I was\nAt that age that who you know he was someone that was barely renowned in the city and she still is on it now and it's you know the high priest salmon and he'll often when I was younger you are walking around town you know dressed in her her guide and very regal looking\nVery on you know she presents no upright and ... at\nThe time to people welcome or with open arms or did they go oh my God there's a which\nYeah that's a great question you know there are many people\nThat welcome her with open arms but let's just say the pound and Sam I'm not necessarily [laughter] so it always seems to be at those days it was a little bit of a battle between the business and you know and the town in Salem and those who really believed in the witchcraft and um so\nBasically she did you know she really changed\nThe whole way they look at it now you know obviously it's a big tourism right for the type of season and it's you know go to Sam I'm so I think that it really worked out well for the town of ... you\nKnow you are a generation shy trench medium that means we're talking about ... back to your family your sibs ability what year who didn't start with\nNo my um\n[noise] it's interesting because growing up my mother just never really wanted to I don't know if you don't want to scare me she just\nYou know my poor father though he thought just those girls insane [laughter] um but I Would come to her and talk to her about spirits I was\nSeeing and I to me it was normal it didn't seem unusual I didn't have anything to judge it by um and my mother would just you know God Bless her she'd say oh here's some holy water you know just to you know she told my father she is normal\nUm but she didn't really discuss it with me a lot until I was older and I was still you know involved but say in a matter of physical and that spiritual around and one day I mean she was talking you know in her sixties she finally told me that she\nIs you don't want Maureen this has\nBeen from my family for many many years like her great grandmother and you know her grandmother used to help people in town and he'll them of their illnesses and keep them stop them from bleeding and do readings for them and she said you know I hear the spirits but I just turn up the radio so\nWould you see that there was a member of your family that was better than another member\n\nI never you know never really quite thought of that um I Would say that I had you know my grandmother died when she was twenty eight so\nI never really knew her um but my great grandmother my grandmother rather I did know and she was the one who really got involved with doing readings for people so I heard that\nYou know she was very trusted in her city or in her town um so it's hard to know I mean I don't know have a lot to really judge by and my family history of who was might have been stronger than another\nDo they ever passed dome stories from one to the other the the you could to reach ...\nYou know the only thing that I\nDo have was given to me and ah I have this little picture of you know and it was my grandmother actually before she had path and uh she was maybe maybe five years before she passed and it's interesting 'cause she you have a picture of her and she looks like a gypsy\nUm and my mother used to joke about it and say that that you know ... that was her true self she was very unique about what you said so that the stories that God will always bits and pieces never never anything that was really concrete that I could say I'm about spirits anyway\nYou know you've been with the New England the ghost project Maureen since two thousand and one would use that\nA well rounded do much better than me to tell the story but he started this story\nAfter on a near death experience um and he had to work and do a um you know a special court for class and he took\nTo try to to keep him busy when he was hailing from his illness I'm and basically he started doing a cable um you know he started cable program and during that cable program he had to do\nIt on something so he chose you know doing on go set his workshop and again he'll do much better at explaining that I Would focus on but it's a team of individuals that\nYou know over the years I've learned you know to me everybody is really you know it's a great team of people you work really hard to gather you go out and you look for the things that go bumps in the night you know someone else doesn't really want to\nSee one look into that they're quite satisfied not knowing about the unknown or you have someone that really needs help there's been many calls over the years to run and the team\nUm that were you know businesses um you know families you know you'd have restaurants and they don't really want to\nDo I go out and tell the public all the time this was years ago they don't want to tell the public that something is going on that they can't explain and people were getting a little freaked out and they need help\nSo it's really been a journey of love I think to go out and actually work because we're not paid you know it's not something that we get paid to go out and do investigation some people it's really going there to to just help them\nHow many people are just off the wall when you go to their house and they're just using it\nWell off the wall meaning terrified of spirit you off the wall just crazy\nYou know show [laughter] sure why his birds I guess\nUm you know as as it says we've done more than a hundred and investigations\nUm I Would say that you know not a hundred percent would we find something active going on at the time but we're big believers to know that you know it doesn't always happen on command\nUm so I really believe that there are a lot of supernatural things that are going on um if you're aware and you're open to it you might experience it you know some people say well I've never seen it and I don't believe in that well there's a good reason why you don't see it [noise]\nUm so if you say how many people I'd say a good percentage of paranormal activity does take place out there and I would bet that if you did a poll and you ask people on the street\nYou'd get a good amount of you know maybe Seventy percent of people have had some odd experience they can't really explain and their lives\nWhat have you conclude about what this may be a lot of people have their thoughts about what ... what do you think they are\nWell I think\nThere are varying degrees of what they could be right so our experience and my experience over the years has been you know if I Do a reading for someone for instance um I get more of a loving spirit someone that's passed over that wants to communicate and come back and you know left their love when those are okay or\nMaybe has a message for them that they weren't able to give before they pass 'em but then you know you're called out to some locations where\nYou know things aren't really going while someone's gotten thrown down the stairs items being tossed around the house um there's different you know event like say a you know people walking by and then they might see a spirit walk by and all these plants\nJust die as they're looking at them um we had one case of a woman who was living by herself with the door\nTo door closed in her apartment and yet she was hit on the back of the head with a a ballot stress from the stairs on you know all these\nOut she'd have something go on in the oven like she'd go to put potatoes enroll them in foil and should lay down and take a nap while they're cooking and yet they would fire would start in her oven I'm it would wake her up with the alarms going off and she'd get up and look in the potatoes underneath on you know on the flames itself\nBig big guy covered in tattoos and we just tried it you know just\nOverwhelming right to sit there and so was just looking at me and we could in this house and he said I think I have a little girl in here spirit and you look around and the mayor is shattered in glass table busted and it just looked like someone to the house with a bat um it was just torn apart and they were terrified and he said you know they've\nMy phone's been ringing with all the rules on it and my wallet went missing and\nNow he's telling me all these things and he kept saying I think it's a little girl and I'm like okay well let's see what we can pick up so after a few minutes I'm thinking oh my God this is not a little girl I could feel the spirit of a man very angry I'm very trying to get his message through and I thought wow you know this isn't meant no it's not and he was getting\nAdamant that you know it wasn't and I need to talk to use them\nBrings us out of the house and now I'm thinking jeez what do we get ourselves into right um\nHe leaves Ron up at the top of the driveway with the guy moods any rags me down on the on the driveway and he looks at me he said I Want you to come back here tonight by yourself and I said well you know I really don't feel it's a little girl and you got to be careful you know you don't want to welcome in something that you don't know is there and\nAnd he turned to me and he said look I just got out of jail for murdering\nMy best friend she\nSaid and I'm telling you right now that wouldn't be him and it's got to be a little girl and I want\nYou here and I thought oh God I just have

dining with the ... that I Do and and that was a at the old dancing cockatoo a we were doing they public ... century\nSomebody for the man and uh I was in the library there are a bookstore I guess it's a better word for it and I'm a member of the Mets came in and she told all about uh\nHow they used to come in in the morning and sometimes they would find books in the middle of the floor and they couldn't understand why it happened so she finished it with us be on one side and then I get up and began to track it suicide began to speak for the books from\nBehind me came ... la la la\nUntil the middle of Rome in front of thirty five PCs and there's no way they would just fall no it was like this fall down behind me I mean I was they come flying\nBy the end like somebody was throwing them at you exactly the and like I said with thirty five people saw it I didn't see and unfortunately because my back when it started to it but I thought the book but by and screams [laughter]\nDo you think there was somebody back they're tossing met you\nI'd certainly looked in ... so you know but that was just a wall where\n... what has for you than you know on the cases that you've been in have you ever felt that your life was in danger\nOr never buy the dead\nNot by the by the living at home\nAnd I first book uh goats chronicles is ... is the second book on the series a marine and I did an investigation it was a daytime investigations jumped him and called me up and asked me to check out his house so I gather murdering up and we went to his house and the places that massively looked like it had been trashed and\nThis guy insisted that there was this spirit of\nA young girl there and ah so anyways uh they were pretty big ... uh in the the\nKind of got us for a while after we did our thing and uh one of them moved separated from the other one and the other one talked marina we later found out that that the guy had just been released from prison for murder or a friend of his and ah so he wanted Murray and come back and well but that didn't turn out so if\nThere was any fair weather then [laughter]\nYeah she was telling us that story before I Would imagine\nIt's it's one that's left an impression with us\nI think so what kind of equipment run do you bring with you\nA very on on on the particular case uh the you know the the larger the um the case you know as far as locations and the more people but more a piece of equipment a small case the lesser amount but you always want to um\nYou know tried to bring the proper equipment that you would need for instance if you have reports of a ... being seen\nYou might bring more video equipment or you know like they're ... or ... whatever\nThat you you believe versus a sound equipment or something like that and it was and vice versa if for instance most of the the the um reports manifested by audio than you would bring more audio crummy so it it it varies avoiding we've gotten to a location\nWhat would you say has been the most incredible visualization\nThat you've come across a I'm Sorry what was the worst visualization of a goal visualization\nUm actually I Believe I've seen a full body operations probably four times um but the interesting part about it or judges that\nThey weren't really well I was ... times in but more while I was just doing normal stuff yeah I work with a lot of White Houses or a funds for him and we do you know public goes on and that type of stuff\nAnd there are two separate occasions or one guy do these goes to his 'cause I'm On the board of directors of course on top of a White House so we do these hard to toys and one time we were in it's a it's a like an observation tower where it's a square building with glass all around you\nAnd say use windows all around you can absolutely see you know three hundred and sixty degrees and his wife and daughter in and out of it and there was a group of people there and I began talking to them doing my ... and I looked outside and I saw a woman a walking on the outside towards the door\nAnd she got about halfway down the ... the a side of the wall you know going towards the door\nAnd I I stopped because I didn't want to repeat myself and she came in and they didn't want her to miss anything so I I just thought they waited for ... circuit generally walk all the way to do it\nAnd I waited and waited and yet nobody came in so finally said is there anybody out there and there was a volunteer sitting on the the rock out there and there was another one by the door and she's just notice there's nobody out there\nBut yet I saw her as clear as day so clear that I had stopped my field to wait for her to walk it and yet there was no one here and oddly enough\nThat ... is where the coast guard because it's on the coast guard base a coast guard report and she and women walking on the wall in that same location so\nThat was kind of intriguing I'm an I'm perhaps the other one which is going to the opposite scale was on a Sunday Morning after we did a public or goes typed on uh what Iowa lighthouse in a bid for pool meals Maine we were in the White House ah keep his house it was under\nUm renovation at that time we were sitting on the picnic table in the in the room off the kitchen I look towards the kitchen I serve dog all across the or the kitchen and ah but I didn't hear anything you know how it drives you hear their claws on the\nYeah yeah the the there was no\nThere's no sounded out so I jumped up and meal you're into the kitchen and the dog to the door was closed\nSo I came back and spoke to a woman and she says why would you see that's that's that's our dog she says the to describe not so sure absolutely as far as clear as day and I describe that thought she'd just stood there and shook her head and smiled at me and she says well you know Ron there was a White House keeper here who had a dog\nAnd when it was time for him to be relieved to leave the island or the dog wouldn't go so all the lighthouse keepers afterward took care of them until the dog actually died in the Iowa and she says the dog you describe pretty much matches\nThe study of the dog that that of that dog and I did see a picture of it looked like it but can I say that was it though I Know but so I mean his two things that I'm really not looking for goes but it certainly saw it would appear to me as a ...\nMinute still

going to take your phone calls as well more goes chronicles Maureen say hello to Ron\nRon How ya doing she never touched me in the morning there you go [laughter]\nSo how often do you get the calls Ron for ghost investigations\nYou know it it it's funny when we first started we course it was quite common but are there are so many group so like when I first started I always say that was\nA ... you have to do was knew that was like twenty four in the country knows like twenty four and any city but the judge I did what I mentioned you mentioned the hurricane Michael is just an image though of the the the sudden right now has got what they don't know if you've seen that yet or\nNo I haven't seen that yeah it has a ... it's pretty that's you're already it's our number is ... and started club but it's pretty cool sorry about that\nMaybe we can concentrate and bring that thing down from her for doing nothing oh\nWell that would be good\nAnd we've been able to do some of that so when when when you go on your team when your team gets together how much research do you do before you go\nWell Maureen doesn't do anything because half the time she doesn't even know where we're going to you\nKnow she was telling us that you you don't want to ah influence\nI I have to know some would have voted for instance if you're going especially if you go into a big location you have to know a where the cost of tree you're you're investigating for instance if\nI'm there are a lot of noises coming out of ... area you might want to concentrate your audio recordings or if\nIf for a visual phenomena are in different locations you certainly order a you know put your cameras in there and and so you you ... you have to have a little bit of it I tried to get too much into the details with tour of the coin is for lack of a better word\nFor you there to discover the ghost or to cleanse it what what did they ask for\nI Am not I am there for a new strictly investigate\nThat the popular question 'cause and that was one of the things people will say when they read our first book was like oh you know you know what were they doing you know they're not going they're releasing spirits and you know those are things you hear from people but\nYou know they love the book but the whole point is is as one and I've always talked about you know some of those parents have been there long before we have um and we don't know why they're there right so we don't necessarily know that they want help to move on and that's one thing if they're there and they don't want to leave who are we to tell them to that they have to\nDoes the person who brings you when do they want the ghost outta there\nI always ask them you know what you want from us you know\nBasically a you know what you expect from us in a in a very at the cases on that if they're looking for someone who watch like a host Clinton's itself but we're not going to do it\nThough you know or are we from someone else um but if they wanted to investigate this to understand what's going on and try to understand what's going on than will do that type of case\nAll right let's take some calls free both to view let's go to brandy and granted big California Welcome to the program I brandy\nHuh hey thank you for taking my call but um yeah I had a question and I had a really really rough year after year I'd probably the worst year of my life and [noise] and I'm Wondering if you are able to tell me what you see\nHere next coming there being a lot better police things starting to go more my way\nMaureen this would be for you\nThat's for sure yes [laughter] yes at what\nUm okay so Brandi I did pull a couple of cards for you um and honestly one of the things that I see is a lot of emotional turmoil right so that you it seems like you're holding on to a lot of hurt that have been happening around you right um and I obviously don't want to get too personal um but\nYou know and the other ... is you know this was last year in our things that have been happening is like a pressure right so because of all these things going around you it feels like your hands are tied and you're not able to move forward\nOn what I wouldn't tell you is that for you to get to a better place you really need to trust you need to let go of some of these things that are you know in your life that I hate to say it but even even if there is um like a health issue that is taking place it's a learning lesson right now for you um\nAnd it's a time for you to grow and you have to be able to to trust that it's not going to be this way all the time and I know that might sound cliche but I'm calling these cards around you and it tells me that you know you're really trying um but you're having a hard time you're like okay where do I begin to let this\nGo on and you're doing a good job of trying to act the part I feel like you're going through your daily day routines are really trying to put it on the math but you're not feeling it\nIs that correct or now a right [noise] yeah okay right\nSo what ... think of it this way right so if you know I see that there's a hailing hand that you have and I used to me you up and go to person feels like a lot of people when they come to you and they have an issue is that correct\n\nThat you tend to be the ear that people talk to someone I was there\nYeah yeah\nOkay so you need to know that you know you have to have patients with yourself in your situation okay um how many is coming so know that you you are coming to a breakthrough it is going to get better\nBut I think a lot of it is knowing it's going to get better you know you have to put yourself in a place that's like a catch twenty two rights you almost have to feel it\nFeel that strength inside of you again which you're kind of like well how do I get that back\nUm and a lot of it is balance right is finding a balance in your life is what you really need to do at this moment\nAlright thanks good luck brand new hope everything works out for you during this time do you do you find Ron in marine that these investigations are more prevalent during the Halloween season or does it matter\n[laughter]\nYeah they do just
