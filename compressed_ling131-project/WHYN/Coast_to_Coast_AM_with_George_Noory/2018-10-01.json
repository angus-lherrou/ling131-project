that's a that's because he always brings the goods\nI Am jazz that he always allows me to get the first interview winning unveils a new book and like the other books this new one does not disappoint\nDavis you probably know spent Twenty years in law enforcement then worked in the tech industry for a bit but found this true calling as an investigator of unusual disappearances and his work in that area has become a phenomenon known all over the world multiple books a documentary film\nAnd maybe some other surprises become Dave great to have you back\nA George I'm always humbled that anyone even wants to listen to me though or appreciate the invite\nWhen you say you know I noticed something as I was reading the new book today that you make some personal observations than I Am not a I haven't seen it you go this far in the other books I insights\nInto your own emotional reactions to some of these cases and it seems clear like the subject really gets to you and you've got I think eleven hundred and thirty five cases that you profiled over the years thousands more they'd be looked into some of them really seemed to get into your head though I I think in part because of similarities\nSome of the missing to your own life right\nYou know I think that's true um I've been very fortunate to me family of people who have been lost and when you meet these people it really brings brings home the emotion and\nThere's a lot of parallels to my life with a lot of these families and I've written about people that remind me of myself a lot of times and uh\nI've put thought in the book just recently ... probably because it's it's more of an evolution of my writing and\nHopefully people see that you know hey if people are really really good people the hurt the Drake who is fighting these are\nThe upper echelon and it's the conundrum to me why I don't find people that are down and out in life that are disappearing but it it seems to me that it's always the high rollers the people that are high performers that are disappearing\nYou know one place in the new book you mentioned how as a rule you did not reach out to the families of the missing now sometimes you meet him on you to various circumstances but in general you don't call somebody up out of the blue and say hey can I talk to you about your dad loved one or you're missing loved one because it seems like an invisible line that you don't want to cross over but I Wonder\nHas the success of your books help in the sense that these families now reach out to you that they're unsatisfied say with the the search effort or something and they're they're turning to you for some help her answers\nThat has happened and uh\nI don't want to inject myself into a search or into the turmoil that evolving with somebody disappearing now somebody reaches out want some help absolutely I'm going to be there I'll do everything I can\nAnd there's been cases just recently where that's happened and I've been glad to help and uh\nI've kind of guided them and it it seems that a lot of these families and covered the same sort of issues time and time again and frustrating as heck sit back and hear the frustration and their voice a common one is is it seems as though when jurisdictions\nStop searching they get to a point seven to ten days and they say hey there's nothing else we can do there's no place else to search\nA we're running out of resources we've got stopped well many times families and friends rally at that point and they get a group together and they keep searching for what I tell these people is you've got to get a copy of those reports that the jurisdiction wrote search and rescue report\nLaw enforcement report the who they interviewed who they talked to were they searched the effectiveness that the search\nOr the areas that they completely eliminated and the and the areas that they thought that they still should search more because without that you're really searching blind and there's been instances just lately where people have said no they said they won't give us anything\nI find that baffling\nWell I mean that's how they've treated you I was gonna ask you the same question about different agencies I Know how the national Park Service feels about you and that they are we should anybody who has not heard your earlier interviews or is not familiar with the books you might be listening tonight\nI'm maybe we start there where you can explain the history of your interaction with the national Park Service the forest service government entities in general because they've shut you out I mean I guess I I'm interested to learn that they're doing the same thing that the families of the missing but uh it's really\nKind of clear over the big picture that they don't want to help solve these mysteries\nYou know it's a sad note on humanity if that's the case but there is a lot of obstruction so when I started out I was told by a couple of Park Service rangers that they had found disappearances and their parks where they had worked that bother\nThem didn't make sense when they tried to find information that couldn't and they thought somebody with an investigative background ought to be looking into it\nAnd that's sort of how it all started and I filed a series of freedom of Information Act requests against the national Park Service they have the

than that pretending to be you can you address that for a moment before we jump into the cases\nSo this is one of the most frustrating parts of the you know in the public spotlight I go to conferences all the time people come up to me and they say so you said this or how did you come up with that and I'm thinking I never said that and\nThere's a series of YouTube sites that have been named David ... is missing for one one missing a national parks there all frauds they're not me there are people that have used my name to get innocent\nAnd listeners to get on and every time you click through they get paid by their Google Ads\nThe only site that has me is a kennel missing project YouTube site all the rest are not me in fact about eighty percent of them when you click and and you listen if you don't know if somebody else talking about some other topic and it's not even me at all so\nI Try to tell us that people don't trust YouTube\nReally don't even listen to him a lesson that can happen to sing project site that's the only real site that you're going to get honest information from\nAll right um talk for a moment about search and rescue\nParameters because that that information becomes key to you picking the cases that huge zero in on I mean there are metrics there are there's data um for search and rescue uh yeah how how they proceed and and I are huge database I Would think that gives clues about which cases stand out as being unusual\nSo that the data that you're trying to get to is really in the reports that they generate and the national Park Service for one won't volunteer up any of these reports\nNow find name a specific date and a specific time and that person has been rural to be a missing and presumed deceased\nAnd are filmed impossible distances away sometimes they're alive amazingly enough but I'm often found impossible distances away and there is no way no way they could walk there on their own uh talk about that than up and\nSo there's a couple of sites that talk about my work and talk about these cases and the couple of people have chimed in and said well you know Dave talks about people in this books that have been found and there's no mystery there\nThey obviously haven't read the books and they don't understand the rationale behind why these stories are important so you've got a two year old child that's in the middle of the wilderness with their friends or their family and they disappear and that child found say three thousand feet higher in elevation and six miles away in a day and a half\nA well I don't know many parents that think that there are two year old could make that track\nBut that's not it I mean when I started to accumulate the data on it in off the grid the book before this one I had a list that accumulated\nThat probably there's fifty a cases in their\nStarts off with a case let's say a four year old missing in Australia found five days later forty five miles away across the desert of four years old and there's other cases where two year old in Florida found twenty miles away through the swamps\nA another two year olds in Australia found Fifteen miles away in three days two years old\nA three year old found Fifteen miles away twenty four hours\nNot possible in my book but I mean there's a long long list of these and why did I start to accumulate that data because in search and rescue manuals that says that a two year old should be found Ninety five percent of the time in a radius of two miles or less from the point last seen\nThese numbers absolutely blow that to smithereens\nIt's something search and rescue people don't want to talk about don't want to address that want to even think about and I can understand why because there's no way you could plan a search\nThirty miles away for a two year old it just you don't have enough people to do it and you have to work for that Ninety five percent tile but the problem is in all these books they don't talk about the other five percent anywhere\nI'm probably the first person that's ever talked about it but as you state\nHow are these kids\nMaking this extraordinary distance and extraordinary heights when I go to a conference I always ask people how many people in the room or parents you know Ninety percent of people raised their hands and I said\nIf I said okay you you're just going to set your child down in the dirt on a trail walk away we'll watch the child with such child's gonna do for the next hour\nThey said well maybe it'll crawl under Bush and go to sleep maybe the plan that dirt for a while maybe they'll run down the trail for a little bit get upset cry and then go to sleep and I said how many how many parents and you think your kid would run up hill nobody raises\nI mean it does happen but it's pretty rare but I have all these examples where the heights been achieved by these little kids\nWere they crossed a couple of mountain ranges or you know it's incredibly difficult terrain sometimes without any shoes on oh yeah we've got to\nMe and we talked about a two year old boy that they traveled nine to twelve miles in nine hours over two mountain ranges\nAnd he was found face down and know the next morning unbelievably why we found that guy years later and interviewed him and he has no recollection of what happened and it has wanted couldn't believe we found him and we couldn't believe it or why\nYou have a case in the new book ah in Southern California the Lucerne belly bill Hanks this was from back in Nineteen fifty six is the child is five years old at the age of disappearance\nAnd you do the math on a bill I guess if he had walked nonstop for twenty four hours he'd have to go watch six miles per hour\nBut a kid's not going to walk for twenty four hours with no food or water\nUm it it seems just impossible\nUnless somebody picked him up for some something or someone picked him up and walk them their\n... and the reason these cases\nHave significant is that what you report on a child who's abducted in downtown and they're found in West Los Vegas three hours later six miles away\nYou know church probable somebody put them in the car and drove down there but when you're talking in the middle of the wilderness that's not happening and\nWhen you talk about this happening when the people in the party in anybody never talk to anybody and when they check the trail walks nobody else was there nobody ever saw anything nobody saw any cars\nNobody else was there so how did that child make a difference in that time doesn't make\nA in the new book uh it's law L.

creepy when did you learn\nSo for people who don't know national monuments are part of the national Park Service it's their property and they patrol it and their national park police\nAre there well there's a location called Oregon or Ga an organ pipe cactus national monument and it's an Arizona far southern part of the state right near the border with Mexico\nOn February third Nineteen Seventy one a woman thirty two years old named Carol Turner\nWho was a student at the University of New Mexico drove there and was going to take a few days vacation and break from school and kind of walk around she was inquisitive smart athletic brilliant some people called er well I\nStumbled onto this case and saw it and some archive somewhere\nAnd I immediately wrote to the Pima County sheriff and ask them for any documents on that case\nI got the documents in my hand then I called the national Park Service at organ pipe and ask them for their reports and they said uh we don't have any sort of you heard of the case no well this person's still missing so she was a thirty two year old graduate student\nShe had been a PE teacher with a master's degree in physical education decided she wanted to go back and get to more masters\nDegrees and she ... she was just really admired by all of the faculty that she worked around and and studied under and all of the articles and all the reports said that they said that she was really smart\nWell she was about to graduate with a degree in sociology and biology and she was working and then you as university lab tech to earn some extra money\nShe loved the outdoors hyped regularly on January thirty first Seventy one she left her residence and southeast Albuquerque she was driving her white sixty eight Plymouth station wagon\nAnd she went about an eight hour drive to the monument and she slept in her car that first night February first\nIt was established that she attended an evening ranger presentation\nAt the end of that presentation she went up to the ranger engage them in conversation he remembered it and said hey she asked really good questions and was smart February second she went to the park visitors center spoke to a ranger they're stating she had just returned from a hike to bowl pasture\nAnd asked about a guy the trip to a place called dripping springs\nSubsequent investigation found she spoke to a ... a ranger an individual named Larry Henderson said he ... he remembers or ask good questions was interested in the environment wander nowhere to go to see more things\nOn February third she moved to your car out of the campground nobody knew exactly why\nAnd on February forth at nine Fifteen and I am a ranger was patrolling and found carols car parked in s this canyon picnic site with a note taped inside the windshield and it said if I'm not backed by four thirty pm on February through these contact the ranger\nSmart smart thing to do\nExactly you know I Wish everybody would do that but then as I went through this I started to think she was going to a place and she was heading to a place that she went to earlier and I always wondered in the back of my mind that something happened that first trip\nAnd she was going back to the second time and just in case she was leaving the snow I wasn't sure so he purchased patrol vehicle and he hiked the two miles up from bull pasture he saw nothing\nAnd decided to check the trail register and it was signed by Carol the first day she went on February second notify park headquarters advise\nThem that he has a missing hiker and this starts the search process February fourth and fifth national park service that sending to Forman teams up that trail the search\nWhether it was described and reports is cold and blustery\nThey determined Carol was last seen eating an orange on the trail and they did find some spare orange peel scattered around the Pima County sheriff was asked to join the search when the national Park Service start to get low on resources they also called in the border patrol and the tribal police US Customs\nMonth an air force base they brought in civilian helicopters was massive the search for three hundred ground searchers were on at any one time\nThe park superintendent a guy named Matt Ryan contacted turtles parents in North Carolina the parents that at the care would never ever go off trail she was an outlet outstanding athletic condition and she was supposed to be back in Albuquerque on February fifth\nFebruary twenty second that Ryan told the Associated Press it's almost becoming a search for the answer to a mystery\nMarch seven one last push to locate curl rangers claim to smelling odor of human decaying flesh up the trail\nMarch thirteenth national park service for the team into the area of the odor and found nothing and again they have no documentation on the incident anywhere\nNow I did get this NPs report that was in the Pima County documents and it was written by the chief ranger Roswell boils and it was three type written pages that outlines of search for Carole\nAnd Ninety percent of it real boring real mundane a review of what it says one additional clue was turned up on Monday February fifteenth too limited locations about four hundred yards the park on the south west facing of the hosts a J. O. S.\nA very strong and distinct human odor was found but no other locations\nSupervising ranger how cross of ... through our national monument and one other searchers who was recently involved in the recovery of a body\nHad very strong and positive feelings on the day than a vacation at the odor the following day ranger cos after flying the area and a border patrol plane\nLetting eat man search party back over this area\nAgain the odor was observed at the same location but only occasionally and not as distinct other members of the team described it as a very weird and scary\nAll efforts were negative and search activities have been reduced intermittent patrols at this time\nI have never in thousands of reports seen anything described in a national park service report of very weird and scary\nWhite guys yeah that's really strange feeling they had\nOr the fact that they're smelling what they think is decaying human flesh but there's no source for the older\nWell here's what it says other members of\nThe team described it as a very weird and scary so\nI'm sure all of us have spent time in the outdoors have spent have smelled the odor of dead flash decaying some time animals die you smell it I don't know if that could be weird and scary\nBut ah again\nThis was her second hike into that area which she nervous about making the trip is that why she left a note or where she just smart about it they never found her there was never any subsequent follow ups after that first sixty days search both of her parents are deceased she didn't have any brothers or sisters\nThere's no there's nothing left of her family anymore\nYou have another a case in in the book about a land disappearance that involves a really smart person somebody who's the editor for what looks like great things his name is Steven read and his disappearance was in Nineteen Ninety nine in Oregon tell me about that one\nSo this is the one time out of the thousands of times where I read this case and I

the era cases so I Want to jump into one of the most baffling cases involving water it's a guy named Henry McKay but this is really pretty creepy\nThat is a creepy case and ah [noise] the new Brighton Minnesota it's a community just north of Minneapolis not very far off the suburb September seven two thousand Fifteen to twenty eight am it happened [noise] McCabe was thirty two years old\nSo uh he was an immigrant from Liberia married to a woman named cream their two kids\nLived in a city called Mountain View again just north of Minneapolis north side this is a cost her area of missing people that I've written\nAbout in the past you had a great job using auditor for the state of Minnesota for the department of revenue on September sixty thousand Fifteen his wife with kids or went to California\nAnd it was a planned vacation well on that Sunday night Henry went out with a long time friend who was a very diligent guy always on time very respectable\nAnd he and his friend went to the early they laugh early on that Monday morning and ... states that he dropped him off at\nA location in critically at the super gas station at a Seventy third avenue at two twenty three am\nHenry phone appears corrupt pocket dial this wife while she was asleep and California and left the link the voicemail strange sound screaming paying growls et cetera\nAnd a guy from uh Finland\nDid some amazing work sent me this booklet of things that he did and in there he said Dave did you know that there's six major disappearances in Bermuda Triangle that matched dates of disappearances and your books [laughter] I never even knew that\nAnd then went back through it and he was right and that got me to start paying attention to these triangles now in the Nevada try and go down there by you it goes from Reno Las Vegas to Fresno that's the triangle and when I first got on to that I thought well\nThis seems kind of hocus pocus I don't know if I should pay attention but then I put it on a map I said holy crap\nYou know it's in the middle that try and go to Sam\nIn national park yes\nI go that's quite a coincidence so you're Seventy kings canyon and sequoia national parks are there and I've got tons of disappearances and king canyon and sequoia as well and when I watched a documentary about the Nevada Triangle\nThere's several thousand planes that have crashed and disappeared in this year is in that area and a lot of it can be explained by various\nMeteorologist as strange air currents that things which seems reasonable but when you bring into account that there was also many many people that have disappeared in that area under unexplained circumstances seems kind of a strange coincidence\nWell let's get into some uh do you have any specifics from the ... were you when you get into where should we just go you jump into the cases of air disappearances in general\nIt was just go to air disappearances you have a case in the book\nBob Moffitt field Sunnyvale, California from Nineteen forty two what's the deal on that one\nSo that I grew up not far from Marshfield in Sunnyvale I grew up Cupertino and I had plane flying into Moffett Field going right over my house every day of the week and it had notoriety in the early forties for being a place where all the blimps\nThat patrolled the coast of California that's where they were stationed at their and Treasure Island in the middle of the day\nOr two in August sixteenth Nineteen forty two a blimp was getting are sent out a treasure island where the help of world fair there was a man by tenant earners Cody twenty seven years old and an infant Charles McAdams thirty eight years old\nAnd uh they've left Treasure Island no big deal general patrol all the details on this came from the navy file under a freedom of Information Act I filed ... report on this\nWell as they depart\nThey start to head out over the Golden Gate and they start to go out over the Pacific towards the pharaoh in Ireland and Cody was at the control of an L. E. airship and this was originally taken by our military\nAnd it was owned by ... here and they took it because there was a needed for patrol\nWhat both men lived near Moffett Field in Mountain View but they drove up to a treasure island for the day to leave on their ship\nOr that night\nWater vapor was in the air and it made the ship too heavy to carry a normal person that would be in the bucket they only left with to\nThe first hundred and ten minutes of the flight was normal fact there was no communication and then at seven fifty am the crew radio that they were investigating a suspicious oil slick and there were five miles to the fair on islands\nAt eight oh five numerous attempts by radio to reach the crew but there was no luck and the navy scramble to ... to you kingfisher aircraft out of Alameda naval air station to go track down the boy\nWhat a plane's encountered cloudy weather with a feeling of five hundred feet they decided it was too dangerous to fly below the crowd so they will bubble at ten forty five AM Moffett Field received a call from Fort funds to near the Golden Gate stating that they had to LA ship with two pilots and all we're fine\nWell the navy made a huge sigh of relief and they felt that all was okay now this was a really really weird call but it was in the file and they couldn't explain why it was their\nMinute eleven Fifteen for fun and calls Moffett Field against they didn't get that in LA had crashed in the hills of Daly city Daly city is just south of San Francisco on the coast or the navy response to Daly city\nAnd they find their airship on the ground with one bomb sniffing the gone to was in near perfect condition\nBoth motors on the ship or off even though one throw was half open and the other with all the way open\nAnd the crew which was required to wear white preserves over the water both of the life preserver that they were supposed to be wearing were gone there was a confidential maybe briefcase in each\nA airship and that was still intact the cabin door was open plenty of fuel within the tanks the radio was in perfect condition no distress call\nFor fun and called back and say they they made a serious mistake know LA with President at the Fort they couldn't explain why they made that original call\nThe central coast of California had a major search and started almost immediately the navy found to fishing boat and navy boat in a postcard ship it's all the blimp dip and dropped two players on the oil slick\nThe blimp then gained altitude and disappeared into the crowd is it all appeared fairly normal but it did go into the crowds and disappeared\nThe crash happened at four thirty to build your street Daly city three miles east of the Pacific ocean\nThe crew did not use parachutes and shoots that were in the craft were still there\nThere's a couple of theories that I'm Sorry to interrupt you there was a couple of theories that developed a and that the theories are just about as weird as the disappearances or we're going to go to a break and when we come back we're in the jump into the other details about this case and then I get your take on what might have happened to these two missing crew people\nInto the break with journey wheel in the sky\nFind them more of us and I just logged on to go to ... am dot com\n\nI'm sure if that time of year when apple drops a new version of their desk top operating system Mac OS this year keeping in line with naming new versions of the operating system after locations in California\nUsers can download Mac OS Mojave most notable and requested feature dark mode basically instead of lightly colored windows the interface as dark there's even darker desktop pictures to match\nThere's also a dynamic desktop that will change background pictures based on the time of day but the update goes beyond pretty pictures Apple's Web browser safari is beefing up security if a website asks\nTo access your camera or microphones you'll have to approve it there's also a new addition to the applications on Mac OS news stocks voice memos and home from Iowa west the actual state in sync with their mobile counterpart candy if you use any home ... devices\nAnd want to control them from your desktop computer it could be assigned that apple is making Mac OS an Iowa west more integrated ... hobby is a free download available now with box on jak I'm Brett Larson Fox News\n... we will never fully understand what we've asked our military service members of their families or their children are asking them to deploy\nThey on one point\nAsking them to put themselves in harm's way\nBut we do understand that it's our turn our duty\nTo bring them all the way home um\nKeep them secure [noise]\nTo have their backs the rest of their lines in\nLondon or your project long term support programs do whatever it takes to help our most severely ill or injured veterans women in\nNo cause\nSo that they might stand\nAt ease find out how you can help and signed W.

H. Y. N.\nBack [noise] [noise]\nBefore the break we're talking about this US Navy blimp is patrolling off the coast of California and uh the blimp comes back crashes on land the crew is gone they pick up the story from there\nFor the movie did their investigation and they said that uh there was no fire on board\nWhen it hit the beach originally when it hit land it dropped one of its bombs accidentally that made the blimp writer was able to take off again and crashing that Daly city neighborhood\nThere was a massive search off the coast that went on for days\nAnd they never found anything they reviewed radio bog there was no call for help\nThey could never explained why the blimp went straight up into the crowds after dropping the players and they thought that it would have stayed lower to watch a lick that they were watching on the water\nThere were lots of water craft in that area they never found the crew or the emergency survival equipment that they were wearing\nAnd an area outside the Golden Gate that I've written about many times before because just north of San Francisco [noise] yup point raised national park which has had several strange disappearances I've documented\nAnd just south of the Golden Gate to a location called the half moon bay in that area of the coast I've written about other disappearances that are very very strange\nNo other part of the northern California coast north of\nThat coin raise area and nothing immediately south half moon bay so it's for one area that has just strangeness attached to it and like you said that they came up with some explanation for to me that were laughable\n\nWell like ah maybe they got into an argument and uh and both fell off or maybe one of them accidentally fell over and the other guy tried to save him and was pulled into the water or\nI mean could that could does not have happened ...\n... what do you think George [laughter]\nWell I'm just asking you did to respond to those stories it doesn't seem like a there was any kind of a disturbance sign of disturbance in the in what was left or the craft or and if they were wearing their life jackets you'd think that they would still be had been floating around out there when the when the search was underway\nOr even if they come out of their life jacket they would have recovered the jak right because that the area of the water that was searched out there with search so thoroughly and eventually those jackets are gonna wash up the shore and they would have recovered them on the beach\nSo oh these explanations absolutely made no sense at all\nYou have another case from Scotland a that was real Eighteen Seventy five\nBefore I get into that if I Want to address something that you said just after the break and that was an explanation that fits the facts\nAnd I immediately thought of getting Walker ranch you know\nGive is going to bring this up at some point or you know as I read this book today um I noticed that you you've ventured a little bit farther than you have in previous works or in the land in the air disappearances there's the Fred let Frederick ... case which is a famous UFO case\nThere's also a reference to a needs a National Institute for discovery science which was the organization that was studying skin Walker ranch in and several of the cattle ... that had happened in the winter basin\nAt the circumstances where it looked like these cows had been dropped from the sky some of them disappeared altogether but some of them or their their legs were broken as if they'd been dropped from the sky several of your cases I thought the same thing in multiple missing for ... bucks it looks like people are snatched out of the off the ground\nAnd then some of them are dropped back into these are odd locations a little kids that are suddenly miles and miles away it it seems like I Know you don't want to commit to\nAny particular explanation because you don't have enough evidence to a to point to one in particular but some of this stuff\nCertainly ventures into the area of the paranormal and um I wanted to share this with the audience that I don't know David how how closely you follow the UFO a topic I Know you sometimes you get into those subjects but\nIt's been an amazing nine or ten months where all these documents are coming out about government studies of UFOs the Pentagon's ongoing interest and one of the stories that I was able to break earlier this year was about skin Walker ranch that uh a program that have been created by the Pentagon\nOr to look at UFOs also went much further that it it studied what we would call paranormal events unexplained mysteries at places like skin Walker ranch in elsewhere and uh\nAt Jeremy core bell is made a film about it and I included in that film and is a reference to our book which\nHad been read in Washington it turns out earlier this year I was invited to go back by Senator Harry Reid to meet with some people whose names I cannot cannot make public\nBut they are they gave me sort of a download on the UFO mystery and what some of the research had uncovered and um and ... as well as additional information and some of that has been made public but the one of these guys pulled me aside\nHe had a at an ongoing interest in getting Walker ranch and other mysteries related to it and he asked uh ask me some questions about the ranch and then he said you know we think that that guy de ... at a at his mystery with these missing people might be related to the phenomena at the ranch\nAnd I ask a couple of questions it didn't seem to have a real solid answer or not one that they would share with me\nBut the idea that the phenomenon that's been seen there which is sometimes playful and sometimes dangerous might be related to yours startled me and I don't know how you react to that but maybe it makes you uncomfortable or being associated with anything as weird as that but you're stuff's pretty weird too\nSo how would you rank this person's credibility and integrity on a topic like this\nUm I'd say this person that I'm Talking about knows more about it than anyone and I don't mean just in the military I mean anyone\nHe's this person has seen a lot of stuff that the public has never seen so you know he he\nHas a very broad spectrum and a very broad knowledge base about what we would call paranormal including UFOs and alleged abductions and things of that sort so I don't know exactly how your a phenomena fit in with a larger picture but the idea that somebody has been looking at it is a I think that's pretty interesting\nThat's a wakeup call I think so um [noise]\nSo you know way back when we first started to talk about\nRanch I really put an emphasis on that area\nTo see if there was anything related to a disappearance that I could think my teeth into they can relate it to the activity there\nAnd you know there's really nothing around that ranch that I could say just related to missing people that I study but ethics seated before sometimes I think\nI I relate it to law enforcement and if you have a say a series of bank robberies the bank robbers aren't ever going to do a bank robbery in their neighborhood because they don't want to draw attention to it\nAnd I've always stayed at that I think that this is related to the profile points I I gave you one of those is water and when you look at Mississippi and Louisiana say it just filled with water and I have no cases from there it's bizarre\nAnd isn't George isn't there a lake fairly near that ranch\nYeah it's ... it's a reservoir it's called bottle hollow um it's a manmade lake but the ones right in the middle of you'd reservation you control that property and they allow camping and fishing and swimming and things of that sort but at that lake is a a\nHas a long history of really weird stuff creatures have been seen there and objects coming in and out of the water and there but a lot of drowning said that they the ... tribe believes that ah there's something in the water that holds you down a lot of people are brown there and uh\nSo you're right I get asked all the time if there's anybody in the vicinity the ranch you meet your criteria\nWho's banished like that and I have to say no other than animals livestock things and that sort but no people have a banished then I Know of course we haven't really dug into the historical archives or to the extent that you have but I think that some of that work is being done right now\nAnyway it's uh it it was a it struck me as a significant that that the person who told me that in D.C had a run up your books and and your subject matter\nI Want to try to get one more of these air disappearances in before the bottom of the break because I'm I think I'm going to open up the phone lines and no people are going to want to talk to you a little bit the Scotland cases guide Norman Peter Gibbs can you summarize that one\n\n\nAnd now the high hard radio weekends sports time

we're going to ask wall in Santa Barbara California wild card lines while the more\nYou I've been called called about five times since they've been on and I finally got through your you go I'm going I'm going to tell you a story of an actual experience\nBut first I wanted to say I think that there's that the higher echelons are working with the parks that won't give you information they don't want you to know and my second point before I tell you my experiences\nI'm encouraging you to read about the uh the Buddhist or teaching about these different types of creatures that live in proximity different dimensions but they can interact even thousands of years ago they talked about abductions split the blue to\nTalk about what they look like what the realms were like what they did anyway so I just encourage you to do that but here's the story this is\nIt it was before nine ... nine is six I used to live in Rochester\nBut I was living in California I drove across the country many times I went to visit some friends in Rochester ah I'll Try to find out the exact date but right now I Can't I'm gonna send me an email by the way I'll say I spoke to you\nOn the Appalachian Trail from Rochester to Philadelphia you there's ways to drive in many places in the Appalachian Trail you can pull off the road and just walk and take a nice walk on the trail and one time I did that in the afternoon\nAnd there was a a man a woman and a boy and a couple of other people walking one direction and we started talking and walking within five minutes another family came from around out seemed to me out of nowhere\nAnd there were picnic tables right near there and one woman who I was very suspicious of that just appeared said Hi to the other one and she had a girl\nAnd the shuttle can our kids play and the the the people that I had been walking with the mother said you are and we shut down at a picnic table and the the strange woman said that the other lady that I had been walk with what's your name\nThey they tell the name and the woman says that's our name too and then about three minutes later that lady looks into boys go on\nAnd she starts calling them and I got up and I walk around and I'll swear to God I Am not making this up there was a close creature over the boy the boy had passed out or I don't know if the creature bump them but this is the part I Want you know it had\nKinda futuristic very tight fitting clothes it jumped this creature humanoid but not totally human it jumped at least twenty feet from the ground without running jumped\nUp to the the middle of a tree where you know the branches start coming out\nAnd then I just turned around and I went back I didn't say a word I was scared I thought that that creature and those people that are pure were part of the same group I thought they were military people and this creature was a genetic hybrid this is what I Believe\n\nWell that's quite a story or David any reaction to that\nNo one interesting\nYou

don't remember an example here you you referenced that about an earlier book in this new book about the boulders\nAnd I I was always wondering well heck there's boulders all over the place how can that relate to the missing persons a mystery\nYou have a couple of cases where witnesses tell you why it it relates that these things sort of come alive um or they move right\n[noise] well yeah I wrote a story in my last book one right before the about a story a Spanish priest in Texas that was running from Native American thing came upon this giant piece of pink granite in Texas it's a state park\nAnd he said that after he ran up to the top of the granted it opened up and swallow with him and he said that he was inside the Boulder gift and made it for three days and then he said at the end of the third day it's that amount\nAnd that isn't the only story I've got like that and uh people\nProbably don't know this but there are stories of Iceland that they will move ... road when they're building it before they will blow up a piece of granite or big Boulder because they have a belief in their society that things are living inside of those boulders\nThey've a ... a missing for
