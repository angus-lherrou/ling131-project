of ah it Dame students a structure wise I don't think there is that much but different ...\nUm oh\nOf course sticks to the um sticks pretty closely to the NGO swan structure mhm and I'm a retains the the uh\nThat NGOs used All right so in other words there is not a lot of difference\nThere's not a lot now and go ah requested that people not use his terminology and so uh I started using\nBasically oh slang terms that the students developed oh for instance do analytic overlay which is basically your imagination taking over oh oh my students ... called stray cats\nAnd so I took over the terminology simply because and go\nOh put out I'm\nLittle basic litter saying please don't use my terminology mhm and ah so ah basically oh I Would say as far as terminology goes it is more disclosure to the original than than anything I teach um\nOh man I measure wise there I think they're basically the same\nAlright may I ask this of all of you why do remote viewers generally not love each other\n[laughter] well uh let me let me address that ah I've been watching this on the net\nWait a minute who is this oh I'm Sorry this is Lyn Lyn okay I've been watching this on the net\nAnd ah [noise] if you look very closely or the the\nConcept or the feeling that ... years or squared off at each other is a form of sort of misinformation and itself okay the ah\nPeople who are squared off at each other's seemed to be a\nEd squared off that Dave Dave squared off it it\nUh it and I are at and Joe ... and oh I think soon to be at and Paul oh and and uh several other people and if you may notice a pattern grew in there oh\nWhy do you guys let me restructure the question what are you guys not love it\n[laughter] [laughter] there are several\nReasons one I'm a [noise] for one thing oh when he got out of service he started a he started giving classified information to the public\nOh I'm a while it was still classified uh\nHe uh is making claims that he oh ran the project that he started the project that it was you know that he brief the president and and I mean these are laughable thing as a\nIt not happen you say not true or not true All right uh I'd\nI'd like to make a comment here as well uh this is Joe a is also made claims that I've worked for him and uh and that sort of thing and those are in fact we not true statements\nYeah he said I worked for him to and I didn't [laughter]\nAll right here's a fax a Mr mcgonigle ... has has said that ... ... was never a remote viewer ah with the government but was simply a person who was employed interview prospective candidates for the government remote viewing program could you please ask him to comment on that\nUm this look look let me jump in and ... this is Paul okay well that's actually not completely correct to end this knows Paula Joe's because they didn't overlap ed came in on the scene a long after Joe was gone\nUm and actually did indeed do did participate in some operational won't be doing projects however that wasn't his primary function or he was indeed a a\nA more an analyst a task or a managing training and stuff you know he did he he he was kind of a Jack of all trades in that regard you wasn't hired primarily as a rule you were in only under exceptional circumstances if you do that but he didn't do indeed\nDid do some operational young I got that he did one ... oh no you argue that you can always just on ... on for a number or I haven't gone through the list but uh I'd say uh I saw at least six or seven that he was a list as a viewer on really\nI didn't have that and I didn't remember that from a database of ... this is\nJoe I'd like to comment on my comment [laughter] ah that's not an exact quote for what I said All right um the claim was made\nThat I'm by a\nA dams that that he was the only person who who was qualified the trainer or teacher of the people remote do and that he was the the most accurate remote viewer in up in the project and the only one who was responsible for your and my comment was that\nHis primary job while he was with the unit was to to act as a monitor and interface with the the viewer in terms of a ... or setting up remote feelings and that he was not a primary trainer he may have trained\nOr in the sense that he ran practice sessions and that sort of thing\nAnd and that's OK that everybody had specific jobs went on the Internet\nUm and every one performed as they were required and I suspect the perform you know righteously ended the job or very well [laughter] ah or I have a problem is\nWhere he makes claims then then attributes them to himself when they're in fact don't have anything to do with him they had something to do with someone who perhaps is not even with this any more today\nIn a private moments are you gentlemen have have you not referred to it deems as Dr Doom [noise]\nAh this was a nickname that was given to him and the unit before he came to us or he was a it was called Dr Doom over there ah he's been predicting doom death and destruction for years and years and years now\nUh-huh uh would you say that he has seen things that the rest of you have not seen\nThat would be with her or something and this is a a\nN and that's fine um what one of the remarkable things about remote doing is that when you when you make a prediction or you make a statement about something a one would hope that there would be some validity or some method by which you could prove whether you're the veracity of the information or I could\nCertainly choose or pick targets that are completely and verifiable and make all the claims I Want and that's okay um\nThey'll never be shown are proven one way or the other but one would hope that if you're going to be making claims about remote viewing and its in its capabilities that you would be a open yourself to being tested in some way or producing information that can be verified\nNo right well that ah opens up another topic and maybe a little bit in the sense that games\nUm he's been on this program and said I'm sure you're all familiar with the amazing Randy so called [laughter] um and it has been on this program and said uh as straight out he accepts a Randy's challenge there is something like a million dollars are now more\nSitting there waiting for somebody to prove psychic ability and deems and said I accept I called the amazing Randy so called\nAnd asked him to come on he settled socks and said okay there's numbers in my safe tell ed to come up with these numbers\nI said that's not fair\nUm you're in control of the uh uh the numbers and I I don't like that oh so how about coming on the program in setting up\nA structured test ah with the controls set up here on the program and the amazing Randy so called did not come on the program would not come on the program I'm do any of you feel\nThat the amazing Randy's challenge could be a taken and met\nA as it stands a he's he's basically a a magician has a slight of hand and sleight of mind uh and if you if anyone does things on his\nTerms oh he wins I don't care if you were a hundred percent accurate\nUh doing it on his terms you you would um you'd be subject to a magician sleight of hand and uh I mean it's a it's a gimmick a you know that he uses for for his own a popularity and so forth\nOkay but if it yes but if if the controls were set up a independently ah from Mr Randy\nThen he wouldn't participate\nAnd so that's why he wouldn't come on the program\nSure right that this is Joe I'd I'd like to say something about that he he doesn't except the current scientific controls that had been verified proven and used to cross a nine to eleven labs and the world\nAnd so he's not hardly going to come on your show or in in establishing a valid or reasonable

model and Paul Smith a gentleman uh we left off an an interesting point I'd asked whether whether anybody had remote viewed Jesus was the ... was he the son of God what are you know if anything\nI'm this is Len yes Lynn a I had started a a an old war story here uh I had been doing the bad guys for for weeks and weeks and I went into the director and I said look\nOr this is Joe and I'm In in my response I'm going to be probably a little bit more specific um alright I one of the problems I have is the definition for alien and there's a lot of construction immediately come to mind when someone brings that subject up\nI I Believe are based on my remote during my experience is that uh the UFOs a real uh let me say that up front\nI have not seen any evidence that there aliens associated with UFO phenomena of not seen direct proof of that\nHowever are within the context of aliens I Would have to say that uh also based on my experiences um I Believe that there are a entities that people would perhaps ... million\nBut that doesn't get guarantee that there extraterrestrial they could be um and they could be essentially time travelers a extra\nDimensional a projections they sure almost anything\nAnd I don't think we possess sufficient proved to say one way or the other yet what they might get an answer Joe\nI'm very [laughter] however all of you agree there is certainly something out there other than us\nWell this is Joe again I'm ... this isn't a new issue are this is this has been around for two thousand years that we know of and it will continue to be around because those are simply experiences that are that people are having\nIn a while we may not be able to say ... very much specifically about it other than they are experiences\nDoesn't mean that it should not be properly investigated or or looked at what happens unfortunately is that a lot of the data is a is mixed with this information or it's collected improperly or poorly and\nAnd we wind up with some very interesting uh concepts about it but we we don't get any closer to the truth\nOr are there are there are aspects of uh Stargate that history of you are still unable to discuss publicly\nYes of course they are I Would have to say about Ninety five percent of it\nOn my God really yeah absolutely so when they said Stargate is declassified they only generally meant the fact that it existed\nThat's are generally so yes\nWell here's Paul um the the biggest body of a material is still classified and and probably ought to remain classified deals with the actual projects themselves and the reason for that is not the connection with ... remote viewing but the connection with other intelligence sources and means\nUm if there is material on some of that some of those projects that would that that could potentially harm our intelligence collection capability it might to disclose the existence of some human source that we have you know and and a\nHuman asset him at risk or you know and there's a lot of stuff in there that isn't even involved with what we're doing that that is sensitive to end a important to ah American\nSecurity or would agree with that\nYou made a rather startling statement one of you or that it deems you felt disclosed some classified material before it's time uh well\nThis is Lynn ...\nI'm not only on a on a few uh T. V. shows uh I think there's one called the other side or something like that and a radio shows but also um\nI was down in Atlanta one time a working with a student and I had the chance to meet a person named uh Courtney Brad ... who was going to put out a book\nOr this book was about the Stargate project and he asked me to take a a copy of the manuscript that he had and read it and then the first chapter of the manuscript never remember everything was still classified highly classified\nI'm In the first chapter of the manuscript was the list of names of all of the viewers\nOh I went back and I said I said Courtney you can't you can't publish this and uh and uh you know if you do they'll they'll confiscate your book or something in in any way that got him\nThe first chapter out mhm oh I ask him where did you get this information and he said well I've got a committed oh\nWhen I was a kid watching you know the old world war two movies and all I knew that the absolute worst trees and that any age you could ever do\nWas give the names of the other agents or I mean you you you buy the China ill and died before you do that and yet here is the entire list uh\nFor the purpose of being published while this was still a a a clash but thing now the reason that upset me so much was because um of another incident where it at a meeting\nHad gotten up and told what I had done a\nAgainst Hussein and I called him on the phone and I should add\nThese are crazy people with guns and uh I've got a family here and he just blew it off well the only purpose I could find for giving those names to coordinate the publishing the book while it was still classified\nOh deals with the idea of targeting for remote viewing\nOr if you have a name basically you have an address and a the a history of Russia and\nOh or psychology has been more aimed at remote influencing\nThan a remote view in our data collection and are\nAre shown I could still fun no other reason for giving information to coordinate than to have something happened to us and uh that upset me very much and uh uh I stayed around court and they not only took the first chapter out\nBut also deleted it from his computer oh I wanted to make absolutely certain that was completely gone\nLook guys over at the top of the hour anybody here have to bail out or can you stick around a little bit\n[noise] like the show for a while I'll or alright\nDone a then they're they are [noise] this is kind of a gathering of the eagles something you will not frequently hear Brahms never has been done before I don't know [noise] my guests are Linda Buchanan Joe McCosker Mitt Monaco will get that eventually and Paul Smith [noise]\nAll three in the military projects known as ... ...\nIs premier networks that was art bell who's being coast to coast am on the somewhere in time\n[laughter]\nOctober sixth what's new today on the free I her radio a radio\nFor decorating the house or just setting the Gehry move\nSpicy plate and has ... with labor in mind when you know after day\nSwing mixture you break out all our great valium party playlists whether you're at home or let's say the um the new I our radio ... collection that come out now\n[noise]\n\nNeed at home technical thing that by if you'd help tournament to free and how comfortable ... once you find you the perfect tagging can deliver it and make sure it's working to really see how that to work on a ... point all your tank all the time that's why I'm Talking about like basketball\n\n\n[noise]\nShe uses squeezes Marilyn soy terrifying attractions one location designed to get\nIn is our peak envoys list\nPrice dealer price to be happier if your car shop and you've probably heard these terms\nWhat do they mean it's so confusing well and was confusing not anymore I'm telling you about your price from two car it's a price it actually means something because it's the exact price you pay for the car you want including season accessories and basketball you'll know if you're a true prices competitive ... shows you what other people are paying for the\nMessages that are applied in the world to return to listen to Nick and Vicki story about seat quiet\nDuring planetary loud and ... very draining town will be next to somebody who you're trying to sleep and we've got that lounge reverberations\nYou're always hoping she'd get to sleep before I come up because I started getting the point where I was concerned because I knew she wasn't going to get much rather see if I came to ban the same time you know she'd been so used to me ... all the\nThis audio is for your review for ...

S. at tidal wave one word dot net right All right and uh you answer your email I take it\nYes you know it I Can't guarantee I keep up or if I have if they get inundated but I Do my best\nUh well uh you're going to be inundated believe me what projects or it in the remaining moments here what projects or have you all taken on after the military I take it you're leaving the national security stuff behind now are you probably had enough of that sink a ship\nA gift or maybe as you I don't know um uh but uh but so what are you doing now\nThis is Joe I'm I'm a research associate still with the economy to science as well that was the original ...\nAnd then later at us I see and uh we're currently working on some very interesting contracts for a uh some major corporations that have passed us with doing some research or of feeling and we hope to continue a pursuing the mechanism of the time of doing\nDuring you talk about it at all I I mean I Am for example our own CIA which wants to spend all its time I'm with national security work uh uh you know Congress and oversight committees have been talking about changing the direction of the CIA to a industrial espionage\nUh we we of course it see a sellout are the kinds of science as well have never endorsed uh espionage with any kind of were primarily interested in trying to uncover the mechanisms that supports functional\nWe've recently done three three or four a very interesting pilot studies that have\nIndicated that we may be on the something with regard to two or three of those mechanisms and if those prove out which we have every reason to believe that will\nUh there'll be some very astounding a findings that will uh open the door to a whole lot more research\nDo you guys ever scarier selves\n[laughter] every time I chose scares me enough uh I I Am a\nNo longer surprised at at this science but I'm never quit being amazed\nBy it I Would agree with that or\nIs it one of those things that once you have big gun uh I I mean I have yet to talk to a remote viewer who was involved in the government program or otherwise\nWho has said this is lousy I'm I'm\nOn board or I'm only interested and I'm not doing it anymore is it one of those things that once you've done you will always do\nA this is Joe uh it's I I always tell people that if you are if you wanted me to sell my experience in this for ten million dollars I probably wouldn't\nDo it however\nIf you offered me ten million at the beginning to do it that I knew what I knew now I probably wouldn't participate\n[noise] um I guess and yeah that's a good answer that's really a good answer All right well we're about out of time anybody a water issue any final words here um I of course would love to have you back at some future point um but any any final\nWords for the American audience is intensely interested in this whole thing you've been doing\nMost I call 'em\nSound like somebody else wants to say something too but um I I think there's a very exciting a process I think it's very exciting time to be involved in this and the and I'm Glad that people were interested that kind of been the case what we were doing in secret for so many years so I encourage people to develop an interest in it and explore it and find out about it\nSo in other words uh go ahead folks if you're interested follow it\nThat's it that's right Joes this\nJoke and I I just want to add one thing for you know after um I Would encourage people to retain or skepticism\nAnd to ask questions it's it's okay to challenge whoever's doing this in and have them explain or open\nA to review and criticism what exactly it is that they're doing uh that's that's where knowledge is developed and it's how we decide whether something is truly valid or not so I Would encourage continued interest but to be skeptical and ask questions\nWell you know somebody might likely saying we've only got a few seconds All right I Want to instill demonstration you know arts holding up something tell us what it is that is not the kind of thing that remote viewing lends itself toward is it\nThat's that's correct this is Joe I'm I I've actually done six live remote feelings on camera for national a national television and anyone in America\nAnd uh one of the requirements has been that they just abolition follow very closely the protocols and in those performances have have been open to review and criticism\nAlright Joe we're out of town Joe a and Paul thank you both will continue with Lindy Kennan goodnight gentleman tonight\nThank you for joining

that type of uh work\nOr is sometimes achieved much more easily\nUh by some other disciplines oh [laughter] I've I've heard it said that a remote viewing you're you're not talking about bar hopping right oh no [laughter] ah oh as far\nAs the the disciplines prepare psychology\nOr if you if\nYou're trying to learn remote viewing in order to get in touch with the universe or your higher self uh

N.\n[noise]\nAll right well here's a question from Ross in California and it's a neat one uh please ask when if he has ever targeted the period of time in which the dinosaurs roamed earth\nAh not personally oh that is a I'm a fairly good training target and uh uh in fact I think maybe I have a in my in my early training um\nYou know just as a as another uh\nA session to see if you're on target because we have feedback on that\nWell there was a there is the second part to the question okay or if so was man walking side by side with the dinosaurs\nUh I don't remember specifically good in that I have always felt that a a form of man was yes uh-huh but uh that I didn't get that from a remote viewing I got the from other studies that have done okay a simple archaeological ...\nThen it'll good PS here a PS why can't remote viewers win lotteries and um before you answer that I Would have answered a Ross in California\nDissenting Ross how do you know that a lot of the winners of lotteries aren't re most humorous [laughter]\nBut you answer the way you want when All right\nWe have ah people working on numbers which is a very hard thing to do in remote viewing a there is another type of remote viewing called alternate I mean I'm I'm well a RV an alternate remote viewing uh which uh\nSubstitutes remote viewing targets for the numbers and a allows you to a remote view for instance to pick three now the way that it's normally done is if you are doing the ... three\nYou have a four people working a three viewers\nEach of which will remote view one of the numbers and one person who collects the data looks on the chart to see what the results of Maine and goes and places Tibet\nOff I'm only ...\nRight ... thank her lungs I Know it's still hard right and people I\nTalked to him\nWell do you help people like this are Lynn\nA yes now one of the problems that I have is this a security clearance and ah for many other reasons as well\nOr if there's an investigation going on especially on an American citizen I Will only work it through authorized channels and so if someone comes to me and says you know uh\nUh my son is missing or or uh [noise] I don't know what happened to so and so yes I'm I Will tell them\nPartially because I Want the cushion they're partially also because it's a necessity that oh if they will get the investigating officer\nContact me I Will be glad to work the problem for free\nMa'am ma'am ma'am ma'am ma'am listen to me listen to me he just said have the investigating officer in your case you can't have your son contact him\nThere aren't there is no and I think for many years ...\nYes but there was an original investigating officer on the case\nWe uh ... retired by now\nWe worked a case not too long ago a last year some time that had been closed for nine years and uh and on the results of our ah\nOur session a male Dave and I worked on this the results of our session the case was reopened and they've been finding a I hear some uh some new evidence\nSo do that man well how can I get a hold of lane\nOkay that's a good question Lynne or ... what is the best way to get a hold of you\nOr do you have Internet access\nOr I Would presume she doesn't she can get it\nOkay oh I Would say the easiest the easiest to address to remember is art bell dot com and uh right there's a link to my page and on my pages my address and phone number\nOn right there you are a ma'am and or I might add that if you don't have a friend with the computer who can do it you can go to a public library and I just remember my address a which is WWW dot art bell dot com [noise]\nNow let me also say that right at the present time we are heavily backed up with a signed witness program ah cases and so we're we're really bogged down until we can get more votes years working on these so uh\nOh I Hope people won't be offended if um you know if they call and uh have their police department call as well\nAnd uh nothing is done that day\nAh we have a we have tremendous backlog here\nCompletely understandable uh west of the Rockies you're on the air with Lynn Buchanan good morning\nAri yes\nGood morning my credit for you know track all out there to cover up a book right All right\nAll right I'm old that that is an awfully good question in other words could for example another group of remote viewers somehow trick you and cause you to see something that would be utterly inaccurate\nAre absolutely in fact one of the biggest problems in remote viewing is that you tend to do that to yourself to begin with\nOh and there is a thing that a recall basically the neighbor's cat oh if or someone else whom you respect very much\nA does a session on a target and they're wrong\nOut of you respect for them you will tend to find the wrong thing as well this is one reason why I never\nUm a\nTask the same exact question to two different viewers who know each other\nWell this brings me back to it deems a tapes which generally the group earlier including you seem to agree might be or hopefully will be a good idea if it works\nIf it works then I'm all for it\nBut then on the other hand we all of those people out there remote viewing maybe even influencing they're\nGoing to be a lot of mistakes made\nA lot of mistakes there'll be paid and couldn't there'll be assertive virtual anarchy that would develop\nThat's my fear I Do believe very strongly in the show direct effect and I know that the more people who learned to remote you correctly the easier it is to learn to remote view correctly the more who learn to remote view incorrectly the\nEasier it will be to learn in ... excuse me incorrectly ... and uh this is my big fear with so many of the quickie courses that are out there oh\nThat I'm afraid that they're going to through the shoulder lake effect just a you know the hundred monkey if there sure are just a\nAlmost destroy any progress that's been made simply because it'll be easier to do it wrong\nYoung well what what was your initial reaction when you heard the videotapes were going to be released that have very or relatively comparatively inexpensive prices\nOh well it was just that I really hope it works or if there's a way that we can uh get people doing this oh\nAnd doing it well then I'm all for it and if there's a way that we can make it available to more people I think that's great\nWell listen we're coming to the end of our actually the entire program or\nYou really been a trooper sticking it out through the whole program it's got to be a one of the sun has to be back there huh\nYes ah looking out the window it is [laughter]\nAll right my friend while I suspect you're going to have a lot of emails to answer and uh this will keep you busy for a while it has been a distinct pleasure Lynn and we will do it again one day if for it\nI really enjoyed it uh I don't get the art bell show because I live in a very steep little belly and our local radio station as the water's edge of a light bulb

H. Y. N.\n\n\nWelcome back because the post am county Willis here discussing the origins of Halloween on Willis ... talking with been Radford then so as you tell us about the origins of Halloween\nIt really does have um an interesting history very rich in history um it's silly it's scary and get said panicking gets kind of crazy I enjoy watching the\nAh television shows around the time of Halloween or that were the fun ones the little peanuts you know characters that's always fun with the great pumpkin and all that kind of stuff\nUm but I like the fun ones and and I like when people dress up you know like the vampires and the Frankenstein I like the really good scary stuff\nI'm suddenly the guy that talks about that\nBut a lot of times ah there you know there there's a lot of them are just hoaxes I remember there was a guy I think it was in a in Cleveland or Boston or something about two years ago\nAnd he went to the the um the police saying that the ... the he'd found like a needle in in a Snickers bar or something and it turned out that he put that in their himself\nOh and we yeah when the police busted him he said well I was trying to make sure the kids knew not to trust strangers\n[laughter] yeah not to trust you exactly\nI was just such an offensive like the first of all the ... you know the whole stranger danger thing is really it's really played on the fact is that most people are good most people don't want her kids at all and you know and of course every year they X ray candies and it's I mean whatever if if\nIt makes me I wanted for her but I wanted to ask you that are they still doing that I remember you know it was always go X ray your candy I mean really do you do people really go to the emergency rooms where there's really sick ... you know people are really sick needing to get in and do they take the time to x-ray that did that really happened\nIt occasionally does happen and now I Know that because uh I I used to live in Buffalo and I remember there would be occasional announcements and it was also I'm a dentist office they would say you know come to the dentist often X. rated the candy and and I followed that for several years again I I Would I Would pay attention to the news stories and I'd follow up and say\nDid you guys actually find anything in the candy and the answer was almost always know\nFor something like you know it's it's a piece of candy if you have any any doubt throw it out you don't [laughter] I don't need to wonder whether there's something in the candy if if there's any reason at all you think its dubious you don't need to make but just toss it the way I just the whole thing is just silly\nNow my dad would go through it and say well let me let me look through the candy make sure it's okay but he did it just so that he could steal the stuff that he wanted\n[laughter] where where are the ethics here what we need to go back to the days when people were coming for soles of of of you know purgatory this ... you know this was something here\nWell what we did the you know sometimes I always think\nKnow like little Linus commercialism when it comes to like a Christmas when did the haunted house has come out because you know those are cool and everything however ... was it primarily for money [laughter] is it all these raises money right\nRight no no that that's a great question you know originally you know of course originally that the the when when people begin first making disguised as I mentioned it was originally an Irish thing it was primarily restrict or the British Isles\nAh and then it came over with the with the first and second wave of the of the ah the immigrants to the United states\nAnd in fact I tell you we mentioned a little while ago about some of the conservatives getting upset about it the Puritans I'm In New England or who of course are you know part of the uh the witch trials be have clean they were they were dead set against Halloween and that was that was a an occult abomination [noise]\nUm and so that for for so certainly for for for many years um of course before there was mass marketed commercialized stuff um you know you couldn't go to the local store you know Halloween spirit store and get a a teenage mutant ninja turtle mask\nSo your people were having to be creative you know boy though you'd actually have\nFamilies coming together to make a kids' costumes [noise] um and what you find is that the first the ... the first record that I found up Halloween masks are really emerging about the seventies so it really dates back over a hundred years\nI'm a they weren't they weren't of course you know as ornate and you know plastic molded and stuff\nBut what's happened that over over the decades as as you know as marketing is turned Halloween into you know a much more of a commercial enterprise and you know it it's B it's become commercialized for for better or for worse\nAnd this is when you start getting adults who are you know ... doing the the elaborate which costumes and you know the the you know the the sexy police officer\nCostumes or a drag yes and of course as soon as you have\nMass marketing then you have a you know you have the princess is right you have Cinderella and you have peanuts and you have all that sort of stuff and so you know that that's fun I mean but I like you I I sort of ... I have a sweet spot for for homemade costumes that really creative and not just you know something with a mask slapped on it\nYeah it's fine for sure and sell you know you talk about the history of it we know basically what goes on now so how do you see since you study there's so much can you really continue to do that how do you see the future of Halloween how do you see it in about ten years Twenty years Thirty years\nWell a an estimate good question you know I think that um you know ... ... ... ... mentioned I mean it's it's it's very much wrapped up in tradition and folklore and stuff and all these things changed right I mean we've we've talked about two or three different incarnations\nOf Halloween going back to to win and then you've got the mixing it with all saints day in office all day and and you were with each\n... each you know a couple of generations changed a bit\nUm and I think that um\nI I think it's probably going to remain more or less the same for the time being a you have had occasional places where people taking it too far in Detroit for example it's it's known as hell night I mean there's the other like art and stuff it's like scary scary stuff going on\nUm but for the most part you know most people keep it keep it pretty simple I think that\nThat there's a certain innocence about it\nBut I think is really peeling again it's not it's not Easter it's not Christmas it's not tied to a particular religion\nIt's it's something that anybody of any of any uh of any faith and creed hum ... who does like address how we all like to dress up right I mean eight year old kids left an eighty year old kid like dress up and so it's there's something that is I think just inherently\nA humanistic and fun and and I don't think that's going to go away and um you know it's still gonna be knocking on doors and asking for candy or you know I don't think it's going to change dramatically in the next ah in the next you know twenty you're fifty years or you could you know who knows maybe two hundred years from now\nA ... there'll be a sort of you know virtual a go you\nKnow where you got like holographic oh you've got to that because that's usually the giant thing that'd be cool\nThat's right that's what's going to be knocking at your door and that'll be cool All right so we're talking with Benjamin Radford origins of Halloween we are going to are asking about the same panic part of it when we come back stay with us you are listening to coast to coast am I'm ... and this is really saline tonight\nNever missed a detail on a show or against sign up for the ... ... email newsletter available for free at ... dot com\n[noise]\nSigns of don't feed the bears this week in Nineteen sixty two Johnny Carson takes over from Jack Parr as most of the late night talk programs Tonight Show Carson went on to host this show starring Johnny Carson\nFor three decades becoming one of the biggest figures in entertainment in the twentieth century as we can Nineteen Ninety lesson one year after the destruction of the Berlin Wall east and West Germany come together on what is known as unity day reuniting east and\nWest for the cherry thriller author Tom Clancy whose books included the hunt for Red October and patriot games dies in Baltimore at age sixty six following a brief illness during a career that spanned nearly Thirty Years'\nClancy fan more than two dozen novels a number of which were made into movies and popular video games\nThat you look back at this week in history things are dealing with drugs are\nGetting to know with the news that now\nComing up at the top of the hour and I got to know what's going on in my ... news radio five sixty ...\nGreenfield used to\nFly in and do the ... joy in Springfield\n[noise]\nWe've got a great feeling sorry for the war in the house\nDavid your guy that has overcome a severe issue\nWhether light the light bulb went on and I started to research is why I was going through capsules I couldn't get enough it made me feel so much better I can tell you one thing the product war\nAnd not only works in one way it works for a whole bunch of different ways because it gives me energy that gives me like ... or how to better way carnivores built everything back into my body in a while but you know what it's better there and I feel it Kemp fan oh\nThis is Richard Ross Perot or for carnival or research international call one eight six six eight three six eight seven three five that's one eight six six eight three six eight seven three five or visit carnivores dot com C.

I was going to open up you know do you want to ... or whatever\nI I agree with that one\nBut I think what was interesting was was that it was it was codified on a wall\nAnd it was I'd never seen that like you know in the rules you know sign this don't use it and so you know typically the concern is uh it's about kids because again as I mentioned for for most of most Halloween it wasn't\nIt wasn't centered around kids or was it was something that mostly you know adults and and and you know teenagers did you know whether it's a bobbing for Apple's are\nDoing trick or treating but beginning in the Nineteen fifties that's when because it was centered on kids that's where the concern came from and so it was that\nA kid the dresses up as a witch or a goal will become interested in witchcraft or Wicca or vehicle because of that and that's that's basically the foundation for that and so this is why a lot of times um the the\n... parents who are concerned about that um they do a couple of things one of them is they have instead of a Halloween party they have a harvest party so if they they they they make a case to distinguish it from home and this is our way into the harvest party but there's lots of similar stuff\nAnd of course they'll they'll you know parents were concerned about that bill have the kids dressing up as princesses or something ... anything that might be you know darker scary\nIt's so interesting because um you know everybody has their views and their opinions and and uh you know and and everything but I just um I just remember as a kid loving that it was\nIt was like a fun scary and it was you know creepy and like I said again you know black lights and the\nUh we were um and I grew up in Louisville, Kentucky and one of the local radio stations that ... W. H. A.

M. F. um correlates with with ah with ghost siting there was a guy named Michael person you're a who tried to do some stuff with something called the got home it\nUh and that wasn't really replicated and so there's lots of pseudo science and sort of want to be science\nOr in goes hunting and that's one thing that frustrates me because I think those are cool [laughter] I think ... awesome\nIf they're real and I want to I Want to be able to find them improve them but I just don't see I don't see good quality research going on and that's one of the reasons I wrote the book\nAnd and I don't want to you know we can talk about this forever but just for time's sake I Want to ask you what do you think those are I mean you think they're cool but why why why what is it\nWell you know um I I don't know it goes or I mean that that's you know of course that's the million dollar question right I mean you even even among the the ghost hunter unbelievers are across the board there's no there's no single answer right some people leave their residual events that are\nYou know the stone tape theory that there is something that's going on and\nIt was some murder murder tragedy that was recorded in stone in ... the the three played other people think that goes for in a dimensional beings\nOther people say that they're you know the spirit that that have gone on\nAnd and the very fact that there is such a diverse range of opinions is problematic for ghost research right because goats can't be both inner dimensional spirits\nAnd you know a an emotional recording into a tree or a house of murder and you know there's the dead\nSo so ... if you have a phenomena has such a widely disparate range of explanations that's a problem so I I don't know what ghosts are obviously they're not they have been Scientifically Proven I think that that my my best guess if they're real would be basically a folklore Rick\nExplanation that would be there some sort of spiritual but that that we were we're seeing that they want to communicate with us for some reason\nMm good stuff for windows for Willis weaned so thank you for hitting his information\nYou have in fact that I Know you have a whole lot more that we can go to you but uh coming up we're going to be talking they werewolf in London so you'll want to stick around Benjamin 'cause all Sinclair he's somebody you want to me out in the case in time\nDefinitely thank you yeah yeah I Will tell us where we can find you and I get more information\nAnd yeah you can find me I'm On Facebook or ...

we were just talking previously was all about the uh werewolf that we've seen holding something\nAnd if you go to the site you'll see featured a these sketches DePaul did by the way he's an artist as well and just just when you see when you see it coming to life\nWell someone you know drawn it it's a it really adds so much to the story from the witnesses now POM Wonderful artist uh sketching that you did I Know\nThat you're an artist as well and a former carpenter and so now what you do is you like to ... year retired in you enjoy going and checking out all these mysteries correct\nYup yup yup I'm listening wondering about that I was actually wondering about the accounts I've never seen counts really run like\nA ... you know that that is the story I mean the the ...\n... ... this cattle grazing it's looks along with it being the old so to lake but around much in the sediments and everything is produced sort of fertile ground very fertile ground but yeah I don't think that's why the cows and not race officers in it you know the\nFirst thing in the Nineteen seventies once again now spoke to this guy numerous times and recorded it sightseeing\nOr you know and he did it a bit of poaching in the Nineteen seventies you know catching has and Robin since I've been seeing woods and places that he shouldn't have been on private land\nAnd um it was a place called Fox ... in written Dale which is eight miles from flicks them and he still lives in ... I mean it's an interesting story is that did you ... it was with a friend said no to for the past week or two weeks that\nSomething was ripping the prey out to be snazzy with my roommates net to catch the rub it in the head and the other game small game\nAnd he's ... he's ... so it's a ... born and bred in his words pretty ... as\nYou said but we couldn't sort of what he was he said we just couldn't understand what was doing it you said there was still a bit of snow on the ground you could see such a rose or they ... as he looking over towards the uh the the open fields and he's on the edge of folks ... with us it's friend who was doing the poaching in the daytime\nSome of the lodge hedge hole forms and things about he said he probably eight to ten foot tall and he ... he took a turn round to speak to his friend and call the ... thing and he's peripheral vision and then looked and saw it\nOn the left over the head which he said what he thought he was a U hauls he meant horse so ... H O the blessing to the only one of your also just\nSuck ... believe what I was looking out so ... what we're saying is this thing was as big as a small pony or you you know your horse\nHe said the interesting thing was he left over the edge and just landed he said wait expert to host to London move forward because the momentum this thing just one that I'm stuck like a magnet sudden something not to look at that\nYou suddenly it was the most peculiar thing he'd ever seen he said he led them before you run away he said what he was on all fours\nAnd he said if it to the store do piece of there being over seven foot and looked like a body builder he said he I Know he said he was a tiny waist and the main like a lion in the face of the ... of about boom\nAnd ... and he said he ... he was almost sort of Britain tilling cooler you know like a box that dog all the stuff that you both terriers\nAnd not what he ... he says well he said I went on to the edge off to them to try and get stiff it's just to protect myself he says although there's nothing we could have done if this thing I decided they were going to come across to us they said the speed it covered\nCrossing the field and into the world\nBut what quite incredible um you know that's four miles from the coast all the sightings are quite close to the coast county and if you if you go further down the coast to watch a whole or in the papers probably two years ago there was the beast of bumps and drain that were featured in the u._k. papers quite often\nAnd this was such a supposed to be aware of that was such a ... going the bombs to train rooms into the sea six miles from where I'm ... now so we got this where we'll type creature reported but moving along the coast and they could go further up the coast you go\n[noise] oh folklore don't let your own legends of dogs with glowing red eyes the pocket the ravens got swept up and you know they started to come down looking I'm Down in time but I think this grains of truth in the story\nSo that was the right thing in the Nineteen seventies and they lived in all his life and it never seen it is never seen it\nBefore that I'd never seen it after that which is\nQuite incredible if this thing I Believe his story thing was to that you would think that they'd be more than somebody so why are we only think smoke glimpses of it Kony was intimate\nYeah and
