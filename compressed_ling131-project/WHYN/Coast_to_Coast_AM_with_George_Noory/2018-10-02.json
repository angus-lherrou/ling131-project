Seventeen of Seventeen Ninety two [noise] and so not yet but in the o five years\nIt's the morning of November the eighth and that's going to last for almost Thirteen months\nThat is a sort of happy go lucky enthusiastic energy it's certainly good for anyone whose uh son science ... in general the next year or so\nUp by the way when you estimate the retrograde Venus goes retrograde this Friday I just mentioned that you know which could be the day of the vote up or down and Venus is Scorpio and it's a ... I wanted to tell people it's affecting anyone who's born around November second or third of any year\nSo those people are going to get an extra dose of Venus over the next several weeks which is\nFocus on love relationship creative artistry social activities money money management and things like that\nMark why does it feel like this year has gone by so darn sure\nIt does feel that way um well you know part of it\nMight be well one of the things\nThat is happening this is definitely you know how the media is always there ... there may is because of what's happening with with the president with the tweeting and all the information\nAnd so from the political realm it when people like yourself or myself people who are you know tuning into news reports a need to do it for work\nOne of the things that's so weird there's so many events are happening much more so that they are being reported like Lincoln split hour after hour\nAnd I think that you know people are tired of it and they're exhausted and then we've had like this whole thing about social networking we're you know millions of people like their their passwords here and there\nAnd so it's kind of like a revolution every single day somewhere and I think that that's making the time go a little faster or maybe we want to make make it go faster to get away from some of the ... the weird problem\nCan you chart out astrological you know you were with me are back in July and you're always poppy on New Year's day with us right can you chat to chart the rush to the year for someone in the beginning of the year\n[noise] yeah well it's an interesting thing New Years in particular is very powerful I mean you could even do today it's October one\nAnd you could in general I mean these things are not usually done you could take a look at the whole month of November by looking at midnight in in the nation's capital here or wherever the capital is of a particular country and do a truck for that moment now the big one is New Year's at midnight all around the world because\nAll be on the air with everybody\nWell yeah and what's interesting is at midnight everywhere around the world lever is always a rising\nAnd the son is in Capricorn at the bottom of the chart because it's midnight and so there you have to feed and all the other planets like for instance midnight New Year's coming up on two thousand Nineteen the sun and Saturn are coming into a conjunction and Mars is going to enter its home sign of areas\nWhich doesn't actually look all that wonderful for the planet because Mars the traditional planet of war will go into its own sign actually laid on ...\nNumber thirty one and then the son of Saturn are together now there can be positive things like maybe for sports with with Mars\nAnd um exercise and engineering and different kinds of projects that are more martial but suddenly Saturn at the beginning of the year is often you know too many frustrations a lot of block coming in but I guess it's going to be a testing year two thousand Nineteen for the world\nWhy does it work mark why does astrology war\nOkay because here's what's happening it isn't that the planets were throwing down raise this is what the old idea exactly and why scientists would say you believe in that foolishness the pseudo science mumbo jumbo\nIt inside of us okay so in other words\nIf everything depends on something being born at a moment of time like with the person baby it's when you take your first breath it's not coming out of the womb\nIf the village of course still tight it's when that's why you know we've got to make the baby cry to make sure we know that three of them taking in the first breath like the declaration of independence is usually use for the America's Choice because it was a first breath were were thing gets wedding when we're independent of you were being born okay this is our beginning\nNow not every astrologer works with that chart but most of them do\nSo the reason it works is that wherever the sun is the moon and the various planet it's not that they're making things happen from outer space\nIt's that whatever is born a person\nA president take an oath of office you buy a new car you get a new job\nYou do if you have the time uh that that happened you put everything into the horoscope and then you can attempt to interpret what is that saying about the potential of my work at this job being the president of the United states or baby being born\nOr with mark Lerner the astrologers website the new one great bear enterprises dot com we've got linked up for U.S Coast to coast am dot com when we come back in a moment we will take your phone calls and he'll do some personal astrological readings for you what do you need from people mark when they call you\nWill fundamentally month they in near earth if they know the time we can try and put that in and or wherever they were born\nDoes the time make it more accurate or you\nWell look I could if somebody said to me I Know when I'm bored ... you know what I don't have the time I Know the town or city actually month and year I could do anything for that person not as exactly ... do it\nBecause timing allows us all kinds of things the sunrise birth is is it near noon his son said is it a midnight we're or the planets falling at that point because in twenty four hours most of the planet are going to be in the ... they're going to be in the same lines but the moon can change a lot and twenty four hours it can go half of the time\nAnd so the moon has a lot to do with our instincts or mood even reincarnation and looking back who may have been or the qualities were bringing in this lifetime moon has what to do with personality the sun is more of a character and kind of a life force\nAnd a connection a little bit more just spirituality but the so polarizing find which was sunrise in the east\nThat is the window to the world kind of on the highest level of or spirituality\nIn and tell me this march since you've been doing this we have thirty seconds before the break your what has been the most satisfying thing you've done\nEver you know isn't this field well unfortunately I well there's two things I'm studying the chart for when President Kennedy died okay 'cause I learned so much about astrology and I was there well I wasn't Thirteen I was there to

one year was kind of like my graduate school where I was twenty two I was studying metaphysics people like Rudolph Steiner George grungy of uh uh spend ski ... the Alice Bailey teachings and so on\n'em and I found my mentor Dane Rhodes who are who is one of the great astrologers of twentieth century and he had studied not just the strategy but philosophy psychology and metaphysics of sauce

his birth Pisces was exactly at the same spot where mine was and I knew what his chart was and when I started reading this book that you asked me about psychic was as if I could hear his voice\nIn my

was it that got you interested in it and then something happened\nUm I started going medical uh to Columbia University my dad had been doctor he got sick at one point I didn't know what it was going to do I could have\nStudied medicine in college at Michigan State I didn't do it I was into ah all kinds of things like social science and he got ill and I thought well maybe I'll take chemistry physics I'll take all the prerequisites I went to Columbia University [noise]\nUh this is part of the psychic weird thing that you asked me about so it's the first date or the first day of chemistry class I'm living in the borough of queens where Donald Trump was born I go home\nAnd just before getting home I stopped in the book store and I find my first astrology book which I mentioned TV for astrology the space age science and it's all about people like Isaac Newton Galileo ... all of these great physicist and all these people had studied\nA more of astronomy telescopes ballet or and so on they were all astrologers but when the biographers would write about the is fantastic people they'd say oh by the way they had one fault they were all went to the phony thing of astrology because they're they're biographers just thought it was\nFoolish and wasteful and they couldn't understand you know why why was the greatest scientist before noon sir Isaac\nNewton studying astrology now how could that possibly be what what's wrong with the guy with what they didn't realize is who is a science it was taught in the universe is if Europe a thousand years ago and it goes way back to all these great ... nations Persia Egypt Rome\n... you know all over the world the ancient world and it was even taught in the universe is if you're of\nI'm going to make your work this hour mark so let's go under the calls we will pick it up by going to Bob in New Jersey hears Bob's burned the December twenty nine Nineteen fifty seven twelve twenty nine Nineteen fifty seven okay more than one forty two in the afternoon\nIn Jersey City now do you when you you want to know the city they were born in or do you want to know exactly the place they were born well\nThat helps I mean just what you just said you know I'm a what I'm doing is just for people out there are not putting on my head I'm actually type it into a computer [noise] and believe it or not I'm able to to get that information pretty quick in\nAnd you want them to ask you a question\nUm if they want I mean ah if they can say to you and say I'm interested in this era of my life and then I'll just see what I can\nTell them and we're going to Bob in New Jersey Hi, Bob\nYou're\nGood welcome to the program turn your radio down a little bit okay yeah I did that you know can't grade you you're on with mark learner I've given mark you burn a day to you know your time go ahead mark\nOkay well if he's if he's not asking a particular question what I can say ah of course this individual is born with a Capricorn son and an areas moon\nAnd tourist rising and he's born very close to a first quarter of ... um ... as I said earlier on the other side of the hour\nPeople don't often study their moon enough because the moon has a lot to do with who we are instinctively so with an areas moon\nComing from other lives and like instinctual early this individual had a lot of\nAssertiveness and forceful illness and kind of an aggressive personality and that's important for him to sort of live his life on a on a deep level where he he has leadership qualities developed in another ... particularly in the last life\nAnd now with the sun and Capricorn it's kind of to refine that not to be brash but the sort of\nDo things more um grounded more practically in order to sort of rise of the heights and the planet Saturn which rules Capricorn is in the process of Criss crossing over this individual son so it's an extra kind of\nA this year and the and coming into the fall of discipline responsibility being focused and he should be make sure he's strengthens his immune system and stays healthy that um he doesn't become pessimistic about things\nUm but he's also heading for um if he wants to develop this an another career cycle of the next several years as long as he stays healthy and focused and a has a good attitude about things\nYou have a question to\nUh yeah what what if I'm not healthy now [laughter] well if you're not held on now\nAgain you want to kind of like um well my feeling is that people should\nStudy things like use your intuition if need be go to a used bookstore you're you're on the show tonight there's a reason why you got on and other people didn't get it on um go to our website see some of the you know read about my life the books the philosophies and so on and get into something like that philosophy metaphysics\nAstrology the power of numbers in neurology is connected to astrology as well and find something that you can kind of a deep yourself in for a while and that can make you accept inwardly excited and then maybe your health we'll get better\nThanks Bob good luck to you and everything you do would you believe in reincarnation mark\nAbsolutely and I study that longer than this and that's part of the whole psychic thing\nWe're all psychic world intuitive and we all live many lives now people are different levels so to speak I guess uh how it would work out of why we would see like an Einstein or gundy are different people and mother Theresa [noise]\nYou know how many times people have been around and when you study spiritual things and there was a whole field of esoteric astrology there's a whole other kind of idea like in the Casey Casey predictions I Know you've got a lot of people on we'll talk about the ... trains and Edgar Casey\nThere was a whole sort of spiritual science about humanity being part of the solar system like we're not just on earth I mean we live in the solar system we live in the galaxy we just don't live there physically but spiritually when we're asleep\nPsychic lead people who ... who can meditate and sort of leave their bodies you know Asheville traveling that kind of thing looser dreaming where are we were somewhere else\nSo that's all part of things and definitely that there are multiple lifetimes than I Do believe very strongly that we're all spirits and souls and\nOur incarnations like in the chart we're looking at ... like I said the spiritual kind of genetic code of water a game plan of higher destiny is as a spirit or sold to accomplish something with the sun moon and the planets and the configuration that we have\nWe're under a marine reincarnation astrological you speaking you were they born the let's let's say the reincarnated person and the person before that well were they born during the same time period\nNo no no ... ... ... there's a whole question about that kind of thing you know people might in the old days I mean a lot of people thought people would reincarnate slowly like maybe once every century or once every couple of centuries or whatever it is according to\nThe spiritual material I ever had my life\nCertain souls or spirits who are doing work like the work that you do okay light work are kind of work at this stage in twenty first century\nMight come back more quickly now everything depends on getting a body from fellow man and a woman that really being able to come into the world Eleanor suspicious time to take advantage of astrological vibrations they're to me absolutely in other words the sold the spirit comes in and chooses\nParents have family based on family karma Dharma that kind of a thing and then you're actually choosing when to be born because there are spiritual forces angels teachers masters whoever you want to call it\nI Know you have a lot of people talk about that stuff hoard guiding and bringing in that entity and then you have your own guardian angel with you throughout your whole life I'm a firm believer and all of those things\nExcellent let's go on to Cleveland Donna's with us welcome to the program that's my buddy Geraldo Rivera is in Cleveland now Hi Donna\nHi that was born in Cleveland, Ohio okay\nDonna is

I've been seeing a lot to to everybody do a lot of deep study you are definitely in in that camp because then you're going to have a once in a lifetime Pluto\nA movement towards your son and the next like year or two and Saturn which rules Capricorn is heading is already in that sign and Saturn will then contact your son and then between two thousand Nineteen two thousand twenty Jupiter will be there so you're going to have three enormously important influences\nIn the Capricorn part of your chart which is your son sign your character your life force\nKind of a link to hire spirits so what the universe is saying is do some big time study psychology philosophy authors or ... it doesn't have to be a study like that I mean it could be art it could be music anything a hobby a craft an activity though that is deep in significant\nSo that you don't get down on yourself are worried or stressed out and so on then you do have a wonderful moon in Virgo in on the line called the trying which is flowing to your son so being an organizer this is what you you've done in the past efficiency\nOrganization service to other people like possibly other lifetimes where you've been nurse or a doctor or or student or you know a libraries or things like that learning languages from the past so there are some skill sets that you have that are very strong from other allies but the big things next couple of years\nSo it kind of deep seated study and a trading into some kind of mysteries or involvements that like you stay really focused and that you learn a whole lot over the next couple of years\nOkay good luck to your car load next one may fourth Nineteen sixty nine may fourth Nineteen sixty nine or going out to California so who is with us welcome to the program for good\nYeah I think you are my question is about Korea money and should I moved to a different that um when I was born in a city boy\nNo where are you okay ... what's the city how do you spell it awaits city oh okay in Kuwait a scholarship and he's a well I'm just putting six AM here unless\nYou give me another time I'll put around sunrise ... do you know your time birth or know\nAnnoyed okay no problem okay you said money and where what state to live in which they deliver these him Kelly right now okay\nWell first of all there is an even in my Web site it's called global hotspots ... where I Do part of mundane astrology but it's also individuals'\nWe've there's been a science for forty plus years and astrology\nIt was originally called astro Qatar graffiti by a fellow named Jim Lewis who many years ago passed away and it's a it's a wonderful tool but you got to know your time of birth and then we can move around\nFrom like where you're born from Kuwait City to California or New York or somewhere on the planet so understand what's good and what isn't a California is and this is another big thing that people don't realize and astrology\nEvery state of the union as a chart like September nine Eighteen fifty California and to the union as the sun science Virgo state with a with a Scorpio moon\nSo you as a tourist son find tourists\nThat's an earth fine and you match pretty well with with California okay so that is a match where you're fine and California's earth fine\nOr good okay you also have a good money aspect in your chart I'm not sure what you should use it for but you have mercury with Vesta which is one of the four main asteroids that says a lot to do with investment\nSo it's not surprising that you would ask that question about what to do something with money investment so there is something that you're supposed to do with all that\nAnd you just have to figure that out the other thing is you have a moon trying to Venus which is another potential money making energy but the big but here is Venus which goes stationery in retrograde on friday\nIn Scorpio is making kind of an unusual Lyme into NATO Venus therefore don't act precipitously okay in in the near future\nUm and because you're ... and it's home signed a Gemini you want to avoid those mercury retrograde times they can be good for review and reflection but you want to learn more about mercury its retrograde the power Venus which is your son find ruler and that will really help you\nMark if there is a planet X. out there in the solar system somewhere will that affect things\nIn fact uh the I have a whole thing about Iraq with which has a five hundred sixty six year cycle which is on said no when President Trump took office it's an article on earth Aquarius news\nIt was very strong at his inauguration it has a whole lot to do with what's been happening over the last year and a half and therefore outer planets even beyond Pluto have are now being used a whole lot just as there are a lot of asteroids and little planets like higher on\nThe truck it's overpopulated that's part of the the complication but you want to use them judiciously are not overwhelmed the chart with a whole lot of them but sometimes they were very significant\nTroop of mark keep in touch with us we'll probably talk with you on a New Year's eve or New Year's day to get predictions for two thousand

I walked out into the there was a long half mile peer\nOut from the uh belong to the Chesapeake biological laboratory where the protection early meets the Chesapeake Bay and I was sitting there late at night when I saw a large light heading toward me\nThat was coming from the mouth of the Chesapeake\nThen I noticed the outline of a large ditched shaped object which suddenly dove into the water then rose back into the sky and headed straight for me as it flew over me I saw bottom panel open and the UFO spray me with what I called in the book but tux and shower\nMany row straight up and disappeared and frankly the things scare the hell out of me\nAnd then the second citing occurred on April second Nineteen fifty eight I was returning home from Baltimore because I was a student at the Peabody Conservatory of music\nWhen I saw a large white light harboring over a barn and a few minutes later began blinking on and off and followed my car for most of the remaining miles Solomon's

later it would appear at the other hand\nIt does it did this for about half a dozen or so times then stop and then suddenly I saw a brilliant large red light that came out of the sky and merged with the larger light at this point in my car radio admitted allowed screeching Sam\nAs I approached the protection wherever the light cross the river headed headed south and disappeared and then\nUh that

opposite side than a fourth much larger object to approach\nIt seemed to come out of nowhere and it dwarfs the other three UFOs as we watch the large objects began expanding from both ends at once and it quickly rose up into the sky at an estimated what I\nEstimate that about a twenty thousand feet outlet to then they changed too is they'll re desk and disappeared a tremendous speed and the other obvious followed suit and I had all these reports in the night cap and\n... all acknowledge that there are very unfair\nNineteen fifty eight we didn't have any aircraft that could do that ...
