I'll tell you what I said about it at the time that it could have come straight out of the White House press office now\nDo you have a copy of that letter and if you do what you read it to us please [noise]\nUh or have I caught you by surprise that\nJust a matter of reaching across here\nOkay well I figured somewhere you'd have that\nI'm I'll tell you what I'll tell you know I mean\nLet me read it I have it right [noise] maybe I should look at the table of contents\nAnd and I'll tell you what this is a good place fine I'll take a break it's that important I'll just give you a couple of minutes to find that my daughter you got it yeah go\nI made mistakes from ignorance inexperience noble work I did not knowingly violate any law or standard of conduct no one in the White House to my knowledge violated any law or standard of conduct\nIncluding any action in the travel often there was no intent to benefit any individual with specific group\nThe FBI lied and they report to the Eighteen\nThe press is covering up the legal benefits they receive from the travel off\nThe GOP has lied and misrepresented the knowledge and its role uncovered a prior investigation the ushers office plotted to have a professor costs incurred taking advantage cocky an HR the public will never believe the innocence of the Clinton\nAnd they're loyal staff the wall Street Journal editorial editors live without consequences\nI was not meant for the job where the spotlight public life and want to hear ruining people it's competitive sport\nAnd that's it that's it\nThe part that really grabbed me was they I it just in a suicide note it I don't think you would say the public would never believe the innocence of the Clintons well\nIt was interesting missed often said you know he said any time you have a note that suddenly appears when they need to be such a duck and then it seemingly benefits someone\nIt's just the immediate cause for concern\nAnd of course here you have so many destroying the state and federal all the experts bleep it the statement had been taken from other documents that he can ... maybe had Britain and other contact and had been put together\nA good word you will always try to imitate known writing\nSummers and they're trying to port well of course of course so you what\nWhy the letter doesn't mention suicide or death because it's been foster apparently didn't right I'm going to kill myself for good by world\nAnd yet that sounded like kind of a summary note nevertheless I mean some are rising everything to this point and with some something in mind without having said suicide it did sound kind of final summation of the sale year or however you want to look at it\nAt the press conflict there were a number of reporters the number of TV networks I don't think that ran on any of the television network\nWill there we've come to a very interesting question now Reuters ran the story\nYou had been ... to me all day long there's a lot of excitement up about it out their writers ran the story you say the networks were their\nCBS and NBC\nOh really yeah how could they possibly ignore evidence of this sort I mean I guess CBS to choose to ignore it or protecting its sixty minutes division\nBut what about the other is and what about the Associated Press and what I Want you know I mean those are the press\nThe major news outlet the country and they didn't send a reporter\nAnd then they got a copy of the report and they said they were going to do a whole new story or at least dispatch I mean here Reuters did a major dispatch twice the length that they usually do on these type of story\nAnd the a P uh editors for Washington were telling people yeah we're going to do a story and it ends up they do what the classic bury the story or they save us to to paragraph literally at the end of a long story on white water hearing but nobody's interested in Washington\nA panel of experts has declared that the foster noted suicide the government ten rather live blah blah blah\nBut this is now the middle of three international forensic experts and they're saying apparently now you tell me without qualification it's a forgery how do they come to that and okay\nWell before they even get to the issue of forgery and they're also saying that the FBI and the park police totally mishandled that that nowhere and forensic examination do you ever come here a note like that or any note to one document\nTo make it certification which is exactly what park police and the FBI did\nFor the big question mark is why did they ban the normal procedure and I quote in my article but you have the FBI crime lab assistant director and be on the head of the question document unit at the bureau thank you know you want in a minimum of ten documents\nWell the only they was funny that you know the ... yeah the crime\nLab as as we all know is now under close scrutiny there's going to be an international a panel put together to look into the FBI crime lab\nWell who knows they may be a lot of crime going on there [laughter]\nWell sticking with the note for a second the declaration than it is a forgery he is a blockbuster I mean if that's a forgery then the whole damn thing comes apart\nWell there's a couple of reasons why first of all the with the great quotes but the ... because the note is found in a briefcase search the police that that they were ... the fact that that brief case searched twice and with empathy enough outlook that\nSecond it um\nBenefited or people at the White House then took the owners thought proven that was the third was born\nAnd apparently the experts at any time you have a document question document that is Loren mutilated crumpled something build on it it is often times an effort to make it come Paris and\nDifficult difficult sure\nDo already you have a primary ... at the English experts at a physician then you look at the no\nAnd the first of all the don't if you look at the no which we have a photocopy if we had a huge blow up a right and comparing you can see that they did not match that the way the stroke structures are done the flow the slant\nOf the letter is not the fame\nSo then from a clear handwriting expertise point of view which is a good science it's a forgery\nWell it is a forgery and the other thing is what they were able to show in large blow up was that certain letters like when you write a letter let's say to let her be right you might only write that letter lower case B with one stroke start at the top go down at the bottom\nYou've rounded out and then the last stroke is going over the next letter the end of the stroke\nBut ... born here will not do it that way he'll write the line down he'll stop the stroke it might take the bow of the letter B. and start from the top of bringing around\nAnd you can see that from a large blow up and that's what they were able to show that the letter be for example um was done in three stroke structured intro\nUnlike officer who had a very tenuous Yankee style of writing uh-huh what she's saying oh we had a dolphin document that we compare to three different for\nA very very clear that we ah that that that they were ... you didn't match\nYou know uh this is starting to get very dangerous for some people Chris at this point like you\nLike me like anybody who's got anything to do is saying what we're saying right now\nBut this has got to lead it's got to lead to the next step and so you're asking a couple of things aren't you you want based on this report you want more coverage you want\nDo you view the coast to coast too young\n[noise] do you still think too that the way things are going up the global leach do want to dominate the planet and that they might succeed\nWell I think they did dominate

people have that or an elite animals all the ... ball or the people that have ruled the earth to cool they didn't like that so for two hundred and forty two years\nThey've been trying to get it back

Chris you there\nYes I Am really good\nChris this really is a blockbuster I mean this is uh to me as you said earlier this makes Watergate hailed by comparison there you're talking about a third rate burglary for some nefarious political purpose\nHere you might be talking about it the least obstruction of justice in the body was moved and the story was manufactured\nOr murder\nRap whatever it is it doesn't it even or even if justice with bird and the FBI didn't use their proper procedures and investigating myth park belief used an examiner certify the document\nThat that never ah with certify the handwriting expert uh\nSo obviously no one really cared to properly investigated that Mr ... one of the experts formerly with the New York city police department was on the house committee for assassination\nHe was the one that tech theater found the palm prints of Lee Harvey Oswald on the rifle but uh he is an expert in the late fingerprint a note was torn for the audience and the reporters today it's twenty eight pieces and and\nThey were shown how many fingers had to come in contact with different piece of paper Mr ... said his statement that this is consistent the fact that they had no fingerprint for only impression bumped need papers it consistent with the person who tore it having on gloved\n[noise] [laughter] [noise] so it's a forgery so we've got a gigantic stories so the Associated Press now you've you've me what you can I knew this is touchy territory Chris letter\nWhile the eight paint today promised a number of people that call on the media world here in in Washington announced where that they were going to do a dispatch may have been you know a short story but it would be a story\nPublished a story this Sunday was and carried on the a P I Wonder why\nAbout a witness that was important Marcy on the night foster died he came in he was the first one to spot forced his car and he told the FBI and the park police that there was a Hispanic man sitting next to last his car watching it a menacing him with very menacing looks followed him at the urine edited the park\nAnd this um witness lap immediately um the park police never went and visited him to interview him they spelled his name wrong in the police report\nOr when the FBI visited with him the FBI civil who was this man that gave you manage thing look it's a Mexican American man\nAnd the FBI interview statement states very clearly that the witness was unable to identify would be unable to identify in a line up or a composite sketch who this man what well\nThere it is in the London telegraph this Sunday a composite sketch all the man he saw the park the FBI out and out lie in New report\nOut this would maybe be a mistake if it happened one when we have so many instances in this case you know there were two witnesses later in the park it sought to man and then around ... car they set it on the record one guy was standing with long blond hair in front of false does harm to but the hood up\nJust before the body was that\nAll right look Chris you're pushing this one to the edge and ah you're beginning to now camp you know even in other words if the worst case scenario is true\nOh which seems now more likely than ever to me based on the forgery saying then you're tampering with forces that have already\nGone an awful long way here and have a ... an awful lot at stake and even though you're a big time reporter\nI'm I'm not convinced that you're safe\nUm well\nRisks involved in anything you do I've taken those risks and will continue to take those risks because the very important story and uh uh you know the trip will have to pull away they may they fall on me that I'll just take that take that the when it comes\nYou know um I take it you've given some amount of sun to do so I mean what was\nSo look if in fact the there was a murder\nI Am one of the prime people behind expose again yeah I guess that's what I'm saying well look and look what\nYou know here Mike Wallace did the teeth and I think I had to you on the last time you know my brother called me up afterwards and for ... you know I've known you your whole life you've always been an honest person you've never won a lot of money never won at the big job on Wall street type person\nAnd I just watch this and that makes you sound like you're a ally or\nBe or Charlotte and trying to make money yeah\nI took a pay cut to continue doing that story\nUm\nSo what do you say I mean how do you how do you argue against that Mike Wallace knew that knew that I'd never reported the foster with left handed a first that with the Boston Globe\nI was going to be held responsible for every era than any paper than ever done in this case um eat only in the Cape to people out there that to look into it\nThat I'm On the right track and only indicates to me I'm On the right track when they have to make such a ... a ... near when Mike Wallace seems almost eighty years old that the dean of American television journalism pass to bring down a thirty year old for reporter that's how old I Am\nAnd try to destroy his reputation\nThat shows\nI'm having an impact\nWell ... if we look at it from the other direction\nThe implication is that I'm not making the charge but the implication is that the administration has control of very large segments of the media and I'm not making that charge but\nYou you could almost begin to believe that could be so because of the Associated Press under reporting because of sixty minutes going after you as they did\nUm and because the news now is so shocking\nThat it just it has to be out there and well it's not so so what does that say I mean if you look at what it says it says a large portion of the media is in bed with the government\nWell or the came media I don't know if everyone came media the leader on sixty minutes elite program you know Don you it has gone on the record producer a minute thing that helped get Cornel what Clinton elected\nAfter the Jennifer Flowers thing that he edited that tape and such a way that he remained recast the Clinton candidate\nUm you know ABC very close association with the ministry of former Clinton campaign advisor or with that and to do for a while recap what a you know\nYou have these these connection the Clinton are not good at governing uh but they're very good at dealing with the

fool\nI Know what could happen\nBut uh if I don't do it then who is going to Chris Reddy doesn't do it then who is going to the Associated Press doesn't do it as they should then who is going to have sixty minutes doesn't do it as they should then who is going to\nSomebody should\nAnd um there are um far\nLess noble things to die for that is what it comes to then I'm exposing the truth or\nSeeing the truth so there you are back to the lines west of the Rockies you're on the air hello\nHow are mourning mourning a you know it's interesting the way the press is covering this thing whether that foster deal when when I was ah in service during ah\nThe ah the breaking of the uh Watergate story uh-huh I was overseas Germany I was reading a European newspapers get more information sure and I was getting out of the magazines that I was describing to\nThere are there are certain similarities in the way the Washington Post had to doggedly pursue under criticism um the story now that is what is happening here now how long is the ... been in this condition I don't know well is it laziness back in\nThose days I think uh you know nobody want to report on what Kennedy was doing a because it was a ... guide to the the spirit of the times in those days was that we leave the president alone the dirty things about the president long ago our way back to to uh\nNot not quite true we leave the the woman I sing or the bruising or the personal things\nYeah out but not this kind of thing\nBut over time the the scrutiny torture public official has a ban hell has has got more and more you know we we kept FDR's wheelchair out of out of uh many people didn't even know he was in a wheelchair and nowadays you know we know what kind of underwear president whereas like like\nWhere they're yeah like we're supposed to chairs around\nBut it was interesting I used to have to give an update to my friends back in the states about what was going on with the Watergate best dish out because I got it out of London paper and I got out of the uh uh English a printed a German newspaper\nI don't know what else you do with this look you don't ignore it that's all you don't ignore it I I guess maybe according to a lot of the reports on getting the Associated Press may have switched off their phones or they may be so overloaded that you know who knows I Hope it's true\nYeah this whole thing just thanked pretty badly it has for the whole time or have\nHad quite an air to quite there's too many unanswered thanks now who bumped into Princeton [laughter] ah there's just I guess at the age of unanswered questions like who was it that bumped on the back of ... will always be the unanswered question you know and who was that a late that's foster out with no blood\nYou know it's almost tiresome sir and nobody wants to see another presidency falter and sale\nYou know as Nixon did nobody wants nobody wants that for American nobody in their right mind could want that and I know on clay feet I Know this is going to be seen as art bell or Chris Ruddy are both\nYou know going after Clinton with an agenda but damn it that is not what this is about\nNow it's not about that at all I I understand it's not about that at all but but we you know as I'm pleasantly as this tasteful as it is if it's something that needs to be dealt with it is something that needs to be dealt with\nWell Americans have got to sit down and have a conversation I think after something like this with themselves and say are we still Americans really\nHad flown down to LA to ticket\nCan can remove the powder\nAnd we put out like yes so did you hear about that no economic\nCalled toll free one eight hundred six one eight eight to five five\nAnd he's making a Disney movie\nOh well I'm sure than a ... organization being very sensitive to that sort of thing I'm there will be repercussions but I I was very interesting um\nBut I Can't let me I'll tell you what let me confirmed that story and I'll get it out All right\nYeah All right it's a very interesting guy because me and ...\nWell I I can I I I Will know what their stance would be ma'am thank you let me please investigate that story before I ... a because that is a very a very very serious charge and I'm not down in your word or but should you be wrong about something like that\nOr there would be very serious a legal repercussions\nSo let me find out about that\nUh but uh even if true or is it is certainly an isolated incident I'm not significant compared to what Chris Ruddy seems to have come up with here\nYou know Charlie's reaction of course I guess I you know I guess it's going to be typical of the liberals\nAnd I guess there is going to be no way no escape\nFrom the accusation that I Am and Chris Ruddy is\nSimply going after this president and maybe it is that the midget liberal mind the myopic mind to the average liberal like Charlie cannot react in any other way\nEven too serious\nOr not mid level but high level forensics expertise that absolutely demands an explanation demands an explanation and they can talk it away by saying that it's um I'm conservative not ball rhetoric\nIt isn't even close Charles ended really reveals a great deal about you as a person that you would approach it that way I Am quite surprised quite surprised first time caller line you're on the air\nI hello ah\nYeah I can barely hear you do you're gonna have to get into the phone and shout out is\nOh okay I'm In here and yes ma'am\nAnd that last night or someone Carter was that the um hay on Bob\n... comment yes right in the head of the ... it did yes ah\nOh I don't think you mentioned that last night but there are\nNo idea I mentioned it on several successive nights\nRight but that you had asked will we get a warning\nI did well wow I mean in in sort of a general way I have yeah sure if a comet where to hit earth would we know about it yeah well\nA on a April twenty third on your program\n... playing one town yes and hear the topic was Catholic\nProfit yes correct\nAnd he said there be or they can no warning with the great act of mercy and now by car would appear and the guy that might have wrote them\nUm well All right thank you it may be ma'am it may be and uh there was interesting you should mention that because of course I'm assuming you heard the facts I read last night about the a piece that broke off which by the way is not\nIn the shape of across or anything like it right now there is a spiral\nAnd that has been noted by recent Hubble photographs a very strange spiral shape to the debris there is a piece that has broken off that is not thirty percent of the comment\nOr somebody worried [laughter]\nIt is a piece that simply is reflecting probably because of the amount of material burning off it you know you take the dirty snowball if that's what it is new break off ... and you got fresh snow and so then that begins to get bright\nThe question the good question is why is it bright at All right down in other words it's out beyond the orbit of Jupiter and whether you're talking about the nucleus of the comet itself or abuse that breaks off\nThere should not be enough energy from the sun to be melting and scattering debris as we are now see\nThat part of it does not make sense and again we will question or Richard ... about that when he's here friday night Saturday morning I don't want you to miss that program friday night Saturday morning he's got a lot to say\nI'm not so much about the common but we will again ask about that because there must be energy to create the burn off that creates the reflected light that we see\nAnd where is that energy coming from east of the Rockies you're on the air hello\nGood morning I'm calling from peeking um uh the lady just call up too long ago yeah about the about the guy produced or directed powder\nAt the true story I've got a copy the store right here by an Associated Press writer uh-huh newspaper to chose them I'm sure the young man picketing in front of the theater or have they\nDon't do me would you do me a big favor yeah would you facts that to me\nI'm not able to because I'm\nAll right I'm than vine let me just ask

past high over our heads while others were falling that our feet the dunes were rapidly evacuated and spectators escape the falling debris and the overwhelming smell\nA parked car over a quarter of a mile from the blast site was talking to one large chunk they passenger compartment literally smash fortunately no human was hit as badly as the car over everyone on the scene was covered with small particles of dead whale\nAs for the success of the effort on the seagulls who are supposed to clean things up we're nowhere in sight either scared away by the explosion or kept away by the smell that didn't really matter the remaining chance we have such a size that no respectable Segal would attempt to tackle anyway as darkness began to set in the highway crews were back\nOn the beach burying

he watched this giant piece of lumber go way\nUp into this kind of look out small and then it just sort of hung their suspended way up in the sky and then he watched it slowly begin to descend like

I I think what was ... I mean I I it's it's it's just it's still very solemn to me that you know the innocent people were hanged who were protesting their innocence\nAnd that the real the people who had confessed to being which is we're originally let out of jail and then it's kind of you if you can test and said yet was really sorry about that then you go but it's the only people said no I'm not going to get this and then I've never been a which\nThose are the people who ended up dying but for the most part I mean there's a large percentage of them in any\nWay you did write that at all at the at the new wants the tragedy of these people who did the right thing you know who stuck out for their believe all the things are told to do in your life\nAnd it ended badly for them um which is why you know Arthur Miller's crucible of such a great works of literature and plays is because he tapped right into that kind of idea that these guys did the right thing and by doing the right thing they ended up at the end of a rope on a hill you know O'Neill America\nWhich the or the end the population you said under about fifty thousand but it balloons up to two hundred and fifty during the\nThe Halloween a ... ... ... a month long festivity of Halloween\nIs is there in Salem is there any other time of year where they they see the kind of bumps like that or is it just it's like it's a I mean I realize that they always kind of getting a steady stream of tourists but as this they're big season this this this October you know these thirty one days or a tumor\nOh mathematically I mean some some ... this is only open in October and can make their whole year in October\nShot up really\nThey've been getting more and more a year round kind of tourist impulse not just for the which stuff but for the maritime stuff they've amazing restaurant scene they have the ninth largest art museum by area in the country so they have like a lot of like kind of you know arrows and their whole started to\nPull a tourist and still happens their biggest one is October which will never go\nWell I Do really I mean that's like a ... there are state fairs that have that right where people open up a booth at a state there they can make their entire year in the weeks that the teacher is open I I Would never guess shops that are just open for one month in in Salem\nYeah but it but the other but what the realizing there's so many tourists coming to say on the court for a year that now they're starting to open longer if you go in the summertime you'll still see the shops are still open you might even feel haunted house open to the monster museum filling in for they're starting to realize that they can do this year round of film grows and becomes more even\nBigger in popular culture than it is now\nWhat's not cool in Salem would it ... or their rules a lake or curbs that they they are either written or unwritten about how people are ... you know ... or to or how they want ... just to be in in Salem\nYeah and they're they're getting better and better at that as figuring that especially like to ... year round you any other time of year there's not that many curb\nBut in October for instance they are the burial ground which is the old seventeenth century um graveyard right in the middle of town there and fail and this year they had to like put a cap on how many people could be in the grave at a time because it was just getting overrun and people were like using the graves as you know picnic table\nAnd climbing on them and doing all kinds of bad stuff to an actual historical artifacts\nThat do that there is on Halloween Night they have a curfew I think it's around ten pm that if you're not inside of a bar inside of a party you couldn't be on the streets for those shoot fireworks in the air to kind of tell people have the nights over ... start heading to the train and start having their cars so there that's\nReally lately at ten pm\nYeah I Believe that the ten pm yeah it it might be a little later maybe eleven but yeah they're trying to set a tip for pushing the hundred thousand people to the train you take some time so by midnight nobody around an al owing a\nIronic did they make everybody get off the streets of Salem before the wishing our\nYeah yeah it was [laughter] it just gets bad [laughter] really that there are they going to get them up\nBefore the ... or maybe that's the real wishing happens after all the tourists Lee J double the locker a in a Edgar Award winning author or thank you so much a season with the which\nThe magic and mayhem Halloween and Salem, Massachusetts is now on my bucket list things do you like I didn't have enough of my bucket [laughter] things that are in every night but I'm checking off one when I go to Ross will in a couple of weeks I'll let you know about that coming up later on in November when I'll be back on Halloween sorry on things\nWhen he won the Green Bay Packers play their first NFL game seven six when over the Minneapolis Marines this week in Nineteen thirty nine NBC\nAnd one of the things I learned that such true crime apart from great reporting is advocacy and proper journalism must stay focused on the facts of a murder and the prosecution of potential murderers\nSo the result is a resistance to the expression of sentiment you know the the or sensationalism emotional manipulation of the accused because that could result\nIn somebody not getting a fair trial this is why this is why journalism stresses terms like alleged and allegedly and how it is choose\nMainstream you know notions of what sensationalism means stories that inflamed the senses right that sensational journalism the kind of news writing that stresses\nEmotions over information risks riling the public uh unnecessarily in it at one point by the way this is a very real day to day\nConcern regarding regarding the power of the press\nOr there was a time in us history not even a hundred years ago when angry mobs would storm a jail and Lynch somebody before a trial ... just like you know the showdown in to kill a Mockingbird or white or black Lynch mob justice is the opposite of the rule of law\nAnd journalism understood its place in keeping the public\nInformed but at the same time call and letting the courts do their work in educating some kind of justice our guest this hour by the way will attest to this because mob rule in lynchings played a key part\nIn the injustices regarding the story of the men from the train\nUp but this is the same reason I Love true crime and bear with me another minute or two where true crime reporting can go where true crime story can tell something\nCrime reporting must not go right true crime is allows for advocacy for justice giving victims of voice\nIt's a central tenet to to crime before death I interviewed I'm a true crime legend and rule about the conventions of great true crime writing\nAn ad rules never one rule was that any true crime story you tell must be victims centric the focus on the acts of the killer or to satisfies the details\nOf somebody's death like a lot of these true crime shows do on TV where it's almost like crime porn right they're really into all the blood and the wounds to a point where it starts to dehumanize the victim I think\nSo I think true crime must always be about justice and on a day when eleven people are dead\nIn a synagogue where they should have been saying the root cause sham and not run for your life or all because of a story seemingly that had been told about\nA Jewish philanthropist George Soros\nWe need to be mindful about this connection between the stories we tell in the unintended consequences that can happen or these victims should burden or national heart for years they will mine when we tell the story of the shooting in Pittsburgh today we must remain victims centric\nJournalist need to be responsible in order to avoid whipping up towards bearing mobs right intent on lynching people accused of crimes but everybody in the media or anybody who uses social media needs to share that same sense of responsibility when it comes to conspiracy theories as well I'm not waiting into a debate\nBut who is responsible for today's mass shooting clearly the majority of the blame rests on the trigger finger of today's shooter\nBut take it from me and my experiences on the radio\nIt's important to be mindful about every thought seed you send out into the world\nThat bears your name because once it hits the wind you'll never know where those thoughts seeds will take root that's what we know to be true there's many other stories in the news this week that attest to that so\nNot everything is a false flag up only a small percentage of such things I've ever happen not everything is die hard to\nNot everything is a conspiracy if everything were conspiracy than we wouldn't have any media about it in fact the media would be focused on what isn't a conspiracy right if everything was a conspiracy that old radio shows built around we don't have a conspiracy around this today\nSo I ask you whenever you talk about murder whenever you talk about\nPeople who you believed to be guilty of some thing stay victims centric in the stories that you tell\nAnd not just about the victims of crimes that have already happened in the case of true crime but stay victims centric about telling stories that could result in the victimization of somebody to come I ask you that in the name of all those people who died today\nSay a prayer for them if you will and and keep that in mind when we talk about the men from the train discovering America's most elusive serial killer that even though the story is over a hundred years old it's still not too late to get justice\nNext an coast to coast

[noise]\n[noise] [noise]\nSo we're talking with Bill James the co author of the men from the train discovering Americans most elusive serial killer I was playing that song sympathy for the devil not for\nThis killer or the one from this morning but just because there's a lot of doubles in running around these days including\nSon devils getting a big win today the kind of fun job so the we were just hated the interrupt you because you were doing such a great job with the explanation about the the similarities between the cases and I I think you were coming up to the end but I I had to cut you off because we had the heartbreak at the bottom of the you know really it was\nGoing to give it up at night because I was going to run out of the things to say but I was able to find him on\nA tight services like ... like a little bit but yeah there for the murder\nBut that that's just like thirty four of them aren't there or something or\nSomething like that they um they uh the crime normally occurred on Sunday night so you just heard on the weekend up until Nineteen ten the crimes almost all occurred in areas in which the primary industry was ball game or one of the primary understood was logging\nThere but but uh until Nineteen oh three Nineteen oh five fingerprints meant nothing I mean the place would be a fan of a crime\nThe fingerprints and blood and it meant nothing to them\nA blood typing was unknown and Eighteen Ninety eight by Nineteen ten by Nineteen twelve but the night and Eighteen\nNinety eight no one knew that there were these for blood groups a B. O. and whatever it if they ah ah the ah by Nineteen twelve people didn't know that uh and and break through his head and I had\nBeen achieved that had been done to make their way into courtrooms but uh it was it was a very slow process and it has a very infant pile stage\nMen from the train discovering America's most elusive serial killer\nTracking this story then required you to go through a lot of newspaper are ... and other things to try to find a lot of these stories which as you point out had been a they had the dots and human conduct connected then so you you may have been the very first person\nThat ever started putting this this case together in this way\nWell yes we were ... except for the end of the the the the last year the last few crimes were connected at the time the public was aware that that what we would now call a serial murder was on the loose\nFrom in Nineteen eleven Nineteen twelve which would rather and killing a lot of people but the earlier crime we what we did was say\nLook this this this murderer is way too experienced to have started this and Nineteen eleven there has to be earlier crime so let's try to find them\nNow getting ordered walking back toward the first crime\nThat's when I got into that nobody had walked it back before you were the first person to go back to the very end and how is it that you are able to determine that first year so successfully\nDumb luck and it is not all of them are empty I had told my daughter that ... if you walk the crimes back\nWhen you when he commits the first crime he will make mistakes\nThat will give away who he is and I told her that because I Know from reading crime books and reading hundreds of crime bucks and very off of a serial murder\nWhen he convinced his first crime reveals who he is but then all of the times he will be ... and seventies he'd be sent to jail for five years and that may be out and start a series of crimes\nAnd he would coverage track so I I guess that that was what was going to happen in this case\n... we were charged fantastically lucky and that is fresh crime happened to occur the the two biggest newspaper towns in the country where New York and Boston\nIs first crime occurred straight west of Boston straight north of New York and because of that both of New York and Boston papers covered in depth\nAnd because of that there's lots and lots of information available about it and it's uncanny it's unbelievable how many points\nThat first murder matches up with\nAgainst the eye out with uh with with all the last last murders and the series so are we\nJust luck I mean we never in a million years expected to be able to find convincingly who was actually doing this but we found a evidence about this man and argued that this is Pam and almost nobody doesn't believe it because it's just there's lots of evidence\nAnd you say you found the arc type crimes for the prototype crushed right he and he modeled he he he perfected that crime then successfully after that\nUm it is is the years went forward and yet ... there was kind of a mixed media rent I mean there's sometimes there were some times over guns involved\nIn all likelihood was carrying a gun all the time after about Nineteen oh five the ah I think that he while he used an axe to commit the murders there are I think three crimes in which the man of the house was shot before he was hit in the head with an axe my belief\nThat he had a pistol stock in his pocket or in his belt or something that he would use it\nSomebody was awake and confronted him but um I think that was not what are you trying to do but it's way would do if you had to do\nTo get back to some of the aspects of these crimes coming up next door but before I Do ... ... ... what did you hope to learn\nAbout the human condition about people about crime what was that you thought you were going to learn when you went into researching and and being the first one to ... all these crimes together to determine you've you've found demand from the train\nThey ... the general answer the question is the crime stories\nAre fascinating to us because they they come from the parts of our of our cell\nThat we don't like to talk about a all crime stories are about lost and greed and anger and hatred and all the things that are a part of you and me I don't know you but\nThey are part of everybody that I've had in the play here knowing and and yet we we don't like to talk about them so we covered them up\nCrime stories expose those parts of ourselves that we are ashamed of the uh uh that's that's the general answer to why I'm obsessive reader crime but by the way at the last book I read was the real crime but with the real world leader\nA it's a book by a ... a\nRabid Weinstein I could have a life name ...\nUh the uh\nI think I just screwed up her name I'm Sorry you know there surely going to be ... and\nAnd one of the things I learned from reading that is the ... or ... or was a an avid reader of crime stories\nUh Charles Dickens we're going to have him at an avid reader of crime stories or a Henry Fielding it it's very common among writers to be avid reader Tolstoy was avid readers of crime stories because the ...\nWhat I just talked about that that they they tell us something about human nature that you do get from a church somewhat but the ... you don't get from\nSports I mean I live in the sports world for the most part that sports world is\nIs about positive people trying to do positive things in general I mean we take a lot of abuse from people who don't understand it but but that is what we are and what we're trying to do with positive people try and do positive things\nSo it is that he spends a lot of his time in the sports world news is talking before the top of the hour but the difference between being in that sort of positive place with very positive energy around people involved doing positive community things and writing demands from the train because he likes to write about crime so do you want to finish that\nYou're you're fading out here and I was not able to hear a lot of them\nAre fading out no Canada that um I was just saying that you are presenting it as sort of a dichotomy of I'm working in the sports world is by day and writing crime at night\nOr the other thing that crime stories are packed into it because they they come from the parts of ourselves that we don't like to talk about and don't normally talk about\nAnd that sort of the man the train I didn't make a deliberate and thoughtful entry into the subject\nI just got hooked ... uh I was I was a documentary about the murders and all this guy called ... living with a ministry it's an extremely well done a documentary far above normal levels of crime documentary\nI was interested in it and it was clear that there was a part of the story that was my thing\nWhich is that it's relatively via ... murders are a part of a series so I started going to put an hour and to and to trying to learn more about the series but the the our became a week the week actually became\nFive or six years or so but I didn't I didn't decide to get into it I just wandered into it\nYou know it shows you a ... you can do you consider this a true crime book\nSure yeah\nYeah you know and that's the interesting piece too is that true crime you know the tradition for true crime is I discovered in in my research goes all the way back to execution sermons right sort of shares a similar DNA with American journalism\nUm except that in the case of true crime you know it was the it was the preachers who's the circuit riding preachers the ministers that would come to these towns in on the day of somebody's execution and they would do a sermon just before the execution\nThat would try to provide the context for why this person was being executed\nIn wide the community overall would benefit from his or her death\nAnd it became became an important part of trying to understand executions in America and and this is where when the preachers decided there they used to just print up their sermons and people would snap them up and then he thought well heck this all just sell it for a nickel\nAnd so they started to sell their execution sermons and then they would get passed around in these became some of the early bestselling\nTrue crime narratives it it it just feels the same function is what you're doing in in demand from the tree and you're trying to bring in it even though it's a hundred plus years later\nIn some cases you're trying to bring a kind of um a a a kind of healing anyway I'm not that anybody is still alive that was directly involved but for these communities maybe this this lingering sense of some tragedy that it happened\nMaybe some closure I'm On a new exactly what happened to their town and how the town was involved are not involved in in the the deaths of of somebody that at one point you know were popular members of the community\nUm [noise] there were things that happened just a few weeks ago I actually got a letter from a man in London england\nWho ah was a a a great great\nAunt had been was one of the victims of the crime Internet here always believed that uh uh the man who ah was accused of murder and was locked up without any evidence for two years before he was really\nBelieve that he had gotten away with it and he said that reading it in my book bag and our book\nThat uh um it wasn't that was not actually what had happened was just a tremendous relief to it\nYeah it was that was a shock to me I hadn't thought about it but it was it was a ... he said he was a tremendously relieved to realize that it was just a a random crime and that this Manhattan actually that that Manhattan actually gotten away with it was this other fellow\nI I don't know why it was important to him to go out I understand the understanding that sense it was important to have to know what had happened\nBut you know one guy getting away with it or another guy getting away with it and punished I I I don't know that there's a lot of different\nBut it still didn't have that reaction to it\n[noise] yeah I think I could go ahead go ahead no please no a lot of the book and a lot of what\nBook is about is is that all all books all good books are search for understanding and a lot of the book is is trying to get people to understand the America\nIn which these crimes occurred they hurt a hundred years ago and ah I grew up in a small town very much like the crimes that these that these murders occur to him and I grew up in them fifty sixty years ago so it's ... it's sort of equal distance from me and them\nAnd that's one reason that the story was powerful to me\nBut I Am trying to get people to understand what what the criminal justice system was like how fantastically primitive it was one of the ... or what how people live that they they lived rich meaningful live a ... ...\nIn urban areas today think of people who lived in small towns a hundred years ago or often think of people who lived in small towns a hundred years ago I was living in these boring lives which nothing ever happened\nTo all of the things that happened to you and me and people in our lives happened to people in small towns I mean they they\nThey got married they fell in love and got married and they got divorced and they started careers and got promoted and got fired they moved and they went on long trips and brought back souvenirs they they had entertainment so they went to literally every night all of the things that that\nHappened ... who happened to us happened to them uh and I was trying to\nCreate a a picture\nUnfortunately it is a picture of their death\nSo that's a terrible picture because they died terrible Beth I'd also is trying to create a picture of how they live and and and give the reader or a an understanding of what it was like to be in America and in a small town or a hundred years ago\nAnd I think he did that very effectively in fact I think the change of the interesting things about true crime in general is that just the focus can be on things which\n... ... ... the inverted pyramid of journalism and you can spend a lot more time on the things which are less important to telling the story\nIn proper journalism you can spend a lot more time talking about\nThe atmosphere of the tone for the um the things that people age or the way the houses were constructed communities were laid out you can you can do that in and it brings up a fresh context\nTo these murders um you know as opposed to the traditional way that the crimes are covered in in St story telling and a journalism context I didn't really like what you were doing especially when you were getting into the fabric of these communities\nThey are and then there's ... there's what is it that always sticks with me that illustrate the point you were just ... and that has to do with the the soccer in the cases taco invented that it uh one of them I think it would suck co ... had an alibi for the time of one of the crimes one of the crime was committed on December twenty four\nOf I think Nineteen Nineteen Nineteen Eighteen and he had a um a he had a witnesses who said that on that particular day he was delivering\nA to his neighbors and an Italian community um a\nPickle deal because pickled deals were a delicacy that we're eating on Christmas Day\nAnd there were there was but there was conflicting testimony that said no no no that couldn't have been done on December twenty fourth because\nYou're never buy the pickle deals on December on Christmas Eve you have to buy them on December twenty second or something so that you have time to prepare them and put them in on on ice for a couple of days before you eat them\nThe a ... it's a it's a tiny detail that you would right now or never survive I mean he would never know that that was true of Italian or the way that tell you an American communities lived a hundred years ago\nExcept that it's important in\nA crime story and that is what kinds of stories are there are these little there's a flash of light that illuminates the details\nOf uh uh or something that would otherwise be totally forgotten\nYou know I think that brings us very effectively ... Iowa I'm ended the crime story which as you pointed out earlier is the one that starts to\nTo give away um ... the communities are already catching on at this point to the fact that there's a killer on the railway\nTickets tickets through what happened in ...\nOn on the night of a gym nine Nineteen twelve oh the lights were out in Alaska due to a um\nCommunity where that happened now the people that area's still remember it still they they could tell yeah oh that's a house right there um but it still it has not forgotten or many places\nMany places where these crimes occurred it was so long ago that it's totally and absolutely forgotten but in some of the ... still quite well remember\nSo I Want it you know I'm I'm going to make a sacrifice you because it was really hoping to finish the book before the interview\nBut I really want to get to the part about how you think you live narrowed down this suspect so let's let's go through that [noise] let's go through that process Ninety victims [noise]\nStarting in the late Nineteen century going up to the early twentieth century of one men the men and the train [noise] does he have a name [noise] next coast to coast am this is Ian punted [noise]\n\n[noise] three years ago making a murderer became less a TV show then a force\nOf nature and uncovered a grave injustice in the criminal justice and it was also completely dishonest and I would know I'm Dan O'Donnell I covered this Steven Avery and Brendan down the trials and now they're making a murderer is back I Am too with part two of rebuilding a murderer\nMounting a murderer is now on the ...

[noise]\n[noise]\n[noise]\nBill James the co author of the men from the train to research with his daughter Rachel McCarthy James and by the way when I read more carefully on the back cover it does say that she lives with her husband not you [laughter] so sorry I got the wrong\nUm but you should be very proud of the work that you all did together not every father daughter team can do that kind of thing\nOr you looked at these ah you looked at these murders and you put them in these different pockets you know the percentage that you believed were clearly done by the mentioned the train and then there's others that might be likely that he did but you could prove that\nThat we we we have a tendency to replicate um circumstances that are defining experiences in our life because that's how we know ourselves best [noise]\nSo somebody who may have grown up in a very dysfunctional household tends to cleave toward dysfunctional relationships not to the opposite direction but they know who they are in a dysfunctional relationship to know how to act and so they keep re creating that until they break the habit\nI'm so fractals theory often and explain whether it's your greatest moment you know like you and\nYou said you know somebody from being destroyed and the fire so you become a fireman so that you can spend the rest of your life replicating your greatest moment kind of thing so I Wonder what this this guy Paul Miller was trying to replicate\nBy recreating the circumstances all along the various realism of America\nWell ... that there is something odd about him the uh that he he was not terribly young he was believed to be about thirty five when the first crime occurred but I Believe that exactly what you just said that that that that first crime was\nA his secret it was it was the most thrilling and the most exciting thing that ever happened to him and that he was simply recreating at the ah ah again and again and again with more\nSome variation but more specimens specificity ... along\nSo that you know the ... the early patterns or not that type but the\nThe later patterns get closer and closer to the first crime it's exactly what you're so what are you saying that that that's who he was that that's a that's how he knew him so I I don't doubt that Mr ... had been the victim of terrible abuses young person\nOr he was a it was an odd looking man he he uh\nHe had tiny widely spaced tea or he was not clean and I don't doubt that as a consequence of this odd look\nAnd here that he had suffered terrible abuse and it's a terrible abuse replicated itself in his anger and his outrage is not that is in any sense of justification for what he did it but I don't doubt that that was true of him\nYou know the the pedophilia ... or ... especially abusing decorum if that's what happened\nUm speaks to the age in which he might have been sort of frozen emotionally\nWhich makes me wonder whether and I'm sure you've done this ... been committing similar crimes in Germany which forced him to go into the navy which forced him to you know just an barking income to the United states\nWell I don't know and and you know there is speculation in the book because a lot of things we don't know about in your view you can have no after you going to speculate of answers up here I wouldn't speculate that he had never killed anyone before he killed the uh the Newt and family and then in Eighteen Ninety eight\nI I Would I wouldn't I don't I doubt they'd ever killed anyone before that because there's an obvious lack of planning and I'm preparation for the of at ... I don't doubt that he had\nCommitted pieces of the same crime earlier I don't I was very much would suspect that he had been\nAdding inappropriate interactions with young girls that he had a\nA while you have if you had a chip on his shoulder he wasn't that like a nice guy and then he says he ... his the documentation of his life around around the time of the first crime mentions that he was\nUm it wasn't hard to get him into a fight you know he was he was he had he had he carry to\nCarry the sangre pretty open by the uh but I so I I don't doubt that there were other violent incidents through in about his life the uh uh but I don't think the whole scenario had come together for him before that\nBut it still isn't that that's a great point we're headed going into the navy do you know we don't know no\nI'd be curious whether to find the tone in which she grew up in yes um and then check what year he went into the navy and see whether prior to that year\nThere have been something which you know he knew he had to get on a ... he had to get out of dodge ... joining the navy it was a great way to do as to whether it's just one person who is the victim of his rage but gave him a great satisfaction and and you know I'm\nA nurse assist sociopath which is what this guy sounds like the most dangerous kind\nI'm socio pets are often rage killers and they they just you know the ... thing and and they they they just they do it as a kind of release and I I Wonder whether that that first released came long before he came to the new world\nBut it was not a nurse if there's a ... because he was not a\n... he didn't have any charm it was not it was ... ... generally as a charming\nRight motive often well spoken truly\nMakes a good appearance he didn't do any of that maybe he was he was a true psychopath a psychopath have no fear of over ... norm had did not have normal fear and one thing that the parent about this the ... the ... on the train is that from his crime that he was not\nEven not acting in fear he was he was calm in the middle of events that are horrific events that anyone else would have been shaking in their boots and that was one reason he was able to get by with it for so long I\nThis is probably not that I should have made this this other point first\nThe story of a Paul Miller on the map from the train is is much larger than our book and and we were fortunate enough to find this set of facts about him but I have no doubt that someone else is going to write another book about him in ten years or Fifteen\nAnd going to say well here's what the James's myth they missed this whole story about Paul Miller in Germany they missed the whole story about\nAh this this crime and it when that guy Illinois [laughter] and uh the I don't we don't have any doubt that they're going to do that and and there'll be right but we had spent years on it and we reached the limit of our particular research capacities so we moved on and printed the book\nBut there is still more story to be discovered there\nAre very interested in a Bill James you really take some questions as sure that'd be great okay so we'll give the phone numbers you're coming up just

James\nIs the author and it's a it's just a terrific read very good writer\nA and a and yet you know until bill there was not a lot to me that he ... his not there's not a name that anybody would have mentioned as being the most prolific serial killer in America and as you say we don't know yet or maybe we can never know the numbers the actual numbers\nIt's fair to say that he was the most elusive in the way in which he operated because he was able to get away for so many years just as it you know his vocation was I tend to rent longer but his application was definitely somebody who we came to a town with the intent of murder\nAnd got away with it for years because really who thinks that there's people out there that do that\nYou know I mean just like even today you don't think about this we will just driving around going up which Tuesday you know I'm really in the mood for murder [laughter] but there are there are they good to Mike in Roswell New Mexico by two incidents where I'll be driving through in a couple of weeks ...\nOh yeah I'm Still I've got a couple of questions first of all I Need you to answer for me again over ... ... and ... like what will the actress\nYeah what any of the actual evidence from any of these crime scenes\nThe ah I wouldn't say so I have held held in my hand the acts with with the Alaska murders were committed\nThey ah it it's still it's still around and and or has been definitively tied to the to the murders and the ah ah but I wouldn't say I have physical evidence now again you know what the palm will buried by any chance\nNo way down it disappeared and I was never caught my belief is that he probably went back\nTo Europe and my guess would be that he ... he went back to Europe and continued to murder people but that is speculation and we do not know that\nFor sure okay well that's all I had to pick it up you pretty much go at all he might have worked for the world road is how he got to every place that he did and maybe Sunday night where they lay overnight or something like that but a thank you for being on the air and I appreciate your story\nThey give you that hey you know actually that's a really good question too about what was the connection to Sunday's why we're why we're most of these murders on a Sunday\nWhether what out in a modern criminal investigation if a criminal could make\nThe murders on weekends this is taking to be a sign that he's employed\nA if a ... and if it happens a lot actually out there quite a few serial murderers who will\nWho committed murders on weekends or\nThe or because they they work during the week and I you know they have jobs go to the um Miller probably did it on Sunday nights because he would spend the weekend working himself into the perhaps stocking as victims although I don't I don't know that it's a lotta stocking\nBut the the just war game itself into the frame of mind that he could get where he needed to be\nA ... the ... and we do you think he did was just kind of trampling it as a you know and and riding the rails or was do you think he was paying you know cash money for a ticket to get on the ... these trains all over the country you\nKnow he was he was just it wouldn't have paid cash money for a ticket because he would have been seen a ... and ... and he he came into town made no contact with anyone spoke to no one and this pair that was part of his\nCriminal Janice they ah they ah but ah so ... is his punished crime in the unplanned crime and Eighteen Ninety eight they did buy a ticket to leave\nThe town and this this led to a trail\nForming behind him and place followed his where he had gone on the train or for quite a while but later he was just it was just job as white used to railroad he always\nAlways used at the intersection of two railroad so that would have trained came by the middle of night he could just hop on and they wouldn't be caught waiting you know if you have to hell rode your last chance a year you'll be you'll be stranded waiting for trying to come to\nKnow each other by saying that really got what it was\nNo that's an interesting point then by the way when I told you about the the people that were murdered\nNext to the railroad line in the town where I grew up they um that was the shoe sure the shoreline it was it just the the train no longer existed um after like Thirty years or so but he used to be the major commuter rail road between\nMilwaukee and a Chicago and I think or maybe even went further up north up to ... Green Bay or something or\nThe other point the other question I was raised in there up until Nineteen oh eight or thereabouts\nHe a settled in an area for a period of time and committed crimes there that area\nAfter Nineteen eighty started just morally more or less trapping it became a Nineteen Nineteen away tonight and Kenny transition to just running loose cross the country bought an interesting thing is that he never stole\nMoney at one of the ways you know with him is that why this line well up here in the newspaper story about\nMoney and other valuables were found in the room that and that happens all the time that that that there's a hit he does not steal anything from the crime scene\nYeah and that definitely is was a ... you know there's the accusation about the first crime that a little was accused of than it was a a robbery and and\nIt yet you know at the at the same time the let me ask you about the acts so the ... why do you think he would leave the is this the murder weapon at the scene I understand like\nIn the godfather right when you wrap the handle and you drop the gun because there's no fingerprints for them to find or whatever but it would seem like even then that would be some evidence to to look for somebody if they're if they leave the ax behind\nWell up fingerprints exploded in the understanding of the American public and I can't afford like oh five in his first crimes he just drop the acts and left his buddy fingerprints\nOn the on the acts up mud once people became aware of the fact that fingerprints than he would wash the handle they act in a bucket of water before leaving it in a crime they did at the last ... every every wherever the second half of his of his career\nThey ah ah which proved that he was connected to what was going on I probably read newspapers and knew what was going on over there but it just a drop the acts because it would have been awkward to take it with him while he was playing or if he once he was
