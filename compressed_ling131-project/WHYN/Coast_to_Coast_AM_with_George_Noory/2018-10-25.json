H. Y. N.\nCheese\nNew entries with this and I didn't even Texas I Will you remember when\nI ... I like to say that I'm as you I Am a student\nOf history and history she clearly shows that a civil war steaks around\nFifty years when it happens most people don't realize that they're already in the civil war\nThrough the ... when they go back and look at things that have happened in the race the best they they immediately think that you know we are in a civil war\nEspecially when they're young something like ... symmetrical warfare an ideological warfare people tend to think it has to be always an armed conflict that's where the guy says what's the definition of war and I says well it's an armed conflict civil wars on the other hand\nAre are armed at times and at times they're not armed sometimes their ideological wars sometimes their spiritual wars sometimes there are warring factions with in certain groups where there'd be right or left how many ... groups that we heard\nThe KKK the Nazis the communist or I could go down to lift the black lives matter me too\nI mean just go down the list of all the factions are at war with each other right now none of them pulling guns on people but yet we have somebody who ideologically disagrees with Hillary Clinton the Obamas and the Democrats and they send a pipe bomb whether it be\nSomeone who's deliberately doing it to prove a point or two at least create a false flag attack or if it's someone on the ... on the right doing it ... out of a left but no one had even brought up the shootings or the congressman\nThere not bringing up the other of a rice and that was bailed out in the rice and it was about to President Trump this is certainly one sided and it's better just to basically heart and the resolve of the persecution complex to the left it's obviously obviously this is what is happening\nOr a yes or am I still on yeah go ahead okay I'd also like to say that um I Believe it was Mark Twain said a patriot as one who is scorned at first but when others join him it cost them nothing\nAnd I believe firmly that that might be Donald Trump\nIt might be and it might not be a history will have to decide that they'll have to say that history decides everything there the last say Brighton, Michigan your own with Roger

where it's coming it's obvious to hear a we're looking at\nSome parasitic invasion into our country ... the body politic is no one's really incredible patient then maybe that maybe it's fighting for

ESPN by force and on the show for only for Ninety nine to bring thousands of a ...\nWith the food the original and the entire thirty for thirty\nBut I can tell you this I Want to get to the bottom and I want to hear what the authorities have to say about this\nAnd I don't want to jump to conclusions because it could be a left wing conspirator doing this to try to make Republicans good look bad but on the surface it looks like and I know everybody's saying you know Trump and his rhetoric has made you know things you create an environment so that somebody\nWould be induced to do this you don't know that no you don't know that we need to wait\nAnd get the official verdict\nFrom our authorities in intelligence communities in the United states and then the American people can chew on it but bottom line you and me both know that the rhetoric in this country\nI'm Talking about the grass roots level I'm not talking about leadership because these guys have always been you know at one another stroked but we have to understand that at the grassroots level\nAmerica is best when we can debate ideas vigorously the bake these ideas and then\nYou know come up with a viable solution to whatever problem that we're facing to try to assassinate former presidents and leaders in government is not the way to solve this problem and whoever did that whoever did it they are not\nBenefiting this country they're hurting the United states of America in Georgia I'm so glad you guys let me way on that weigh in on this because I Love my country I Love it with all my heart I told you want on this there that would get my life for the United states of America and I and I will\nBut George this right here it's got to come to win and hopefully this a wakeup call for all of us for all of us to realize that if you're a Republican don't look at a Democrat is your enemy if you're a Democrat don't look at the Republican as your enemy\nAs an opponent yes but not an enemy we're all\nOn the same team and the media\nNot not coast to coast [laughter] but the media has definitely because George you giving everybody a platform you're giving everybody a platform and you've been reasonable you been honest I've heard your commercials saying listen you know just because I let a person to say what he wants to say don't think that I'm On one side or the other\nAnd that's the proper and healthy way to look at it but George\nThe media has exacerbated this problem I Do believe that the media bears as you know a little culpability in this we've got to stop demonizing\nAnd looking at one another as we are enemies were all on the same team the only people that are clapping and I are our adversaries overseas\nAnd build on and the individual or the group that sent these packages exactly George\nTed Kaczynski the Unabomber killed three people injured twenty three others\nHe was caught because his manifesto was publicly let go in his brother recognized it as Ted Kaczynski he's turned him into the FBI\nAre we going to happen hopefully some kind of a person because I'm convinced Andre that one person always tells another person somebody knows something about who sent these packages out ... maybe they'll go to the public or if\nThis is a conspiracy I don't think that this conspiracy will hold wax too much longer you cannot have a conspiracy like this and everybody keep this keeps their mouth shut\nI think that if this is a conspiracy we will get a resolution to this we'll find out the truth a whole lot faster\nThan if this is one lone but I Am convinced in our law enforcement uh individuals and are individuals in institutions and in the intelligence community entire US intelligence apparatus they will get to the bottom of this and it won't ever did this\nWhether it was somebody on the left or to somebody on the right because I Will say again\nI Will say again because I Know you've got people on the right thing this could be a false flag somebody on the left that did this\nAnd you got most of the media thing that President Trump still this weight shut up wait let the intelligence officials do their jobs then once their job is completed and they've determined who've done this\nThen we can begin as a nation to try to put the pieces back together and come together as one country we are the United states of America you know every\nGroup has you know had their time to be stepped on that's just the way empires are established\nAnd America is an empire and people are going to get stuff done but you have to wait\nAnd do things proper in order I'm thinking about the Tuskegee Airman right now who President Roosevelt said go out they can't fly on a piece for the one less thing but they flew it and they blew it most ... more successfully and they protected more bombers than anybody in front\nOf they sure did in in ... in when they landed white pilots went up to them and hugged him\nExactly George exactly you know we all\nWant to contribute to the greatness of America and we're on a good path right now let this path continue\nUnless stop this rhetoric that drives us apart and and I'm not talking about Trump I'm Talking about individuals the guy at a gas station your best friend the guy who you talk to on the phone you know stop it realize we're all in the same boat together we're all Americans\nAlright ... team joined we will talk this week and and see the rest of the story unfold hopefully Saudi Arabia's crown prince Mohammed bin Solomon as described the killing of ... to show me as a heinous crime\nIn his first comments in some of his closest aides were implicated in the Saudi journalist death\nSpeaking edited investors conference in Riyadh that has been overshadowed by this crisis been sold them and said that those responsible for the killing would be brought to justice Facebook could collapse of uh keeps being dogged by scandals or misinformation\nAnd election hacking says the author of a ... book on the company\nDavid Kirkpatrick says advertisers could start to showing the platform scandals don't stop after a year of seemingly endless controversy over misinformation privacy and fake news listen to this new development and fiber optics\nCould make Internet speeds up to a hundred times faster by detecting light that has been twisted into a spiral\nThe research published in the journal nature communications can be used as easily upgrade existing networks and significantly boost the fish and sea let's check in with our expert Warren Weinstein on the Internet boy this would be amazing born\nBefore I comment on that I I like to make a technical comment on on the fence today um I Would I Would estimate that the probability of this being tracked down to either the perpetrator or perpetrators of the very short period of time as as being very very high\nI'm ... ... I mean these are all unexploded devices that me and all kinds of trees of who's available for them or they're all they've all gone are all going to the FBI you some of them were sent through the regular mail us ...\n... I just wanted to know if they're from one city one location or a number of different cities\nThey probably have that all figured out already the entire us peer network is highly computerized they have photos of the packages as they cross through the sorting\nGot pictures of the person if he delivered it to the post office ...\nThat the post offices I mean this is the kind of thing where where if you wanted to have the best possible evidence it's almost as if someone wants to be caught so I I think probably within a day or two days are certainly a short period of time we're going to find out who is behind this some of these questions are are going to start to uh be possible\nAnd you'll find out about a minute left the why we're optics story real quick\nI mean this is mostly a a you know it kind of future kind of issue with it more it it's more involving a ... the communications rather than individual I think the question always comes up when you when we talk about higher speed Internet is are we going to be able to afford it\nOr the ISPs going to raise the bad with caps enough so that we won't use up our whole allocation for the month and in two minutes\nAnd where it's going to go because right now the ISPs have tended to put a high speed a new system in the uh high rent urban areas they haven't showed a lot of interest and putting them in the rural areas so there's that question to are we ever could actually see it depending on where you live\nOr die for and Lauren thank you so much will be in touch with you this week as well while a lottery ticket holder in

story of my demons layer well it's it's not as tragic as that but I have\nHad one experience and I I Will share that with you I Would say about Nineteen Twenty years ago and this was my first experience with a real live demon men this wasn't like a portal ... within my house and came out and you know wanted to play it was actually a demon that was summing up by a very evil some federal and he sent it my way\nWhat's on federal I sent the ...\nIs a religion and and they can either be good or bad I don't know much about this on the idea of religion but I Do know that there are some

can be comic curses can be ... doesn't mean that you have to accept it because if you\nHave learned you know you you said God or during the gods were the ascended masters or the angels and if you make it very clear\nThat you no longer want this to be part of your experience you know you can really do something like that on crossing and I'm release it from your being but it's both but it\nBoils down to the person who was the target it's usually are mines that are not as strong as they can be but it is possible for each and every one of us to to have a very very very very very powerful mind and when that happens\nPersist can affect us we'll just bounce off\nLet's go we should the Rockies Charlotte in Pennsylvania harsher what go ahead\nHi Charlotte I ... thanks for taking my call or my

interview\nAnd I've known them ever since then what I venture league\nMatured and did my night talk show in St Louis he was a gas in them\nAnd I replaced art on coast to coast stamp was a rush a staple of the program anyways and we continued and he's been at some live events with me I think I'm going to be with you an alien fest the end of January up near the big beer and I think\nSo at least that's what the plans were assuming there is no getting away you know [laughter]\nSo they stand tell me tell me what's going on in the field of you follow gee these days I mean you you were out there way in the beginning telling people about you ... talking about the Benny in Barney he'll case you've got books out\nWhat's the latest based on your work your research\nWell I think there's been a much wider acceptance I think the biggest thing that's happened as we've come to realize that our vision of the world was not quite right\nWhen Frank Drake talked about are there might be aliens out there he said there might be eight thousand places in the galaxy or were they going to be sending a signal\nWell the latest word begat looks like there's about one point six planets per star not per galaxy per star\nAnd the our galaxy the Milky Way has about a hundred billion stars all that means is one\nHundred and sixty billion planets so they're all over the place and you know that changed as our picture we used to think we're pretty special you know there's only of civilization or around and we're at the top of the heap well\nRoll up life and that changed our perception of how important we are of course from the most important things around because we haven't been around very long\nAnd leave plenty of room in other words for others and we've come to realize that you know get in here from ... not quite the big deal we used to think it was\nA hell of a virus comes from doing things differently [noise] so the notion that uh you know it's going to take a very long time many years to get between stars and can't be much types and back and forth\nNow we're ... we're fusion for example or you can get ... hours\nWe also realize that the country a sixteen fifty I guess a bishop Russia and thought that the world was created and four thousand B. C. that's right it can be who may beings around you know well it was off a little bit four billion be this\nJust a little the little\nUh our ... natural we were not as important I I hate to say this to people but we're not as important as we might think we are in the larger scheme of things\nThe ultimate you know hurtful thing\nUm we're beginning to realize it's a busy place out there and there should be no surprise that the people see others coming here because apparently they seem to be all over the place now whether this is a result of\nSpontaneous generation of life everywhere or migration colonization or maybe people are being exiled all used to find out is saying but the nearest one is a lot of that they\nPut in incarcerated people you know like yeah like a ... boy guy's been brought on earth\nAnd you never know the way they've been treating people ...\nSandy you were one of the first if not the first to break the Roswell New Mexico story nationwide yet but in ... have you changed your thoughts in views at all about that case over the years where you pretty steadfast that what we've been talking about would you especially is still what it was\nI think it's Italy and visitors and as a matter of hungry for expanded the notion of wired tried to tell you a first time I was on that well we think there's one point six planets for stars so you have to like huge number of planets and\nYou know they're probably coming here\nUh I I I'd have been left that there's only a few thousand planets you know if there were a life out there we see it ... you know they would make contact and land on the White House lawn and all kinds of crazy so\nNow I think it's more like realizing but at North America has more than a few people on the east coast is jammed full of people all over the place\nAnd we that makes us less important than we'd like to think we are and there's still people thinking that the world is only a few thousand years old so what's the big\nOr or still slapped\n[laughter] and and so uh what most of us have learned that\nIf it's a more complex place than we thought it was and we hate to admit it but you know what we're not the most advanced and much shouldn't be surprising again because we know now we measured the age of planet the stars and things like that\nAnd uh hey we're not number oh oh no [laughter] no ... and so what we\nAnd you can tell from another thing or the military budget on a blind eye for about a trillion dollars this year or so we haven't changed much have we know that it'll pay people don't get the goodies of our from their work\nUh we take for leaving because we're stocking up on and on ways to kill other people and it seems I I don't want to saying that's human nature\nA but it appears to be close to what it is and I'm not going to try to explain why or how but\nWe know enough to say that ah\nIt's awful lot of energy available to them in the universe and you know I've gone to the sequence

fence is an extra physical for people and I've just written this new book that does include big foot at some ... that's the only a ... a retired police officer\nAnd white whole New York that back in Nineteen Seventy six\nHad a ... year face to face encounter with a a seven foot tall gigantic bipedal creature\nThat he was thirty feet away from it and he'll never forget it and it has affected the rest of his life and I'm actually going to be going to see that individual NYU whole New York very soon his name's author Brian got one and so it's got to be an interesting book George I'll make sure that you have a copy you know you for already endorsing the book\nYes uh it it's something that a little different for me because I'm used to writing about my own experiences that in ... covering a broader spectrum and writing about some other folks\nAre absolutely and build this ... this officer of course has no reason to lie has nothing to gain these are the kinds of credible witness is you have to have aren't there\nI totally agree and I didn't know about this matter is Margaret from like super who also is a former police officer he lives in Carmel New York\nAnd he um somehow got connected with officer Godwin and went actually interviewed him so that's how this all came about and in that I've had dialogue with officer Godwin since then\nHe's very credible and it was not only him but seven other officers are over a two nights band that actually solve this creature so it was the original two witnesses that reported hearing just God awful shrieking sounds coming out of the woods\nAnd they reported it to the local police\nAnd so the first night there were I Believe five police officers present\nAnd then the second night there were two more present and had these I Witness accounts of this gigantic big foot creature in the area\nSome people believe that big foot bill might be dimensional other people believe it's tied to the UFOs or I tend to think it's it's a creature of this planet ... what's your take\nWell I have to say you know again based on research and my feeling about it and dealing with this creature I'll I'll tell you a story in a second here but I Believe that it's both George I think\nBiblical a now or if you're reading things like that of course you know if you're reading not which isn't in the Bible but if you read the book would be knock it talks about\nThe ... the thought of God coming down a taking human women which produced a hybrid offspring of giants called enough one\nThose Neff limb had unnatural sex acts with the beast of the field now if this is true then perhaps these big for South watch creatures are a part angel part human and then part a bear or whatever it is that you know that these now from\nA you know made it with\nMhm and I find anything can be\nTo now think about this and a lot of these cases\nThere seems to only be one foot print there's never really very rare that you hear about a lengthy trail of of these types of friends and I've thought about that and I thought okay if if it's not a hoax\nThan perhaps this creature may take one step before it becomes invisible as crazy as that may sound but they're short seems to be a pattern here of investigators or eyewitnesses that only find one track\nThat's a good point\nWhat do you think in the old Paterson given themselves\n[noise] well I've seen it and I've kind of on the fence\nI thought [noise] Mm [noise] I don't know it ... I'll say this though if that was a fake\nIt was a darn good one a darn good one and it would have to be someone you would think that would be gargantuan to fit into that type of a outfit to be able to make that come off as real and another thing George if you think about this\nAs you watch the creature walk away you see the arms swinging and the arms look very long they certainly look longer than ... in my opinion what human arms would look like so it is very compelling\nWhen with ... bills website is not linked up the coast to coast am dot com bill being dot net for you he was the second person behind the secret door I did not get it right so I'm One for one so far [noise] gosh I ...

Mandela lag anymore\nWhen do you think of that bill\nWell I mean she's writing what she's saying but again I think there's intent behind this whole thing and I think that it is evil intent because uh when you are\nMaking such changes to some of the scriptures in the way that they've been altered and changed I mean it is that it is absolute mockery of God and Jesus as well\nAnd and just foul I mean

Mandela died I was in school\nHow will remind wages in jest outlawed and asked about it and then he died two thousand Thirteen other one\nIn high school I did as again on the JFK's assassination that was for people in the car no by John Connelly was never in that bar there was never six people in there\nThat strange I'm trying to remember bill a there was John Kennedy and Jackie in the back seat there was a secret service agent in the driver's seat and then other in the past and there was another in the past it was only four I remember right\nWell no I I remember governor calmly and his wife big in that car as well because supposedly governor Connelly was hit also with one of those bullets\nWill know you write the governor calmly was in front of him because he ... he had one of the bullets\nThe magic bullet but we're was a ... was his wife to his left so Conley was in front of Kennedy and his wife was to his left\n... but the the car was a front seat back seat right or was there a third seat there through narrow third seat there\nAnd I can't remember if the if the seat was a with Connelly and his wife\n... what you were you know them ... you know but I think con Connelly\nIf I remember the artistic sketches of the shooting were they track the bullet Conley was sitting in front\nOf the president so when he got hit but but what I don't know is whether he was in a bench before him how that seating arrangement was I I I think he was sitting\nIn a bench in front of the president or the way I like the front seat I think he was in the front\nAt so the so a governor currently and his wife or in front of President Kennedy and his wife\nSo there were three people in the front seat\nNo they were in another so it it would have been a row of feeding their and then a driver\nOr a or the other Secret Service agent was on the passenger side so you would have had six people and\nThat would have been six that strange route and Tom is looking at it and what do you do too much to can you turn Tom spike up for just one second Denny to put your speaker downtime and tell me what you're saying\nWell I just I just pulled up to the ... film and I'm watching them come over and what is described Kennedy back with his wife right and are hoping you can hear me 'cause I'm I'm looking at the film are now I hear you [noise] and uh and then a Congressman Frank I don't see a third row of seats\nI I didn't I don't remember seeing the third row either bell thanks though\nThat the ... thing and and again I'm that's why I always thought that it was your Secret Service agents at the front seat and then a second row with Governor primary and his wife and his wife was to his lap and the president and Jackie were in the back and Jackie was to his left\nIt's true and I mean I definitely do the secret service agent was on the front driving because everybody accused him of I'm turning around shooting the president uh yeah and I don't believe that happened\nBut I you know again I think about this and I studied that as well because William Cooper is one was saying that I write you know I thought about it I thought okay well the driver would have had Ruben left and that if that's the case and also [noise]\nHe's driving so that they'd have to take his eyes off\nThe road to turn and then make perfect shot you know with his left hand and everybody wants to see that
