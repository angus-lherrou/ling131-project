[noise]\nAnd so I Would in a lot of people in Los Angeles used it in one very famous actress and her son had killed himself and she reached out to us meaning me and my friend\nAnd I sent the board and she said that she spoke to him a Putin ally and thanked me and she's a very famous she staked no mention of you if\nYou don't you go ahead and it was a [noise] where she was from the tech Van Dyke show\nMary Tyler Moore and she was very sweet\nVery kind Rosemarie no she was Mary Tyler Moore Oh Mary Tyler Moore was on the Dick Van Dyke show on her own shows weren't time and more\nNow but she was very she was searching for ways to communicate and just understand so it it's out of it so in other words what I'm saying is it's not just the evil you can you can deport old is it you know to channel would you want\nI think Bob [noise] was naive and he put he put this together to talk to his victims and then you realize they're gonna come they come back\nAnd haunted him and he kept on driving around at one point my grandfather who was in one day and then a month later he was in the town another town and then it caught up to them and that's [noise] um I think that's why he just and he killed himself he drowned himself\nAnd his body was ever found no\nBut he turned my he sent my grandfather a note I saw the note and it was type ... because he never would write and free hand I'm never wrote anything down and you type it or you stencil\nAnd what did he say what was his last words in the letter\nHe said that he can't take any more because of the the the stress that he's being haunted he says he made a mistake by making the board and people are haunted him that he has hurt\nAnd then he he went into Jersey beach town and walked into the water he said he was going to do it anyway and the letter and no one ever saw and again so my\nGrandfather who was a much healthier a man like a stable man and he loved he loved Bob throws fault and he said that\nBob had a weird way of

we know that the industry of do the talking board enter into the community of the spiritual Smith meant and also it's in the United states only but it was an Eighteen Ninety the ... board that we know today got its start\nIn Eighteen Ninety One it was patent and trademark and was in production at that point so there's always some interesting stories about that but an Eighteen Ninety to Canada lots of rights from us the United states to sell their own version of the leader board and so they started making boards and Eighteen Ninety two\nAnd the rest is history and so bored such as Bob board which again falls into the category of talking boards\nA lot of sports after the wage what makes it a prominent splash into\nThe market I mean everybody was buying them and using them in the heyday I mean this this has been a spiritual moving with going\nBig time and I was going on with their communication at the time that people started making copycat boards and started doing different types of their own type a board and of course we get the trademark tens of the name they couldn't use that name\nRight so you have to use different names but I mean this is the story behind this board is rather unique I've never heard anything a particularly unique is the story of of Bob being a suspected serial killer or making a board ah basically it's ... it's almost as if it's penance for him to make this board so that he\nWould feel right about himself or what have you are in his own special way\nI'm just curious if there are any other unique stories behind certain types of boards that have been released in the past\nThere there are many reasons that people make their own boards and as you mentioned earlier people do make around and start customized selling them\nOn but the degree of this type of story no I've never heard of this story but there are reasons why people make boards and it could just be a personal their own little personal portal or they want to communicate with the deceased one or they see an opportunity to make money ... there's a lot of different reasons but this is a very unique case\nI'm In it I haven't heard ever heard of a serial killer making aboard before or I shouldn't say he was in a secular he was posted a legit or we don't know if he really was or not\nYeah we we don't know if you did be tricked into somebody mental institution right in fact a you know that's that's the that's the thing it would be avoided or any kind of prosecution because we checked in a mental institution\nI mean in in since you've been using the board you've gotten longitude and latitude of you submitted any any of this information to the authorities and if so do they take it seriously\n[noise] well which is kind of awkward because I haven't really you know this is really just a small thing that I was just showing on on on we just put the color\nA Xerox is on on board and then I met this guy\nUsed to work for ... which is an old TV show or\nOn the which has only channel five or something right in the east and um she was really for years he was kind of trying to do something with the board and he worked on hated like um show he could like producing I think mhm\nCurrent affairs and then he was the one who\nIntroduced it to the guys that make these um [noise] it's a company called allied board and they make different games things and they took it to another level like the same image to same exact [noise]\nYou know but then they took it and they just put more quality thing with boxes and everything you know\nI mean in the background to write the background history\nYeah and they will I told them everything you know and they put it down\nTo they made it more like a sophisticated I guess but I'm the same story and it's a very and I tell people

Karen go ahead oh\nYes uh what is the best way of raising a spirit vibration in a position to prayer or what is the and if if the dances meditation what is the best for just a different forms of meditation\nOh that's a fantastic question um\nSo you you've got it the number one thing to those people use is prayer or and or meditation both worked really well\nBut one of the best ways a will to about ... a little bit more to that one of the best ways to raise your migration is to get yourself in states of joy find things in your life that give you such great passion and find ways to incorporate that within your life\nFor every time that you get into a state of joy your vibrations automatic to the highest it can be joys is equated to love some moments when you feel that ecstasy of love 'cause you know those come and go and realized we can always hold onto them\nJoy so that we can create if you pursue something you absolutely love you get you get lost in time let's say you like to do art or music I'm Dan some kind of expression maybe just like to get out and being nature maybe like if your child it's that moment of that\nFeeling you get a Catholic that you can go back to recreate it that is what the guys always teachers teach what is creating join your life right now what can you do to follow that joy and bring more of your life and that is the number one easiest way to raise your vibration\nOkay so we know the Asian that does come into the picture what's that again reading the Asian doesn't you\nIt does not again and about the meditations too there's many different practices you can practice there isn't one did one the good one good one is the one that works for you [laughter] so we would recommend in terms of a meditation\nIt's uh it can be a little bit ... now that's not a traditional way a meditation but that might help you get into that space\nUm religious religion helps um [noise] the problems that we see that John McCain get in a way of

Dodgers are but I spent a lotta years in Boston Tea\nIn harm's way and I had my son was born in Boston and I don't know I'm kind of caught between a rock and a hard [laughter]\nI understand that and that's why a ... a a later on a\n... you are obviously you you achieve great heights both in academia and in media and you are amongst I think in the elite group of science reporters people who actually write nonfiction about science in into very accessible way\nUm I we put you in the same category as Mary Roach are you a fan of hers\n[noise] you know I I I I'll be honest with you I'm not familiar with Mary Roach\nOh you're missing missing terrific tell me and play you know she's a she's a frequent guest your and but very very entertaining and she writes I'm always about science and so she she lives to explore particular subjects and\nSo her book on for example what happens to the body after we die called stiff or ... or packing for Mars and when she talked she tried to learn what it'd be like to go to Mars and all the things that would happen and she is just love it\nYou know she's grey and you'd really like her in this district kind of ... it was reminiscent to me a little bit on how you were getting into these subjects because you handle it with a very\nUm [noise] a very non scholastic approach it's the science is there but anybody can follow these stories in everybody probably should if you want to get a glimpse into what the future is all about the students should be a great gift for\nFor Christmas if you if you have a a young scientist and you're on your list some urban old scientist for that matter but looking ahead you know I have you pardon the pun I was just talking about Larry King and he was he was talking about he he believes he's a big believer\nIn cryogenic [noise] yeah yeah a lot you know there's also that famous baseball connection with you Ted Williams family in ...\nBut I mean I what what is the science these days on something like that and how realistic is this would disappear or ... for somebody like Larry King do hope that he would be able to come back again and take his place behind home plate in the few huh\n[laughter] well first of all thank you for the kind words I I have spent my entire life communicating science I Try to make it as interesting as I can you know I spent fourteen years at\nA ABC News as you indicated good morning America twenty twenty Nightline and you know you have to you have to make things interesting or they'll give you the hook basically [laughter] uh I kind of cut my teeth on that\nAs far as cryogenic is concerned you know it's interesting you bring that up and I've covered the cryogenic story over the years\nAh you know they're in the stories that Walt Disney had his head a frozen and ah with with the hope one day of uh of being brought back to life\nThe head being the most important part because it carries our memories or thoughts and so forth and so on\nBut you know I got to be honest with you that's like old school um\nWhat I ... in the sense that now with what's going on with robotics and so forth and saw it more likely that um what Larry King is going to want to do is you know before he kicked the can uh you know he's going to want to upload all his thoughts and memories or\nOnto a super computer and then downloaded onto a very realistic robot so that Larry King [laughter] can ah can remain behind home plate you know indefinitely into the future but I'm Serious\nYou know in in my book um the end of life you know what I deal with these four big topic areas or the first is the worldwide Web the second is the artificial intelligence robots\nThat third it has to do with privacy and surveillance technology and the fourth has to do with genetic engineering so between genetic engineering and artificial intelligence robot man I'm telling you Larry King is going to be around for a long long\nTime ago and I was reading some of those sanctions and I thought that was interesting because there really as you said when he was very I think you mentioned like ... once the book and there's not a big emphasis on it but there is still this hope that people have about\nPreserving their essence and and then that becomes a course a full debate about what we're is the seat of the essence of us you know we used to think the soul was the heart and the head contained all of the you know the the computer works but\nBut ... ... ... how realistic is it ever in the near future that we would be able to upload thoughts in dreams like you might expect from Minority Report being able to capture them and then put them into something else\n[noise] I think it's very real or in I mean you know ... and you indicated about my book being about the future but but the truth of it is it's\nVery thorough but then I allowed myself that last\nFinal chapter and I thought you know I Can't just serve this stuff up to the reader without giving them my thoughts on it so you're you're my thoughts in a nutshell apropos what you've asked me\n[noise] um I see these innovations as the fruits of human intelligence they really spectacular many of them are brilliant a lot of positive consequences I think will come out of this but then there are some things as I said that are a little unsettling and downright dangerous\nWhat I think we need now because we are at the threshold of creating for ourselves a world that can either be grim\nOr great and so I think one of the things that can help steer us one way or the other is to call upon the fruits of human spirituality out for many many years I was pretty much an atheist and the sense that all I cared about was science I\nGrew up in east LA with the dream of becoming the scientists since the second grade really and that dream took me to UCLA then on to Cornell where I got my PHD in physics and astronomy and then as I said on the Harvard where I taught physics for about eight or nine years and so\nIt was during my grad school years at Cornell when I started asking myself how does this universe that I've been studying come to be an\nExport into the wisdom and Buddhism and ... a Islam and transcendental meditation and Judaism and [laughter] and finally um I met this girl this girl came into my life and she challenged me to read the Bible and I wasn't interested I was like five or not I I just thought it was just too familiar to prosaic\nBut anyway it's it changed but it was a game changer for me I don't want to get into all of it so I have become a man of faith faith\nI'm a Christian and I take my my faith very very seriously and so when I\nSay we need to call upon the fruits of human spirituality I'm Talking about ethics morality religion ancient wisdom whatever your faith system is I I don't particularly care even if you're an atheist phase system there are some innovations in this book that I think\nWe need to reflect on and say okay just because we can do this

H. Y. N. [noise]\n\n\nMichael Guillen former science reporter for ABC News on various shows and former instructor of physics at Harvard as well as author and the new book\nIs ah is is just great it's the end of life as we know it\nAnd just before we went into the break we were talking about\nThat that space in discussions of what we should and ought to do which\nMight be better informed by discussions of morality as much as ethics and and you know I think even Michael when you were talking about\nAnd they were slowly throwing it out like you know with hair dryer and stuff like that a little bit at a time with the intention of trying to get their hands on from DNA from you know frozen are preserved DNA and then the whole idea is to\nThen bring back the wooly mammoth and that's going on right now are including a group that's being led by a guy at Harvard named church\nSo um the question then becomes do we I mean you know it's exciting it's it's interesting that it's like science fiction come true but then when you get past all that kind of the bells and whistles of at all you have to ask you know then we really want to do this and there's an even deeper question that I raised\nIn the book and that is with all the genetic engineering were doing and you know the extent these the extinction efforts alright do come under the category of genetic engineering why we're doing in is something that's never been done before\nAnd that is we are elevating recessive trade\nAnd we're going to trade in other words we're flying in the face of the very forces that have created these species the evolutionary forces sure\nWe're defining the natural flow where to find the natural order of thing and you got to believe that when you take on Mother Nature remember the old commercial you don't don't mess with Mother Nature or something like that\nYeah it's not nice it's nice to mother nature that\nOne yet none I forget what it was\nThe original was margarine I it was very mired in for a merger and right yeah I mean we all know margarine is not so great for exactly but\nYou gotta wonder that because we are doing this we now have the ability of elevating recessive traits and suppressing dominant trait we're fine in the face of Mother Nature we had to pay a price and he can't do that\nYou're you're you're fighting again you know a billion according to science you know billions of years of evolution right where we didn't do that if we take it on or who's going to be the casualty I'm thinking we are\nYeah I you know this is the ultimate question and I I mean you know I was reading the DEA extinction thing and I'm not sure that if they brought back quote unquote a wooly mammoth what we really wouldn't have is just a wooly or elephant\nYou know but much in the same way that we have a sweeter orange right where we have a a a a juicy or a peach or something that people do by\nFlipping genetic codes around here there and I'm not saying that that smart either but but I think I'm more worried about some of this idea about the the ... some of the robotics that you talk about\nAnd and what that what that really means who's gonna decide when\nHave really gone far enough and are we going to be in a situation as crazy as it sounds words like sky net and it'll be too late the robots will you know there'll be self teaching and we're out\nWell you know again that's a very real possibility I um\nI tell this story about\nThis guy I think his name is Anthony ... is a former Google engineer a big into driverless cars I'm so he he he helped launch way mo which is the driverless car\nA division of of Google right and then went to her and then got involved in this ugly last food or stealing or industrial secrets and so for the phone but\nHe recently applied to the area and was granted I'm a tax exempt status for what he's calling the church of artificial intelligence\nAnd you know on the surface it sounds a little bit crazy but when you look into what they're thinking his thinking behind\nDoing is he's he's basically saying this look\nIf we continue in the trajectory we're now on\nIt ... it is inevitable that one day a artificial intelligence robot Howard\nBy artificial intelligence will will become so much more\nIntelligent than we that they really reached the level of a deity they they they are in effect God because\nThey know everything they see everything they they control everything if we give them that kind of freedom and so we may as well to start getting ready to worship it because we want to stay on its good side because God I did that this technology we're creating will run amok\nAnd you know you start thinking well okay it's a little crazy this guy but\nYou know it's not that far fetched because the rate at which artificial intelligence is\nIs developing you know I talk about how it beat the pants off of the chess champion and then the checkers champion and now it can beat the chance that they you know Texas hold them poker and the uh the gang go which is generally conceded to be the most complicated game most ancient game around go yeah\nYou know there was no one smokes in\nRight in artificial and tell us now can beat the pants off or you know the the goat champion and so it's printed that writing is on the wall in I mean it it's pretty clear that these computers and not just going to become fans there they're no longer just fancy adding machine there no there are no longer just doing computations\nAh but they're they're becoming more adept at doing things that we post about are we one spoke about being very good at that well you know like you they're ... button that up I think they're generally like he was still pretty small\nBut you know one day they're general like he was forced seem to be even greater than ours that the day of the singularity that's for the day all singularity him when they will have the equivalent IQ of you know ten thousand a hundred and twenty five so\nYeah and that I think the interesting these are the two is it ... the equation is let's use it a hundred and twenty five and we're using that as like a horizon line for human intelligence right if we go with an IQ one twenty five\nBut at the smarter machines get and the more the takeover of our day to day activities\nAnd or the more they do things for us and we allow them to be in the driver's seat of our lives who's just said that that that average you know I using it a drop ten points\nSo we we'd like to think that we might stay but the more we get cushy our brains get ... and who knows it might be a lot we might be bringing on our own physical demise faster than\nRight than we would have possibly imagine\nNo I like that the cushy Murphy ... yeah I'm right because you know the old saying if you don't use it lose that you lose a yeah no but I talk about I think I caught one guy that said you know it may very well be that we are in the process\nOf creating our own conquer\nThe yes raising with that the I fully believe that completely and ... and let's pick this up and coming up after the top of the hour 'cause I'm saying like like marriages like democracy like friendships\nI think our life as we know it is much more fragile and people would like to think it cannot stand all the things we will be throwing added in the future we'll get back to that thought with Michael Guillen gloves to shoot

H. Y. N. [noise]\n\n[noise]\nI Want to measure to leave some time to talk about future of privacy we're we rest right now at this frontier of all of this home technology with Michael Guillen in a moment but I I wanted to wrap up\nThat conversation about uh about trends humans as you talk about them in the book people who are becoming part of something else or use physical\nUm enhance Mintz from technology to be able to compensate for 'em either for injury or for deformity um and there's a couple of those that are very entertaining like the guy with the built in by breeder and some of the other stuff that's\nIn the book but the part I thought that was really interesting and I just wanted to mention it because I I I think they're this idea of the ... skeleton I'm ... I Know several people who have a ... who have\nA trouble walking or the ... lost their ability to walk in spinal injuries and and that this to them as a dream ... just being able to walk across the room because of a of an ... skeleton that carries their body or ... or muscles are stimulates their muscles are all three\nOf I I Can't think of a downside to that other than the military application I guess a but where are you with that one\nNo I I agree with you I'm a and I I think that yes it that discussion that I have in the book about trans humanism and you know that's there's actually a movement are called the trans human movement where\nAs you say ... or the ideas to enhance ourselves one way or another using technology and I break it down into three categories of the usable or trends human augmentation there's so there's usable there wearable and then there's implantable\nAnd I I agree with you I I ... this is an area where I see very little downside I mean I tell the story of this guy from ... Tennessee who he was a power lines when he touched a a high voltage\nLine that was lying on the ground and he lost both arms to the vet them right off now here's a guy who would have you know live the rest of his life you know of severely crippled and and now scientists are creating for him what are called neural cross the prostheses\nBut the these are artificial arms but not like your grandfather's artificial arms you know that we are mechanical that require you to wear a harness and you have right now these are these are arms that he can move with his car they're they're they're wired is\nMine and I mean isn't fantastic\nOh yeah and another story that I tell about the woman who is a quadriplegic and now\nYou know she she's able to have some level of independence and uh because of of some of the trans human augmentation um so I Know I I I agree with you name it even and um [noise]\nEven in the military setting I mean if we if we can outfit our soldiers so that you know they're wearing an exoskeleton I talk about how on day has come up with stuff there yeah where you know write it get it just ... you know so so or a soldier who's out there and he's carrying you know what I'm fifty six pound backpack\nYou know if if if they if we can give them an extra fell a skeleton to take some of that load off their own skeletons I I think that the I\nI think it would be a threat to find fault in something like that\nOr maybe but maybe I've seen robo cop more times than you have I mean I think that\nMean and I do I'm not I'm not being\nFacetious I think that's the only one I'm here's why there's always this belief somehow that if we can if we can come up with the technology that saves our soldiers from from harm\nInevitably that decades weaponized into and yeah we can invade without losing any soldiers and therefore there's no political consequence\nYeah from the ... and ... and ... you know back to 'em that idea about I'm about\nMaybe some of our advancements should not be consequence free is that I think that that's the ... I get worried a little bit and maybe that's the science fiction part of me then I see\nThat politicians would rebel at the thought of not having to be accountable for anybody's death by having super soldiers that can go in and take whatever we want 'em until the embittered enemy that we've created does this one better [laughter] and it never really it's a new arms race\nNo no you're absolutely right in and I again I talk about that but you know it's interesting if you look ahead to what this technology is pointing to\n[noise] and ah you know we're talking about an ... a human soldiers abilities but I think are equally realistic will be a you know a robot warriors and effect Terminator like warriors that will be our surrogate going into war and so we ...\nCould possibly go wrong there [laughter] yeah [laughter] and you know I quote that sounds like a plan [laughter] yeah I Know\nAnd and now and and the ... group you know I caught them in the book in Russia is very upfront about them doing that they're I mean they're in the process of doing that and they're talking about unveiling\nSome of their stuff soon or using their own that is just a fancy way of saying these are robot warriors that have human like brain the question then becomes\nDo you give such warriors the right to make the decision to shoot or not should in other words you give them complete autonomy\nAnd and that is called the Terminator conundrum right now yeah nations are thinking about well gee if we give our robot warriors complete autonomy then that basically going to make Russians do the same thing and now we're going to be as you said a moment ago in\nWe're going to be now and another escalating arms race\nThat right yeah ... it in some ways you know that I often I often think to myself you know yeah all that technology is brand new it's unprecedented but we are just still the same\nYou know all our fault in our or evil than our weaknesses and are downsides just get magnified by this technology the technology doesn't eliminate our weaknesses and our ... and our down side you know what I'm saying to you\nYeah I Do and ... and ... and yet I Would propose to you\nMay be the biggest problem we would face in the law of unintended consequences\nWould dictate the Sarah Connor ... not the Terminator conundrum but the Sarah Connor tuna under which means if you can't win a conventional war because you're over well by the technology of the euro opponent you go unconventional\nAnd you go gorilla end this creates more terrorism and you know you know I mean\nThat's that's how eventually she was able to beat the I don't want to spoil the ending terminal but you know I mean that's how that's how you know she will one is eventually learning to to you know to go to grill her way out of it not to face the enemy but to be the enemy by you know going\nOr at his weaknesses but but positive person because whenever you mentioned Russian scientists I'm reminded of the story about the the scientist that want to put a a a a new had an old hat on a new body right\nYeah yeah okay or had transplants yeah yeah\nOkay so let's let's pick that up [laughter] that's one of those that's one of those Halloween e\nKind of moments right there where like All right now that this is this is one of those nightmare dream things depending on where you are with it I could understand that somebody had um a body that was decaying but their brain was brilliant and you wanted to put it on a new body but then where does that end and how far along are they in that\nYeah well you know what I've been reporting on that story for some years now and um it began with a small number of scientists\nUm who experimented on monkeys and it gets a little grizzly but this being Halloween okay ah where they yeah they severed monkeys head and then they re attached it\nOr just to prove that they could so there's a lot of plumbing involved right I mean you have to sew up the the the the veins in the arteries and the nerves and so forth and so on and they've they've\nScientists have achieved to a level of success with monkeys and so now embolden\nOr by that they are turning their attention to doing it to humans and there's at least one guy in Russia who's been quoted a frequently or who is a quadriplegic or you know otherwise mentally very alert\nPassive listening that is going on that we have not yet fully come to terms with what that could mean for our jobs for our relationships are for our communities\nAnd for the security of our country I just had an op ed that it'll be published very shortly I'm a U.S Congress issued a report on Thursday so\nI think that um the Chinese are hell bent on um a exploiting the vulnerabilities of something called the Internet of things and that's what we're talking about\nHer that kind of a refrigerator your dishwasher everything that's connected\nAll these smart devices that we're talking about the Alex's or the smart watches the smart as you say refrigerators the smart thermostat on and on and on\n... there are now a more than eight billion Internet of things devices so we call it I O T I talk about it in the book\nAnd the Chinese or the this as an opportunity to ... to spy on them and we are the willing accomplices because we're buying these gadgets bringing them into our own home\nYou talk about the ... thing in whether that's true or not it's entirely possible and I tell the story in the book of a woman who was murdered\nI I don't want to give away the story but she was murdered in the police started looking into the the situation and the husband was claiming one thing he said there was an intruder and\nHow he came in\nHe killed he killed his wife in the basement and we started looking at things and they found she was

I had to cut you off but we're going to the bottom of the hour and it's a heartbreak so I couldn't pass on that [noise]\nOh yeah no I was telling you the story of a murder that happened to Connecticut\nAnd ah the husband claimed a one story and the police looked into it to his wife was murdered and he claimed one story in the\nWhat the police found was that the woman was wearing a the deceased woman wearing a fit with one of these little smart watches that keeps track of your heart rate how are you walk and so forth and so they downloaded the data from the fit fit\nAnd they found out that the they could actually get this calculate how many feet she walk and it didn't square with the story from the husband\nThat yeah yeah they they won't have soles God didn't make them they won't have soles there'll be like zombies there'll be like and it was like no they weren't so I mean I think some of it as an education piece in and I think that's where great science writing in science journalism in a book like this is really helpful because it really\nMakes clear to people who how complicated these issues are but what's the great benefit or not for us in the long run that's the part I'm I'm focused on myself anyway and I think\nIf you're you're you're absolutely right and that is why I wrote the book people can have their own opinions but you have to be well informed in order to have a sense right in right after you read this book you'll have you'll be well informed and then God Bless you with your opinion\nRight and and God Bless you in five years this book maybe totally irrelevant right because by that time so it's a bad since you're gonna have to write a sequel the end of the world is the end of life as we know what let me go to Jason in Portland for Michael Guillen on coast to coast Jason\nYeah they um playing God is kind of baked into like the F ... when they say that we are created in the image of God that kind of you know is put into\nOur defense ... now\nInto my question before I get I if I read the uh your schedule right are you going to be talking about the subject of immortality on Tuesday night\nOh coast may be yeah I Will yeah great well it'll give it a little plug for an up [laughter] and now they're I think you\nYou were talking about immortality and I don't know exactly where it is but in the revelation that talk about your mortality and when the wrath of God is or out of a ... fine it says that they will pray that they would die\nAnd they were not able to and they asked for the ... mountains in stone to come down and in and cover them up and are they talking about this period that you're talking where we've achieved immortality\nThis is this is an interesting premise again is whether immortality would be a blessing or a curse a ... you know that uh that is the the portrait of Dorian Gray ... what's your thought on that Michael\nWell it's a it's a I have a couple of thoughts about that and that is number one uh you know obviously as a theoretical physicist and and as a serious minded Christian I'm fascinated by finding a references in the Bible\nThat might give us some glimpse or some hint as to what what's in store for us and how it jibes or doesn't jibe with what's going on in science I just find that just it's fascinating intellectually fascinating\nEr and and so I I I'd love to think more about this reference to revelation\nI I think also my other thought is you know do does does a supercomputer and this is this is a kind of a ... of a mental a question or a mental experiments that people talk about a lot ...\nIt will reach a point where we create an artificial intelligence being whether it's in the form of a big computer server\nOr it's in the in the body of a among careless or a kind of a role of human like robot\nBut get so complex and soul yawn ... you know hasn't existence that is beyond the human experience that you cannot unplug it\nYou know it's like that guy net running it's like running on on energy that it absorbs from the environment I mean ... that's\nThe horror from saying or from the crush souls of the people in stumps on on you know getting are going to get some coffee yeah I get that I think\nThat happens with some of our technology now right after you haven't you ever been in a situation where you know you're you're like trying everything stop you know that it's a piece of machinery is going great stop stop stop and oh I don't like it and it still goes on you know [laughter]\n... tell me but I spent the last two weeks trying to get a Kenmore elite dishwasher six so Jack Lew\nThat after this exactly where I'm living and by the way to is somebody with the I mean I have a masters of divinity degree I Would just say it's really interesting about the Bible in this the the only problem is the Bible is multi vocal on the subject of immortality life after death et cetera\nSo it's really great because it creates more conversations but it doesn't always resolve them so\nKeep that in mind let me go to a let me go to a ... who is in Arizona on coast to coast am David going\nHey my question for me I'm ... and the ethical and moral conflict created by doing these things artificial intelligence\nA new one would be the result\nYou keep breaking up dude you're killing me because it sounds like a really good question [laughter]\nYeah or if

yeah no I think this is where are the technology really is very hopeful\nUm they they are making enormous strides now uh with\nRestoring people fight with macular degeneration I'd actually interviewed a woman who had the operation and you know even though her fight is still not crystal clear she can she can make out shapes and given her an enormous amount of independence but\nWe're making enormous strides they're already working there's this one company in particular in California I talk about\nThat or is already working on a second generation a that will help actually restore sight the people who are born blind not never mind with macular degeneration so I see a lot of hope on that also in the kidney from I don't think we need to create these by merit a there's a lot of great research and I've reported\nOn them for ABC News and elsewhere where they are now able to create using stem cell or ... it might create a artificial Oregon so\nThat are more tailored for the the person yeah yeah

it'd be didn't here's the story on coast to coast am wrote down\nDowntown Oregon City there are there it's just like at least that's the theory\nBehind paranormal activity witness that fine zero treat a can of his dispensary\nBehold if you dare this surveillance video from August watched the glass tip jar on a counter slowly it starts to move that's Andy going that's next to it\nI thought it was happening and I felt like somebody was standing there like somebody that's like right here\nSuddenly the John ... at the level surface that does happen then Andy remembered the surveillance camera I saw the jar\nNot long after that this happened watch the Penn ... it's completely still and no one's around when suddenly the pans begin to move\nAnd if you think the videos the doctor as a candidate shop that would be against the law ... GM Samantha Davidson says at the turn of the century this building space with\nYou as a farm in ... to bring me up and so so yeah so this could have been a pharmacy and maybe there is no real explanation for why there are goes there\nBut that video ... especially ... and the fact that we really got me was because it's a candidate shop law mandates they can't touch the video\nSo what was it I don't know but if you go and look at it and you want to jump in on open lines of ... let me go to Mike in Charlotte North Carolina on coast to coast to get us started Mike\nGood morning hours y'all [laughter]\nWe're good thank you\nYeah Halloween all out of the night the hills run with an animal or children\nYes well I Am right now not enough runs in the Los Angeles because it's now going into the are going to be in the Eighteenth inning for this game this World Series or the question of being whether this show ends before that game and but where do you want to take off\nA about ... ... well everything was fine and the trailer talked about a floating there's not a supercomputer\nOr Anglo forever blah blah and one problem\nDownload memory download horses can download mannerisms and download action match by robots now\nBut it all gang because you can't show [laughter] some of the feelings and the personality of the uh\nI I'm with you in spirit I mean we're the in there and that\nThe Bible says that there are where nothing because they sleep right uh you know we can try to play God but I I I [noise] it's impossible because we are not God that's all I have to say\nOh it's bad enough I mean I it thanks for calling you know I think the the issue of that so peace though is a little more complicated\nSo a lot of people would say that and it\nIf it's a version if it's forty percent of who you were why wouldn't it have a soul if other people out there have you know uh other meant if there are other people who have problems with their mental capacity due to injury or disease\nYou know we don't say it was suddenly they're less human or that they have less of a soul\nI'm so I'm not I'm with you in theory well I'm with you in theology on soul\nUm but I think it is much trickier question than just saying they wouldn't for sure because that used to be the thing that people said about test to babies and I think we're we fortunately moved beyond that uh okay let's get to where we got a lot of people standing by which is always fun Aaron is in Richmond, Virginia on coast to coast\nHi um I and world power guy for for\nNot in for five years I don't want to get too much into it but\nI'm ... and I I have a couple of things to say on this whole in March ... her saying I'm a reader either in a manner or would it have anything he couldn't adapt to where to survive\nI mean wouldn't even know what to do in this environment now and furthermore\nIn our current situation right now we have there are a lot of people storing up first survival situations and\nThere are a religious groups such as the Mormons who are you know piling compiling surprise for for years to come for for some families\nWith multiple wives with multiple shelter with multiple multiple and um and we don't really know how that really hot it whether or not we are usable and we don't know even with\nTraining we don't know if the supplies what's known somebody in a cave or in a whole or in a ditch or whatever I mean\nSo I Would hurt it on your way to um fallen scare myself\nNot to consume companies suppliers but just chew on my cell and my child even I hesitate to say my child but I Would like to offer\nA myself to give her trial like for a year on one of the supplies without training without any\nKnowledge of how to use the supplies to just hear somebody could even his they themselves and interesting you don't really know even with these like Mormon families if there was a huge disaster you don't know who's going to survive that could be a child\nIt could be a twelve year old kid who hasn't had any training on how to use the supplies that are stored up with colds or or wherever I'm\nOkay well I think that's a really interesting proposal and I I I I just want to because there's a lot of listeners who are a latter day saints and so I just will be a clear for people most LDS do not practice plural marriage ran the overwhelming number of them do\nBut to her point I was watching on Netflix or there's this series called like the men with three wives zero three wives club or something I don't know\nBut it's about a renegade a Mormon sect community and everybody generally in the community has more than one wife\nAnd the following some of these and that's in Utah near Moab\nAnd um and they they they've already talked about saving up than having you know food for these big giant families to last for seven years that's a lot\nI mean and wouldn't even work Kennedy even work I don't know a ... but uh yeah so Aaron's willing to be a volunteer but um I think the only fair if you get to bring your kid a done is in a in Kent, Ohio I knew well until ... am done\nRather he I'm happy to have yeah and\nYou know I got a kick out of your commercial buffet ghost in the pawn shop in the record that was their name was Andy Gomez remember ... for the monsters yeah\nSure ... one of them is\nYou know a now now you mentioned the young lady mentioned about the

ask\nThat way but my question in their opinion I Want and we're looking now we're looking at what else is going to happen that we're missing we're missing all this done on purpose were missing something what is your opinion on that\nWell that's an interesting claim it that the the the marches on purpose or coordinated toward us I mean I I I think that you'll always see migrations and the good the long history just bring up the Bible again this\nIs that we're all immigrants right the Bible says that we we all move 'em and that would be you know all of the stories you a lot of the stories revolve around people just trying to get food just trying to move to get food and begging people to allow them to live in in space it has food\nSo I kind of see that as a perpetual thing not something new but\nYou know ... is er is er it's ... if it that's the smoke screen than what's behind it I guess we're supposed to wonder about or are you suggesting that something is going to come from the north\nUm while we're so busy looking south and east is that was that part of your implication\nInsurance that's kind of my question I mean all this happening at one show or something else
