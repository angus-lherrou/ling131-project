Madison Avenue security of the member anyway [noise]\nI I live\nWelcome to passport to retire now Frank Frank finance off every\nWeekend he brings asked his thirty five years of experience as we talk about retirement and of course he's here again today to get you up for advice as your journey to and through this exciting world of retirement Dale it's great to be here with you again we have got some news to talk about regarding the stock market don't we\nWe do it seems to be a having a little bit of a correction these these last couple of days\nI Know and I'm Wondering is this something you know that we should be concerned with\nWell you know when it's only a day maybe two days and you have to look at it sort of with a grain of salt you know they might be some profit taking because you know the market has been so strong so hot in ... almost overheated so it might actually be a healthy signed that people looking at and just take us profits off the table\nWhat do you think sparked the fall of the fact that everything's doing really good really well\nWell yeah that's part of it and I think also you know the feds are starting to look at interest rates so interest rates are coming up they're talking about maybe two or three more raises in the interest rates between now and the end of the year\nAnd when you really look at where money wants to be it really wants to be in safer places\nSo as interest rates rise people tend to want to pull money out of the market maybe cash and some of those gains and put it in safer places to get more interest on a on a fixed basis when he tends to move really from real estate stock market the bombs to six types of investments like CDs money market him in the in the back\nYou know might be healthy correction but you know you never know when it's so volatile time right now\nAll right let's talk about why are higher interest rates a problem\nAgain it depends it it can be a double edged sword right now\nThe United states has a tremendous amount of money out there in the form of bombs and treasury notes and T bills and really have to look at the rising interest rates that could be problematic because this huge national debt over our heads in excess of Twenty one trillion dollars with a T\nAnd the unfunded liabilities for Social Security prescription drug liability and Medicare\nSo whenever we have rises an interest rate than that impacts the ability for states to pay its own debt so as interest rates rise it costs us more money to pay those debts so can slow down the economy\nBut it could also put money on the stock market go to a fixed interest account so you know again and can have a positive impact but it could also possibly um custom inflation and we might be looking a little bit of inflation going into the future\nAll right so the higher interest rates for the consumer won't be as good but I guess if you have money in savings then you're going to be earning higher interest rates right\nOh sure in a sort of again a double edged sword because it's going to benefit consumers and the fact that they can earn more money on their savings\nBut on the other hand it also means arise in mortgage rates would can also for the slow the economy down because with rising interest rates less demand on housing it's a matter of fact I was I'm In California will this past week and I was talking to a real estate broker\nAnd she was telling me that the the real estate prices are starting to come down because of the higher interest rates on the mortgage so fewer sales bigger inventory so that the the real estate market is starting to come down a little bit in California\nAll right now what about the tech stocks what's particularly happening with that and they seem to be dropping right but why are they well you know\nWith with a high tech stocks um they've enjoyed a surge in value\nAnd I think again because they get up to a certain point I think people get nervous they look at how much the the tech stocks have gone up and they want to cash in so I really think you know as a gut reaction is knee jerk reaction people standing takes profits off the table\nAnd the tech stocks seem to be the ones that tend to go first 'cause they're the most volatile again and they want to want want to make sure that protect their uh their games and take them off the table\nAll right now do you think that this little dip here is the beginning of fall correction where it drops like twenty percent enjoyed very market gosh you know I don't have my crystal gallon hat [laughter] or does it\nIt doesn't work but if I was you know if I was guessing man\nAnd I feel pretty confident in the economy overall I think that the tax cuts that we've uh that we're experiencing hug at the beginning of this year have been a tremendous boost it you know putting more money to the economy and the market really has been relatively strong the economy's up to you know jobs market is positive so I think a lot of positive things going on\nIf I should say which way would I think of the market will be going I think this is just a a minor correction I don't think it's a trend in things to come but goodness you never know something could happen in the\nService restaurant petting zoo add sugar shack available for private parties come and join homemade ice cream and sunset views that west view farms east hill road in months and\n[noise] [noise] [noise] [noise] [noise] [noise] [noise] [noise] [noise]\nThis is the daily dived weekend edition I'm Oscar rumors and we're running down some of the top stories of the week and don't forget to check out the daily died Monday through friday for more news without the noise\n[laughter] I think one of the stories it's captured everybody's attention this week is that of the lottery the mega millions jackpot is the largest that it's ever been Powerball is going to have a big drawing over the weekend also\nI think between the both of them they're going to be given away one point three to one point four billion dollars in lottery Miranda if you won the lottery who would be the first person you'd call\nAnd I think I'd call my friend Meghan McCain because her family has been insanely wealthy forever [laughter] and so she's the only person I Know who would not try to get money out of yeah and she would know that people to call the ... maybe that leftover generation that's funny\nI thought you were to say something like hey now I'm as rich as you guys but [laughter] I I mean I might say that\nThe experts say that the first person you should be calling is actually a lawyer because there's a lot of stuff\nThat you have to deal with when you win the lottery a lot of times in states your name has to be publicly announced you can't get away I think there is only six states where you can't be named where you can remain anonymous oh it's crazy but just you know good luck to everybody out there playing\nFor the mega millions your chances of winning or one in three hundred and two point six million I Believe for winning the Powerball it's one in two hundred and Ninety two million\nSo and then the chances of winning both let's say you played everything\nOne in eighty eight ... and then I ... followed by Fifteen zeros so I'm inside the odds are crazy\nWe spoke to Rodrigo ... he's a reporter for the record in New Jersey and we talked to him about why you should be calling a lawyer first and how they can help you out\nKeep your mouth shut and call a lawyer towards winning a big I spoke to a uh Jason curling he's an attorney based in New York He's actually the silk acclaim lottery lawyer who's represented more than thirty lottery winners of ...\nI saw him at his name mentioned in a bunch of articles yeah he is the guy I guess you'd say the\nRight on this type of stuff and he said that's pretty much the first thing he told me before you speak to anybody call a lawyer particularly one that has experience in representing lottery winners them basically protected them from a lot of the pitfalls of winning so much money in such a short time\nRight 'cause people don't know what to do with all that money at first and the jackpot for the mega millions is nine hundred and Seventy million dollars if you take the cash option it's five hundred and forty eight million dollars is\nStill a ton of money one of the main pitfalls is a lot of states require you to be publicly announced it's like a matter of public record so you can't get away with being anonymous\nIn New Jersey I actually did another article trying to answer that question because a few months back the jackpot for the mega millions was also\nPretty large so people the the question that I get most frequently is\nTonight claim my jak anonymously if I win so I figured it out and unfortunately the answer is no you you really can't in New Jersey it's a matter of public record in other words if the average citizen is allowed to and encouraged to file what's called the public record request and\nThrough that you can obtain the name of any lottery winner\nBe a director actually of the state lottery said you know this is a very public game so we want people's names out there you know this is\nWe want people to know who's getting the money that they've spent on the statewide damn this lottery\nAnd you know a lot of people have also offered up well can I start a allow the er an entity to claim the pride rain James carry his his name director of the lottery he said yeah that's fine you can do that of course and they'll pay the jackpot to whatever entity you set up for that but your name will still be public record\nWow I I guess may maybe the only thing in that is that you could do a lay your name coming out because the the trustworthy Elsie might get first building\nAnd there's there's only six states where you can remain anonymous Delaware Kansas Marilyn North Dakota Ohio and South Carolina [laughter] you know pretty much anywhere\nYou're names and to get out there I I Know people have said you should get off the Internet immediately before you announce close your social media down if you have a landline making unlisted before skipped town if you can write when they're gonna announce it so that you're not there and you know you work in the media as you've seen when\nAnything major happens in the news\nThe media starts hunting down any pictures that they can of you or you know all the details because everybody wants to know so you know some experts instead close all that stuff down just to help avoid
