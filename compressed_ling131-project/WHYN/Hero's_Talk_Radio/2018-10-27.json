recognize that things are slowing down globally partially because of the fear of these trade wars with China\nDavid I Want to go back to those rising rates I Know that they can spell trouble for the overall economy but aren't higher interest rates really liberal retirees\nWill you know you're exactly right they are good for retirees a special retirees\nBy the way who pay down their debt right which is\nSomething I've talked about for Twenty years the fastest way to to reach retirement early is to pay your debt off so if you reached retirement and you and you don't have a mortgage payment you don't have a car loan and you're probably not using credit card or to borrow money if if you're doing well in retirement than the good news about race going higher\nIs that the rates on your money market and your checking account and CDs and again treasuries are going higher and at the end most retirees live off of the income that their retirement money produces\nSo the good news and I think there actually is a lot of good news I think I think before you know we will see tenure treasuries 'em over three and a quarter to even three and a half percent and there's talk that\nThe ten year treasuries could eventually get to four percent and the next Eighteen months and all of a sudden we have rates again that retirees will be able to look out and go wow you know what that's pretty good I can I can live off of those those income checks and so I think it is\nFor retirees it can actually be a very positive thing\nWe're speaking today with nine time New York times best selling author David Box well known financial educator about the recent market dropped I Know people listening who are in are nearing retirement David they want to know is this the beginning of a market correction\n[noise] so I should pull my crystal ball right now [laughter] right it's funny 'cause because here's nobody knows right ... ... what I what I what I Know and and we've been talking about this and maybe you know I've done other interviews on\nUm I Know that we're in we we've just had the greatest bull market of our lifetime I I Know that have you been in the markets even after the recession hadn't even after the markets pulled down if you just stayed the course today you have more wealth than you've ever had\nAnd at the same standpoint the last day two months I've been telling people don't get greedy [laughter] right like don't now is not the time to get greedy now's not the time to get complacent so it's very important if you are about to retire or you're already retired it's very important that you're not taking too much risk with your money because\nIf you're in your fifties in the markets pull back you can afford to take the time to let the markets recover but if you read tired your\n... your comfort level with seeing your money drops significantly is going to be lower\nSo it's really important I I just can't stress enough that when you're approaching retirement harder or you're already retired that you talked with a financial advisor that you work with a financial wise or if that if you have a financial wise right now that you\nUp the phone and paying attention to the news which I don't recommend you do call your financial advisor go back into their office\nSit down with them have them walk you through what you're invested a lot of people who are retired that might be fearful the stock market today actually have a very well we call very low exposure to the stock market like army people who are retired and they're worried about the stock market and\nHalf of their money isn't an annuity payment a guaranteed rate and half of their money in bonds and they've got a small percentage of the stock market under so uh but they read the news and they're very cheerful\nSo don't be fearful find out find out how much money do you actually have in the market how much risk are you taking and again I work with your financial visor I just a big believer that a\nA working with the professional ... which is what we recommend people work with the register investment advisor when you work for the financial ties are the most important part is that they do a financial plans were you that they ... they\nGet to understand what your comfort level with risk is and then they help you build an investment portfolio based\nOn your goals and\nYour comfort level with risk if you have a very low comfort level with it take any risk well then you should have less money in the market um but the key right now to notice when markets are pulling back the most important you can do\nCan link is just call your advisor don't panic sits still don't do anything every market pullback ultimately has had I Can't promise it will always out but I can tell you is always had a recovery right every single major market pull back\n... has had to recover and so I'm just a big long term believer that you wanted diversified portfolio high quality investments build off of financial plan working with a financial wise that you can trust that's there to hold your hand when it gets like this right now which is this is a rocky parts Marc\nDavid fantastic insight on this market drop once the silver lining here and all of this\n[noise] well I think the silver lining is how incredible when economy we have right now like let's not leave side of that now look at some of the numbers right now the lowest unemployment in America in forty nine years\nUnemployment's at three point seven percent right now\nWhat is that why is that because we have an incredibly strong economy right now so GDP which you know two years ago nobody believed that you could get to three percent well most people certainly did GDP right now the first half of the year three point two percent\nThere are predictions of the third quarter could be as high as four percent so the economy in the U.S super strong\nThings really are very very positive which is why by the way also we'd had stock markets hitting\nAll time high so just notice things the economy are strong this was a very normal time to see a pull back in the market if anything is probably very healthy\nWe're not going to work or right now and just the economy really well\nFor sure we seen economy\nDavid Baake always a pleasure thank you for your insides today and I get my pleasure thank you

some of the top stories of the week\nI don't have to check out the daily died Monday through friday for more news without the noise [laughter] for the ongoing stories that has been happening for a few weeks now is that of the Central American migrants caravan that it's making his way from Honduras\nThere's members from Guatemala and El Salvador as well the Trump Administration is planning to dispatch about eight hundred or more active duty troops to the southern border\nTo help stop the flow of migrants into the country defense secretary Jim Mattis is expected to sign an order sending the troops at the border bolstering the national guard forces that are already there\nThe additional troops would provide logistical support to the border patrol the plan is not yet been finalized or formerly announced but it is expected to happen for more on the migrant carbon we spoke to Ted has and he's an immigration reporter for Politico and we started off by talking about the president's reaction to the Caribbean and the implications for the midterm elections\nWe've seen the president talked up on this issue and this is nothing new I mean this goes back to the last\nTime there was a caravan back in April I mean I think the one difference we have here is we're now at the doorstep of November's midterm elections and this was a political issue for him obviously he really wants to make it about his policies and the need for a border wall versus what the Democrats and for what he characterizes as open borders\nHe's saying that these countries you know under a self Salvador Guatemala they're not doing enough to keep these people there I Know Mexico's National Guard there are so you know some military guys they put up a roadblock ate at one point but then they tore down right away\nI guess maybe there was too many people are they knew they weren't gonna be able to handle it the countries are doing something maybe just not enough and like I said now he wants to start cutting aid I think last year these three countries had more than a combined five hundred million dollars in funding from the U.S I think so far this year it's been about two hundred million dollars\nIn aid has been shrinking in recent years to begin with back in twenty Seventeen it was\nSomewhere around seven hundred million to mostly to these three Central American countries Honduras Guatemala and El Salvador and then in twenty Eighteen down to six hundred and Fifteen million and now it's been proposed by both the house and the Senate said bring it down somewhere in the five hundred million dollar range and the and the Trump Administration was actually asking for even lower\nSomewhere in four hundred million so even before all this happened President Trump was already proposing to cut aid to the Central American countries\nSo that in itself is nothing new I mean what is interesting though is that he doesn't want to do that on his own right these are bills passed by Congress and Congress will consider what amounts to give in Central American aid when the time comes\nAnd the president being very forceful on this stuff does give some political cover to Republicans who have to push this through because the Democrats are going to be on the opposite side of it with regards to the mid term do you know he's saying whenever you see these people come across in these criminals and\nUnknown middle Easterners and everything she the Democrats in mind we have to change our crappy immigration laws so he makes it about the midterms everything any provides a little covered by being forceful but\nIs there not much political will on the part of Congress to do something I'm there was some immigration bills that tried to pass this past year and none of them went through even some of the ones that the White House was backing\nI mean I think you really need to consider his words in the context of where we are right now only being two weeks away from the mid term and I think it is an issue that is really important to Republican voters and it\nSeems like it's going up an interest in recent weeks and less so for Democrats essentially as a way for them to mobilize their base to get them out to the polls now whether any of these proposals you know order wall slashing funding to Central America rewriting asylum laws I mean these are all\nAll really big projects and even maybe a year ago a little less than a year ago when Congress was working in a bipartisan fashion to address them they really struggled to do so and they weren't able to advance any legislation and the White House who pose the bills that had the most support\nSo it's hard to imagine that after the midterms with Democrats likely to take back some ground in the house is not when it entirely that they'd come back to the table and work out a better deal\nWhat has been the reaction from the leaders of these countries Honduras Guatemala El Salvador I Know the Mexican the incoming Mexican president has suggested that\nThe U.S Canada and Mexico work out some funding development for poor areas of Central America in southern Mexico where are these companies trying to do to reduce this type of migration\nThe presidents of the the northern triangle countries were up in Washington DC not too long ago for a summit was convened by the U.S and Mexico jointly to talk about these very issues\nAnd you know for the most part they're open to cooperating on security issues but there are clearly limitations in some cases those are economic limitations of not having the funding to do it and that's I mentioned before with us funding is being cut towards and they've got a project so Central America right now and then in other cases it's political and it's because of\nPolitical instability in their home country I mean indoors in particular is an example where I'm the president there one Orlando Hernandez is a strong us ally but one narrow reelection and doesn't really have much of a mandate to govern", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Hero's Talk Radio", "city": "Springfield", "day": "27"}
