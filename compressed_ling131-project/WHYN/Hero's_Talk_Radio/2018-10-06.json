you achieve the retirement that you're dreaming up\nAnd they will be again confidence of peace of mind to start to learn more about Dale and his team or why don't you check out their website it's Dale Frank financial dot com\nHas your journey into retirement maybe you're already there yeah I Would love to help you out and guide you Dale Frank financial dot com that's his website\nWe're talking about the importance of diversifying at cross asset classes which is probably the number one way to limit risking their portfolio they down how else can we protect against weak spots that might be working in a strategy\nWell Lou him there's a lot of different weeks plus we look at but I think one of the other ones that's very very important\nIs tax treatment so not having a diverse collection of account types that have a variety of tax treatments can be very risky also listen to help you avoid if you can taking on so much income in a given year the bumps showed a higher tax bracket\nSo you also want to find out ways to managed capital gains taxes were planning on selling off assets and attacks will investment account or even sometimes real estate assets to provide income\nWe all always look at ways to minimize taxes one to take income when to take Social Security benefits all have an impact of your tax strategy so the chemical\nIs not only to minimize your tax burden but also to revive yourself for the flexibility to just the mouse you getting from a specific income source\nSo your overall asset based functions as tax efficiently as possible even as your personal circumstances and other factors change\nIncluding what could happen with the tax code because you know when we have this window right now with the Trump tax code where your standard deduction some purse exemptions are very high meaning you're paying taxes on a less and less money and the tax bracket the rate of taxation in those tax brackets I'm also come down\nSo there's a lot of things that we can do to basically be as tax efficient as possible and that will also help to extend the life of your assets and protecting against longevity risk right so yeah ... and that's important to look at right\nExactly because like you said taxes are kind of on sale right now we don't know when it's going to change again it may change you know and another couple of years with the new administration we just don't know so\nNo well we just don't know and you know I think it's a good idea to have your retirement assets and different types of accounts he could have a mix of tax profiles and by tax profiles I mean let's look at tax deferred like\nFor one case traditional areas where the money put in his ... tax but the money comes out as a distribution is\nThen we look at things like tax exempt a investments mainly rough IRAs raw for one case where the money is taxed on the way in but it comes out tax free and then finally looking at taxable ... such as a portfolio stocks bonds and mutual funds\nThat are not part of an IRA four one K. so pretty much any type of investment that as an elder qualified or tax exempt account\nNow down how can tax diversification help protect your assets fan certain risk could you explain that sure\nHaving your assets in a mix of a ... an account types occurred different tax obligations does give you flexibility in how you manage your assets to produce income for retirement but basically you want to give yourself options you want to have the ability to draw from different sources do retirement as market conditions and other factors dictate\nAnd to do so without pushing yourself into a higher income tax bracket\nI Believe you want to keep the flexibility in your portfolio mix and match you withdraw types to your best tax advantage given the contacts environment because as we just discussed all those things are going to change over time this is a window I Believe\nSafe suffered losses in your portfolio having the option to make withdrawal doesn't create a taxable event on top of the ... declined can be helpful\nFor a lot of people I Believe it makes sense to take withdrawals from a combination of account managing the timing it amounts of those withdrawals can be tricky\nGiven the complexity of tax laws\nSo it always suggest that people work with a financial intact professional in concert for guidance because getting withdrawals right from the tax perspective can literally saving thousands and thousands of dollars in tax revenues and also increase the amount of time of your assets will be there for you during during your retirement during your lifetime\nRight he's definitely when they don't want to pay more taxes than you should have I mean of course you want to do it legally but if you can keep more of your pocket that's the name of the game quit before we have to end are showing it talked about the role that Social Security plays in an overall retirement strategy\nWe do talk about Social Security alone is sort of one of my pet peeves because it is a complex system it does figure to market risk it does figure into taxes and I sing market risk because if you have\nAdequate Social Security benefits and let's say a portfolio is going backwards and you really don't want to take money out of those retirement accounts if you don't have to win the markets are retracting a little bit or correcting\nSo sometimes I ... I suggest to folks that maybe you need to look at Social Security a little bit differently and not always take it as soon as possible\nAnd all the excuses that I've heard in the past all the reasons that people saying well what if I'm not here or what if the Social Security systems out here I Want to take it as soon as possible that also means there's a significant reduction in the mouth you get from Social Security benefits\nAnd we've talked about this numerous times ... that the higher the Social Security benefit to lower the taxes can be under certain circumstances\nSo by differing\nTaking Social Security to a later time whether it's full retirement age for most most folks in today's world it's sixty six or even different to Seventy you get a higher Social Security benefits increasing by as much as eight percent per year from for retirement age Seventy which is significant\nAnd we think of yeah it really is um most people that I Know today don't have a guaranteed rated retirement of eight percent per year and a portfolio but yet the Social Security system doesn't Christian benefits by ... percent per year\nThirty two percent higher for made sixty six to Seventy and all the way I'm Social Security benefits or tax law when\nThere's a ... a formula called provisional income equation that equation because you get special tax treatment and the maximum amount of your Social Security benefits that you pay taxes on is eighty five percent\nSo if you can exclude up to Fifteen Percent of your Social Security benefits from the overall tax tax rolls and if you can make less and less we so security benefits taxable\nAnd also coordinate your income through tax free investments like ... that can also be helpful in maintaining a lower tax rates so keep in mind the role of Social Security benefits and how it impacts your tax liability overall that\nThing how can we make sure that our retirement plan is strong enough and can lead to the storms and there's just so much to consider here\nWho in everything has to fit in its proper place and there's a complex system and there is a domino effect at times is to do we take too much risk on on a portfolio if we do take too much risk than the market correction could have a huge impact on the way you're investing money we have to look at taxes and make sure it's tax efficient so\nCreating an implementing a tax efficient strategy and looking at the investment types in converting your assets into retirement income does present a complex set of challenges\nAnd challenges I don't think you should just put in the hands of anyone that's why we're here we do it every day we've been doing this for a long time when my personal experiences over for almost forty years\nYou don't want to just put your assets\nThere is a domino effect at times has to do we take too much risk on on a portfolio if we do take too much risk than the market correction could have a huge impact on the way you're investing money we have to look at taxes and make sure it's tax efficient so\nCreating an implementing a tax efficient strategy and looking at the investment types and converting your assets into retirement income does present a complex set of challenges\nAnd challenges I don't think you should just put in the hands of anyone that's why we're here we do it every day we've been doing this for a long time alone at my personal experience is over for almost forty years you don't want to just put your assets in the hands of anyone you need a gentle and financial professional when you call one eight hundred six Seventy five five one five\nYou'll gain access to one of our firms trained experienced professionals one who will sit down with you and look at your personal situation look at the big picture talk with you about your income goals you need you want and based on that conversation provide you with what we call her passport to retirement that's developed based totally on your individual circumstances input\nIf you'd like to sit down was give us a call at one eight hundred six seven to five five one five that number again is one eight hundred six Seventy five five one side\nThis is passport to retirement Dale Frank I'm Lou ...\nThat next week and they'll give you more helpful advice to guide you and your journey two and three of retirement that never again to call eight hundred six seven to fight by one by\nSharing jeeze measured here in our backed by the claims pain ability and financial strength of the issue were\nSecurity through Madison Avenue securities El Al the member ... an S.

out the daily died Monday through friday or more news without the noise [laughter]\nNobel Prizes were also being awarded this past week one of the more interesting a Nobel Prize is awarded was for that in medicine physiology or medicine and went to two people Dr James Alison and test Sudoku on Joe\nFor discoveries that led to a new way to treat cancer by targeting the body's immune system rather than the tumors themselves a it's led to a host of new drugs him you know therapy it's quite expensive but\nPeople are saying that it works pretty well on a certain types of lung cancer and melanoma which is a form of skin cancer\nSo for this story we spoke to Peter loft is he's a reporter for the wall Street Journal we started off by asking who are these Nobel Prize winners James Alison ...\nBoth of them that specialize in immunology\nStudying the body's immune system this turned out to be a critical part of what they discovered and to put it in context if you think about the mainstay of cancer treatment over the years things like chemotherapy and radiation which were effective I Know are active in certain situations but\nBut it can also be blunt instruments and the sense that\nThey can destroy healthy cells in the body along with cancer cells and so that's kind of the causes all sorts of complications going back about Fifteen Twenty years there was another advance in cancer treatment and that was the target genetic mutation in cancer cells now\nThis immune based approach it sort of the new wave and one of the more significant approaches to treating catcher in the long time\nThese two scientists working separately but it in parallel discovered features about the body's immune system that led them to figure out that have used certain kinds of drugs to target immune system cells in a certain way it'll basically better equipped to the body's own immune system to go after and destroy cancer cells\nSo exactly how does it work I was reading a lot about checkpoints and how a lot of this stuff let's T cells basically attack the cancer cells it's T cells are form of white blood cells and this is where the magic really comes through in\nI mean what's so interesting about what they discovered was that the body's immune system as sort of its own\nNatural checkpoints or break so that it doesn't go overboard and attack the healthy parts of the body cancer cells have basically figure it out how to exploited and so they in some way they sort of latch on to the break about his immune system in a way that helps him escape describing destruction and so these drugs\nThat have come out of the research from both sides is essentially take breaks off of the body's own immune system to go after cancer cells in a way that they wouldn't have been able to do otherwise\nSome of the drugs that have been able to be developed because of their research I've seen these commercials for these on TV a key true to end up even though I think it was former President Jimmy Carter who said that he is key true to to treat his melanoma and it worked out very well for him\nI think a lot of people have become aware of them through those things may be hearing about Jimmy Carter taking the true to and yes the TV commercials now are promoting\nThe use of evil and true to I think primarily lung cancer because lung cancer is one of the more common types of cancers and then one of the most deadly these drugs have shown some promise\nThe research still obviously continues they're finding out that these things help treat those things but you know it's not a hundred percent success rate so the next step is to find out why it works the way it does work and then who would benefit most from it there's also a cost things some of these immunotherapy can cost upwards of a hundred grand per person so\nThat has to be figured out as well but Dr ... himself is even said this is a work in progress but he you know confident in his own work\nIn progress of these treatments says by the end of the century cures could be found or you know just even more therapies can be developed to help out with this stuff\nThe studies have shown that as welcoming as these drugs are and as much as they represent an advance struggle alone I think for the most part only works in a minority of patients that we see that in the study what's striking to doctors about these drugs is that in that minority patients they can have a lasting effect that can help people\nLive in some cases for years to the trick now is to try to better\nProtect in which patients these drug will work and by doing things like ... Singh tumors and then also studying different combinations of the drugs to\nSee if like two or three of them together can do better than one alone and as you mentioned I mean you mentioned the cost that approach is going to compound the cost factor in the sense that you that there are huge drug alone is real\nItaly expensive and so combining them just going to be even more of a financial burden\nThese are effects that we're seeing that from things that they've been doing for eight years beyond that even you know longer than that that they've been looking into this stuff specifically Dr Alison the American he has a very intimate relationship with cancer of family members had cancer she had a bout with cancer it's been around him for a long time", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Hero's Talk Radio", "city": "Springfield", "day": "06"}
