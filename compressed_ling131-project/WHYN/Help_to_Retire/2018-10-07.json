I hate to say this but ultimately every married couple one's going to land up a widow or widower that are hauled\nBeing human all it's nothing you want to really talk about an awful lot of deal but you do need to plan and say listen\nYou know as my for example is my wife capable of taking over this portfolio that I've been self administer himself invested investor\nAll and making my own decision with very little guidance as she capable or desirous of doing that or vice versa all in many cases they say listen I my forte of something else I Know nothing about the stock market but you need to line up that advisors going to help her through the process before it happens not afterwards\nRight absolutely and again I'm a ... [laughter] this is something that and I'm going to ask if you have you ever run into where where you know somebody somebody dies and and they realize oh my gosh this is the wrong beneficiary but it's too late at that point\nOh I've run into the more you think ... was was more often at a conference telephone ... until the day\nWe call the custodian with a very large oil rate and then the recorded conversations speaker phone in my office and I do record the conversation as well as the particular transition we were talking to the custodian then I said you know oh ... by the way who is the primary beneficiary of this man's IRA\nHis wife a sitting right there and we're waiting all we hear on the other line is la ... [laughter] I said you do have a primary beneficiary on this higher rate and this is a six bracket Hyun six rocket irate and the person said no we have no benefits round this account at all oh gosh well I\nThink about this how many thanks to you know that the name was different ten years ago the name on that same building was different Fifteen Years ago right there's a lot of acquisitions and transfers going through and every time someone acquires a particular entity\nYou know you got this database over here trying to interface new database of people choir them usually something gets lost in this particular case in Britain fishery designations were not brought over okay\nThat me and what's the significance of that you say well the bottom line is the spouses still probably going to get the money but they're gonna have to go to ... to get it\nGood well again I here's the thing now it'd be a great opportunity a great time to get richer to call go on and sit down and talk about it sorted I'll I'll make sure it's right\nSteve it all boils down to talk to them all these different pieces with financial posts will need to fit together in together nicely\nGive us a call right now will set up an initial no cost consultation\nWe'll talk it through all the different puzzle pieces over a cup of coffee that you need to consider for instance how about the\nLevel of risk you're really taking I always liked that does it is they tell me all they've got to my broker tells me I have a balanced account and I say well what does that mean you got one barefoot in a bucket of cold water and the other foot barefoot isn't a bucket of hot water or you balance then what does it mean so we take a look at the actual assets\nPeel it away and determine what the real risks level is\nIs it appropriate for your age and the amount of risk ... and the return you're getting how about your sees how much you're really paying fees and commissions\nWith your current plan we could run for ... and uncover many of the hidden sees you may not know that you're eating paying taxes what about tax implications of your state is is there a way to save money in taxes down the road by planning proactively now prior planning prevents poor performance\nOkay so obviously there's a whole lot we need to discuss we found that most people just have a plan thoroughly enough to address all of these issues some of them yes but not on them so if you've been a managing your retirement money by yourself and you're not realizing maybe for the first time that a lot of these issues you have not been addressed\nLure if you are now realizing that your current planner where as long as there hasn't been helping you think through all these issues as thoroughly as they should be doing this is your chance for a true holistic and comprehensive plan was due to put in place\nAnd if you come right now and you're in the next two callers normally we would get the financial review in the second opinion

let's do this\nWaking news sound or Steve break the news guy yeah my brand new movie with Rudy Rudy sure that you remember the movie Rudy Rudy Rudy movies of all time twenty five years ago it came out and other re release and get to studios here in the in the fall\nBut we went to Notre Dame being a good group of producers and directors and walked the campus with the real rooting not the not shown Ashton the actor we film that last year last April and Notre Dame so about a year and a half ago and now our movies out it's called Rudy Rudy sure the walk on\nAnd it's a full length motion picture and it's available right now on Amazon Prime\nView on primary means of all you know I just want to ask you one question how many yards and how many carries ... [laughter] no not really ... you remember watching that movie I haven't watched I watched the original one could have we seen about twenty five times and I'll admit I cried each time I watch it raised about a little guy overcoming adversity\nRudy smaller than I Am and he was playing football at Notre Dame like a dream come true yeah so are\nWe walked around campus in all the places you saw in the movie we went to and then then and people recognize some people still recognize Rudy there in a great movie ...\nMembers here again and then the state uh-huh yeah everyone was shooting specialist there some other ... famous people in there too but it's a really good movie about overcoming adversity and and and not letting people tell you it can't be done to throw engine that could kind of thing and so he's a real good guy\nReally excited about the movie and\nAnyway that's that's good news and they are very good news and I've been invited to be in us another movie coming up here in two thousand Nineteen it'll be out it's called the last blockbuster poet rarely tell me everything news over\nLast blockbuster down memory blockbuster I Do I mean did Chuck you absolutely I remember going to blockbuster and then you spend a lotta time perusing all the videos and then you finally find one you want you go up to the\nFront desk and they say they're all sold out there are all your begging me almost want to give them a five dollar to make money I think a slip of five to go look in the return box always about turning videos like check it out yeah so please be kind rewind member that oh God yeah\nSo that last blockbuster you guys I probably you probably heard me talk about what is there were three of them a couple of years ago two of them in Alaska they're both gone okay she'll give us a hit us this east or west of the Mississippi was west of the Mississippi west or is it in Vegas notes in Bend Oregon never get that no\nSo uh I don't know why a lot of retirees there has got a lot of time on our hands are those that don't use digital\nWho you know they had a chance to buy Netflix for pennies and I passed up on it [laughter]\nSo chicken yourself into NATO or yeah but so that's what we find that will be able to talk about that but it's just going to be fun I'm going to work there for a day or you know um it yeah and also very cool and then they're going to interview me a quote unquote working there and a belt my experiences with blockbuster in the past you know I think he would blockbuster all the time was when you turn the tape\nWhen you go up to their box out there you throw it in the box right we had no yeah no proof that you put the take back in the bud right right yeah no I bought it by their mailbox kind of thing you know drive up and throw it in there and then\nIt's up to them to say you really turned back in if not sort of like uh you ever had never library books back into they check a book out in the exit overdue but it may be forgotten sort of back in all summer so they they sent you a bill for like fifty dollars typically costs twenty [laughter] so that's what they did with his videotaped sue if if you didn't turn it back in ... a lot of money yeah\nAnd there was no recourse I mean you had no way no way of ... so it was it was a he said she said they had I have to be very careful on that so anyway that I thought I'd share that because we're we're positive about these movies and I want a couple of days before because of a group inviting people out there like Peter demand is\nOne of the three guys behind SpaceX\nAnd everyone's heard of Richard Branson and Eli must course but Peter do you mind this is the brains I think behind the operation and and so that one too and he's a couple of years ago called the vision ear and you'll look around that society these days there's always somebody trying to do something to make things better\nAnd then there's always someone trying to do things worse too about the bank they're charging fees on people so\nDisruption they call it Amazon dot com is has just written well first of all disrupted the book selling industry now is disrupting everything you know after you get ours I guess you get an Amazon a bank and everything I wouldn't banquet Amazon by the way\nBooks from a but actually we supply why we buy paper towels and beverages and everything from 'cause it's a lot cheaper can be wise to just press a button that it is to have to go out and go shock and if you lived in New York City or if you lived in a skyscraper think about it but when when you want to go shopping back to the day you'd have to that's all day event\nSometimes ... the elevator as broke as he had walked down thirty like oh here's a taxi cab which I'll have my own it's its own funny games there and you're ready to go to a store buy the food luggage back into the cab we'll get back up the steps\nAll day if they are right or you press one button on Amazon deliberate your door the FedEx and UPS men are too happy about the Post's band flights of stairs I'll tell\nYou what I got seven grandkids that's how we give them they probably since we don't touch it it gets sent right to their houses all wrapped up in looks pretty\nTalking about what makes me excited the Amazon gift card 'cause I mean you get anything you want their editors to get something you don't want like when I was younger and we would get underwear for Christmas [laughter] oh gosh I myself\nI don't know I saw an article of the Jeff Bezos view that German of the company they said he makes one point five million dollars a day if I just wanted on interest a non profit on Iraq on ... on his wife and that's pretty nice pretty nice yeah that's like the whole kind of money [laughter]\nSo we look at the are going to quickly touch on this and then when we were on the next thing we're going to go through what we call brokers behaving badly unfortunately this is a story or more every day we finally have to go down to one a week but I'm looking at something called the art or retirement here that we're designing and it's about when you look at an artist\nAnd artist starts with a blank piece of campus and then it's up to him or her to make a masterpiece\nAnd if you gave me a blank piece of campus in a in a paint brush I'd make a mess that well that's how that went on to hoard all that so that's happening a lot of times when the financial world how do you know the plan or you're dealing with is Israel is an artist a financial artist how do you know\nIf they're working for a big institution you trusted that big institution has looked at it but how do you really know if they're putting a plan together\nBased on what you have and so let's say that uh you you give the artist you have to Blake canvassing you give them some uh some yellow paint\nSome blue paint and some red paint and they pay just red yellow and blue on the painting", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Help to Retire", "city": "Springfield", "day": "07"}
