{"month": "10", "state": "MA", "station": "WHYN", "content": "And that is interesting I think that's very important to combat this notion of you're not safe in one of these settings because you're already sharing it with somebody else and what if they bring somebody creepy back to the room or something\nSo that's good that they are eliminating that so hopefully there is more of a sense of security there I think I'm has these already I liked to have my own room and\nBut the one in the outskirts of beautiful room it's a hundred and twenty five yeah but if I Can't bring anybody back you know I cannot friends back I'm not saying\nI'm not saying that\nSo you hospitals expanding in the U.S trying to show these old identities we'll see if they gain in popularity thank you Miranda thank you ask a\nTask\n[laughter]\nJust has to be my favorite story of the week I'm a Southern California guy I grew up here and I love Disneyland I Love going there\nIt is one of the happiest places on the earth and we found this article in the wall Street Journal about the big secret the Disney World and Disneyland have\nThat it's a favorite spot for people to scatter the ashes of their family members once they've passed these think it's like one of the ultimate tribute said you can have their Miranda real quick if you were going to have your ... and where would you have them spread\nIt probably Indiana Jones 'cause that's my favorite right\nI Would go on space mountain and I just want somebody to throw me up in the air so that it gets all over everyone and everything I worried they're going to sweep you at the end of the night that's what happens actually so\nWe spoke to Eric Schwartz all he's a reporter for the wall Street Journal and he spoke to several families who have actually done this they were very forthright about it they snuck the ashes in the spread them out in different places\nDisneyland holds a really special place in a lot of people's hearts and it just makes sense that people would want to have it be their final resting place oh here's ... with more about the big secret from Disneyland\nI'm so glad to hear you say that it made a lot of sense to it made a lot of sense to me to it without something I'd ever thought about but whenever I heard that this was a popular place it spread ashes it was like oh of course people love going to Disneyland it makes sense that someone want to spend eternity there and when I started talking to the custodians who work in both parks\nThey told me Oh yes it's very much a thing of always been these rumors about it but it does happen\nAnd it so much to the point that they have a code word for it or they say it's a habit clean up so\nIf you are a worker who sees what you suspect are human ashes maybe left on the seat of a ride or something like that you radio over and you say we have a clean up and that means you need to grab the hyper allergenic vacuum because the custodians will then come by and if they do indeed identified the substance of human ashes they will\nCome up in a vacuum and clean it up while everyone you know leave the premises and\nGoes on to other right before they can come back\nDisney custodian say that it happens about once a month that they actually notice it it could be happening a lot more so that's a lot of frequency we were talking about a really quick about how much it makes sense that people would want this to be part of their final resting place\nIn the article you you detail somebody who said that they would go to Disneyland with their dad and he worked like the graveyard shift but when he was at Disneyland he was a completely different person happy go lucky and she was like can we stay here forever so it really means\nSomething to a lot of people to be in this location give us a couple of examples of how people are spreading these ashes like what are they doing and you know where are they doing it all that stuff\nI spoke with six families who have spread ashes at Disney Parks\nAnd they do follow a bit of a pattern they know they're not supposed to do it so they have to get creative\nSeveral of them smuggle the ashes in prescription pill bottles you know I've talked to one woman who said you know she had the very surreal experience of empty and her father's or in in the hotel bathroom\nInto a pill bottle that she could then smuggle path park security while others will simply put them in Ziploc bags and put them at the bottom of a purse or an ...\nThat that's gotten through security as well and then once they're inside if they want to maybe spread it on a specific ride they might wait until the rights particularly dark so no one sees them other times they'll just go to a flower bed or a part of the park that doesn't seem like there are a lot of people around\nNow I did speak with one woman who's in the story who and two thousand nine for the ashes of her mother at one point while she was doing it she was sort of overcome with grief and she hopped over the barricade surrounding the lawn outside Cinderella Castle\nAnd ran across the grass flinging them as she ran out and it's a pretty dramatic statement and she says no one stopped her and I have photos of the sit\nThere and I just saw the you know so [laughter] so it definitely happen and so it's like wow if if someone running across Cinderella lawn for a ashes doesn't get notice I mean I Can't imagine how many people do this and never get caught but you're right that in talking to ... thirty in the consensus that I arrived that was that it happened about once a month\nBut I've heard stories of it happening more frequently I heard stories of there being some downtime where they might not have one for a while but in my story alone I had six examples ranging from Nineteen Ninety six to last week\nHow did you find these people like how did they come forward I mean I I I think the ... says that if anybody is caught doing this there'll be escorted off property but I don't think there's been any arrests or anything related to this house so how did these people come forward to you\nThere haven't been any arrests that we know of the Anaheim police department says they couldn't recall any arrests being made on this kind of thing you know the people that I spoke to they were pretty public about the fact that they had spread ashes at Disney\nSo it was the pride that you know at this point\nAlso I should say like even though I think most of them found a bit of a bit of humor and the whole act they they definitely it was an extremely emotional experience and something that they also saw and interpreted as honoring their loved one final wishes\nSo it was something that they were really touched by an and actually quite eager to share it with me\nYou've touched a little bit on where the spread these ashes a lot of times flower beds Bush is on the lawns outside even in the park gates [laughter]\nI Love the quote someone said that the hunted mentioned probably has so much human ashes in it that it's not even funny and that's one of those places obviously we know what the hundred mentioned right is all about spooky and what not and it's like the perfect places to drop the ashes it gives the all new meaning in the next time I'm going to be they're going to be like trying to look for human ashes there\nWhile I take that as the ultimate compliment I mean I think the I think I heard\nSo many examples that I can say safely say that human ashes have been spread all over these parks the hunted mansion is definitely the most popular destination but it's a small world also had quite a strong showing based mountain pirates of the Caribbean I mean\nReally if you think about it they're probably been human ashes spread there and I don't quite know why they ... the hunted Manchin is so\nI mean obviously it's on theme right for the practice but in talking to people who work in the hot I mentioned they describe just to sort of general obsession among certain fans\nWith the haunted mansion I also think that it's probably strategically a pretty good spot because it's very dark and there are a lot of places where you can sort of in conspicuously into it\nIs not only an investment advisor if I Do this year he but he has a sub specialty is all our people do and this thing is Social Security\nSo I always rely on a backup but again\nIf you've got a divorce she can she claim under her ex husband who was a big wage earner a rather you know collecting on hers and let her go into four to eight percent and grow on her personal account till she's Seventy\nThat can work for a lot of divorces or you know when you talk about a married couple a you know they they want to postpone and get that eight percent increase on the big Social Security check I just had a couple of just leave a little while ago\nThe wife was a wage earner executive at mass mutual\nAnd uh she made a considerable amount of money and has a nice ... you want that to ... percent and grow and grow and grow okay so how do you get the income coming in to talk about getting a spouse or Ken Kenny spouse you know take one half of that amount of money at full retirement\nAnd use that as as casual to allow the other one to defer their largest Social Security check until they're Seventy\nSo it was all kinds of different ways still to increase your lifetime total ... received\nAnd more importantly you know if one person pass the way you want that bigger check to be as big as possible because you've got to choose between a small check and the big check for\nRight well and obviously you're going to take the ... the public sector\nEmployees has an entirely different retirement program oh I Know is down in Atlanta years ago studying the federal program again ... is our internal expert on public sector employees as well uh and uh you know\nThose those federal employees land up transferring to a very high metropolitan cost of living they strap on a pistol on the side of their hip as another ten percent right there et cetera et cetera you can crank that last three years and increase your retirement income is a federal employee very very significantly so you can't do that so so scary that's for sure\nWell he'll fraud I mean you end up being a genius twelve it's got to be All right not bad not bad at all oh so you mentioned the divorce benefit talk about that a little bit because I still think there's a lot of people that don't fully understand what that is and how beneficial that can be\nWell again there are so criteria is or if you've been married to an end can prove it to somebody for at least ten years\nOr you are still single and you know you take a look at going down the ... ministries we put a packet together for the people you're walking there at the marriage certificate you walk in there with a divorce decree now and they will pull up your ex spouse is a Social Security account\nAnd say well listen at at sixty six or that person is so scary count as acts a and one half of that is let's say a thousand bucks [noise]\nAnd uh your ear so scary short for whatever reason was to be more realistic to let's say today\nA ... his Social Security or her as the the ex spouse is twenty five hundred dollars per month you know you can get one half of that that's twelve fifty as long as it's you know greater than than your Social Security check bank some criteria is but again the big benefit of claiming your spouse or even on divorce\nIs it allows your account to continue to grow your account is not touched it girls eight percent every single year from sixty six run up to Seventy then you switch over backed yours and it's a much much bigger check\nNice and and again the the uh the only one of the other stipulations is is that ex spouse has to have already filed for Social Security\n[noise] yes uh that is a situation you can't control or you're not going to want to go in there and claim it at any earlier okay because you're going to take a hit there\nSo there's a lot of ifs and dust to be dotted and teach to be crossed but just knowing you have that right and you do the calculations we can do and say yes it's a strategy you ought to pursue it you know you're going to be all put some money in your checkbook now and see your future income grow dramatically why not look at it\nAbsolutely so what about what about all I filed for Social Security oh crap I didn't mean to I Want to do it again is that possible\nYou're going to do over a as long as you make a quick decision and change your mind within the first year of collecting your Social Security\nSo the good news is yes you can change your mind do retake and start over again the bad news is you've got to pay back the money they gave you within that year oh okay so that takes a lot of fun out of that particular situation of sulfur Ninety nine point nine percent of the human beings off there when they claim Social Security\nIt's a done deal sure and again you know if it's the whole thing of of Social Security and claiming strategy and the and the number of ways they can do it especially if you're if you're you know married um wow I mean that's it's a complicated complex process and and we need help\nWell whether you're married or have a a ex spouse who was a major region are much over the years there's all kinds of different components so we bring a client in were able to take that data\nPut it through some pretty sophisticated software come up with at least three different scenarios and uh they will show you when you should apply who should apply between a married couple and how they should apply and what's the effect is based on your life expectancy which means we need to interview you and talk about your family your DNA\nOr your your life expectancy expectations and you know you're going to come up some very different scenarios\nSure well again if if we get your interest in and do you know you want to learn more about Social Security and and really talk with the experts are I'd like to open up the phone was Richard let's invite folks to give us a call at ... come on and sit down and

nicely give us a call right now will set up an initial no cost consultation we'll talk it through all the different puzzle pieces that you need to consider for instance ...\nThere is level you're

changed the level of market\nYou can find out what your investments really are costing you because of high fees or conditions what those future tax implications will be and and even more important than that how how much income you can actually securely generate from that once you do move into retirement that number once\nAgain eight hundred nine to zero sixty six eighty six eight hundred nine two zero six six eight seven\nFour we come back we're going to talk about financial dignity and tell you what financial dig and they really should maybe [noise]\n\nYou're listening to the financial pottery means [noise]\nFor the financial safari news network on Steve's at all yeah who was agreed to pay fifty million dollars in damages and provide two years of free credit monitoring services to about two hundred million people whose email addresses and or their personal information was stolen is part of the biggest security breach in history\nThe restitution hinges on federal court approval of the settlement filed this week in a two year old lawsuit seeking to hold Yahoo accountable for digital burglaries that occurred in twenty Thirteen and fourteen but weren't disclosed until twenty sixteen\nAbout three billion Yahoo accounts were hit by hackers\nThat included some link to Russia by the FBI [laughter] [noise] New York giants quarterback Eli Manning has teamed up with a visa and USA Today and launched a video game that teaches financial literacy to kids\nIt's called financial football three point O. here to weigh in on that as America's well coach and best selling author ... ... what do you think\nWill save us never to sooner too late to plan for retirement showing or financial planning and when we're talking about if you're listening right now and you're getting close to retirement if you're fifty to an older your and what I call the financial red zone\nAnd now it's time to assess your retirement strategies keep in mind hope is not a strategy I Know when people play the lottery they're hoping right trying to find out how realistic your retirement plan is probably realistic expectations\nAnd it's very important to begin creating the income now that you need and retirement use some of your growth portfolio to set up a safe stable income producing foundation\nOf your portfolio you don't have a true retirement plan unless you have safe stable retirement income that will come for the rest of your life so most people have Social Security but not much else but they have a lump sum of the four one K. let's figure out how much of that four one K. you can put aside and devote to lifetime income you'll never have to worry about save the more income to better the more streams of income to better\nCoach great insight as always\nAnd finally today stupid criminal comes to us from Topeka, Kansas this genius was just released from jail and thought it was a good idea to steal a car in the jail park\nCops knew it was thirty three year old Kevin Jones because it was all captured on camera but before officers could chase him down they got a nine one one call reporting someone breaking into a car about six blocks away you guessed it it was Jones trying to steal card number two he was arrested\nAnd the other car that was found around the corner Jones was out of jail for less than an hour that said for now join us again next time I'm Steve set off for the financial safari news network [noise]\nLooking back into financial safari consumer advocate Thomas let's come here with you in Studio alongside the coach America's well financial and income\nCoach coach Pete the ruder he is a best selling author winner of many awards including XP's ... again like I said earlier in the program I could go on and on in Studio with us as well as Chris the rocket man brought our now coach you were talking about financial dignity before the break and it reminded me I'm going to\nUh open up and probably get left out a little bit here [laughter]\nWay and again yesterday when I was a a pre teens and you gotta think like eleven twelve year old Thomas ah there was a band called ... and that was very popular back in the day that there were these kids they all had long hair\nSo I had grown my hair out because I thought it was cool and trendy I go into a gas station one day to pick up a bottle of pop bottle a coke or whatever and the ah clerk their refers to me as a female instead of a male ... cut my hair the next day some little dignity example there just to kick off the segment\nHow how long your hair sandwiches down on my show I've seen like would you would not much here at all you have yeah is that after the the episode there you go [laughter] or time is on a ... a dignity that right that's right\nWell yeah it's it's on again your terms so financial dignity though you know doing what you want when you want where you want with whom you want that's financial baked into ... and we see so many people every single week that come in from the show we talk to them\nAnd they are wondering if they have what they need put aside and places they should have it to get to the retirement they want to have\nAnd unfortunately well fortunately or unfortunately unfortunately sometimes they don't but fortunately there are they're thinking about it so that we can get them on that right past mhm we call it a critical thinking\nAnd its benefits we look at the benefits of of what what you're doing right now versus the benefits of something you could be doing who should I mean so it's features advantages and benefits and why would you make a decision that didn't benefit you completely and as much as more of than anything else out there yeah\nI I Would imagine it's just not making the true comparison not not nearly being educated\nYeah we go through what we call the financial stress tests with every single item that is in your current portfolio while and then we compare that to what we would recommend is independent financial produce areas we can go out across the world and find things that make sense to you one of the things that are largely I keep seeing it over and over again from people that come in from other planners\nIs these other planners are pushing like crazy these days something called a real estate investment trust otherwise\nKnown as a rate OK hoarding called rats before two lines that that is a real estate investment trust is when they're being pushed by financial professionals they get a pretty good commission see that's why they pushed that and many times it comes right out of your return ooh okay so if you are right out of the money put in so let's say that with a hundred thousand dollars into a real estate investment trust\nAnd the person you're buying it from is not a true for do Sherry the hundred thousand dollars you put in Ninety One thousand or so goes to work for you guess where the other nine thousand ghosts or as a gift dominant women's draw a line to\nTalk of the person sounded okay now does that make sense no and that's all right so that's an immediate loss now you have for the year right unless it I mean what's that real estate goes up like crazy now\nHere's the thing and that's bad enough that I think you agree that's bad isn't it a risk does that make you met data it does I mean that's almost ... percent right there I went to Harris Teeter shopping center to buy a half gallon ice cream for five dollars\nYou give the person five dollars and of course tax cuts that on there to see how you get to the person five dollars and fifty cents [laughter] and what they do is they take your gallon ice cream to take this big knife you see like a ginsu knives\nRemember these to cut through the cans with it and then to cut through a tomato I remember the ... the ginsu knives out and they take a tape measure out and they measure one fourth of the ice cream and they cut it off a hold on to the fact that then they put the dripping part of that's left the big three fourths into your bag and it drifts over everything up they take that one fourth and they start eating it right in front of you that's equivalent to what happens when the person takes a fee\nAnd ... out of your money that you're trying to death while that's a really good at issue nice they slice helped me slice of the money you put in when somebody goes in their pocket some of them go and yours Lao and so but that's bad enough but another thing is when you buy these real estate investment trust\nThey are ill equipped for the most part they are non traded really hurt us you've heard the phrase non traded rehab near that I have yeah and probably when I met when I was talking about you for me you know yet what about you know yeah in that but yeah All right so non trade that means if you buy it you can't sell it\nRight or locked okay it's like when you buy silver and gold now but it's the silver and gold at least is liquid because you can sell it back to the person who bought it from shore or loss yeah sure you buy it for a hundred dollars and they'll say well why we buy back from you for night [laughter] I might as my commission they say so they may commissions both ways okay yeah so\nBe very careful if someone is peddling a real estate investment trust ask them why and say how does that fit in what I'm trying to do okay sure because they're taking advantage many times with the fact that people know they were they want some real estate their portfolio and if you want real estate go buy some real estate you can sell tomorrow\nThat's what I was going to have you know we we hear a lot of people who take advantage of the rental situation or a rate is very different than okay\nSo we've got this cheat sheet that you can use to and it's like oh gosh one two three four it's got six main topics in each each of those main topics has eight sub topics Mm So forty eight\nDifferent sub topic wow and six main topics but then the because you need to go through this before you buy something you'd never heard of ... like a real estate investment trust there you go yeah and one of the things that you have to say what what is that what are the strength and what are the weaknesses of that\nBecause many times when people come in and show us what they have all they've heard about the strikes\nA which is hopefully this will go up in value can sell for profit yeah what we're doing not liking it then it's yeah the maybe the hospital I said hopefully hope mostly yeah yeah I'm ... [noise]\nYou could have got to play but bell but some instead you said\nMaybe thinking though ... hopefully your fun to play with that for all right so but\nIt's not joking better people are getting into these they shouldn't get into that and a lot of that money's money they need to have liquid in a cup in the future maybe five years ten years there's no guarantee that money would be like ... and there's no guarantee that money will ever go up and die we seen a lot of people lose a lot of money in real estate investment are going to have to say about that okay at least if you buy real estate locally and if you if you negotiate a good price\nAnd maybe you get some people in there that are renting it from you can we get some income generated from there but you go if you're buying the rate you're in a big pool of other people buying these big buildings or or these these commercial properties and there's no guarantee that they will stay with people in them\nYeah it sounds like your control just dive um\nYeah so you know Amazon has chicken a lot of people's but these days and so if you buy a shopping center and it's based on retail shopping and Amazon announces they're going to have even better deals all these companies kept saying business yeah and so then that property now that was a hundred percent or Ninety percent\nTaken non bacon occupied when you bought the rate now becomes twenty percent taken or eighty percent vacant ... oh there goes your money no doubt\nAnd then you know so you'd be very very careful of that now I didn't mean to talk about that as much as I did but that was something that was on my mind and then when is this acceptable and unacceptable to own that's another question again who what where when why and how are all questions to ask", "show_name": "Help to Retire", "year": "2018", "city": "Springfield", "day": "27"}
