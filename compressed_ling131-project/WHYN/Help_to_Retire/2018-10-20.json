edition here's the rest of our conversation with ... and I started off by asking him how the U.S is going to fare with beer prices\nAnd who are the countries that are going to be affected by this the most I Know Arlen like I said could see triple a prices of beer but the other countries and where does the U.S fairness\nThe northern Europe is gets the biggest hit because they all have to import than most barley to make the beer in\nThe U.S consumption drops in price goes up but not as much as other places because barley production starts moving north into Canada further so we don't lose as much supply a burly is imported and exported widely and that was in corporate and the model but you know it really helps in terms of price to have a stuffed nearby\nWhat's been the reaction from other groups or you know beer trade groups I Know the brewers association was one of them that said hey you know the does the app academic exercise don't believe all the hype nothing to lose sleep over and then they also say you know the farmers would be adapting as things would happen you know the shift\nBy the growing to other parts where they can still get good yields so what's been the reaction out of other people outside of the study\nYou've summarized the beer industries reaction pretty nicely yeah they said were on top of this thing there was a drought in the Pacific northwest last year that affected probably production and so we're all\nAware of this and worrying about it and that's nice but some of the people who look at sort of large scale farming say that you know these are changes are gonna be happening on continent wide scale and that is going to affect crops when you have drought and heat waves we can engineer\nFor things like drought resistance but that actually might change the nutrient profile with a barley which might change the taste of the beer\nOr you know it's what's in it and you can editor for drought resistance but he resistance is a tough one and he is the thing that's going on what time of climate change and that might change these very basic chemical reactions that are going on in our late ...\nEarly early and so that's why you have to move it\nTo harm it and you know you run out of north after a while and it becomes more expensive to do that sort of thing you're competing with other crops\nSo the people who study these things on ... agricultural economics basis or not as sanguine as the industry on the other hand you know people like beer and the industry is pretty innovative one in some way so you know maybe they will get on top of it it just shows is not cheaper though than like not having to worry about it\nYeah I think it's just pretty funny how quickly this story went viral you know obviously climate change a lot of people are always attuned to that but you throw in beer one of the authors of the study even said not sure what to make of the fact that in one day our paper on climate and beer has garnered considerably more attention than\nAny of their previous work on energy transitioned air pollution deaths anything other than that you know it's like this you know you're messing with my beer and you know everybody's interested in it right away Denver got a science reporter for buzzfeed news thank you very much for joining us thank you\n\n[laughter]\nAll this month of October I've been putting in little stories and the podcast is trying to get everybody to get on the same level of Halloween\nThat I Love to get every year the one that caught my attention this past week was that any child vampire burial that was found in Italy in some type of baby cemetery there was this era discovery ... they found was the skeleton of a ten year old\nThat had a rock lodged in his mouth they bury this child is way because they were afraid who's going to come back to life and continue to spread malaria I spoke to my producer Miranda and we talked about this vampire burial site in Italy\nResearchers from the University of Arizona and also a university that Stanford\nWent on this gig in Italy and they've found this child cemetery and so inside of a miniature him in what used to be a gigantic Roman villa they said it was about the size of a shopping mall if you can think about it like that\nAnd they found a body of the ten year old child who died more than Fifteen hundred years ago the skeleton was lying on its side with his mouth open and stuffed inside was a limestone rocks\nAbout the size of a big egg and like you said they believed that child died as malaria sixty miles north of brown and they said that the way that they buried this catalyst they ... they ... already dead they opened the ... the rock inside and\nAnd build that extra spots with cement so that they can be sure that the rock wouldn't come out right and they were able to determine how old the kid was by looking at the teeth depression\nAnd that's how they know that the rock was put in after he was dead because of those same impression right locally or they're calling it the vampire of Luke nano it's in this like you said is in this area which was like the center of witchcraft and the Roman empire at that time in Italy they said that this burial site has also been called the London properly they banned beanie\nWhich is a cemetery of babies and they found all sorts of different stuff in his burial site you said it was like a huge villa\nAnd they found remnants of a ... in these trenches they're dirt cover trenches\nThere was remains of infants toddlers aborted fetuses that had been buried alongside raven talents toad bones ROMs called dreams these things were filled with ash and sacrificial\nPuppy yeah archaeologist call these deviant burials which is the ancient way of burying people who were they feared would have supernatural abilities like coming back from the dead or that the where people and I I don't know how this would apply to children but it had violated society's rules and ... vampire ...\nAnd a lot of these archaeologists and researchers saying it's stuff that they just didn't understand these illnesses like malaria at the time they probably didn't have a handle on it they didn't know what it was or why it was popping up\nAnd things that they feared they thought might come back from the dead that thought they were vampires that's why they took these extra steps to bury them this way so that they couldn't come back and continue to spread diseases\nAnd they would do all kinds of things like that were rituals I'd rather he didn't say they were dumb honey suck all all over the place and these were just to kind of try to make it as your as possible so that these irritates with just pass along and not come back\nWe don't know the gender of this ten year old the skeleton that was there but they said that near this one was a three year old girl the the remains of a three year old girl they found\nThat said there her hands and feet had been way down with stones which was another form of vampire burial to keep the evil away so that she couldn't get up they were able to dig in into the bones and the remains and they also found that she had died of malaria\nAnd they're saying that the reason why there are so many children's bodies that they had done extensive research on to find out yeah they all died for malaria is because\nIt's Roman Empire section was considered to be assessed pull of diseases and they spread it through contaminated food and water and swam piece of their a ton of mosquitoes and that's why there was so much malaria up until they pretty much figured it out in the Eighteen hundreds\nThis is not the only sight of these quote unquote vampire burials yeah in northern Italy there was a woman who's buried with a brick and her mouth almost the same thing like ... you know a shape rock but this was a British huge too you know\nShe was dubbed the vampire of Venice in England there was another guy who had his tongue taken out and replaced with a stone so it just seemed like that was one of the popular methods that are popular rituals to keep them from being able to come back from the\nTo help or you know sixteen hours a day every single day of the week uh that that's a pretty heavy burden\nAbsolutely it is an end but how can we plan for that Richard\nI think that's one thing is English is the age group helped to retire here that we're able to do that many many other quote advisors are not interested in ... or not permitted to do\nAnd that is basically by coordinate the legal documents\nUh the assets and how they're titled the type those assets you can basically prearrange harasses to respond very quickly to his theory nasty situation wasn't supposed to happen so that you can turn a negative situation to an opportunity to save your assets that's what we do here\nWell I I liked that concept I mean that makes sense yeah and again like you said you've got the specialist there to that understanding and know how to do that\nWell I wrote a book for the bar association years ago with some judges in the area and that was the basically the part of the book I wrote\nI mean how do you qualify for a community mass health getting some help to help you financing this key people at home when their needs some help how do you qualify for a long term care you know to take care of the nursing home cost and not leave your spouse at home impoverished\nUh that's something we've been doing for decades here uh people don't have long term care insurance uh the vast majority\nOf those that do have it it's going to\nRun out after two or three years you're going to want to spin that at home figuring that you're never ever needed on that long you won't mind up in a nursing home so I'm assuming that basically one way or the other a hundred percent of the people are not prepared financially to pay for that nursing home which we've seen costs rise from twelve to fourteen thousand dollars\nPer month per month that's not a misprint guys so no upper middle class can afford to pay that for any length of time before they are impoverished so prior planning events poor performance you get your legal documents to coordinate with your assets\nDo some planning and it's like you know the spare tire in the trunk the hope you're never going to use it but you ought to have it in the trunk be ready to go\nMake sure it's got a full load of air good tread\nA and that's what we do run through all the assets all the legal documents coordinator everything and say listen\nIf this happens you're on a much better position than Ninety percent of people coming in the door and we see to respond quickly because guess what their lawyer doesn't talk their financial advisor why waste it that's not billable time your stockbroker never want to talk to lure certainly the insurance guy because their deal killers\nThis lack of coordination is going to cause you some serious delays navy disqualified for benefits or delayed them at the very best\nAnd that's not the time you want to find out who see or I should have planned a little bit better than us absolutely\nNow you've been in this business you know her better than Thirty years so you've seen these ups and downs but for the last ten years we really haven't seen that in the end that's it's bound to happen it's going to happen\nI call this the wizard of Oz stock market okay\nThey may say well you know I went down pretty rapidly and two thousand eight but you know it came back off fast and then I asked them why that happened you ever hear of tarp how 'bout quantitative easing number one to one Thirteen okay a politically I don't think that will it ever occur again\nPeople are losing their house left and right\nAnd the government went in there Federal Reserve went in there and basically bailed out Wall Street or if that ever happened to me just take a look what's happening on the TV with the Supreme Court nominee this this country is fractured\nIn one political party would crucify the other party a and kill them at the next election if they went out and build out Wall Street again I don't think you're going to see a tarp to not again so the next downturn I predict or if it's anywhere near like the last one there is no one's going to be bailing you out but you\nKnow and so you've got to prepare for that you know one of the other thing is contrary to what we might believe we don't know how long we're going to live\nOur generation generally speaking a doesn't drink to excess they certainly don't smoke three packs of cigarettes a day and we have a lot of ... ... a lot of medical technology a to helping us ...\nSo uh and discovering and treatments to survive ability are much better so basically over all\nThere's no reason to believe that you will not live a many years beyond the age of your parents in pro beyond your life expectancy right now that being the case\nLet me tell you it's not the first five years a return but they're going to cause your problems is the last five years which five years of those from Seventy to Seventy five or more likely from eighty five Ninety\nAnd very few people are prepared for that extra five years or their assets certainly aren't prepared for it whereas the income plan and suppose you're wrong you know everybody does my family's Seventy five boom boom boom\nYou know you got to have a plan B plans seat\nRight well so I mean when when you start talking to folks how long how long do you plan for in other words when you're putting that plan together that income plan do you plan for Seventy eighty Ninety how far do you go well the actual\n... tell us the most recent studies that if you have a couple or sixty five years old there was a forty seven percent probability you wanted to say every other household where there are sixty five year old cup when\nThe forty seven percent probability that one of them will lead lived to be at least Ninety excuse me Ninety now though the figure that really blows my mind there's a Seventeen percent probability that's about one out of every five houses that one of those folks live to be Ninety five\nIf you retire at sixty five I mean you're talking Thirty years of unemployment that's what I called retirement yeah you know you're not working as a check is called on employment\nExactly well I tell you what I think what we've done is maybe pick the interest to some folks why don't we invite them to give us a call oh come on and sit down and put that plan together once and for all\nThese folks cause the

now have to ask coach for those who may not know what is a ... award\nWell clearly is given to a best selling author ... and\nUh I was surprised when I got when it looks like a big golden feather okay now I can see it at our studio and then our offices we have two of them and I actually have a ring the bestselling author ring wow which are are they maybe pay four times\nBut I thought I was qualified to get it in the spring and it looks like a Super Bowl rings okay it does yeah yeah and I got one of the one of the ... at least for success ... what's the four okay or the other one race so to have in baby steps he has one I Love ... wonderful\nLove the stories throughout it but the successor nominees books with Steve\nForbes is loaded with chapters on how people can make themselves better okay and Thomas we talked earlier on the show about their retirement ready\nTo get we did I guess and make sure you retire when you're ready on your terms\nAnd ways to recession proof\nYour retirement years now what does that mean to you when I say recession proof your retirement what does that mean to use the thirty two year old\nOkay so that makes me think that are in the long term when I Am ready to retire I don't have to worry if the market where to begin to thing yeah I'd have that confidence\nWell yeah because the recession and I remember my grandparents that this was back in the seventies nothing ever got thrown away food wise ... I mean my grandfather make chicken one day and the next day the chicken soup like chicken something else to catch the door you know it was like he would never wasted chicken as they would take the chicken bone or the turkey bone\nAnd put it in a stew pot and make turkey Stewart you go yeah so it ended up making sure that everything that you have gets used the right way okay and unfortunately when we're paying fees that we don't need to pay ... you were in effect throwing that edible food away every single year\nYeah and if that food could have been put into better use or maybe you know get a lot more food with it so basically if you're paying the\nYou're losing the buying power for that money so we need to make sure number one rule of recession proof in your retirement\nIs make sure to have a the reporter forensic the analysis to make sure you're not over paying on these\nThat's right and and a lot of folks maybe like throwing food away they thought oh it's just garbage anything else with\nIt so you look at a statement and it doesn't look like you have many face right yes not statement where the fees are really show many times and it's looking at the actual products and strategies are in and many times the fees are built in or they are in documents that you don't know how to read\nIt's incredible every time we talk about it I just don't understand how little I really\nDon't have recession proofing your retirement well it shouldn't be something called the fiduciary standard where the advisor is supposed to put your days ahead of their needs that's right I've been practicing that for twenty five years since I started very but a lot of people don't so I like to put myself in my listeners shoes and what they are doing what they need\nAnd what would make me mad is would be paying fees that don't have to pay through that I don't know about truth right double play wrong thing I hear you and so when we look at it we we want to be prepared\nNot surprising yeah every time it's all about the ... so you can retire early if you get your ducks in a row the right way we need less sure that we don't over analyze things we get a good team planners on her side\nThat understand what your needs and desires are and custom designed\nThe plan that fits what you're looking for the very very important yeah we're going to talk about this and the next segment only in real detail but nine ways to protect your nest egg huh okay how your nest egg is money you're saving for retirement\nAbout a bird it sits in the nest and is that like sits on the egg and it gets it all nice and warm and they finally had just mhm 'cause it's growing right right well you don't want it to be stolen or or crack before you before the patches and so ... want to make sure but\nSome of the topics here we need to talk about is and who else out there besides million you\nIs worried about rising healthcare costs ... a magic and many of our listeners now it's a big enough for when we have a paycheck coming in that's right and you get mad about how much comes in and it goes out and I should think about retirement when you don't have a a work paycheck coming in and you still have now let me ask you this to the health care costs go up or down when we get closer to or into retirement\nWould've imagine they would begin going yeah yeah\nSo we are going to get into the way back machine\nWe're going to talk about the nine ways to protect your nest egg this is from a class that I taught back in two thousand and five\nAnd on about this on the radio show started by the way wow and so that's a long time by the way time but it is does it seem like a do you enjoy what you're doing exactly so we need to make sure we designed plants that we have a transfer made of conversation okay\nAnd that's an informal usually private discussion in which two or more people exchange thoughts feelings or ideas by spoken word\nOften causing someone's life to be better in some important way and that's right from Webster's Dictionary right so a transfer made his financial conversation is from my dictionary here\nAnd we're going to go through all those ways nine ways to protect your nest egg we're also going to talk about the twenty two steps now what I thought by step do these all behind the scenes in three appointments but the total retirement plan\nAnd this is a way to retire with confidence many times to retire early but when you retire you know everything's going to be like it should because there's no guessing\nAnd there's no might happen that's right like when you talked to some advisors are here some other radio shows the guy say\nWell if everything goes right and and certain things do happen you have about a Ninety percent chance of everything being okay dangerous where it and that's what I don't like and I don't like all that stuff but the main thing that I mean for is a hundred percent chance of everything coming out right to strike because then it's not a chance anymore right that's right that's right we chance become a guarantee when it's a hundred percent\nExactly when something you said as well coaches you want to prepare for retirement of success not one where you have to take you know ... percent of your income like a lot of people tried to shoot for\nYou and again yes we ain't for a hundred and twenty percent of your working income in retirement not Seventy percent of sort of we call it retiring with success there you go not guessing and hoping for success exactly [laughter] and I love all these legal legal these things these days where people put disclaimer at the end where they tried to make a\nWell everything will be fine assuming no wait a minute and once you say that word assuming everything you just said gets a race verbal racer executive orders but exactly you know I Want you to have a great retirement but uh uh they don't really want me to have a great retirement that yeah so we need to be concerned\nA lot of people are concerned about if they'll run out of money and retirement so we need to check that off we need to totally eliminate that concern of running out of money and retirement but not just not running out of money but having enough money to do what we want to do when\nWe want to do it that's right period mhm no disclaimer no but no ah most of the time all these other words\nNo data mining like I heard one guy and radio show say when we were talking about the way he was talking about four percent really had a caller call in and they said well a lot of eyes are said to four percent role doesn't work it right into down market right and so he proceeded to say well it works fine that up markets don't listen to advisor who talks about the bad things about what [laughter]\nSo if if you got to retire here's here's here's a good guarantee\nIf we reach retirement we have a hundred years of a market environment right\nWhere it will will the force that will be fine you've never run out of my time and well then Thomas we've never had a hundred straight years up in the market so if you're retired you know Murphy's law strikes a lot of times and today you retire as the day the market goes the wrong way exactly you know so here's what I Want to do though very important we need to get educated we need to get the proper plan in place\nAnd we need to do it with confidence and we need to be comfortable with our planner and are planning process\nSo we do this for everyone who calls\nAnd right now for the next thirty call where we're going to we're going to double the number of callers we usually take at this time of the show for the next thirty call\nWe're going to create a one page financial review it'll indicate if you're in need of a full blown financial planner not that it's over nine hundred dollar value now what what also being quoted is this will take the mystery out of the financial planning process for you by mapping out where you are right now the most important part of any financial plan or planning process is having advisor", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Help to Retire", "city": "Springfield", "day": "20"}
