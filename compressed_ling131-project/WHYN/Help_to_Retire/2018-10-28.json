listening right now and you're getting close to retirement if you're fifty to an older you are and what I call the financial red zone\nAnd now it's time to test your retirement strategies keep in mind hope is not a strategy I Know when people play the lottery they're hoping right trying to find out how realistic your retirement plan is probably realistic expectations\nAnd it's very important to begin creating the income now that you need and retirement use some of your growth portfolio to set up a safe stable income producing foundation\nOf your portfolio you don't have a true retirement plan unless you have safe stable retirement income that will come for the rest of your wife\nSo most people have Social Security but not much else but they have a lump sum of the four one K. let's figure out how much of that four one K. you can put aside and devote to lifetime income you'll never have to worry about saved them more income to better the more streams of income the better\nThanks coach great insight as always [noise]\nAnd finally today stupid criminal comes to us from Kansas this genius was just released from jail and thought it was a good idea to steal a car in the jail parking lot\nCops knew it was thirty three year old Kevin Jones because it was all captured on camera but before officers could chase them down they got a nine one one call reporting someone breaking into a car about six blocks away you guessed it it was Jones trying to steal car number two he was arrested\nAnd the other car but that was found around the corner Jones was out of jail for less than an hour that's it for now joined us again next time I'm Steve set off the financial safari news network [noise]\nLooking back into financial safari consumer advocates Thomas let's come here with you in Studio alongside the coach America's wealth\nFinancial and income coach coached Pete de ... he is a best selling author winner of many awards including ... ... again like I said earlier in the program I could go on and on in Studio with us as well as Chris the rocket man breath our now\nCoach you were talking about financial dignity before the break and it reminded me I'm going to uh open up and probably get left out a little bit here [laughter]\nWay and again yesterday when I was a a pre teens he got to think like eleven twelve year old Thomas a there was a band called ... and that was a very popular back in the day that there were these kids they all have long hair\nSo I had grown my hair out because I thought it was cool and trendy I go into a gas station one day to pick up a bottle of pop bottle a coke or whatever and the ah clerk their refers to me as a female instead of a male ... cut my hair the next day some little dignity example there just to kick off the segment\nHow how long your hair time it was about ... would you would not much here at all you have yeah is that after the the episode there you go [laughter] or tablet like Saddam a dignity that right that's right\nWell yeah it's it's on again your terms so financial dignity though you know doing what you want when you want where you want with whom you want that's financial ... and we see so many people every single week that come in from the show we talk to them\nAnd they are wondering if they have what they need put aside and places they should have to get to the retirement they want to have and unfortunately well fortunately or unfortunately unfortunately sometimes they don't but fortunately there are they're thinking about it so that we can get them on that right past mhm we call it a critical thinking\nAnd its benefits we look at the benefits of of what what you're doing right now versus the benefits of something you could be doing ... should I mean so it's features advantages and benefits and why would you make a decision that didn't benefit you completely and as much as it more of than anything else out there\nYeah I I Would imagine it's just not making the true comparison not not nearly being educated\nYeah we go through what we call the financial stress tests with every single item that is in your current portfolio while and then we compare that to what we would recommend is independent financial for do share as we can go out across the world and find things that makes sense to you one of the things that are largely I keep seeing it over and over again from people that come in from other planners\nIs these other planners are pushing like crazy these days something called a real estate investment trust otherwise known as a rate OK hoarding called rats before too long lines that that is a real estate investment trust\nIs when they're being pushed by financial professionals they get a pretty good commission see that's why they pushed that and many times it comes right out of your return ooh okay so if you are right out of the money put in so let's say a hundred thousand dollars into a real estate investment trust\nAnd the person you're buying it from is not a true for do Sherry the hundred thousand dollars you put in Ninety One thousand or so goes to work for you guess where the other nine thousand goes or is that ...\nI was talking about the person sounded okay now does that make sense no and\nWhy it's that's immediate loss now you have for the year right unless it I mean what's that real estate goes up like crazy now here's the thing and that's bad enough that I think you agree that's bad isn't it and risk does that make you met data it does I mean that's almost ... percent I went to Harris Teeter shopping center to buy a half gallon ice cream for five dollars\nYou give the person five dollars and of course tax cuts that on there to see how you get to the person five dollars and fifty cents [laughter] and what they do is they take your gallon ice cream to take this big knife you see like a ginsu knives [laughter]\nTo cut through the cans with it and then to cut through a tomato I remember the against the knife out and they take a tape measure out and they measure one fourth of the ice cream and to cut it off a hold on to the fact that then they put the dripping part of that's left the big three fourths into your bag and address over everything up they take that one fourth and they start eating it right in front of you that's equivalent to what happens when the person takes a fee\nAnd ... out of your money that you're trying to death while that's a really good at night they slice helped me slice out the money you put in when somebody goes in their pocket some of them do when you are as well and so but that's bad enough but another thing is when you buy these real estate investment trust\nThere it liquid for the most part they are non traded really hurt us you've heard the phrase non traded read heaven here that I have yeah and probably when I met when I'm Talking about you for me you know yet what about you know yeah in that but it's an entree that means if you buy it you can't sell it was right or left\nOkay and I'm like when you buy silver and gold now but it's the silver and gold at least is liquid because you can sell it back to the person who bought it from short for a loss yeah sure you buy it for a hundred dollars and they'll say well why we buy back from you for night [laughter] I might as my commission they say so they may commissions both ways okay yeah so be very careful if someone is peddling\nA real estate investment trust ask them why\nAnd say how does that fit in what I'm trying to do okay sure because they're taking advantage many times with the fact that people know they were they want some real estate in their portfolio and if you want real estate go buy some real estate you can sell tomorrow\nThat's what I was going to have you know we we hear a lot of people who'd advantage of the rental situation of the uh read is very different than okay\nSo we've got this chi chi that you can use to edits whoa gosh one two three four it's got six main topics in each each of those main topics has eight sub topics Mm forty eight\nDifferent sub topic wow and six main topics but then because you need to look through this before you buy something you never heard of ... like a real estate investment trust there you go yeah and one of the things is you have to say what what is that what are the strength and what are the weaknesses of that\nBecause many times when people come in and show us what they have all they've heard about the strikes\nA which is hopefully this will go up in value can sell for profit but what we're doing not liking it then it's yeah the maybe the hospital I should hope we hope mostly yeah yeah I'm a ...\nYou could have got to play but bell but some people said you said maybe\nThinking though ... hopefully your fun to play with ... All right so\nBut it's not joking better people are getting into these they shouldn't get into that and a lot of that money's money they need to have liquid in a cup in the future maybe five years ten years there's no guarantee that money ... and there's no guarantee that money will ever go up and die we seen a lot of people lose a lot of money in real estate investment are going to have to say about that okay at least if you buy real estate locally and if you if you negotiate a good price\nAnd maybe you get some people in there that are renting it from you can we get some income generated from there but again if you're buying the rate you're in a big pool of other people buying these big buildings or or these these\nCommercial properties and there's no guarantee that they will stay with people in them yeah it sounds like your control just dive um yeah so you know Amazon has chicken a lot of people's but these days and so if you buy a shopping center and it's based on retail shopping and Amazon announces they're going to have even better deals all those companies kept saying business yeah Heather do then that property now that was a hundred percent or Ninety percent\nTaken non vacant occupied when you bought the ... now becomes twenty percent taken or eighty percent vacant ... oh there goes your money no doubt you know so you'd be very very careful that no I didn't mean to talk about that as much as I did but that was something that was on my mind\nAnd then when is this acceptable and unacceptable to own that's another question so again who what where when why and how are all questions to ask", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Help to Retire", "city": "Springfield", "day": "28"}
