sells\nWonderful love the stories throughout it but the success anonymous books\nWith Steve Forbes is loaded with chapters on how people can make themselves better okay and Thomas we talked earlier on the show about the retirement ready to get we did I guess and make sure you retire when you're ready on your terms and waste a recession proof\nYour retirement years now what does that mean to you and I say recession proof your retirement what does that mean to use the thirty two year old\nOkay so that makes me think that are in the long term when I Am ready to retire I don't have to worry if the market where to begin to thing yeah I'd have that confidence\nWell yeah because the recession and I remember my grandparents that this was back in the seventies nothing ever got thrown away food was ... I mean my grandfather make chicken one day and the next day be chicken soup like chicken something else to get the door you know it was like he would never waste the chicken as they would take the chicken bones or the turkey bone\nAnd put it in a stew pot and make turkey stewards you go yeah so it is making sure that everything that you have gets used the right way okay\nAnd unfortunately when we're paying fees that we don't need to pay ... you were in effect throwing that edible food away every single year yeah and if that food could have been put into better use or maybe you know get a lot more food with it so basically if you're paying the\nYou're losing the buying power for that money so we need to make sure number one rule of recession proof in your retirement\nIs make sure to have a the reporter forensic the analysis to make sure you're not over paying on these that's right and\nAnd a lot of folks maybe like throwing food away they thought oh it's just garbage ... anything else with\nIt so you look at a statement and it doesn't look like you have many face right not the statement where the fees are really show many times when it's looking at the actual products and strategies you're in and many times the fees are built in or they're in documents that you don't know how to read\nIt's incredible every time we talk about it I just don't understand how slim I really\nDon't have recession proving retirement well it shouldn't be and something called the fiduciary standard where the advisor is supposed to put your days they had their needs that's right I've been practicing that for twenty five years since I started very put a lot of people don't so I like to put myself in my listeners shoes and what they are doing what they need\nAnd what would make me mad is would be paying fees that don't have to pay through that I don't know about truth right double play wrong thing I hear you and so when we look at it we we want to be prepared\nNot surprising yeah every time it's all about the ... so you can retire early if you get your ducks in a row the right way we need less sure that we don't over analyze things we get a good team planners on her side\nThat understand what your needs and desires are and custom designed\nThe plan that fits what you're looking for the very very important yeah we're going to talk about this and the next segment

all nice and warm and it finally hatch is mhm 'cause it's growing right right well you don't want it to be stolen or or crack before you before it ... and so ... want to make sure but\nSome of the topics here we need to talk about is and who else out there besides million you\nIs worried about rising healthcare costs\n... a magic and many of our listeners now it's a\nBig enough for it when we have a paycheck coming in that's right and they get mad about how much comes in and it goes out and I should think about retirement when you don't have a a work paycheck coming in and you still have now let me ask you this to the health care costs go up or down when we get closer to or to retire [laughter]\nWhere did it and they would begin going on here\nSo we are going to get into the way back machine\nWe're going to talk about the nine ways to protect your nest egg this is from a class that I taught back in two thousand and five\nAnd a lot about this on the radio show started by the way wow and so that's a long time by the way time but it is does it seem like it do you enjoy what you're doing exactly so we need to make sure we designed plants that we have a transfer made of conversation okay\nAnd that's an informal usually private discussion in which two or more people exchange thoughts feelings or ideas\nBy spoken word often causing someone's life to be better in some important way and that's right from Webster's Dictionary right so a transfer made his financial conversation is from my dictionary here\nAnd we're going to go through all those ways nine ways to protect your nest egg we're also going to talk about the twenty two steps to bite step we do these all behind the scenes in three appointments but the total retirement plan\nAnd this is a way to retire with confidence many times to retire early but when you retire you know everything's going to be like it should because there's no guessing and there's no\nMight happen that's right like when you talk to some advisors or here's some other radio shows the guy say\nWell if everything goes right and and certain things do happen you have about a Ninety percent chance of everything being okay dangerous work that's almost what I don't like and I don't like all that stuff but the main thing that I Am for is a hundred percent chance of everything coming out right to strike so then it's not a chance anymore right that's right that's right and we'll have a chance to become a guarantee what is a hundred percent\nExactly will end something you said as well coaches you want to prepare for retirement of success not one where you have to take you know ... percent of your income like a lot of people tried to ...\n... you and again yes we ain't for a hundred and twenty percent of your working income in retirement not Seventy percent of started we call it retiring which success there you go not guessing and hoping for success exactly [laughter] and I ... I Love all these legal legal these things these days where people put disclaimer at the end where they try to make a\nWell everything will be fine assuming no wait a minute once you say that word assuming everything you just said gets a race is a verbal racer ... out of the word is but exactly you know I Want you to have a great retirement but uh oh there you go you don't really want me to have a great retirement that yup so we need to be concerned\nA lot of people are concerned about if they'll run out of money and retirement and so we need to check that off we need a total eliminate that concern of running out of money and retirement but not just not running out of money but having enough money to do what we want to do when\nWe want to do this right period mhm no disclaimer no but no ah most of the time all these other words\nNo data mining like I heard one guy in radio show say when we were talking about the way he was talking about four percent really had a caller call in and they said well\nA lot of eyes are said a ... percent role doesn't work right into down market right and so he proceeded to say well we work signing up markets don't listen to advisor who talks about the bad things about what [laughter] so if if you're going to retire here's here's here's a good guarantee\nIf we reach retirement we have a hundred years of a market environment right\nWill will will the former several be fined you've never run out of my ... and well then Thomas we've never had a hundred straight years up in the market so if you're retired you know Murphy's law strikes a lot of times and today you retire as the day the market goes wrong way exactly them yet so here's what I Want to do though very important we need to get educated we need to get the proper plan in place\nAnd we need to do with confidence and we need to be comfortable with our planner and are planning process\nSo we do this for everyone who calls\nAnd right now for the next thirty call where we're going to we're going to double the number callers we usually take at this time of the show for the next thirty callers\nWe're going to create a one page financial review it'll indicate if you're in need of a full blown financial planner not not a silver nine hundred nine dollar value now what what also being quoted is this will take the mystery of the financial planning process for you by mapping out where you are right now the most important part of any financial plan or planning process is having advisor", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Help to Retire", "city": "Springfield", "day": "21"}
