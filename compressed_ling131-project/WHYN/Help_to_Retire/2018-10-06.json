I mean here it's so delicate process in infiltrating the colony and even half the time it right the you know the fungus as a time it right so that when the end is leaving the colony that's when it releases all the chemicals and finally taken over the brain\nTo make it do ten inches up and fight leaf and everything is just so interesting how these things work\nAnd you were saying earlier it does ah originated in the rain forest but there are some here in the United states as well in a South Carolina I think uh we have a at a certain type of this fungus as well\nYeah and that's where it gets if you can believe it all the more credible because\nIn some of the United states you of course have trees that will shed their leaves once a year and that of course would be bad for the fungus if the fungus was ordering the ... to bite onto the pain of all if that means it's going to tumble out of the tree and lose its perch above a colony so what has happened\nHere in this in the United states as well as other temperate climates around the world is\nThe fungus doesn't order the antibody onto the ban of elite but instead the branch are quick which is a perch that it can maintain year round even as the leaves fall off the treat the problem there is that that's a little bit more delicate of a purchase your ticket a purchase on\nThe vein of elite biting into it so it actually happens here in the United states as as the fungus there's ordering the ... to bite onto the twig it's not such a good purchase but then orders the answer rap its legs around the twigs and then grows as the fungus grows out of the legs and kind of attached to them to that\nStem and that's just all the more power to purchase there and you know get a good grasp because in the temperate climate the fungus can't develop nearly as quickly as it does in the rain forests where it's nice and warm and humid and actually developed over the course of a year and they all\nOver winter just sitting there on the stand biting its time and then\nOnce the spring comes around or then finally a rough out of the back of the head\nOf the ... as it does in the rain forest whereas you know in the rain forest a dozen and a number of days as opposed to once upon month so it's really fascinating how in different parts of the world the fungus is uniquely adopted two really ruin the day of the ants in a in a very unique

quote dot com since Nineteen eighty five we shop\nAnd uh we got three little babies to raise it put through school this is a a screeching example of why you need life insurance if you have a small business and it's going to be passed on to your air is with us a big tax bill\n... money okay but if you're single the kids are grown you say\nWhy Mike ... life insurance ... you know yeah again especially if it's true and it's expensive you just wasting your money or what does the purpose of life insurance you may not need it\nRight well and one of the other things to consider too is making sure that that you know you have someone that can take care of you talked about that just a moment ago where you know if you've got nobody somebody's going to have to take care of you and you're going to have to you know a sign that was a duty to someone who's willing to do it\nEven if it's short term I mean I had a case a while back and handed in county or the woman husband had a stroke and he was pretty well disabled and uh she was hiring to a un agency just to fill it with two shifts of aids and by the time we added up all the monthly bills for that for the age that was like Seventy one hundred dollars\nPer month couldn't that oh that's a lot of ... that's a lot of ... yeah ... and got it so again a home health care it can be and\nStart out to be relatively affordable but in a crisis situation it can be extremely expensive the ones who is a crisis when you're all alone there's no one there to help you\nRight now it's called paid help and that's what it's going to take isn't it\nIt's going to take that and maybe even more one of the other things I Know that you've had to deal with this is you know if if a spouse dies suddenly unexpectedly and somebody is all of a sudden calling you sang Richard ... what do I do now um what do you tell them\nWell that that I put those into two categories of is a very large practice we have five offices and I've been doing this for decades so when a client\nLoses their spouse things have been pre set a we're pretty well organized and were able to walk that spouse and maybe their child whatever helping him during that process transition from single uh uh you know to to a state where they're by themselves but the king comes to set up we replace the income from the spouse blah blah blah [noise]\nNow the second scenario which I think what you're talking about is when I got a call from a stranger and says my God my spouse just died I found this thing has disorganized can you help me boom boom boom when they come in as it's it's basically two faces\nA worse situation uh what needs to be addressed a it's almost mandated or keep the assets away from probate possibly find the ... cases get them liquidated and get her some money\nOn the other hand we went to making major changes and major decisions when they're grieving or they need to take a breath of fresh air slowed down a bit and then slowly ... you know kept their feet underneath them not that's probably\nThe difference between the existing client of working relationship with versus someone coming in ... new climbed the middle of a crisis well\nYes absolutely and again that but that's got to be comforting to folks too is that that you know that you've set them up that when that you know when life happens as we say um the ... they're reading their prepare\nOur favorite thing around here is a five piece prior planning prevents poor performance Bremer resolve their you know pretty close to the real saying okay All right so a ... ... I hate to say this but ultimately every married couple one's going to land up a widow or widower that are called\nBeing human all it's nothing you want to really talk about an awful lot of deal but you do need to plan and say listen\nYou know as my for example is my wife capable of taking over this portfolio that I've been self administer himself and dusted investor\nAll and making my own decision with very little guidance or is she capable or desirous of doing that or vice versa all in many cases they say listen my forte is something else I Know nothing about the stock market but you need to line up that advisors going to help her through that process before it happens not afterwards\nRight absolutely and again I'm a [laughter] this is something and I I'm going to ask if you have you ever run into where where you know somebody somebody dies and and they realize oh my gosh this is the wrong beneficiary but it's too late at that point\nI've run into that more you think ... what ... what is was more often I conference telephone constantly client 'til the day\nThe goal the custodian with a very large higher rate in in the record a conversation with speaker phone in my office and I do record the conversation as well as the particular transition we are talking to the custodian and I said you know oh ... by the way who's a price\nMurray beneficiary of this man's IRA\nHis wife is sitting right there and we're waiting all we hear on the other line is loves the winter I said you do have a primary beneficiary on this higher rate and this is a six bracket Hyun six rocket irate and the person said no we have no benefits round this account at all oh gosh well I\nThink about this how many thanks to you know that the name was different ten years ago the name on that same building was different Fifteen Years ago right so a lot of acquisitions and transfers going through and every time someone acquires a particular entity\nYou know you got this database over here trying to interface new database of people choir them usually something gets lost in this particular case in Britain fishery designations were not brought over okay\nThat me and what's the significance of that you say well the bottom line is the spouses still probably going to get the money but they're gonna have to go to ... to get it\nNot good well again I here's the thing now it'd be a great opportunity great time to get richer to call go on and sit down and talk about it sorted out make sure it's right\nSteve it all boils down to the fact that all of these different pieces with financial postal need to fit together in together nicely\nGive us a call right now will set up an initial no cost consultation\nWe'll talk it through all the different puzzle pieces over a cup of coffee that you need to consider for instance how about the\nLevel of risk you're really taking I always liked that doesn't usually tell me all they've got to my broker tells me out of the ballots to count and I say well what does that mean you got one barefoot in a bucket of cold water and the other foot barefoot isn't a bucket of hot water or you balance then what does it mean so we take a look at the actual assets\nPeel it away and determine what the real risks level is\nIs it appropriate for your age and the amount of risk ... and the return you're getting how about your sees how much you're really paying fees and commissions with your current plan\nWe can run a forensic analysis and uncover many of the hidden sees you may not know that you're eating paying taxes what about tax implications of your state is is there a way to save money in taxes down the road by plenty proactively now prior planning prevents poor performance\nOkay so obviously there's a whole lot we need to discuss we found that most people just have a plan thoroughly enough to address all of these issues some of them yes but not all of them so if you've been managing your retirement money by yourself and you're not realizing maybe for the first time that a lot of these issues you have not an address\nOr if you are now realizing that your current planner where he was there hasn't been helping you think through all these issues as thoroughly as they should be doing this is your chance for a true holistic and comprehensive plan ... to\nTo put in place and if you come right now and you're in the next two callers the only way to get the financial review in the second opinion package\nThat we've seen this charged as much as a thousand dollars or more for but when you come in but also give you a copy of a brand new Han up to ... to ... just put out called the four oh one K. modern Bloomberg I Know keeping my folks we should all those who have choice when he's ... he was up to a thousand dollars or more for similar features offers but this reporters and dial\nIt could save you hundreds of thousands of dollars in taxes throughout the remainder of your retirement years\nRichard here's a great opportunity folks that and again that just sounds really good you need to sit down get that financial roadmap put together let let your ... year and a team really help translate forget what it amounts to a lot of complex financial world into really clear instructions\nIt is an excellent chance for you to get that true practical retirement review and for anybody listening right now that number to call this eight hundred nine two zero six six eight six\nYard Richard the next ten callers are going to receive that comprehensive financial review that he just described it shows you where

it's called Rudy rooted you're the walk on\nAnd it's a full length motion picture and it's available right now on Amazon Prime\nMurals on primary means it are you going to lay out I just want to ask you one question how many yards and how many carries visual happy and I would not do you remember watching that movie I haven't watched I watched the original one could have we seen about twenty five times and I would miss I cried each time I watch it raised about a little guy overcoming adversity\nRudy smaller than I Am and he was playing football at Notre Dame like a dream come true yeah so uh\nWe walked around campus in all the places you saw in the movie but went to and then then and people recognize some people still recognized Rudy there and also have a great movie ... began and Senate\nMembers here again in the state mhm yup ... shooting specialist there some other ... famous people in there too but it's a really good movie about overcoming adversity and and and not letting people tell you can't be done through engine that could kind of thing and so rude is a real good guy\nReally excited about the movie and anyway that's that's good news or the other good news and I've been invited to be in is another movie coming up here in two thousand Nineteen it'd be out it's called the last blockbuster totally rarely tell me about the news the Arab or at least that's what

box always turning videos like check it out yeah so please be kind rewind member that old guy yeah\nSo the last blockbuster you guys I probably you guys probably her be talking about where it is there were three of them a couple of years ago two of them in Alaska they're both gone\nOK so give us a hit us this east or west of the Mississippi was west of the Mississippi west or is it in Vegas notes in Bend Oregon never guess that no so uh I don't know why a lot of retirees there has got a lot of time on our hands stores that don't use digital\nGot all of you know they had a chance to buy Netflix for pennies and they passed up on it [laughter]\nWhat chicken yourself into NATO or yeah but so what else can we find that will be able to talk about that but it's just going to be fine I'm going to work there for a day at school are you home it yeah and also very cool and then they're going to interview me alone quote unquote working there and er about my experiences with blockbuster in the past you know I think more a blockbuster all the time was when we started the tape\nWhen you go up to their box out there you throw it in the box right we had no yeah no proof that you put the take back in the bud right right yeah no I bought it by their mailbox kind of thinking you know drive up and throw it in there and then\nIt's up to them to say you really turned it back and if not sort of like uh you ever had never library books back into the check a book out in the exit overdue by it maybe forgot to sort of back in all summer so they they sent you a bill for like fifty dollars typically costs twenty [laughter] so that's what they did with his videotapes sue if if you didn't turn it back in ... a lot of money yeah\nAnd there was no recourse I mean you at in a while yeah no way of proving so it was it was a he said\nShe said that I have to be very careful on that so anyway that I thought I'd share that because we're we're positive about these movies in a couple of days before because of a inviting people out there like Peter demand is\nOne of the three guys behind SpaceX\nAnd everyone's heard of Richard Branson and Eli must course but Peter demolished as the brains I think behind the operation and and so that one too and he's a couple of years ago called the vision ear\nAnd you'll look around and society these days there's always somebody trying to do something to make things better\nAnd then there's always someone trying to do things worse to or something about the bank they're charging fees on people so\nDisruption that calling Amazon dot com is has just written well first of all disrupted the book selling industry now it's disrupting everything you know after we get ours I guess you get an Amazon a bank and everything I wouldn't banquet Amazon by the way I buy books from my but actually weeks' supply why we buy paper towels and beverages and everything from 'cause it's a lot cheaper\nCan be wise to just press a button and it is to have to go out and go shock and if you lived in New York City or if you've lived in a skyscraper think about it when when you want to go shopping back to the day you'd have to that's all day event\nSometimes ... the elder as broke as he had to walk down thirty five years I have a taxi cab which my oldest is don't fun and games there and you're ready to go to a store buy the food lug it back into the cab we'll get back up the steps\nAll day affair right or you press one button on Amazon deliberate did or the FedEx and UPS men are too happy about that [laughter] I'd had opposed man flights of stairs I'll tell\nYou what I got seven grandkids that's how we give them since we use that as I don't touch it it gets sent right to their houses all wrapped up and looks pretty\nTalking about what makes me excited the Amazon gift card 'cause I mean you get anything you want their editor had to get something you don't want like when I was younger and we would get underwear for Christ [laughter] the friend alarms oh gosh I got myself\nI don't know I saw an article the Jeff Bezos you they'll chairman of the company they said he makes one point five million dollars a day on his money not interesting non profit on more on ... on his money that's pretty nice pretty nice yeah\nThat's like the whole kind of money [laughter]\nSo we look at the are going to quickly touch on this and then when we were on the next thing we're going to go through what we call brokers behaving badly unfortunately this is a story or more every day we finally have to go down to one a week but I'm looking at something called the art or retirement here that we're designing and it's about when you look at an artist\nAnd artist starts with a blank piece of campus and then it's up to him or her to make a masterpiece\nAnd if you gave me a blank piece of campus in a in a paint brush I'd make a mess that well that's what all that so that's happening a lot of times when the financial world how do you know the plant or you're dealing with is Israel is an artist a financial artist how do you know\nIf they're working for a big institution you trust that big institution has looked at it but how do you really know if they're putting a plan together\nBased on what you have and so let's say this to you you give the artist you give the Blake campus and you give them some uh some yellow", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Help to Retire",
