problem\nAnd if you still have those in your house\nOr you can tighten those up there is a product called draft stop and what you get a clear talking that you can literally clock that ventilator closed can't open in the middle of winter though a book called closed income march that little clear talking most simply\nA peel away but it the windows are in the budget or maybe you're just you know bought an older home you're\nRefurbishing it you call those little leaders close take some clear plastic lose when the kids in put those on the front I'm telling you can take a really old\nDraftee it official window and you get yourself another year to work all life though they're really minimize the draft\nAre coming into your home so that's a couple of things if\nYou know I'm not really encouraging you do that right now but come January that might be something you want to take a look at a river really really cold winters just talk to you mostly closed plastic over\nYou know we're worried about replacement windows on the other day or a A R phone number you can join this eight hundred eighty two three eight to five five happened to take your phone calls also at the bottom of the next hour we're going to patch plaster and take care of some rotted would\nGo over home I'm sure you have one or both of those issues and that's well dressed in the next hour of your calls next after this short break your at home\nHave a list of things to do around the house Gary will find something for you one eight hundred to three calls and your whole Jerry\nJerry's on a Sunday night seven to ten on news radio vice WHYY yes\nAnd then when they wear out I'm really fast\nYou know nobody pays any attention to them and then you end up with scratches in the wood floor anyway it's always kind of like the nylon ones\nYou can also get the non ones that have a ... to it\nWhich is you know just so that it can be angle to the come tour the leg in other words if the legs are flair to add a little bit er and then an angle that little adjustable nylon nailing glide or works better if you get straight legs just straight ... fine\nOkay great any of the ... that was kind of light and that's where you get the\n... yeah and it's only laughing because of the other day I was in one of the a stores and I was just looking for some things for the house and I was near the or collide I'll [laughter] there was probably eight feet of just different glides\nAnd back in my heart and we're days there used to be about two feet and there was all different kinds of ... ... ... how can [laughter] and so yeah yeah all hardware stores will have all kinds of choices and you may find one that you prefer more than the one I just talked about\nAll right oh very good way I'd probably stick with an eye on it and do it that way with thanks very much Gary appreciate and\nYou're all you're quite welcome thanks for the call at daycare I Mm Bye bye and again it's eight hundred and eighty\nTwo three eight to five five if you've been trying to get through and they haven't been able to now is a good time\nLines are open again it's eight hundred eight to three to five five we've been going through our weather ... that we have on our website it scary Sullivan online dot com we've kinda taken a look around the windows and around the doors\nAnd a kind of address those issues but there's other openings or in your house that you may not be aware of and uh one of 'em is\nThere's a lot going on on the foundation of your own um and really take a look at a you know on the outside above grade you can always do the inside later but above grade and take a look for any types\nOf cracks in the wall themselves they always say there's more cracks on the outside\nThen there is on the inside and if they're on the above grade there's probably some below grade too but let's address the one's above grade when you're examining the foundation and you see cracks in the foundation those can be patched up\nWith either a zip it mortar which is a neat little package a murder that can be applied to a vertical surfaces\nI'm you could also use a hydraulic a concrete patch little darker and color in most cases and I'm also dries really fast but if it's above grade I don't think you really need the hydraulic patch you just need some zip it mortar to\nCover it up also look at that ledge if you've got a brick house or encountered this not long ago when I said really taken that walk around the house examining needs things\nKeeps not only moisture output keeps insects out and I have a an invasion of aunts and I'm sure we can always talk about using products are getting exterminator and take care of the answer but really why not take care of their entry point into your home and when you're looking\nFor a um problems when you're doing your weather ... it and we just talked about cracks in the foundation take a look at the brick or sometimes right on that foundation sometimes getting the binoculars out and just kind of looking at the whole field of bricks which you're looking for\nIs cracked the brick a cracked mortar missing mortar\nAnd that's exactly what I found which was right on the a ledger the foundation and that's where I was having the invasion of the ants come in and they're marching right through the mulch\nAnd up into the crack in\nYou know we go we solve that problem by getting in a some patching materials and ... than solving that problem but\nThat's the type of things you're looking for a crack brick a missing mortar a cracks in foundations and get those things sealed up also you get utility pipe she got five phone lines electrical lines cable lines males slots all those items that I just mentioned are penetration\nInto the envelope of your home and addressing those issues with a ... keep the moisture out some parents have to do that and again when every year doing\nA like a gap between uh say gasoline is run through the foundation or phone lines or whatever a low expansion phone to get back into that cribs and seal it up is ideal yeah you can use ...\nAnd had traveled man there on ... so the house it smell like mall I had heard about ... I got ... okay I'm kind of skeptical but I'll give an inch and I did at work really\nPutting off building that dream home\nNow perfect time to talk with us about a mortgage loan\nMany options considered will find you alone then you write for\nAll today in orange\nFree I hardly do you laugh today\nBy ... [noise]\nThis project of the week is brought to buy the metal roofing alliance\nFolks are project week Israel fix some things up in the house there's probably a few things that are broken have an older house you've\nProbably got issues with plaster you've probably got issues with wood that is rotted so river friend Richard in from amateur on which you know we're talking about all the time but ah Richards got some good news Richard welcome net homeless Gary Sylvan\nHey Gary how you doing guys been busy I haven't you\nIt it has been busy as do all of our ... so a A R a must be getting still rotting in\nAnd out and just keep getting older you know what it will never stop [laughter] it'll never to exactly let's talk\nA little bit about would we had a call yesterday in fact in I recommended your product it was a I think one you and I talked about many times and that was a wood column I can't remember how old the house was when there was a new one or old one but\nShe had some of the wood that was rotted and they were suddenly cocked underneath it so it was hold water and it was a disaster\nAnd said you know what do I do can I mean just cannot patch it and then went yeah yeah you can yeah yeah it can you take us through that project I mean is that something a lot of us can tackle\nYeah yeah that's something that you hear about all the time is a good rotting wood columns and whether there's our columns or whether they're how columns um there's there's a there's definitely a way to do with your style um and remake factor chicken pox the products that are ideal for making those repairs\nUm whether what starts to go bad with what starts to rot\nUm you know rather than having to replace entire column which you do is to use our hockey products are called liquid would and where he talks to patch up those bases and it's a real simple process or any of your home or can can use these products\nI'm there to talk to you than in our liquid would product is a penetrating pox you work hard and so\nOne of the word start school go bad and it gets a rod in hockey and saw right um what'd you do is you brush away loose crumbling materials that that\nThat would rock create and then you want to saturate all that or anything with black or using that liquid with product and go liquid would will penetrate in a deep into those fibers\nAnd ultimately it solidifies and heart and all that soft material hides it all back together\nUm and make some monolithic repair heartening all that\nSo I'm so structurally it strong\nYeah absolutely absolutely the the liquid would has a press the strength training over five thousand PSI so there's a vote bearing type repair product chair this isn't just a just a a ... it's gonna sail last until you sell the house or something that's going to last\nFor generations to come into not just a quick quick cover up type of product and\nThen you'll take your ... moved out of the debt point\nYeah exactly so you want to saturate those routed areas with that liquid would and then uh you actually apply what a pox while that liquid would still wet tacky and sticky and to the ... is another part of ... but rather than be liquid this is\nMore like a party or filler ... and you use that to patch and replace the missing sections of all it so you can fill in and rebuild or anything that's missing and you can do barrel the checks and crack some books and the wood\nOr you can rebuild entire chunks of of missing material that you need to so there's really no limitation to the to the scope of or repair that you can make on something like that so\nYeah that was actually one of her concerns and I'm sure you hear this all the time and you know with a column she was getting ready to just dig all this out and she was getting me whether there would be a good idea or with her column fall down basically\nAnd um go well you know ... you don't want to go all out right away I mean we\nYou know and then I went in explained kind of how the liquid would works and boy that is that's the ticket for the for the call because you just can't do that with any product\nBall right right yeah there's a lot of a component products on the market that uh like I said there are there ... there are there are a quick cover up type product or they're or they're meant for interior used or something like that so\nYou know when you're when they're making that type or repair you definitely want to make sure that you're using something structural unstable or something like a two parts followed a proxy liquid ... types or\nNo you folks at every turn him good news about these products and no because for years or for a few years that I've been talking about that I became aware of and I know you're really involved in the restoration industry\nAnd and now reaching out to you know the D. I. white guy and it can really take care of some of these issues around their home\nAnd we were sending them ... or send the Amazon but now they can do to your local local farmers are\nRight exactly yeah we're we're pretty excited I'm ... ... what a pox products or have just been added to the age distribution network and uh\nUh so we're we're just trying to get the word out with a lot of the white customers um they don't necessarily understand that a lot of the a store as a parent in the hardware stores in stores\nUm you know the the owners of those places are are looking to those customers to find out what type of products they need\nRight now and now our liquor would have ... a distribution channel and so if you can't hide it at your local a store already a beer\nOr ask your you know the the order the paint manager of a local a store and they can they can order those products right and they can they can get them on the show for yeah\nSure sure hum rape products and certainly make those projects that look a kind of overwhelming a obtainable and um you know as you just kind of walk through this is a project most people can tackle it to her home\nCrawl exactly yeah exactly are we simplified the products they're they're eager to years they're easy to mix\nThere's things to your to do all this year sees are are gasping are nasty chemicals involved with these\nProducts um and you don't you don't have to be a pro you just have to be able to follow through simple instructions and uh and anybody can can use and and create a successful repair\nSuper so that's called liquid wouldn't wouldn't pox\nLet me shift gears a little bit because of folks that have older homes and they have plaster walls there always challenged I don't care what kind of house you live and they're always challenged with cracks in plaster usually you'll find them above doorways come the angle cracks or windows\nCode and its cracker K. K. R. A. C. K. K. O. piece of crack cocaine that product is designed specifically for I'm making repairs to old plaster walls and the confused on drywall sheet rock as well um but it's a it's designed to be in the last ... patch\nThat will ... with the wall as those houses tend to move\nIn that plaster and very flexible by the way\nThat great but the problem is those walls that over some ... rams adore and one of those old houses or they\nFind the windows shut your heart and and that plaster a disagrees with that ends up splitting open and\nHow fast you're on the phone down way register online and only\nTime I ... for less than five seven and a half or something like the\nRepair mine is I don't mind warm hope I now pass on seven seven he's radio five six\nReveals used traffic and winter season use radio by ... end up\nAnd go from Alabama and on one of three point nine AM thank you and the question I have a my father in a while I'm a care giver I my son okay and uh he's eighty six years old\nAnd uh I live with him and he asked trouble uh [noise] I Am open a can\nClean up after yourself in any way to lean real far over on the fact he's calling me right now but I have a Lincoln a toilet when he landed over\nIt takes ... around the bottom on the base so so I'm On the floor\nOn the floor yeah so um what's going on there is a that toilet is not stabilized on the floor or is a little bit um warned so that that toilet that sits\nAnd just to kind of give you a one on one on how that world as you've got a four inch pipe the sewer line that's coming up and you got a ... and you have a wax ring the wax ring then seals at the bottom of the toilet and two bowls\nAnchor the ... toilet down to the floor\nOf which go through the uh little plans\nAnd secured what's happened is all the way it should have been shifted under the front either those boats have become loose they've broken probably just became loose\nAnd that seal is become compromise so when we're flushing that that flush of the water in the toilet bowl is since the toilet is not sealed to lose the\nA pipe properly you're getting a little spill out on the sides so what you need to do is you need to shut off the water you need to you're going to take that floor off the flinch I'm In the planes again you can't get a pony nice scrape off that wax ring\nAnd then I Want you to get what they call a perfect seal the little bit easier to make disrepair with this Mike\nIn a perfect sealed in Mount ... on the ... much more durable than the wax ring even though there is a ... case in rubber I'm In you'll tightened that up real good your ... on the floor of the toilet to the floor and I think you're going to eliminate your problem\nAll right my friend thank you much for the call I appreciate good luck with that in Charles welcome\nGarry Yes sir I got an injury or a problem All right I had some holes in my garage was then I got those patch just fine the problem\nIs there's a ... on the war ... looked strike it down with\nA ... like a quote unquote plastered type ... that kind of running and rock okay and I'm Wondering how can I replicate that\n... million dollar question Charles I'm so there's all different kinds of techniques for that all different people have different techniques and even if you try to duplicate the same technique it's difficult\nBecause we all have our own kind of artistic touch to it so some people do um uh they'll use brush around brushed they'll the opposite for texture others will have a half moon or half around type trial remotest\nAffected you direct\nOr not I don't know I Know what do you mean by dripped\nUh it it just it it kind of done like in a vertical fashion and it looks like it was just going to be when they put it on the wall\nOkay well that's probably your tip 'em that's probably what they've done they probably took topping compound I Can't really visualize what the design would look like that and I mean I'm so um my guess is they would take topping compound and a drill was a big mix or on the end of it\nAnd they would\n... thin out the ... that topping compound and then probably take a like a wallpaper and brush uh I'm In literally do what you just said kind of drifted or that's what I was\nThinking yeah yeah I think and and there's real no answer to it Charles I tell people try to imagine how that person put that on a big piece of cardboard and try to replicate it\nYou come close you probably won't be perfect but you come close but it sounds like if you're talking about the you know a dripping or a a rain type of finish on there I Would use you know the topping compound diluted\nA you know just maybe just a little bit thicker than paint and just kinda I'll use the word slap it on with a wide uh wallpaper and brush\nThat what you're saying chopping compound would that be like using a ... a pre make singer ... yeah\nYeah yeah just use a regular um you know pre mixed a I called topping come out and just mix more water and to get it more Ramy\n... show okay that sounds like the solution\nAll right good luck thank you take care Bye bye [noise] all\nWell we're fixing up all kinds of things if you'd like to join his love the heavy it's eight hundred eighty two three eight to five five\nEarlier in the show today somebody called and said man I loved that middle seat furniture\nOne of my favorite products to it cleans aim restores woodwork wood furniture in perfect for kitchen kid that removes the grind the dirt stretches the old watch from the wood and then re stores is by the way it's also great for removing\nThe he brings in water rings that we get on the kitchen table it's ...\nAnd it's ... am A L K ... dot com\nCheck it out give it a try to reach the\nOrange will continue with your calls here at home with Gary Sullivan [noise]\nYou're always just a click away that Gary fell over the online dot com he's at home when Gary [noise]\nOkay well you can do one or two things done you can either measure\nThe actual groove in which this line is going to fit in or if you already know this blindness too fat and and I know exactly what you mean is just to Smith of fat to get that role or to push jets flying in\nTake a snippet of that's flying in and get the next size down there's there's only probably six different sizes\nOf blind if it's snow again you just can't quite get it down and you only got to go down to the next you know the next size will will get the job done for you\nWell the one that one I've had the most trouble with is a screening closure and it's a it's a flat and it has reached someone once you go into the groove mhm there's a slight recession to the to the left side mhm it's like a ... it's not\nYeah I'm familiar with the flats blind to and in fact I just got done some uh this summer I have a big screened in porch in those panels all have the flats blind\nAnd I'm I'm trying to think how I chose this point I think I had some at the house\nI'm In the one I head of the first one was to be the other side's fit in just fine I put it in with the roller and I don't know if if you yeah I I didn't measure so I don't know I had one at home that was too big and I use the next say damage\nIt worked fine but I I get the challenge uh but I think if you can measure that actual opening\nA you address the the issue but I I get it on that flight buying that can be a challenge [laughter] All right thanks much down a couple of tips too if you're gonna work on that\nUm you know doing the show for thirty one years you kinda forget some of the tips you passed along in a screening tip this time of year is a great screening tip here's the deal I'm you know the time changes next week right and so it's gonna be\nDarker in the evening and we're going to get in\nA lot of parts of the country more the dreary time of year\nYou would be amazed at how much light is blocked by screens in your windows got fools screens in your windows\nI'll bet you it's going to block the third a little light that's coming in your house may be more and if you get a good fall day papa new screens out you know if you think we're pretty much finished with opening up the windows pop that screen now\nTake a look at the screen screen that the fiberglass screen it lifespan of that's ten to twelve years and they kind of gets thread bear and now\nThe fall is a great time to go ahead and do your re screening get it done on the big flat surface ... screen the screens allow more light and the winter time and then you'll be ready\nTo go in the springtime when they go back in ... and didn't know which one goes into\nA witch a window start with the one the window closest to the kitchen sink and that's number one you just take a little sharply input number one\nRight at the top of the frame and then go clockwise around your house and number but replacing that a a screen now is a great time\nOf year to do just that and the ... line that you're pushing that rubber I used a membrane\nInto the group the whole screen intact\nThere's ... tools looks like a big pizza cutter but then there's this line get this ... blind mice no we've got that wrong ... blind mouse and it I'm\nJust check it out the hardware store as from what they look at you like you're crazy doesn't look like a pizza cutter ads of about a half circle flat\nAnd the wind rolls over to rollers and it's much easier process of pushing that's flying\nInto the groove so good time of year to tackle that particular project a hundred and eighty two three eight to five five Marilyn welcome\nCarrie yeah I'm I have a I have an F ... fighter knack uh-huh [noise] and I\nHaven't Eric I ... I started a heck of a ladder and I ... back here and then I read the directions we have our our people are how I had her hair American adding home get kind of having a little bit of problem with or anything I can get\nAre you finding them around the drain\nAround and around and I was kind of my background Harris okay around that drain also hire um\nYeah well one thing is and then we'll tell you about the kind of maintenance so we don't have that problem or one of the things the shallow bowl\nUh with some\nLittle water a little apple cider\nA low apple cider vinegar and the drop of liquid soap and set that up there'll be attracted to that oh okay\nAnd I'm that'll attract them to that and they'll meet their demise and that'll help but they'd like everything else are looking for food ... and that's where they're going to get trapped in your little trap that you're creating but what they're living on the sends a little gross\nOr they're living on the bacteria in the scum that in the drains\nAll right so I I say often everything we use anymore as Jill we got Joe ... Joe ... everything's jailed and that sticky so like me I use a gel a shaving cream cone shave in Washington dumped going down the drain\nBut that gel even though it goes down the drain it starts slowly\nA coating the top of that trap or the top of the pipe inside portion of the pipe and that a judge\nA whole combined with flaky skin some risk yours is the bacteria in these little guys start finding it and they started feeding on that and so there is a product um that is the silliest it's actually a like a culture bacteria\nThat creates enzymes that eats that bacteria\nOkay so we're live lead to a point were cleaning the inside of our pipes\nRight okay that particular product it's also used to a ... claw blockages and things like the current pipe uses a maintenance product it's called ... right at her four ounces of water I think it's a forget whether it's a quarter water but\nWith all due is like in the bathroom vanity\nOr you pull up the ... the the stopper or you put four ounces of dream but when you're a little warm water and there are ... I think it's ten minutes and you release the water it flushes down coats the inside of those pipes\nIf there's any minor blockages it eliminates that too but that starts eating all that bad bacteria and so you've taken their food source away\nOkay can I get that at the box or am I\nAm I I picked up at ... I think do best curious it also uh I don't know if it's in the big box stores or not\nI Can't take the garbage editor Clapper I kept a really\nGood I forgot to tell you about and so other people listening let's repeat that that little splash guard that rubber eyes wide or we put in food it grinds it up and spit said all over the back\nSide of that and it and it has to us right now how can\nI add one other question around radical I Know ... ... ... okay you ever heard of that cycle I gotta feeling of how I ...\nOh yeah I ... yeah\nWell the the ceiling probably less than the others but um I'd say a polish every two weeks on it just makes that granted scream I'm so cleaning it you know whenever it gets like granted does\nWe clean it with the the wipes all the time and then polish I'd say maybe once every couple of weeks or so and he thinks that granite really pop\nWhy don't we didn't get that don't work I'm renter and things like that happened with a lot of what I Want to know that I I ...
