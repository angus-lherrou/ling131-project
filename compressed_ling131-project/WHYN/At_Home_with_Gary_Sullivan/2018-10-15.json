[noise]\n... well well hold on you use the wedding forget correct\nWe do you mind okay did to get rid of it are no\nGood okay we got a lot of tree okay and in fact the attack\n... is it back in the exact same place where it was yeah\nWell that that surprises me a little bit in Maryland because the wedding forget it does do a complete kill and the complete kill should I'm not going to say prevent because that's too big of a word let's say slow down the progression of re growth uh so it does leave they\nI I guess it would leave a little bit of a film nothing that you should be able to see nothing that should be slippery but um since it is a complete kill it should take longer for the ... growth to take place though you say there's a lot of woods and a lot of shade so\n... so yeah so let's do this um I think that whole problem is telling us something we can certainly use the wet and forget again and ...\nYou know it works um in it'll kill it but I think we need to get that brick sealed oh I don't think what's going on and remember the mold the middle do the algae the fungus the like and\nAll that keen grow unless there's moisture\nSo we got a shaded area we got a lot of ah\nUm dust that's on that broke we got a lot of a morning dues and ... and he keeps that brick wet\nAnd if that brick isn't waterproof per se it wicks that moisture in and it's um it holds that brick or holds that water net brick for a longer period of time so if we get to\nA mold the bill doing everything off and then we use a brick ceiling or brick waterproof and cause you don't really want to seal you want to allow water from the backside to transfer through it\nBut the rain water you want to keep it from absorbing into the brick and then I think what will have is we'll have that problem pretty much fixed up\nNorth side of the house and it kind of year we ... we hardly ever get any sense right\nRight right All right how old is the house\nOr the house forty eight years old okay but now the patio and put in last fall okay but we did not feel it\nOkay so this is on the patio this is on the floor so they kind of cavers right\nYeah and we had company can now not done it yeah name and what is\nIt yeah you need to get that sealed there's no question about it so you can get out and\nSo we can spray the wedding forget on their if you'd like or if you want something\nUm that's immediate so you can do it you know in a day or two um we could use like a high grade a a missionary cleaner in fact there's a website let me just give you that Maryland then you can decide which way you want to go okay we know the wedding forget work so but we also know it's going to take four weeks to get it to clean\nAnd this time of year we might want to move a little bit faster\nSo it has to do that Clinton forget\n... probably I I ...

H. Y. N.\n[noise]\nThis project of the week is brought you buy the metal roofing alliance far back to where we go thirty three minutes after the top of their you're at home with Gary Sullivan\nAs we get into the heating season um I Know a lot of people will be calling in their back bedrooms will be cold and there are upstairs will be cold and they want to know why and they just bought this a super energy efficient furnace and\nA you know they're they're they're um whether heating building go down that much and they'll call no so you know what's going on and I always talk about the whole system you know you you're buying the furnace the heat air and uh you got a system of duct work pipes\nThat run through out the house that distribute the heated air that you just paid for\nBut it's out of the Hugh there doesn't get to those rooms or doesn't help you much right and if that furnaces real efficient but you're losing that heated air along the highway of duck we're it's not very efficient as so\nThat's why we brought in Tracy Martin She is with a company called arrows seal and you can check this out at arrows seal\nDot com but Trey she\nHelped me out what what's going on there was a\nScary things or had any well he'll what's going on I mean you you nailed it are precisely the furnace a itself makes the air and temperature control of the air but without the highway and you you as you put it that that effort to deliver it to\nA all of the living spaces in the room had little holes along the way that air is creeping out Lincoln out uh it's kinda like if you have a garden hose mhm they want water to get out the end of it right\nYeah and if you have a ... it's not going to work very well written ... exactly yeah so I don't know if you've got the data for this but do you mean your thoughts on it a typical home\nWe got a gamut of age tones out there um would you say most people's duct work is compromised\nYeah actually I Do have the data and ah yeah yeah and it's from the department of energy or into the department of energy estimates that a Ninety five\nPercent of homes have leaky duct work and another misconception that's out there and um you know you might hear someone say well I have a new duct work well new effort can still leap\nWell it's just because you put two pieces of anything together and it it's prone to having you know points of leakage\nNow you may not notice in fact I Know you don't do this but I was Seventeen years old my job was to run duct work [laughter]\nAnd I don't think duck works installed like this anymore because what I used to have to do and I had to do it right that when we put those two foot pieces together we didn't have to run little heck said screws\nAnd make sure those duck works were connected I'm not so sure that's done anywhere anymore\n[noise] yeah I mean there's there are um different approaches to the installation of growers and the the setting of the the two ... and certain states across the country have codes now that require that for me sealed when it's installed though and\nWhen you were saying that Ninety five percent figure of duck works leaky in the United states first thought I had this sounds like we need new duck work at our homes and we need newer technology works that probably help huh\nIt would be OK Harris he'll helps\nTo well I was going to go there to do because well you know you're not going to run a business of Ninety five percent of the homes of leaky a duck work if we changed it you you got you got fifty years to get your ghetto that's true that is true All right so I'm ... so it's a good bet that every one that's\nListening they're not getting the efficiency of that foreign as they're not getting that heated there to the places they want so what is their CEO\nWell there is a technology that was developed about Twenty years ago a by the department of energy acts really uh-huh yup\nDown at the UC Berkeley lab mhm um and it was it was developed to help make the duck system more efficient ... at the best way to put it to heal up those tiny holes and crack and that our our typical into an adopted system mhm and\nAnd also it's a it's a long term\nYou know almost permanent type solutions once you do this technology and it feels that the duct work and it's guaranteed for ten years but it's been a stress test it to last up to forty or so in those cases\nAre as long as you're going to be in your home right right so it's kind of a liner\nWell kind of I I some people\nTo simplify it look at it like kind of like six a flat\nIn a way okay bye And to be real precise about it it doesn't actually coat the duct work when it does is it finds those holes okay like you have a balloon pop a hole in it mhm you're gonna have air escaping out of that whole right kind of pressure on different ...\nOur technology is able to find those holes and then he'll I'm from the outside in the negative air pressure exactly that's exactly right but\nYou know ... ...\n... is that right now that okay All right yeah so ah so I have this done to my home and I I don't know when it was but I'm gonna say\nThirteen Years ago and and I notice the difference immediately so if a homeowner\nFirst of all you got to find a deal that's installing that I'm assuming that you've got air soul dot com\nEra's he'll dot com and there is located are there\nAre okay so I called his company up and I say I want you to check my ...\n... ... ah ... ours system itself will check to see how leaky the doctor again so we do a before and after type comparison when they hook up the machine and they can run a test\nTo see what they charge you know like a blower door to us for a house\nIt's a it's kind of like what's called the duct blaster tests and they're similar okay I'm ... different dealers approach it differently and you know what they may or may not charge for that but there's other ways Gary I mean you I can walk around my house you can walk around your house\nAnd just use your eyes to look for signs of duck linkage it's really it's really pretty easy to find a happy and I talked to my my mom and my sister about it and that they were able to just walk around and find evidence that oh gosh I could have what kind of evidence they find\nKnow the story\n\n\n[noise]\nThey're buying traction won\n\nThis year's Avengers brands like Mars National Geographic and

I'm Sorry caused the fish and the drains showed sure you ask about your duct work sure\nSenate does they got phone calls and said hey this Ninety seven percent foreigners has not lowered my eating bill one bit yet that the water that but yeah sure you're right All right so if you are buying a furnaces getting installed talk about talk to you to ignition really\nAbout a thermal imaging some walls and make sure I don't have the leakage because\nOtherwise you're not going to get the value of that I'm highly efficient of furniture you're living in an older home and you got a ... coup spots throughout the again get a hold of an H ... thermal imaging thing go to\n... dot com in a you can find somebody that's a skill to installing this particular thing and you say the ... around the three years yeah on average yeah that that's often so look wrap up give me some benefits of if you're perfect duck working in a nice\nNice uh efficient furnace and I have ... on the dock work\nAll right Gary I can do this one in my sleep you know good I was thinking\nTo myself that might be an unfair question grow up with a well known now right at kind of thing because there's really there's really no other product in our industry that can do all of the things that that can do and plenty that can be one of our two of the things that when you break it down for a year ago\nIf you're a homeowner who has ... done ... on your ... and the things are going to notice they're going to be more even temperatures throughout your house none of the hot and cold spot cool\nAnd you're also going to notice a difference and the humidity you're going to be able to better control\nThe humidity in your home so dry home or a superhuman home that should be even doubt that should be a big benefit air quality now this one this is near and dear to my heart and you're going to be breathing the nasty contaminants from the eighties faces in the attic or the cross\n... being sucked into the leaky Duckworth\nGotten right and then as the the lady of the house I might not have to dust as much ... and that's that's a fun one my what\nI mean does worry me then I just wanted to read from design of college I mean\nI ... well she doesn't think [laughter] I Do\nFeel a little less ... less allergens energy savings you will notice that as well and then at this one is also I think really important and that is it's going to ... tech and prolong the life of your age me the equipment and it's going to make sure you you get what\nYou paid for nature and you get the efficiency which are hoping for and so then the second\nAll right um music playing Tracey thanks very much for coming down the studio and\nDon't let us know exactly what folks can do because I Know there's a big problem I I get questions about this\nAll the time in a solution quite honestly is pure steel products so folks if you're interested you want to know a dealer or you can go to arrows feel dot com arrows field dot com and\nAgainst thanks much for the scary part a break at the top of the hour when we come back we'll take your questions about your home improvement project or\nMaybe getting your home ready for winter or number's eight hundred to three\nTo four or five years old [noise]\nTo get your hands dirty with Garry McCarthy one eight hundred to three talk your at home with Gary [noise]\nWhen George Mallory mornings at one point news radio vice jumped which way\nDo you watch college football\nAcquired news talk more about ASU online degrees tax school two three five five one seven that's S.
