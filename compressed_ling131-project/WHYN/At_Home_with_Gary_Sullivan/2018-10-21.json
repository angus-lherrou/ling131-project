E. L. stop all which is a fun way of I guess the Italians say stop to stop all\nIt is a legal doctrine that says even if you do have a case if you will whacked not to go forward to argue your breach you accepted that and that's the argument they're going to make you have accepted the fact that they're not going to pay you a bonus now uh can you go back\nYou're not going to go back nine years I guarantee you that uh\nCan you go back uh maybe but they're going to keep on arguing I Would saying hey you know what yeah we had a deal but we weren't dealing with it and he's obviously he's OK with it so um\nYou can talk to a lawyer how many ... ten thousand dollars by the way your least ten thousand dollars is very interesting uh but let's say the only be liable if there's liability pretend grant and that's over nine you're Ninety thousand dollars you know we're talking to a lawyer\n[noise] yeah yeah so I talked to a lawyer and we'll see how far how far it goes in hello and welcome\nYes

porch light okay can be installed or any of your doors um you know front door backdoor site or\nIn the ... as you mentioned earlier you basically just take off your old light fixture and replace it with a new fixture and you just use the existing wiring is already there yeah no additional wires yeah it's all everything else is wireless so it's basically it's a ten or Fifteen minute a project and you turn off the break or by the way\nSo good point [laughter] very good very good so you turn on their break or literally I made sure we put one up and it was it was no more than ten minutes and I'm you know the ... has a nice little diagrams you know how far the screws need to come out and you just slide in black\nWearing a black why or why are why our groundwater to ground screwed\nYour business him absolutely and he downloaded the Q and a half which is a very powerful user friendly have downloaded that and you connect your\nLight using the app to your local route or in the house and that and then after that basically your light than is connected to the cloud and you're ready to go it's a very easy process okay so seriously it is that easy and say I mean it really really is that easy and you got a flood light Sylvia of\nOld flood light you can just simply ... yes if you get a flight over your patio or your your garage or your driveway or corner of your house you basically just remove the lights and then you installed a new and we have what's called a quick connect plate\nWhich is a a plate that you mount a first allows you to wire that played up you're not actually holding the light and you're right it's just a just a disk that you actually wire up\nAnd went that's once that's mounted you take up the light and you just snap it into place and you're good to go\nSouth really has managed to light the maximus flood light is easier to mail then a flood light you buy the big ... really is because of the quick ... am absolutely hit really really is All right now the fun part okay you said you download the app so this\nCamera and light functions on the app on your phone\nRight so you know there is a very user friendly app that you can see all of your cameras on your lights are on your your smartphone with your apple user Android doesn't matter\nUm you know the first thing that happens is even when you're not looking at your phone if someone comes to your door you get a notification that someone's at your door so I'm at work you get alert I'm\nIn the office in fact last night we were having dinner the one fellow that was with us as well somebody's at my door and it was very cool and so it notify makes the sound or listen\nTo the ad sewage whatever the notification you have it vibrates or the noise what how their you set it up and your phone and then you can actually click on it and if you click on it then it actually takes you right to that camera alive and you're seeing the person real time and you can actually talk to them real time that you can talk to them have a conversation if you like or you can\nYou can press you can dial nine one one you can actually pressing alarm if there are a burglar I mean you can do is learn that can be press so if you don't know who this person is and they're not dropping off a package or maybe they're taking a pack each\nUm you can take action absolutely yeah on the spot and and no matter what if you if you answer the door or not or if you go to the live feed the the video will be recorded as into the cloud for for downloading viewing later so so if mom and dad say no kids in the house while we're gone [laughter]\nYou can see if there's kids coming to the ... see a lot ... usually not every child legs are products\n[laughter] we've heard lots of stories last couple of years is sell this coach light with camera or are these prevalent or do you are the only ones that have like ... Samaras are are usually cameras free standing or yeah so there's a\nThere'd be an issue again and as a consumer I think you know you have to decide you search the mark and see what works for you the best but in terms of the porch light\nA application you know we're really the only ones that carry a porch lights solution and we offer that the foresight does come and different um different styles and different finishes 'cause we trying to accommodate you know the\nThe lights in the design of your house I'm so we don't really have any competitors in that space there there's some knock offs that are trying to mimic what we're doing but really there\nYou know as a release the porch light we've you know really know competitors\nThe flight there is another option or two out there um but again I I think we've got the best solution if you compare the products are in the market with ours I I I Believe\nAnd our customers tell us as all the time they replaced their existing\nProduct with ours and how much happier they are with the product [noise]\nWhat would be the difference is that the quality of the camera and the quality of the camera detection range him in our detection range is Seventy feet um detection on the camera it's a hundred and two hundred and Seventy degrees around the camera to detection range definitely I'm I'm you know one of the differences the quality of the camera\nYou know we use you know not to get to technical but because of our application and our software and the from wearing the products we actually use less resources so\nUm we're not as resource um ... heavy so our products will work a lot of times when social services week\nOr a wife I said no it's not as strong as as you know others products requires so um you know just generally speaking they have a very good um customer satisfaction the app is definitely a difference if you compare our app with other\nAnimals so I'm really yeah I mean we do some nails are so that means is when you're looking at your videos you know you don't have to actually play a video to see what's on the video we show you the thumb nails for all the videos\nAnd you can sort by camera and sorted by by day in time um it's just it's again there's so many features in our lab that customers really like and what we hear that you know quite often\n[noise] now on the coach light with the camera that camera is I mean you talk about the angle and you talk about the distance but its position of all too yeah so it's a it's\nIn a ball basically um both the the flow lights and the coach later the other a porch lights\nWe put the camera in a in a in a ball that can be when you first install the product\nYou want to aim that cameras you get the optimal a field of view so you want to cover your porch or or cover your driveway you basically look at your apple you're aiming that camera and then you have a locking ringing lock that camera and the place and then and typically it just stays there then\n... but when you're watching a when you're watching the um the either the live feed or you're watching a video later you can ... you can actually pinchers screen and zoom in so\nYou're able to go in pretty close to a to whatever you're looking at through the camera you can get pretty close if used them in with the pension is great\nGreat so I'm Daniel let's open up the phone lines if someone has

cameras to play back mark when we went to a break you said something about adding ten seconds\nBefore before what before you see right so what happens is the the cameras are always recording in memory or in buffer so when we're when we do have motion a sense and weeks in the video clip up to the cloud we put that ten seconds onto the front of the video so nothing's missed\nSo if a if a driver or

how can we help me yes\nWell I heard a click on TALK ... with a camera uh-huh now what happens is that many perfectly comes out there and damages that are covered that is that possible and that kind of cover it for the Clinton thing\nOh sure I mean if they if they cover the camera that I mean obviously it's going to block the share of the um the viewing of the camera the you know the good news about the cameras very and conspicuous I mean you don't even really realize there was a camera on the light\nI guess that's also another good thing for that ten second buffer though right yeah you because you gotta walk up you got to get the camera they've already got John camera and on video so yeah there is also\nOne other small feature we actually have a status light it's a little um indicator light that used to tell you you know different colors blue it means it's on line but if you really want to be you know incognito you can actually turn that light off in the app so that little blue light is not on and the person does not see that when they woke up to your door so\nBut very good question to die and you're thinking\nThey're not alarm goes off on your phone if somebody were actually not a light off the wall fake so to speak\nNo you would just get your normal notification greeting at someone's at your door and of course once that happens I mean there is a panic button on your app that does sound an alarm so some some someone does damage to the delight or covers it up you can push the panic button no light flashes and the alarm goes off on the light itself\nI think you're right not All right Diane thank you care so it is smart in order to bring what you said a hundred and eight to three to five five we're talking about smart security lights by maximus lighting fascinating Randy welcome\nI ah I have a question we shoot the runaround what they're saying trick or treaters apart\nYes I mean the um you know if you have the porch lights on your front door um I mean that's designed to pick up motion within say ten Fifteen feet when your porch area\nBut you can set in the ... you can set the zones that you actually want to be active or hot that would actually trigger the the motion sensor\nI'm so yes it will pick it up you and you can do to there's another feature that I didn't mention earlier I mentioned it now is that um if you see the dogs that are in your yard you know used to look out your window you can see them\nUm you can go into the app anytime even whether the the motions been triggered or not and you can do just uh you can hit the record button live she can do record on demand\nSo if you're something going on in your yard it's in the field of view of the camera no matter what it is um if you want to start recording you just hit the record button and it started recording that activity\nOr any\nI I just curious 'cause we have actually right now and I have turned off every ten minutes though turn around the house and go wandering if they are the way that the Justice Center on it\nThey're absolutely there's two things one is you can you can control of his own drink literally would just show you a grid of the field of view of the camera and you can actually you can highlight the areas in that grid that you want to be a sensitive for to to the actual activate the motion and the camera\nAnd beyond that you can actually turned into a bar you can slide the sensitivity up or down\nSo you I call it tuning so when she saw the product you can kind of tune you know which alerts you want to get the ones that matter and again we've built all that features into the product in the up very cool and then\nSee that's man you gotta think everything don't you I'm fascinated by by the questions again it's eight hundred eight to three to five five she'll a welcome\nHello yes I was wondering like how can you have any generator that are run by ... or any solar panels or any how roof tiles or anything like that\nThey're selling the security lighting but that's something you could add to your home but these things are are they go ahead I'll be quiet\nOut mhm among all that\nShit was crazy it was really crazy I'm trying my now literally her opportunity to catch I get here and that that probably I say\nYou can pick up a pod cast angel again we we got that on our website scary solving online dot com but one of the questions I have for you as we we hit somebody actually concerned about that also\nAnd and again did they have any video of this happening at all now yeah bond them ... and on this particular product is ... ... this maximus lighting\nThat wouldn't be a problem though right we're gonna we're gonna when the videos is to send him to the cloud we actually I'm at ten seconds before the motion sensor goes off we we both dead on the front of the video\nSo you would get the person coming up to the door and see them in the video before the damage whites keep in mind though are cameras integrated into the light fixture is not a like a lot of other products are separate cameras you can easily spot right this is actually it is to a ball that's on the bottom of the light fixture that\nMost of the time you don't even know what to their looks like a ... coach would know that the camera's there unless you're really looking forward to but if you did you have that extra ten seconds which is awesome unavoidable were catch him don't worry we're going to catch them yeah\nSecond follow up on that answer a possibility that the way we do maybe possibly a building that are on\nI watched the first one we stole a car can't keep them tying security our vehicle to\nWell I mean we can we are an integrated though with a with Google Home an election which is now in your vehicle so I suppose that bridge could could be done yeah I had at the first time I've heard that question it's a good one\nThat's great that one day [laughter] yeah sure [laughter] yeah but the Google it certainly could be up there are sure\nI'm In love it love at\nGreat thank you very good thanks angel appreciate it and again these are available at Costco it's available at home depot got smart listeners I'm telling you what huh right there and\nThey were actually the promises and other stores to I Know there's not not every store willows lows carries I Believe in five or six hundred stores okay also carry the product to so okay can they order online course yet if you Google the maximus smart security ladder maximus came up a light\nYou'll find all the different economic platforms that you can buy the product okay I think I Know the answer to this one\nAndy welcome hey my question was you touched on the lights earlier but our our in the camera I got a ... actually just hit the light switch as they're walking out the door am I going to lose the functionality of the camera\nYeah so you know a lot of the uh your porch lights are on a switch we recommend that you actually a wire around that said that the camera cannot be turned off I mean you get an education that the ... the cameras off line\nBut um we recommend that you actually eliminate the switch so that the powers never uh never turned off and then just programming is on your apt\nTo do whatever you want yeah and you can turn the alerts off too so let's say you're back door and you go in and out of your backdoor all day you can actually go into the app and turn the alerts off you know during the day if you don't want to get those you know while you're home sure but we recommend\nThe optimal way to use the product is just not have the power be able to turned off All right All right\nVery good thank you up by the way we got one line open we got just a few more minutes with mark if you want to grab it real quick it's eight hundred eight two three eight to five five eight ... two three eight to five five uh we're just going I mean I'm sitting here I Know it I've installed it um\nDo rebels
