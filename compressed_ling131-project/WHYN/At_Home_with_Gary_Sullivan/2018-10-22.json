{"month": "10", "state": "MA", "station": "WHYN", "content": "Hello yes there are good morning ... um I had an eight hundred and eighty five dollar electric bill on my own\nThree months ago holy taught him by eight hundred and twenty five followed by seven hundred and fifty five ... started analyzing everything from the pope pop to the bases and so forth diamond in the south in South Carolina so it was all\nRight ah shutting the average um several things on\nThe house was encapsulated\nAnd they put to a good\nSize ... Mehta fires underneath that it was about ... three thousand square feet on that floor ha ha and one hours analyzing shutting everything down isolated the D. humidifiers\nAh they were using the equivalent of a hundred and thirty three dollars a month well\nAnd my question we could go further into it if if you please but my real question is simple and easy is\nDo you have to run the suckers twenty four seven because I'm a if you don't you know I can cut a fit to a hundred dollars probably right there and then on my poop pop icon ... Hungary\nRight right well that's great question a demon of fires are very expensive to operate a lot of people don't realize that even little tiny portable ones yeah was misled\nI was told when by the pest control company when it was done that it would have your house so playing you know underneath and it is ... you know then it died in Ninety five degrees outside you can set up I don't eat there and enjoy yourself you know\nBut um I was told that the money saved from that and sledding factor would be more than it would cost to run the date humidifiers and\nIt's actually had virtually no effect that I can notice on any of the heating or cooling\nYeah I'm so when it's running twenty four hours a day what is the humidity level inside your home\nThe humidity level and shot at my home ah has traditionally and continued to be a little high ...\nOr ... even in areas a lot from one side to the other you know how they set to humidifiers\nAh ... the the extremity on the kitchen side I'm a little higher in extra extremity owned the master bedroom sat on the opposite as a little higher\nDo you have any idea what the percentage is the ... the percentages I mean is it below fifty is above fifty or\nIt's below fifty but I'm a I've had some pushing and home went to this because uh even though I'm a figures guy the humidity humidity is not what am I right things but uh I think I've heard figures and the high thirties or around forty you know\nWell in all honesty were really where you want to be as in the winter time if you can kicking around thirty five forty that's fine but I think it's a stretch if you can keep it below fifty in the summer I think you're doing great\nOkay well my concern though is underneath the house and that was mode and every time we had the rabbit treated\nRight well and it was probably run in Seventy percent them\nAnd and so once it was treated the um the humidity has been unbelievably low underneath a house\nOr what they do they put the plastic on the ground and help yeah yeah they totally ... so you have ... and all that water vapor\nWhere you're talking like a Fifteen thousand dollar deal\nRight right and I know exactly what you mean\n... really Eighteen nigger if you uh work on it\nRight but your question is do I need to use those human fires all the time they\nCould I possibly maybe once a month a run him for about three days\n[noise] uh I Can't answer that because I don't know how much in flux of humidity is you've changed the environment by using vapor barriers and different things like this I tell you what I Would do\nJust totally locked and you know yeah I mean his hair free all your van shipping closed off and everything right\nSo what I Would do is I Would go in I Would buy a little um like weather station it's about the size of a book you\nCan put that up in your bedroom or your hallway or wherever you want and then the sensor\nYou just place that down into the crawl space area it's going to give you the temperature and it's going to give you the humidity and you're gonna watch it and you know maybe there is times you can turn that off if it's really really hot really humid\nI'd just be real curious to know and I don't think you have to answer yet what that humidity level is is there a you miss that on the humidifier\nI I think underneath a house in the home and to this but I think I heard figures like Eighteen or something like that you know\nEighteen what on the humidity or reading or whatever\nOn its way too low yeah you'll never needed that low\nYeah ... well I was told by another pass guy that it might or pure hardwood floors you know a ... if if you if it's too much\nAgain I think you wanted a fifty percent okay in the summertime below forty percent in the wintertime\nI Will get a sense are down there and a weather station so I could just manually monitor monitor it by one of those from lows sure sure and then you can see what's going on and if you got it off for three days and all of a sudden the humidity level starts creeping up to\nFifty five sixty percent you turn it on you drive it down to maybe I don't know forty five percent questionnaire\nUnless I'm abusing your time or\nThe pope hop it's a it's a um one and a half horse\nAnd that's eight and me and about a hundred and thirty dollars a month right and I was told by ... or ... that once the temperature of the water hits sixty five and below chemicals added or a moot point because it doesn't react to the\nAh that may be I I don't know that okay like that that that makes sense since\nIt's logical for me that that that does make sense so that that point boy hit the filter or why of the pumpkin going\nJim we got to go but monitor that humidity no there's no sense in running the humidifier if you don't need it now however you gotta remember when you got 'em going full blast where are you right around fifty percent so you turn them off I\nThink it's probably going to go up a little bit but the cooler it is outside you got a big cold front come through Florence when it gets cooler it's usually less humid\nAnd maybe it's something that you can deactivate him at that point ... monitor where your humanity level is All right thanks much for the call I appreciate your welcome to ah joined us our phone number's eight hundred eighty two three\nEight to five

if you're home didn't have that and your neighbors did you got the humidity issue so there's things you can do to control and knock down the potential for having humidity issues\nAgainst you\nAnd I would start with the simple ones again I don't know what's your status on across bases but see if that is in ...\nYou know you can eliminate any ground moisture coming up and then I'd ... really concentrate on ventilation fans within the house again everybody and not everybody but most people turn on their fan um when\nThey share but then they turn it off it really should run by half hour after the shower for all half hour afterwards as far as the closets and stuff maybe the doors to try to the carpet\nMaybe we need to get some ventilation nearby either putting event in the door or shorten the door by half and so we can get some air ventilation and there is a closet a war\nZone and outside wall maybe it's a wooden house and we get some uh ... more strict in coming that way too

grimy and looked like it needs a little help well you don't necessarily have to buy new imagery don't necessarily have to send down and paying them\nWe can kinda rejuvenating them you hear me talk\nAbout a program called ... and we have Chris with us from mill think Chris welcome that almost scary Sullivan\nWarning Gary how you doing I'm doing great how about you not too bad\nThere you go so you heard the stage kitchen cabinets I dunno around the handles probably most people's ah unless they're always using mills think you're probably gonna find that a black grainy oily substance around the handles of cabinets or even on the doors of kid myths and tell us a little bit about ... it's got a long history\nYes scary most likely to develop back in Nineteen fourteen by Hungarian immigrant ... resulting second he was a master cabinet maker ... know productive is fun creations and that's when most furniture polish and cleaner was developed\nAnd really that's what makes you know sex so unique is that it's a cleaner and polish it'll take that Greece and grime off those kitchen cabinets and restore the would do its natural luster and like you said especially when they're on the handle ... your ... and you get the grease on your hand you're opening cabinet doors we get that build up in most ethical clean right down to the finish\nSo that grime we have is that cooking oil or what is that grime recombination ... several things I guess huh\nExactly it's a combination it's from cooking oil from the oils in your hand on the Greece's you're cooking on and that all gets on to the cabinet and you don't have to use another uh you know use a ... other products you have to clean 'em and then go back and Paul ... or ... you know clean and polish almost up\nNow when you use the word polish I I Know people use different spray cleaners different spray wax is to give them a little lost her but even that wax over time get soft ingrained me correct\nRight you if you use products ... over the years you get that build up where you can almost scrape it will your thumb now yeah\nYeah no sect doesn't have any ... in fact no sec remove all that ... built up and clean right down to the finish show on your dining room table if you get a heat ring that white rings from that wax built up someone such hot cat on there and it kinda ... wack so since mill sec removed\nWax built up it'll take that heat ring right off the dining room table a watering off the coffee table\nAnd it will certainly have a lot of those calls in the next two months I guarantee you so uh so the ... there is no lack sitting there in yet it cleans what what's the secret sauce and then you can't tell me the secret to the you know I mean it it's going to be something special is silicone or no silk ...\nBuilt up as well right on your furniture and our our our furniture polish doesn't have any water and it it's pure cleaning and polishing ingredients in their trade secret ingredients in house formulated and allows or product to do what it does\nAnd so anything that would how 'bout laminate because lame Leah cabinets and stuff like that they get grimy to work in a ...\nRight laminate painted cabinets um it's even good on your hardwood floors and lemonade floors you got to lose their directions on the bottle you haven't been diluted quarter cup a gallon of warm water and you'd be amazed by the dirt that listen to shine it leaves behind\nNow does it have to be deluded for the cabinets are just like the floors\nJust for for just for the floors otherwise you use it straight and I guess you just put a little bit on it or on a rag is\nYeah you just to actually be slightly dampen your towel and then at the ... the town that activates the [noise]\nThe cleaning agent in our products soda and cleaning and polish at the same time you're even came to watch you know we had to hurricanes down south and the ... or using candles that candle wax gets on the dining room table

mix smell real Christmas yeah and they all clean and polish shame she get the same performance as the original I'm an oil except for you have a nice Christmas ...\nWhere are you also ... also has I think the greatest stainless steel\nA cleaner and I don't know whether it just leaves just a little film on it but when I use it on my stainless steel refrigerator and I don't get the hand prints like I Do with regular cleaners that they're almost protects it to a degree\nYes our stainless steel cleaner is so easy to use it to Korbel liquid it's not a ... you don't have to wipe the floor up from

the other so uh it's world we live in I'm sure eventually work its way out but uh\nYou know yes yes that's ... ... ... they can say about that All right against eight hundred eight two three eight to five five a Janelle also posted the question on her Facebook page and that says hey Gary heard you talk about someone about ... holes\nIn a driveway from ... is the word it's when the surface of the concrete just pops up holes are about a quarter inch deep anywhere from two inches to four inches in diameter\nAnd um the product you used for that she wants to know what to use for that what you do is you will remove any of the residue from the spoiled area\nYou would remove any dust from the spoiled area then when then you would come back and you would with that area down you use the hose you don't need to use the pressure was you're you just want that hydrated and you wanted as clean as you can get it then the patching material\nIs a quick pre ... product it's called vinyl concrete patch or and Daniel I um I don't know if you're writing it back to them but we might want to do that\nUh it's violent is vital concrete patch or and that can be applied up to a half inch in sickness\nIt's a powder you mix it with water and uh you let's sit for about five minutes and it's a it's not a slurry it's a patch it's almost like butter in a tub at that point and you can use a trial you could use a wide taping knife and literally just go around\nAnd just move over those spoiled marks on the driveway\nOr the negative of that of course is no concrete matches one concrete from the neck so if you have a very gray concrete or this might be a little lighter than that if you have\nYour from the south and you get a little reddish concrete this was a little more of the great side than they do so tense if you've got a lot of it and of course there's also products that\nRe surface the entire surface of the concrete so that might be something to but the name of the product is vital concrete that you're\nYou can find it and most any hardware store or big box store or a dig in to get a question on board simply dial up at eight hundred date to three eight to five five with Facebook pages Gary Sylvan public your ... then you know he's got all kinds of things to do now [laughter]\nYou like in your job today [laughter] so um yeah [laughter] ... you can't say because it gets taken off the air

handle for you as you a travel around on the on the weekend so I wanted to pass that along a again that ... sale is going on that goes through Monday\nAnd uh we do have ... just on our website scary Sullivan online dot com or we're talking about the chimney and I hit a chimney sweep on yesterday\nAnd he has to misuse backed up all the way to Thanksgiving\nI think he kind of said close so when I can kind of start warn you in August ... encourage you may be to do something in terms of getting the chimney inspected um that's really the best time to do it right now every chimneys sweep\nA that is worth his salt is busy and there's an association if you're going to call someone to inspect your Jimmy\nIt's a C. S. I. a certified chimneys sweep and a lot of cases are almost all those guys have cameras where they can literally\nInspect the inside part of your chimney if there's a problem they can show it to you
