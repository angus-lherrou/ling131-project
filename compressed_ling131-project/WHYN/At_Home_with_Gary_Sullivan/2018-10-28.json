{"month": "10", "state": "MA", "station": "WHYN", "content": "First of all no one gets hypnotized to give up money All right that just doesn't happen in real life or there's no hypnotists in the world that can convince you of that and I think I I think with Sandra Tsing she's off the phone is I think she's trying to somehow rationalize away the fact that she got totally bamboozled\nAnd was in ... ah versus I was hypnotized and I have no control ... ... yeah I don't think so\n\nHigh mark yes I entered into a a settlement contract with a large insurance company and they were supposed to uh get me to good faith checks up front\nFor a total of a two hundred and one thousand dollars and in payments for the next seven years I took the trucks down to the\nBank and the creator new account specifically for those are the one check for forty five thousand dollars one through and then I was notified by the bank or something to mail a return on a stop payment on a second check\nOkay did you did you call them up and just ask why I asked why\nAnd everybody is walking around with their head gone G we've never heard of this ever happening before\nYou may have to hire a well I wouldn't even hire a lawyer yet a now comes a a letter saying you're clearly in breach of the contract\nAnd send them a letter out senator and breach of a ... new center to all the different\n... and ... how long ago how long ago did you send that letter how many weeks ago or days or weeks ago All right well to a couple of weeks ago is not enough time for all that they've had sixty they respond I Know what they do and I just have a more I just had one of those\nWhere it was a settlement that no we entered into my company entered into where we're going to get paid 'cause we dealt with people that didn't do such a good job who had insurance\nSo we settled that and they have to pay within thirty days the insurance company correct they ended up paying within Seventy five days is how long it took us to get paid ... and to the point where our lawyer had to get in that's a lawyer who arranged the settlement\nHad to come in and start screaming at the insurance companies we actually had\nTo file a lawsuit\nFor breach before they paid\nOkay so mark just get really aggressive or if they ... you probably fell through the cracks mark a if you're dealing with a major insurance company you weren't going to get paid more there's no question\nAnd then I Would turn around and see how much interest you're paying ... small claims court for the interest you lost through OK well you'll get paid more guy it's ... it that's world of insurance they're they grab\nYou you're you're a second and a half late on your auto insurance for your health insurance ear cancel Seventy five days late on a payment that was supposed to be made within thirty days just like Mark\nAnd that's typically what the payment to the timeline normally is\nI hey Gary welcome to handle on the law\n[noise] hey I'm I have a question for you my wife and I own a house in Ventura and it's a smaller track about uh thirty nine ... nine home of we when we bought a house um where was given a a gives me a faint than are\nThat are limited what we could do a lot of what we could do with our own and one of the stipulations of the the the at our said that\nEach of their homes have to rebuild on a single a lot and um that each home had to be at least Seventy five feet wide\nThere are other stipulation but what happened was a developer God for the city of Ventura\nOr the city approve the flooding of the law and now the developer is building to homes that are in violation of the CBC in are in a number of different ways okay so I wanted to know what our record the\n... ... what you do is you get the homeowners you get the H away\nAnd immediately file a lawsuit against him just because of the city allows\nA certain type of building or the or the community that is the H away also can control and they can say no more than one lied or one home per ... now I then it becomes an interesting situation where the developer now comes back\nAnd saying you're violating liability or to build housing of which ah I'm allowed to do based on the city but I think the winter here in my opinion would be the H away but you it's time to get a lawyer you need a land use attorney Gary like right now\nIs that a real estate attorney\nOr it is a real estate attorney but it's a real estate attorney that specializes in land use\nAnd there are a attorneys out there then in fact represent nothing but H always okay so you get to go just go on the uh go on the Internet and got check them out because that is\nI Know developers going to roll over on this one uh there's no way in hell was especially if you're building additional home such big money for them alright max\nHi good morning of Yasser ... inch insurance claim of course [laughter] okay yes you have trouble with an insurance company yeah I never heard that one before ever ... imagine life without it\nFor a while now asking [noise] anyway uh anyway they shorted me based on the estimate of space for\nThey shorted me eight hundred thousand dollars a call him a couple of times the fish were they told me to go on it that is anyway anyway what I did I filed in small claims court treat other Ninety seven dollars and play with a check for five hundred\nBanned the verbiage on the trucks to check that negates credit for the\nClaims right now I'm Wondering if I drink a check because I Know in ... in court if I take a ... ... yeah yeah\nBecause that's part of the agreement the agreement is if you accept this jak then I Will not go after you I have all my rights absolutely so the only way you can go and kick their bodies to say no thank you to the check\nAnd go ahead and fire when small claims court and kick their butts\nOkay that's good ... good luck\nAnd here's the good news whenever you go in front of a judge small claims judge against an insurance company I don't know how that works normally they would kick it right up to superior court and so you're really not going to be in front of the uh a judge a small claims judge which are usually not judge was a\nAn daddy is and this happens all the time would be companies the immediately make a a motion to kick it up and then you have to go out and hire a lawyer ostensibly however there isn't a judge in this world that has not been screwed by an insurance company\nSo you're coming in with an advantage by dry cleaners never even go to small claims court ever\nBecause they know they're gonna lose walking in the door they just write checks now the good news is they write checks for the amount of replacing a\nDress and I've had\nYou know pair of pants they know I shop at Costco so it wasn't even more cash the check [noise]\nThis is handling the [noise]\n\n\nThis is Michael ... here with Mike stole from health markets helping folks find the right Medicare coverage that news reports say that the rates might be going down\nThe government protect the costs of Medicare plans will decrease this year so you have to ask yourself are you getting the best rate help markets opera's a free service with access to thousands of Medicare plans nationwide to help folks maximize their benefits and say\nAs we learn their way through the show and on Facebook alright Andrew welcome\nTo answer okay a\nParticle board problem that smell real by it\nWas an eight okay\nI I don't think it's a ... on the earth they must be smile mhm it's more of a chemical smell it's really all particle for\nUm gas and it was ... down somewhere in the seventies okay\nAnd I had towel or let our spare bedroom that we didn't use of and now I've retired I've got into an office but\nOur old pal off of it and that child has flipped off of like pancakes on my legs right but it's got a real strong and you rub your finger crossed it that's a ... you know\nWell a particle board there is formaldehyde in it and um you know it creates off gassing there was one of the\nUh problem some would flooring hit a number of years ago that made the news but usually formaldehyde in wood or furniture or anything along those lines\nBreaks down over the years in other words it eventually dissipates um I the interesting part you said as a there was kind of build up on that surface which is\nKind of challenging what that could be um in in that slick nests on that surface Andrew you feel that\nOr whatever that is is where the smells coming from\nIf you can picture and that was true I mean it's you ...\nHave you done anything at all with that at this point I mean having\nTried by a ... a core issue on down over new carpet\nAnd it's still there yeah a lot better off the chair that are are they looking at online research a little bit of this scale and uh\nWell I think need to win an odor or eliminating product\nUm for sure uh but um I Am a little little concerned of what that would be um you know we're trying to solve something we don't know what it is but there's there's um I don't know if you've ever heard me talk about a product line called odor exit\nOdor exit makes a variety of products um from sprays to actual chlorine dioxide which actually eliminates the the odor in the air\nSo that may be a product you want to take a look at or you may want to give this company called\nTo see which one they would present you didn't have any pets it's nothing along those lines correct\nNow and it's all for that aspect that you know they they didn't really hang out in that room ... with a closed off All right\nAll right ... you know the one interesting thing though is when you put that Lou won over we really can't get to the particle board now I'm\n... I'm On ... on ... or pulling back a day well\nHere's a website you can also get their phone number there maybe talk to them and I'll talk about the two products I think that to work for you it's odor exit oh deal are X.

that'll kill a lemonade\nOr mold mildew algae\nOr like in ...\nOn the outside of your home they have a wedding for you for the next year it comes three different ways um just for your information if you have those problems there's three different ways you can buy their product\nI'm One of it is to concentrate that he was speaking of which you just mix in a tank spray or in a spray down or the mold mildew liking it cetera\nAnd it takes for six weeks it'll just slowly disappearing I say slowly because you might walk out three days and that's going on my walk out after three weeks and say nothing going on you're probably see the light and a little bit one day you walk out it'll be gone\nAnd I know it sounds crazy but um I get all kinds of calls and emails about uh how wonderful it is and I also get some calls were appeared on three weeks ago gearing up for putting it give it some time but there's three ways that the the one is the concentrate at spoke of the other is they are they\nI don't know if it's a quarter half gallon or somewhere in between but it's already do use bottle with a little sprayer um and so that's available\n[noise] then there's also one\nThat is a different formulation that you just connect the host to the hose and spray bottle and you just have ... the the bottle itself and the mechanism in it actually dilutes the product it'll do I think twenty two hundred twenty four hundred square feet\nAnd that spray it will go twenty five thirty feet so you could do the roof get rid of those black streaks on the roof so uh I\nJust wanted to let you know there's multiple ways you can take care of that issue all\nRight I said we didn't get to the ah energy out at the weather is ... on it for the next year of your home and we will do just that if you've got a question to ask you can Dallas up it's eight hundred eight two three eight to five five you'd like to pose the question on our Facebook page carries Sylvan public figure just click like\nClick visitor post and put your questionnaire and we'll get that answer her idea energy out let's start with the entry doors the exterior doors for possible leaks\nThat's always a great idea that keeps out insects sometimes even keeps mice out of the house certainly keeps cold air out of the house keeps moisture out of the house all which can do\nUm damage to your home remember water is at number one enemy to your home\nAnd if we don't make that little five dollar repair today can quickly become a five hundred dollar repair a fifty dollar repair it'll definitely ... so what are we looking for we're looking for cracks where the door meets the frame little gap\nAnd if you can get somebody outside at night with a piece of chalk and you're on the inside you get a little ... like flashlight just go around with the door meets the frame the person on the outside if they see any light penetration\nThey can take that little piece of chalk and just a\nYou know put a low marking on the frame itself and that's where the leak is you might want to take a look then it changing out the weather stripping and there's all kinds of weather strict things we can choose from something as simple as a a foam within a nice of on the back it's not going to last very long but certainly take care of the problem this year\nThere's also an E. D. P. rubber a which is much more durable which is a stick on also and then there's some with frames\nThat are more substantial with all vinyl bowl and the woman I'm frame that's the direction I Would go also the joint between the frame and the exterior and the interior walls might take a look it\nMay be putting some uh ... and they're the one thing I don't want you to do is don't concentrate on ... the bottom of that frame\nAnd a lot of cases if the openings or at the top or the sides and you know wind driven rain and water gets in me and find that frame if you see or clock the bottom that water can escape\nAnd then we hold that water in and that's why you see so many door frames that first a bottom twelve inches that wood frame is just totally rotted\nBecause we've trapped that water in there so you know the ... can be done on the sides it could be done on the top but not at the bottom also take a look at the bottom of the door at the threshold there's a couple of things there that are creating a seal\nThere's the threshold which is wood or aluminum and we'll have either a piece of metal in the threshold or again a vinyl insert a little vinyl ball but when the door closes it can presses at\nAnd creates the seal also in the bottom of some doors they're all different they're all different all manufacturers do differently\nThere's even some doors at the bottom of the door to part you can't even really see that the sits on top of the threshold there may be some channeling in there where there's a vinyl insert there and that's how that feels made but again check it\nAnd you can clean them very easily I always clean him with middle spirits\nCaught and cloth mineral spirit's just wipe down the tracks you'll be amazed at how much turkey get wiped down the glides and then just spray the tough on her silicon move the window up and down and you're in business and all that cases you're in business there's there's um obviously if you have an issue with it and the parts broke and\nUh you got to get to part and there's a lot of window parts companies out there and you can also look on line I mean they'll have six and seven million ... million with an M but um at least you can still find parts\nFor a lot of the western window up in the northern Ohio areas one and uh there's many throughout the country really but a meat that fell to show all the dime\nTells me his infant Tori is in the seven million range so or\nTake pictures trade pictures in order them online um any gaps or flaws in the construction around the frame um can be cocked again always be careful of clocking any piece of wood down at the base a lot of times you got to let that waters Cape and talking at the bottom\nReally can cause bigger problems\nUm weather stripping on some of the a\nVentilator double hung windows can be replaced again knowing the type of knowing the configuration of the channel\nA will be key but those\nWeather stripping parts can be replaced and it is just like weather stripping a door and a lot of cases just sliding it in to the channels so those are a couple of things you really want to take a look at before it gets too uh too cold out cleaning windows [laughter]\nAnd I know they just lost a lot of people they don't do windows but really cleaning windows or extend the life of a window remember window glass is a liquid\nYes it's a liquid\nYou look at really really old glass eighty Ninety a hundred years old you ever knows how it's wavy\nAnd it's a liquid but a glass um needs to be cleaned it can get a little pits in it I'm In one of the\nBest products for cleaning glass that I've come across\nIs the jaws glass cleaner or J. ws I Know kroger's carries it in a lot of parts of the country now\nYou can also get it in on line at the jaws cleans dot com but I Would highly recommend that in fact it's a ph neutral there's no silicone or alcohol and that\nAnd what that means is you can use it on\nA glass like um high def TV screens computer screens getting even use it on your eyeglasses I'm the one of those things that are about yourself on screen cell phone screens another one that was a sensitive you got to\nUse the ph neutral or ... no alcohol no silicon glass mayor I had a friend of mine asked me the other day said a clean my TV screen but now I can see kinda ... streets in it and I said would you use\nThat just used in say a common brand of a window cleaner and ISIS got ammonia in it it's got alcohol in it it'll streak that find screen and they go well how to get rid of it you don't\nYou don't\nAh so ph neutral or products like the jaws cleaners um I Would highly recommend that glass cleaner and you can also get it on Amazon meeting about that product to because of the spray bottle and um it's got cartridges\nSo once you spray that onto the glass and you do all these windows in your bottles half empty you don't have to go out and buy another bottle you wouldn't solve away empty can fill that up with water\nTake that cartridge and just put it in the neck of the bottle and run the spray or through it and it just versus um the concentrate in with the water and you got another bottle you're you're ready to go\nSo um you don't have to keep buying the bottle and all that saves on storage and everything else but jaws cleaners a check their out another tip on clean the windows and we're talking about the weather is ... and just kind of getting things all straightened up um is some paper towels not all\nSome paper towels have a little bit of wax and them\nSo if you're using a good product like a jaws where it's going to be street free always use a micro fiber cloth I'd stay away from the paper towels summer great I'm not trying to just knock\nPaper towels newspaper that works good to know no ... newspapers but a micro fiber cloth ph neutral product like jaws you're not going to have any street and the glass so then you've lubricate the side you replace the weather stripping and you clean the glass so he did a really good job of uh\nUh getting those windows are ready for winter and again just make sure they're locked when the weather gets cold and the same ...
