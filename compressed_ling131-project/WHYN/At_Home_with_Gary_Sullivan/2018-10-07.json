theirs is Fifteen Years ago and they do have the process you have to go through all of that first okay because something somebody is making a mistake that doesn't work I mean for\nThe new the new in what we bought the dead so it just starts all over\nThe central part that's what they told me I don't know if it I Know collection agency or the credit reporting agency\n... question okay have you checked have you looked at your credit reporting out your credit report yeah absolutely\nAnd it was on and it's still on the credit report correct okay you can't forget about the collection agencies ah they just hang up on them that they have nothing to do with it or threaten\nThem or I as I keep on telling people just say hey I'm recording this call is a Fifteen year old dad I'm recording this you have no lawsuit against me and you argue consenting to\nTo keep on being recorded and they'll hang up on you\nSo ah the next problem and this is the big problem is that from Fifteen Years ago a debt was unpaid is still on the credit reports\nVets that's an issue because that's huge damages so well could actually destroys your wife effectively ... especially in this day and age\nAll right so you go through the appeals process you say I Want to refute it sent me the paperwork and your refuted you say Fifteen Years old and you ask them it don't you have a policy of uh after seven years of dropping from the credit\nFor and what are they gonna say nope that policy has gone\nIt's crazy all I agree it's crazy\nYeah I don't I don't understand it I mean I just don't understand that happening I'm had credit and I've had clients who had ah the issue with these statutes ... with these statutes that no longer fly for your statue in California for example when on paper to Crump a credit card or any written a contract\nAnd a credit card agency or collection agencies and some of them are real\n... agencies have called and people know there was a four year statute and they'll say hey this was five years ago there was a four year statute they just changed the law\nWhen they change the law last month it's now a ten year statute and\nWhat do you do well my calling and said okay just send me just give me the code just told me don't tell me the number let me look it up right now if I owed them money will start talking oh oh oh oh\nYou know that's sort of thing and it's horrible ruled out there with credit credit reporting I mean there's a whole just I think it's going to be a huge huge a new area of the law dealing with it already is a pretty good size area and are those are people that you'll with credit but it's a\nIt has to explode just has to explode All right Paul Paul Europe welcome to handle on the law\n[noise] hello about a year and a half ago my Seventeen year old was in a clothing store and up to cry on a prepared and [noise] she walked up to the girl checked the items\nShe checked committed something I'm not sure what she did she handed the garment sector she went and tried in on the parents want him\nTo step through life without the back cover and its laughter scratch her leg\nYeah Eighteen Inches who've Bernie thing there\nI mean is there anything there are I mean he told me about the scratch or was the was the federal Ari a artery cutting did she bleed out there is a\nNo no I wasn't I was thinking more of a the threats we went through we\nAll know no ... no one cares about your stress that vote\nFor an aids test we had to have her tips\nFor HP we wait a second an aids test because one of those security devices scratched her and you did an aids test\nWell how many people on the other GOP scratch but how do we\nRight okay so you did the age test and of course came up negative\nOkay now what that is why I'm asking you know\nNo matter of fact there is not good news is there's nothing there either in terms of the case or the eight or ... yeah yeah no there's nothing there\nThere's there's I mean theoretically now did you go to the doctor that you get stitches a young emotional now there's not an ... an emotional issue when you get scratched\nSo no there's nothing there although you know it's always interesting is there I have my knee or anything they're in you know everybody ... this is America where your default to how do I get money\nThat's it how do I get money\nAnd then we start talking about well what it what happened and okay so there's nothing there well emotionally distraught ah I'm Upset because I I Want money and I can't get money and therefore can I sue because of my anticipation of getting money\nOh sure that's a great case of all why not\nAdding is high Agnes welcome to handle on the law\nI think if I make sure I call I got a pie problem I have a like a fake war\nSo it's like I can what less than half an hour and they kept me seven hundred and I didn't I doubt it I Won that that I have to and then ride at family and\nFrom what I mean how much should you pay seven how do I do I know but how much you think you should pay did they fix it or not\nI think that the last half hour\nIt doesn't matter I don't care if they're fixing half an hour or did they give you a bed did they give you an estimate they gave me All right did you pay did you pay for the glass door being fixed and when did they did they say it was going to cost eight hundred dollars or just after the ... they handed you a bill for eight hundred dollars\nNo they're not they already than just don't pay I\nDo then well then that's the problem you have a Agnes because you paid it and now you say I pay too much\nSo it's a they're going to say you accepted our\nOur our our bill the bill basically use verbal says I Want a eight hundred dollars and so on and then there's the issue of uh contractors over five hundred dollars you need a written contract but I don't think that's a that's going to be particularly important although it might be in a in the case of a\nA small claims spending on the judge so ah you wanna do it's worth something act and it's right the work they did\nNot know what do you think you should pay I mean I think no more than ... God\nAnd that may be reasonable so you turn around soon for six hundred dollars and you take it to court and they're going to say you accept the deal and you're going to say it's too much money and I didn't know and then I found out that they just rip me off its predatory\nBut I had nothing to prove that there's a ... ...\nWhat do you mean you have now did you hand them eight hundred dollars in hundred dollar bills in cash\nNo no I met my credit card\nOkay so you have the proof that you pay them eight hundred dollars okay and you're saying is too much and you and you want your money back and the overcharge you okay and you didn't know they overcharge you until after the fact\nAnd they were going to argue it doesn't matter what we charge we told her I was going to be eight hundred dollar she agreed they're going to lie about it ...\n... and you're going to go to court and tell her to a judge okay that's that's all you can do that I asked them for me if I go to of course you ... you have to ask them first okay that's the law you have\nTo make a demand you went in writing say you over charge me I've checked around\nAnd by the way you do have to check around you just can't arbitrarily say I don't I think it's only we're two hundred dollars 'cause what kind of expertise you have that and there's nobody cares what you think it's I've checked around and you do want to check and it's worth two hundred dollars you overcharged me I Want my six hundred dollars back\nYou make that demand they're going to tell you to go pounds Sandra pound glass in this case\nAnd you are they'd go to sue when they say no [noise]\nNot that complicated [noise]\nThis is happening in Greece dirty log onto sturdy home dot\nCom\nNews radio by say\nFly in and WHYY NSMBC Springfield [noise]\nIs the smoke alarm that comes with a building lithium battery Jess how long the battery last\nYou got it ten years so you put up the smoke alarm when it starts beep and that the batteries

H.\nY. N. and\nThirty three minutes after the top of the air you're at home with Jerry solving hey we've got a kick out of the dark that's right\nWe're going to talk about a household lightning in wow what a change there's been an household lighting over the last Twenty years and if so you're like me you're probably a little bit confused\nOn what type of light and you use in our home even if it's L. E. D. there's different qualities and different types and different lighting so we're going to get that all straightened out we have carbon best story he's with GE Lighting and Carmen welcome that home was Gary Sullivan\nHey good morning Gary how are you\nDoing fantastic how about\nYou I'm doing great it's a great weekend so let's talk lighting because man we've been through quite a change over the last Twenty years\nOr that's we have we add incandescent lighting and used to be you go into a store and you know you knew what you're going to buy and then we went to a whole CFL thing and a lot of people I guess just hated that lightning and now we're in the L. E. D. lightning so\nJunior junior kind of just talk about an overview of lighting in general ... kind of dig deeper\n[noise] well it's a great time to be talking about lighting October is\nEnergy X. amount of converting incandescent are halogen to Eli day is the right time to be thinking about it especially as they are getting shorter and I took getting longer ... really has changed with almost come full circle\nGary in terms of like bald performance\nOnly had CFL we can have an energy savings and long life a candidate sacrifice that like quality or that flow warm up more that flickering but LA is basically allowed us to do is to get basically the same performance that we had with incandescent ... in terms of bright light\nDental comes on instantly with great color\nWithout having to sacrifice there's other things that we had with CFL entering at the long life and the energy saving\nMan I'll tell you Eli the lighting is super energy efficient as enough\nIt is if you look at a sixty watt incandescent bald now more than Ninety percent of the energy that was coming out of that Bob was heat\nMhm ... ... it's using eighty five percent less energy paid to the same brightness so you're getting an eight hundred looming equivalent sixty ... mhm using less than ten ... instead of our traditional sixty ...\nSo it's a much better from an efficiency standpoint huh option than a traditional incandescent ball\nNow when I go to the store to buy LCD bulbs and I'm sure everybody's got one or two Eli ... made the entire switch I get in there and I see flood lights they see you know what is um you know like a sixty ... old fashioned bald\nAnd I see different price ranges there's different qualities of Eli de bulbs correct\n[noise] there is like with anything in a home improvement store or had a mass merchandising store or there is differences in terms of performance there's differences in terms of quality\nBecause you're looking at LAPD\nWant to look at brightness they don't want to necessarily at the water's edge ... has really what we're trying to replace when we're looking at a sixty what Paul is looming right the sixty wipe all that's going to produce about a hundred limits on the first you want to look for as I bought that has around\n... author lumens the second they might want to look for his life\nSo there's different tiers of LA days okay some last ten thousand hours on the last Fifteen thousand hours which would be three hours per day is Gary equivalent of having that Bob last for Thirteen Years so you do something different on your Sunday mornings instead of just like all\nLike the last one I bought colonel was like thirty thousand hours\nYeah isn't that amazing is fantastic camera that's perfect for me [laughter] and then\nThe third thing the thing that ... has kind of opened up for us as on one hand we can replicate incandescent so they're looking for the software in light\nOf incandescent bulbs and they can provide that but not everybody wants incandescent like light or maybe in different rooms of your house you want to create a different mood or different effect ...\nAnd that's what he has opened up so now Gary one of the more popular trends right now is a vintage lighting\nLoan yeah dial where you see the like old filament in their\nExactly right from an efficiency standpoint those bombs are terrible and they're using more electricity but not providing a whole lot of like\n... now has given you the opportunity to get that same look that came warm candlelight glow mhm but using a fraction of the electricity so you're using\nFive watts instead of Timothy ... perfect person and you're getting along life for this is an opportunity for even on some of those styles that you don't necessarily want to replicate what you had with incandescent ... also switch to a lady and get those benefits\nWell just taken everybody back from when they went to shop for their first L. E. D. bulbs they were confused about looming they were confused about energy savings they were confused about the lighting and then different people started talking to him including me start talking about Kelvin units\nRight up to seven thousand the lights blue and super bright and I made a mistake myself buying the wrong brightness a ball but the reason I wanted to have young Carmen is genie lighting his finally got it together in terms of changing the whole lighting industry back to where it was where you've got\nYou didn't know that the mood or the light of that ball which is you know like a softer why the bedroom like you made it simple and I loved it\nWell for most people spending hours thinking about lightning is not what they want to spend their time on\nYou know coming a PHD in light bulbs is not really where they want to spend\nTheir time or energy or effort enjoy down into basically simplify it now we've talked with consumers we know that people use light differently in different rooms of their home we also know that there's a lot of numbers and things on the package that quite frankly get pretty confusing\nTo provide that down to\nThree different types of light there's relax which is a more warm comfortable type of light similar to incandescent you might want to use and a bad room or a family room clay story kind of want to unwind chain there's refresh\nHi how are you just fine\nThe reason I'm calling is what the eye and the shame that practically have yes I think it will\nMake hot\nAnd then turn it off if you want to go south on it and I had a little cloudy and three minutes later white and all of that right now huh it get off of that\nSo just regular table salt and a ah a learning Arabic\nCan't write it wouldn't have thought that I Know what that is how I felt as though as bad\nExcellent Victoria thank you\nYou're welcome and I have always a pleasure to show\nThey are very much call any time in ... by by by All right there you go I knew somebody I Know I I don't know about pressing machines but Victoria did and she knew how to clean them sort of thing I thought you knew everything you know sir I Do not know everything John welcome [laughter]\nGood morning I was just turning radio station I heard your show\nThank you a ... ... s", "show_name": "At Home with Gary Sullivan", "year": "2018", "city": "Springfield", "day": "07"}
