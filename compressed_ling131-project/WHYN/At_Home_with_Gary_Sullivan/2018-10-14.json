{"month": "10", "state": "MA", "station": "WHYN", "content": "Uh yeah I I don't know if you're gonna go any place with that\nBar complaint now and even the fact that she was tied into the beginning of the\nYeah and and and yeah and how many how many years ago it was seven years ago you said correct yeah I mean in those days I don't think there was a bar violation but do you want to get back at him for a screw your wife at the time or you just basically want to blow it off\nWell you know I don't\nKnow if you're gonna make out of it yeah you're gonna make life miserable so I Do want to you certainly can I don't think much is going to come of it\nOr they're going to do a bar investigation is going to obviously have to defend themselves probably hire a lawyer\nOr an expert in representing a representing a it was representing their lawyers that represent lawyers in front of the bar and um you know I was a oh and I I once had a complaint against me that was quite had a couple of complaints against these crazy crazy complaints\n... a basic based on the handle on the law the advice I give because some people that took me seriously\nI owned a relied on that so anyway but I had to ah you know I brought in a lawyer or who specialize in this the first time out or when I was actually frightened nine now and her father so it's your call here called do I think\nAnything's going to come of it no why as I said because it wasn't a conflict it was the wife you were a notch\nUh being uh you were not a she was not being representative wasn't a divorce case where there was clearly a conflict so ah I just think the two of them got it on a daily rate there your whole anyway yes\nAll right um um oh\nGod I hate these lines All right let's try it ah let's start again\nWe just lost you know there should be technology out there that overcomes is wouldn't you think by this day and age\nI mean we can send the guy to the moon that doesn't work anymore last time there was a guy in the moon was in the seventies so that's kind of stupid so we're going to be able to we can send a guide to Mars right at some point as well because back he calls back All right oh hello Chris welcome to handle on the law Kris\nBill yeah there's\nA new tax law that allows me to a man that tax return from Eighteen years ago it could get a refund over Packer paid on military severance pay back then I was married to a someone that I cannot located now are hiding from having to pay ... or\nSo I have no way of contacting her and I haven't heard from her in like ... years [noise] I don't know how to amend a tax return that would join with only one signature\nAh there there has to be a way of doing that because if the law allows\nSomeone to file an amended return Twenty years later Eighteen years later a there's a a decent chance at the other partner their spouse or ... is not around either can't be found somewhere out there\nOn remarried died whatever so uh there there has to be a way within the rules of the IRS\nBecause the IRS is pretty good about issuing five thousand new rules every other minute so the trick is to find an accountant straight out accountant who understands these rules\nAnd now when you file your tax returns you have an accountant\nChris yeah yeah have you asked your accountant about this\nYes and he wasn't curve any way to do it then you have and I happen to have an appointment with the Iraq on friday\nAnd that is yeah that's the way I'm Glad you're asking me because of my vast\nExpertise with not only this is tax law or this or tax\nReturns and of course I you know when I have a complicated problem you think I sit and researchers look it up now I go to Mike counting Chris ... who did not what you did is you went a step beyond and that is what I Would tell you if your account and doesn't know or several accountants\nYou make an appointment with the IRS and yet I didn't\nMind it projected that I actually find that Mike though and ah maybe no picnic or just magically appear\nNow I I I don't know why I don't know if I Would do that I don't know if I Would do that what I Would say to the IRS is do I have to find her and uh then I Will then I'll go to extraordinary lengths to find her\nAnd that's when I without\nSeventy grand behind in power right that's another issue in there and they made this and you and and you may be able to get the whole thing okay based on the child support order so\nI the magical signature ah she's she's still entitled to half of that yeah now there could\nBe a way where and this happens all the time with child support the IRS holds off I mean it'll grab people's money\nYeah our cases in that that stayed right now we're ... supposed to be surrender\nOkay so you're halfway there definitely time to talk to and IRS agent and and if the IRS aging doesn't know that rule specifically and it doesn't have any experience or ah doesn't really understand that you go to a supervisor and you ask for someone who understands what's going on because it's a pretty obscure stuff\nAnd it's not as if ah and I are ... who doesn't understand this is incompetent in any way I mean if you ever look at the IRS code if you ever look at the Internal Revenue code these our phone books thick with hundreds of thousands of rules\nAnd you're not normally for ... to amend after three years\nWell they've changed the law I Wonder if you want to ask me I would've said no but if they passed a law that is a different than we're in great shape\nIt's for military better yeah obviously are on Rick Perry yeah All right so is there any of them out there to get their return\nSo we're talking about a very narrow narrow description of a very narrow group of people and so you simply need someone who understands it and you're doing everything right man I'm there's nothing more I can give you other than you're doing everything right\n\nAlso let me tell you about life like here's something they do right and life locked protects your identity and of course another hack\nThis was Facebook fifty million accounts of course why not there isn't a person in this country has had Information Act already I mean it just doesn't exist so uh I've been a customer of life lock and I'm suggesting you look at them to\nA customer for ten years and have a saved me from identity theft a couple of times between me and my daughter and here's what they've done is they've added\nNorton Security to their program lifelong protects your identity Norton Security protects your devices against virus attacks and if you have a problem with either one or they will work to\nFix the problem now no one can stop every cyber threat or prevent all id theft or monitor every transaction every business but lifelong with Norton Security that some serious\nEnhanced protection go to life locked dot com promo code handle and you'll get ten percent off your first year plus the twenty five dollar Amazon gift card life lock dot com promo code handle or call age\nMay get up in the attic and let's see how much insulation yeah getting yards they just see how deep it is make sure that insulation is not covering up soften venting if you have suffered venting\nAnd the department of energy has a map on their website that shows you what the our values should be\nFor the attic area and for the walls of your home in fact if you go up to a place that sells insulation that energy map is right on the bags of insulation so you can do that too so let's just say it's an hour forty two and\nThe insulation is maybe in our three per inch thickness you can do some quick math and\nI can figure it's going to be around sixteen inches of insulation somewhere in that area and if you get up there and you're measuring you've got five inches of inflation you you know you got your work cut out for you\nSo can you put insulation on top of insulation for the most part yes the only way you wouldn't want to do is if you had a vapor barrier that was a on top of the inflation which I Hope you don't have usually vapor barriers facing down towards the living area of the house\nAnd let's say you had five six inches you know you've got to add another ten twelve inches on top of that and you can put batting down on faced batting or you can blow insulation in and you could blow a cellulose inflation and you could blow fiberglass insulation you don't want to cover up to solve advance\nIf he had old wiring up there you don't want to cover that up and in fact you shouldn't insulate over it at all ever never if you have older can light you want to make sure that they're protect you don't want to insulate over them but for the most part not a difficult job\nIf you wanted to lay bats over that's fine bats are not quite know the you know they're still going to be a gap\nBetween the would up in the ad I think that the Joyce\nThe prices are going to be a little scene there where's your blowing it and it's kind of film and all that area but just adding insulation real good idea and get it up to speed a lot of times your department of energy will tell you okay for new constructions are this\nIs remodeled should be our this but you know somewhere in between if you're just sitting up there for five inches of insulation you you got some work to do it also when you get up there just kind of take a look it's crazy what you're finding your attic fine mold on the underside of the roof\nMaybe some rotted would maybe you've gotta moisture issue maybe there's dead birds in there maybe there was some critters that we're living in their nest was made in the inflation\nSo that's telling you you got a problem you've got a breach somewhere in the middle of that house it needs to be repaired and maybe that old insulation needs to be removed at that point but a lot of times it's out of sight outta mind and that's not always a good option so\nWhen it comes as we say to start keeping the cold air out that's a real good place to start is the ad against elation and just get up there and take a look and see what's going if you're not capable\nOf getting up to get somebody to get up there and take a look at it or do an energy audit and address those issues eight hundred ... two three eight to five five that's our number Mike welcome\nSir how are you doing doing great\nRight now I'm not a cabin down in the on the Tennessee River uh-huh I've got a guy will too\nAnd I kinda like at that rate foment relation uh-huh have you here everybody wanted to do it right or wrong you\nWrite a while and across things underneath it got on the side of the mountain though and the lord and it won't be done but up here in the attic he re it you're the top of the roof\nOf metal roofing over two by four that are on that yet a Mars Arnold ... over the vertical raptor then they rolled out some kind of in the white now hitting the inflation hung in group filling in it mhm\nBut I have no way to get that phone to stay up and then there's the sun and very restrictive spray the carpet route okay ... part of the roof\nMhm mhm so there's not going to be any venting in that in that roof correcting we're just going to encapsulate that whole attic area correct\nThat lady okay and I don't need to do any um property beer felony if he does it that way\nThat's correct so what you're talking about is actually pretty trendy my kids started probably Fifteen Years ago yeah you're a trendy guy can tell\n[laughter] I'm an older guy I'm not going there I'm not going there\nSo a lot to answer your question yeah about Fifteen Years ago a company called ice ... started this process of whole house in ... and\n... and it really is it makes an entire insulated on blow to the house from the roof all the way down to the side walls it doesn't require suffered venting it doesn't require roofing\nA roof venting because basically that attic area becomes a conditioned area now so if you had air conditioning and heating that becomes a conditioned area so it's kind of all in one in terms of the house very very cost effective very very energy efficient\nVery quiet in that house now the challenge because there's nothing that's ever perfect the challenges that houses really sealed it's really super energy efficient you just gotta be careful that we have good I'm clean healthy air another word sometimes when we over\nA ceiling over inflated house you've heard the phrase sick building syndrome that's pollutants get trapped inside the home in the house you can't breathe\nSo one of the things you might consider down the road and you see how it goes is what they call an error exchanging and it's so it's actually bringing in some fresh air outside in a very small amount but\nI've written that you are meant to be she ... the little unit okay\nOkay so it's exchanging air it's bringing Erin is pulling air out\nYep yep that's perfect man you're going to have another cabin\nOkay well that's what I needed it now has a dollar twenty five square but like a pretty\n... I really don't know I haven't had a price sale I really don't know I really don't know but you go that way I think it sounds like a great idea\nWell buddy you answered my where I can go now trendy [laughter] out well our eye out All right I have a great day thing by by by\nAlright Seventeen minutes after the top of their eight hundred eight to thirty eight to five five dollars up happy to talk about your project will take a break and get back to kind of tightening up our home for the chillier months of the year you're at home with Gary Solomon\nRight when they called a guarantee cell of money on rent free talk at home with Gary selling\nTen minute radio by telling you wait why and [noise]\n\n\nAlways get calls about removing layers of pain from old furniture\nTheir doors and molding in removing old man's think off the concrete floors my answer blue bear products they're safe and effective and affordable there's soy base of there's low odor and safe in your home blueberry paint and European remover does the work for you it easily removes multiple layers of pain and the blueberry ... remover makes a tough\n[noise] with Jerry some of the [noise]\nLevel we have no problem for Gary Cohn wind hundred eighty three talk is at home when Gary fell in love\nWith your you know every morning at one of my news radio five states he tells us why and [noise]\n\nIt's\nAlways a good idea to have a certified Jimmy sweep inspect your chimney annually hey Gary solving hero leaky chimney can be a big problem in chimney are acting as a three step process to make your Timmy water tight first brush will crown repair fix minor chimney cracks followed by the mainstream water repellent to waterproof the brick and mortar joint and\nFinally a last ... flashing ceiling chimney our ex products are available to a ... plus watch informative videos a chimney or X. dot com enjoy that fireplace\nAre you familiar with wet and forget shower well you just spraying on today and rinse clean tomorrow [noise] once a week after\nYour shower just spray it on all the shower surfaces even the glass doors the next day rinse clean with wet and forget shower you can breathe easy because there's no harsh fumes and no scrubbing\nI'm twenty eighty five eight hundred five five five twenty eighty five bucks\n... weeknight starting at seven on use radio five sixty WHYY end [noise]\nCame\nBack to where we go thirty three minutes after the top of the hour don't forget our website is Gary Sullivan online dot com you'll find links to love the\nFavorites we have also our podcast or there were also on the I hard platform are you going to do a search at home with Gary Sullivan Wilson Google playing I tunes and or you can follow me on Twitter and Facebook Facebook scary some public figure by the way we're trying to increase our\nAh connections oh you got to do is go to ... you know Gary Sylvan public figure on Facebook and just click like you don't have to wait for me to respond you're on board and the reason we post a lot of our podcast on there and Daniel puts in\nYou know different information during the course of the week I think you'll find it helpful with your home improvement project so a ... a public figure and that's on the Facebook so the eight thousand eight hundred Ninety nine you lost somebody we lost some somebody said to heck with the I guess they said\nYou're anti or you're you're at a year or so we gotta try hard we generally are eventually I think\nWe're going to work at where we can take questions from Facebook you actually just be able to message may and will get them answered a we have a lot of cool stuff in the works yes we do yes we do All right let's get back to the phones here again said hundred eight two three eight to five five in the gym welcome\nAh good Marin Garry I was listening to uh the person that was uh interested in buying a standby generator\nYeah Carl's looking for ... you gotta between code orange or gender echo thank\nGosh mhm well I live in South Carolina where the summers are Ninety five Bosch uh-huh I'm all for acres I have a Dixie chopper would again Iraq engine okay and it has a to hydraulic systems\nAnd I'll tell you what I'm five hours a day and was shot and and I bought a used outlaw more was using that way over three hours and hours on it uh-huh and\nIf he uses very good quality oil or the oil that interacts says to use in at ... I Am all day long and all that energy and doesn't use any oil whatsoever\nYou know humid it sounded odd to me again I didn't read the operations manual but I asked them if both said that and he said yes\nUm but I don't know I don't know I don't know of an engine that burns up in eight hours\nWell you know I mean it might be worth ... but I don't know if it's going to need additional oil\nYeah I I think I'm the reason why\nGeneral ... that is is that a white person who I'm there now what he has to do explain to people in ...\nInstalling it how can work around add it all goes back to the quality of oil well oil you use a better a performance you're going to get\nYeah in some of the holidays or you know even longer life than they were certainly Twenty years ago\nThose Gen Iraq engines are so well bill or have a oil cooler I have a two so under ... solid that shaft as murder man it has a oil will around it has a an extra oil spill around it\nAnd uh like I said I I ... I ... a day and that's a\nSeventy two inch long more\nSure well you're a ... fan that's for sure and one of the things I said Jim and I think you will agree obviously you love your gender reckon I get that\nA color doesn't really make junkie though that's kinda why so no no no you're not going to go wrong either way\nThe biggest thing you can do regardless of what standby generator you get is gets a maintenance agreement and get that thing taking care of and you know tip top shape ready to go because when you needed you need it now\nOh yeah and and then you don't want to say on caches skip that lasts a you know checkup and know the thing in fire but\nYeah you just have him shore and he tells the installation people sure um you know that there's a gap in marriage not going to be home yeah and I'm\nQuite honestly I think that's why a lot of people by the so I'd be curious to and I'll look into it also ah it seems um eight hours is just a little that is a little troubling to me\nAnd the other good thing is because why they use natural gas propane sense it's not liquid fuel\nEngine oil stays absolutely plain because there's no liquid article edge right that are going to run down a show on the wall and wash out the walls or that's what causes usage because of the oil and then you start using oil so I'm\nAll right well very good thank you for your input certainly appreciate it All right eight hundred day two three eight\nTo five five we kind of get in our homes ready for winter we talked a little bit about insulation we've talked a\nLittle bit about I'm a generators these huge surge standby genders we talked a little bit about ventilation you know there's all kinds of places we can go from here that's for sure when talks about to get in your home ready for\nA winter I guess one thing we got to really do is take a look at that entry door take a look at the back door to look at the side door next to the garage let's see what kind of shape that is let's see if we can stand\nIn your living room or your for your and just look up between the gym and the ... day like do you feel a little breeze do you look down at the bottom of the door and you feel a little drift there because those are the vulnerable areas that allow cold air into your home\nNow there's ways to do a little test to see if there's ... talked about\nThe thermal camera but one way you can do this is a cool little trick\nYou know we took it gets dark at night and send your better half or friends outside and you stay inside and you get a little pen light and you go along the top of the door down the side of the door down the bottom of the door and your friend outside\nHis piece chalk and wherever you see light penetration they just put a little little you know X mark that they're ... they're seeing the light of you can see the light you're definitely getting\nUm what to expect in probably if you've been using them for you you're probably pretty trustworthy people\nI talk about a a\nCompany I use it like for generations if they've been ripping off people a ... they wouldn't be in business for four generations but having that inspected good idea how 'bout um", "year": "2018", "show_name": "At Home with Gary Sullivan", "city": "Springfield", "day": "14"}
