it\nAnd that is that the paint was bad\nI'm sure it happens but every pain manufacture every paint batches May Day keeps samples of the two tested in case of consumer has problems with the with the ... and then they go back in the paint company and the pain company will say\nUsually your preparation or there's moisture involve or whatever the problem is and\nI guess if it comes to push comes to shove they test the batch that they have on file\nAnd you know like I said I don't think I ever ran into where the paint was bad it was always the applicators and it was always the preparation or there was water getting behind the substrate a but if you do the preparation you could just about paint anything\nAlright eight hundred eight two three eight to five five that's our phone number you can join us we're talking about your home and John welcome\nHow you doing Gary yes are fine hey\nGot an a or some kind of bounce off your mom got a mobile home here and I tore out the bath tub and I'm putting a shower stall and its place hum and all the plumbing ... is in right now\nAnd when I cook the I'm a shower up to the rock climbing I'm using the chief I'm a ... a drain you familiar with those\nTell me what the name is again if the food chain the breath I'm a drain that goes into the bottom of the shower stall\nCame with a Ninety degree brass type\nA notice that this is a straight and the PVC comes up on all okay into it and he put a new prime washer and they're right any tightened down\nOkay so it's like a compression fitting\nExactly and it's about an inch long and and here's here's my dilemma um when I tour out the bath tub there is a great big hole underneath that were the original Plame was put in for the tub\nAnd that's where all the mice were coming in and so I boxed all that and so now you basically you have to have a boxer with the rock climbing\nOr going out to the septic system and then the shower sits on top of a on top of that\nAnd when I put the shower base in I can I'll never be able to get to the trap again it it will be\nBuried in that box um and I can't afford to have a leak in there and and so the PVC he's been tested no leaks there that's all well lit up really nice my concern is that in the brain washer and and so the question I have four years this\nOne I put that Neal praying gas cars I should call it out of washing [noise]\nIf I put some silicone feel on that gas ... as well and then fly it down into the drain and it goes around the PVC and then I tightened and not on top of it [noise] um ... when that silicone dried I should never have a leak there is what I'm thinking\nBecause if I get a week I'm never going to know I have a week because I Can't get it on the shower base\nUh once I put it in ha ha ha I wanted your thoughts on on does that make sense is that um\nTell me about the ... like the clear nylon plastic or is it rubber arise\nIf it's ... the black piece of rubber if it's round about an inch about an inch tall [noise] um and it it when you put it into the [noise]\nThe drain itself you got there compression and it's supposed to you know basically compressed them um but the PVC can move a little bit and I live in move a little bit I'm I'm afraid it that seal is going to break\n'em and then I'm going to get a leak and this is going to the water she's going to go down that box I built in actually ... out time\nIs that the end of the world I mean can is at a cesspool if that happened\nI got to tear the er at the color and eat them all all material a blanket on an okay 'cause it's kind of the shower it's kind of in the middle ... and I'm I'm a ... it\nWas like yeah take up the whole sharp ... or anything like that\nIf well I I could take up the whole shower pan but once I put the top half of the shower out so it's a full size to ... at the bottom happened you got the top half when I when I put that path on and I don't recall and those two together like manufacturers says are supposed to I'm never going to get it out [noise]\nSeeing them come from underneath\nI thought I'm going to have to come from underneath the mobile home if I ever have a week but the challenges that probably never going to know if I have a week\nAnd right right right yeah right and then it might come back and so one of the problems I have with the silicone and maybe I don't know your answer to this is I don't know if the silicone will compromise near ... okay I'm In and I don't know\nI Would have to look into that\nIf I put ... ... is there a way to double up to ...\nKnow if it's all designed to to work together as one drain unit you know so it's about an eighth of an inch thick you know we are pre war sure that that's about an inch tall so it slide down it grips quite a bit\nI I'm also trying to think of all the times they've done plumbing whether those ... are ever failed it's usually the pipe that failed okay I'm In quite honestly a lot of times taking those washers off a re used them\nUm\nSo I guess if I were you um first of all I I really think of it fails and you hit a leak and you didn't know it and the it rots out and everything\nI Know we don't want to do it but it probably not the end of the world is repair bullets you know like space shuttle here [laughter] I mean you can get it and you can you can repair it I'd be comfortable with the ... washer\nUm I don't think I Would use the silicone unless I was released certain\nThat that wasn't going to compromise or the ... and I'm not going will compromise some types of products like that\nYeah and I I I'm I'm not certain that it won't to you and that's why I thought I'd give you a call and you know if it fails five years from now that's one thing if it failed a week from now after I get the whole thing put together that would be kind of this\nUp to my health\nTitles that your heart radio weekends for its\nTime capsule the bucks ... weeknight starting at seven on news radio five sixty WHYY end\nWhere ...

there's obviously a reason to manufacture does not want\nThe issues and I dream temperatures because they know it's going to fail\nOkay and I didn't ... I had another question\nAll right we'll see what\nI'm writing or shall I form the advertisements paint your house right ... yeah I never heard of you to talk about that\nYeah in fact we even had Jim from runners shield on back in the summertime um but yeah um so it's not a paint it much much more than a paint\nAnd this is um [noise] it's got many benefits it's I'm\nVery very durable it's much thicker than paint it also has some energy saving properties\nIt's got a um it's got ceramic coding in it which bound black you know solar heat game um\nFootball over a looming fighting perfect fighting about it was put on and thick ... ... but it you know something wrong with that rank pulling that want\nOkay\nWell again and how long ago was that\n... that's a pretty good and money and hide yeah that's pretty good so that's really sad that\nThat's really your options so aluminum siding whether you go with the rhino shield or you go with paint 'em is is probably one of the best substrates to put a coating on\nBecause it's it's stable it's not absorbing moisture um it's like ... not going to crack it's not going to absorb moisture so it's very stable preparation again the key runners shield will do that the rhino shield is just heavier duty than a pain\nIt's something like that it's a coating it has reflective properties\nIt's going to listen I mean not paint last really good so bad you know I mean that's certainly an option for you or the rhino she'll be probably one and done\nI'm going to say it say lifetime warranty I could be wrong on that I forget what the war and he is but I Know it's a long time it's at least twenty five years um but I it's perfect for ... it's perfect for aluminum or vinyl siding\nGreat okay I'll I'll be looking at a fan\nYeah getting drunk you know what it's going to be and make your decision\nI'll call her back on my call\nYou're quite welcome Ellen thanks take care Bye bye\nYeah that has um [noise] well I tell you what if you go even ah I I kept talking about the signing but even if you're a during the run or shield over would again it's it's a more flexible and sicker coding in some of your paint so drew abilities there Jim welcome hey yes\nOr how the ... comment on the guy putting the shower base in or the child was uh-huh and I put a piece of hard work off underneath there on a box the bill uh-huh so um [noise]\nIt doesn't contain the water if he would have first of all make sure that that does that shower doesn't really have somebody wrote a bunch of water while he's on good they're\n... they're not going to bail it gets a fight and die I agree and and then when ... ... so instead of being ... completely what would that a piece of hard work walk on the bottom or but does grip\nAnd he's going to have to go under there to ship as gripping right he'll ... he'll see on the ground below that it's ... and it's that that's not a viable option\nYou can use that won't troll ball that sort of expanding ball ha ha and my mice will not eat through that he can all caps late that whole grain system\nWith that well and to ensure the ever does have to get into that dream bidding spray it for for some ... lawn or a\nCoating like you'd use on a garage door chain overhead is you're it's half long base and the almost stick to that we see they have a\nDry and then ... that whole thing was that there are also add some insulation properties to to correct yeah I I didn't remember what part of the country wind and asking I forget I it's on my screen but they didn't as a as a the following work in any pilot you know aren't sure\nPay and then I ...
