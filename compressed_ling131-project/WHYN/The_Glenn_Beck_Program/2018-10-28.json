Democrats got smoked\nUm you said the same thing two thousand fourteen remember Democrats got smoked again they're Republicans fifty nine percent said they were really interested only forty eight percent of Democrats said that um and what's interesting is leading up to I Would say Brett Kavanaugh\nYou had the same type of thing playing out\nAgain in this time in favor of the Democrats started to look a lot like two thousand six so up until ... you had sixty three percent of Democrats\nHighest levels of interest in the election Republicans was only fifty three percent so that is a you know a big it's the type of gap that leads you to lose the than any ... and lose the house or at least it makes it possible ... since ... that has changed\nDemocrats have gone up from sixty three to Seventy two percent holy cow Seventy two is the highest number for any party and all of these elections however Republicans have jumped a higher percentage point basis\nFrom fifty three to sixty eight so now we have a basically a balance of very close within the margin of error separation\nAnd both of those numbers sixty eight would be the second highest level of interest of all of these elections so the Democrats are Seventy two Republicans are sixty eight both of those numbers are the highest of any of these elections going back to two thousand six mid ... two thousand six midterms\nUm and I mean which is which is crazy\nIt is a a a ... there's a level here that we don't know what's gonna happen if we this is like you know this was territory that has not been seen before\nAnd ... you know while you can look at the polls and you can see the polls as we've talked about over the past couple of weeks relatively are relatively pointing towards a Republican or a ... victory in the Senate where they maybe pick up a couple of seats\nAnd Republican loss in the house where they would lose a couple of seats\nUm there is a you know if you wanna look at the kind of be optimistic way of looking at the house right now\nTo show you how close is it Republicans were just sweep the races they are favored in okay that's not it's not going to happen it never happens but just kind of generally for understanding if there would be able to sweep all of the races there favored in\n... and they revealed a when all of the races that they trailed by one point so all of these races are either victories are toss ups right I mean they could go either way\nBut if they were to sweep all of those\nRepublicans still hold the house at two twenty two Fifteen now the problem is the idea that they're going to sweep all those races is we know that's not going to happen it never happened the other thing is they will win some races where they're underdogs by more than one point they will win some place you know when they're down by five in the polls they'll want him winning some of those races\nSo the split is going to be important here but just that gets them only to two twenty two Fifteen\nWhich is a I think they lose that's been losing ten seats from where they are now um but also a very narrow majority to the point where some conservative things could be derailed by just you know your generic moderate house member that you've never heard their name before\nUm when they decide they're going to vote against the president\nSo it's an interesting a way of looking at it and it shows that this really could go either way I mean when they say that there's about a twenty percent chance the Republicans lose the Senate and about a twenty percent chance that the Republicans when the house that's the way they these models are all kind of looking at it twenty percent is one in five\nRight um so it is very possible that one of these things could happen but right now it looks like those are going to wind up getting split and then of course still has ... even though you're not gonna be able to pass the Democratic bills because they would either give each other on the train in the house you're still going to have investigative power gonna have subpoena power you're going to have imposed\nA nightmare it's a nightmare and if if they get the house it's a nightmare okay so here's here's what I found interesting in um in watching the news\nAnd watching just the flow of it have you noticed that you know places like the Atlantic and the times and the post are now starting to publish stories about\nYou know it's an uphill battle to win some of these races in the house it's an uphill battle they have changed their tone from um you know an absolute positive well we're on a blue wave to now almost laying the foundation\nOf ... oh\nYeah well we lost but it was you know it was really kind of a long shot anyway\nYeah I mean I that's how badly I think the Kavanaugh facing a has backfired on them I mean it's made the Senate basically I mean again I just said it's one of the five chance but I mean they had they had a better chance of this uh two months ago I mean they had a legitimate paths to victory when Cruz was only up by three points\nAll of these races that looked like leaning Republican we're all toss up are and some of them looked like they might be leaning Democrat\nThey had a chance to win the Senate before the cabinet thing now I mean I think it's real real it's really\nGoing to come to the independence how are the independence feeling\n... there is an interesting group because they're not as passionate as you would expect in this environment so independence in two thousand six and two thousand ten where at fifty percent\nIndependents are almost always going to be lower in a high interest in partisans because partisans engage more like chipping away um that's like of course a blanket rule but it's typical\nOf and she doesn't fourteen it was down to forty percent\nAnd she doesn't eat uh Eighteen up until Kavanaugh was forty two percent and then uh the jump now to forty six percent so still that's not as high as some of the earlier elections among independents and that may just be because they're overwhelmed with it and they don't they don't like either side and they just want it makes them want to withdraw from\nPalo yeah but I Wonder 'cause I Would consider myself an independent yeah and there's no way you're going to keep me away from the polls\nAnd so I'm Wondering you know with that four percent jump was it a four percent yup or to preserve four percent jump I'm I Wonder how much of that or people like me who are going to vote for the Republican\nJust because the left has gone insane\nRight and there's a lot of independence that I ... I mean I certainly would fall into this category as well right I Am not registered member of any party nor will I ever be right ... what was that being said\nUh you know I vote Republican I mean I you know don't vote for Democrats [laughter] so\nI mean for Republicans independents and libertarians libertarian so I don't vote for Democrats but yeah I mean so that's never going to happen so and the fact that I'm an independent you can't look at that line as these are people who could go either way it anytime between these two parties that's not what that is\nRight people who identify that way it's a group that's ... that's growing and has been growing for quite some time yes people are bailing out of the parties [laughter] um but the parties themselves are becoming a more rigid in and more\nOf this one could come down to the independents mhm this one could come down to because you can understand the Republicans going up you can understand if you're on the Democratic side Kavanaugh driving all those people but what's driving the independent\nYeah I mean I Would think they are discussed with what's going on right [laughter] if anything\nOr they don't like the overall system there's one other interesting Saturday here Glenn if we could yeah I'm as we're talking about the caravan of of uh immigrants coming migrants whatever ... which will will be illegal immigrants if they if they get it all the way up by the way who\nWho said that was coming or oh yeah there's this burger yeah definitely we talked a lot about ... a lot about this uh interesting to see the numbers among Latino voters\nSo ah in two thousand six were coming off of the attempt at comprehensive immigration reform that fails ... Republicans very upset about that Democrats win that election\nTypically easily um a Latino at sixty two percent high interest in the election that number in mid term elections has been dismal since ... in two thousand ten was only forty eight percent two dozen fourteen it was forty one percent\nRenowned medical correspondent and endurance race champion pop are not empty people ask me\nHow do you keep competing at the age of Seventeen healthy living is important which so his pain if you have paid you can't train so on fruit I discovered salon pasta lie to keep less this unique topical pain reliever contains too safe and effective anesthetics nothing has worked better for\nSalon pasta ... plus cream or wrong\n[noise] but how guys on for the most important midterm elections in a generation immigration healthcare trained for control\nOf all on the ballot this year and ... helping make sense of it all we only stayed\n... says that will determine control of Congress\nJoe until the last vote is counted\nFuture Tuesday November sixth on MSNBC\nTune in every Saturday morning at seven thirty for new dot coms well and the show learn how to bring out your natural beauty with advanced skin and relaxation techniques they'll have death speakers to touch on other topics that affect everyday lives it off for tips on how to take care of yourself that Saturday mornings at seven thirty [noise]\nImagine twelve of the areas finest restaurants all under one roof it's happening November first that twin hills country club and long meadow joined greater Springfield habitat for humanity as we celebrate our Eighteenth annual ... festival pay fun night of cocktails advertisers are in the areas best restaurants\nBid on silent and live auction items for your chance to win a saint Patrick's Day celebration in Boston with a drastic Murphy's bid on it we stayed at one of the Napa Valley luxurious resorts in California and we always have a few surprises the proceeds from greater Springfield habitat\nFor humanity all these doubles support our mission to build homes for families in need of decent affordable housing in hand in county for more information and to purchase tickets visit our website habitat Springfield dot org\nThat habitat in Springfield dot org we look forward to seeing you on November first act when hills country club and long meadow asphalt feasible twenty eight teams raider Springfield habitat for humanity building homes building hope [noise]\nI grew up in a family of nurse at my mom and step mom are both nurses\nAnd I am proud to be a nurse at bay the noble hospital staff emergency room and now that our behavioral health unit question one would be a disaster\nFor every nurse in our state with rated staffing racy is the limit the number of patients they treat overriding are professional judgment\nTaking away the flexibility we need to do our job much worse [noise] math and she has that same thing in opioid and mental health crisis question wind means ... noble would have to reduce capacity\nIn our behavior on how you make forty seven percent a year that means we'd be leading pay some in the ER to wait for how sometimes for days that put question one main protest our high but I think what it means for every hospital in Massachusetts [noise] my name is Molly moody\nI Am a nurse from my fiance and I am voting no on one [noise]\nPaid for by the coalition to protect patient safety [noise] All right\nWe've got a brand new wave of air one grain one ... one going Brett alright what about do grain bread let me get a ticket for to bring what about you image onto the magic no from Jim it down to about three three grains I've read breeze I don't know if I buy for ordering who wouldn't want or grains John's Delano let go by five six seven eight want to make it rain a range of John Still uno All right what about non non rain we rarely yeah\nWe'll take it that's the only job new nine weeks up going one no one five so\nDry our new nine green we got to me John sweet yeah for yeah only in the ... can you see [noise]\nUm [noise]\nMy mouth and be among the\nRocky and ... opening up to a world the possibility\nBecause once you get to the foreign come back on line with a different [noise]\nThere are some moments only before it's kind of spy find yours that discovered the forest dot\nLearned about forest near you\nDiscovered cool thing to do when you go like hiking\nFishing for camping\nAnd friends might just see this moment south they're fine to discover the forest dot org that discovered the forest dot\n... by the U.S point ... on ...

maintain a framework for ordered liberty\nSo that you can go live in the communities of love where you're actually raising your kids and build a better mouse trap or app or where your worshipping because those are the communities that are going to make you happy politics is a means to an end politics isn't the end\nSo become completely agree with you however our politicians are becoming more and more extreme especially on the left\nOr they are you know they're they are anti capitalist they are they're anti constitution so you know you use on one hand I agree with you we can't be you know all about politics\nBut at what point do you see good people say\nEnough is enough and I can't take this anymore\nYeah but then to what end what what do we do next because what we don't want to do next is what the weirdos did\nOr to Nancy Pelosi in California and hundred centigrade aware does did to Mitch McConnell and Elaine Chao in Kentucky exactly that are day because there is no second or third just moved from there that doesn't just end up at violence and this is not saying by the way that people don't have a First Amendment right to protest that clearly do\nBut screaming someone down\nTaking ... lanes food off the table and throwing it on the floor and saying you don't belong in our country or to to leader McConnell or to Secretary Chao who served in President Trump's cabinet that kinda stuff doesn't actually have\nPersuasion as any goal the the only thing there is just sort of symbolic politics as rent a witch headstrong pretty dark place I think\nSo I agree with you again but where is the leadership I've written a book you've written a book it's different than actually going out and leading 'em and standing you know Martin Luther king marching through Atlanta and taking the beating\nA yes but I think we should also recognize that the ... a phenomenon is really built for short term media collapse that is what they're doing\nThat I I'm In I'm In the middle of a little downtown sort of restored downtown in Omaha right now and ah there's no end to fight here and yet we got a whole bunch of people who might be obsessed with\nThinking about and to today when I think we we need to be aware of this sort of media college in which we live so in the Nineteen fifties\nSixty eight percent of Americans any given week we're watching I Love Lucy so that it was sixty percent of households that that basically Ninety nine percent of households knew what Lucy and does he had done that week it was an important content\nBut it was shared the content that was that American way when you fought with somebody about some project at work or if you disagreed with him about politics or you could still talk about things that we had in common what's happening now and why I wrote this book of them is because there is no we're right now\nAnd they're the most watched cable news programming a Sean Hannity is number one that Rachel that I was off and number two they're still\nReally only one point one percent and nine tenths of one percent of the public and so our world is so fragmented and fractured that I think it's really important to not consume our media as if the people like anti ... who are doing this to hope\nFor viral collapse I think part of what healthy Americans should do is ignoring them [noise]\nSo what is are are we I mean I've spent\nThe last two years and the things that I can I continually come back to every single time is the bill of rights it's why people came here because they were protected they knew that they had the right to dream and create and be left alone\nYeah yeah is that our our even our own them\nSo yes ... ... e pluribus unum out of the many one right we don't have a whole bunch of one right now we don't have a shared sense of what you've just said the first amendment is the beating heart of the American experiment freedom of religion freedom of the press freedom of assembly freedom of speech\nRight of protest all of those things flow from the fundamental assumption about the dignity of three hundred and twenty million Americans which is we believe ... day we believe that our citizens are created in the image of God with the turtles souls\nAnd with dignity that way bigger than their policy preferences and so what's unique in our moment I think the grand tension that we as a people are not really wrestling through that is so far upstream from politics is this tension between rudeness\nAnd ruthlessness almost all of the happiness literature a few well out there it's confirming stuff that wise people people who've had grandparents have known for millennia\nWhich is that happiness is actually a relatively simple equation the nuclear family do you have a couple of deep friendships\nOr do you have a local worshipping community do you have a theological framework to make sense to death and suffering and forth and statistically the number one driver of happiness is do you have a meaningful vocation do you have shared work do you have co workers do you think when you leave home on Monday morning\nWhen you go to do something not to make a lot of money or do you have a lot of status but is there some neighbor who benefits from what I Do\nIf those four things are true or even if three of the four true you're pretty likely to be happy\nAnd that those things are all tied to rudeness but we're living through a technological revolution that's tempting to believe that we can be ruthless we can be place less and so a lot of what's happening as the undermining of local community and the undermining of thick relationships and the undermining of vocation or long work ends\nUp in a world where a lot of people are using political tribalism to fill a void of the loneliness that's actually happening in their local community I think we need to reflect more deeply on that challenge of our time\nAll right so I Want to take a quick break and I want to come back and talk about um the press
