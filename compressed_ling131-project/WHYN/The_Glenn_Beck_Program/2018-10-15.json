Facebook but I I I I I Want to spend some time going over it with you\nSaying may you live in interesting times they always say oh that's a Chinese curse that it's really not that's not may live in interesting times is not a Chinese in fact\nThe first place that we can really find that being said is in the Yorkshire Post that's in England in Nineteen thirty six a guy stood up and parliament his name was a sir Austin Chamberlain and he was um uh he was\nThe meeting with union is and uh he spoke of the grave injury to collective security by Germany's violation of of the treaties so he said look I'm not so long ago\nI spent some years of service in China and there there was this old Chinese fellow who told me of a curse may you live in interesting times and there is no doubt that this curses followed upon\nUs so it's not a Chinese it's this this guy is the only one is the only place we can really find this but I've always liked that because I don't think it's a curse it's a it's a\nIt's just the saying and you decide if it's a blessing or a curse\nI personally think it's a blessing\nMy dad taught me what I was really young that no matter what happens to you there is no bad\nNow he taught me this when I was really young but it took it took me hitting rock bottom alcoholism divorced everything else my life completely falling apart before I really learned that it took a dark chapter in my life that they taught me there is nothing that life can hand you that is in itself bad\nIt just depends on what you do with it\n\nIs this going to change you in destructive ways is it going to make you angry are you going to be filled with bitterness and despair are you going to be looking for vengeance claim\n\nOr will you allow whatever calamity has come your way to strengthen you\nThrough enlightenment through correction new understandings humility it's up to you so living in interesting times I think that's a blessing\nAnd we're going to learn this one way or another we can either learn this the easy way like with my dad telling me or we'll learn the hard way like I actually had to take hit the end and learn through just total collapse\nBut one way or another humility will rain again because we have we have an unbelievable lack of humility\nIn DC in Hollywood of a story today to tell you about Michael ... who's now quitting the music industry\nHe says he's tired of the celebrity nonsense\nEverybody on the left and the right we all have an ego problem we're utterly convinced that our side is absolutely right and if you violate that if you violate one part of that you're a traitor you're a traitor to the race the party the cause whatever\nThey are wrong and we remain right now there are real true right and wrong or there is there is truth\nBut I don't think any of us are really looking for at least a large section isn't looking for it we are indeed living in interesting times\n\nBut is is our crisis is our problem of them problem because that's what the world is trying to sell us I personally think it's an ... problem all of us both sides\nAll of us and maybe we don't see it because we're so busy staging and filtering and enhancing the colors on our Facebook or Instagram pictures that we can really no longer\nRecognize what what is true even about our own lives because everything that we print and post most of it is ally one way or another subtle or bold its ally\nAnd why is that\nBecause we've been marketed to ever since we were born all of us if you were born after Nineteen fifty you're marketed to your whole

compassionate\nYou by the Democratic label I Am smarter than others I Am science minded and it doesn't even matter if you really are doesn't matter if you've ever given a dime or given any time to anything just by buying this label you are compassionate it's the label that everybody needs\nNow if you want to buy Republican well then you get to be patriotic guy unpatriotic I support our troops I

you have\n\nYou have all of us are honest and we really look at our situation we all know we all see the same symptoms we all know that we as a nation or sick were really really sick\nAnd we have we have each of us have doctors and their each prescribing the opposite medicine and each of us as\nPatients are also desperate to cure or what is killing us killing our society\nThat we will follow these doctors directions because they know better they know better they know more than we do that they've got the answer and we become more and more vested in their cure as our friends and family say that's not the cure\nBecause we're taking this medicine and we believe we just become more vested in our doctor are doctors write yours is wrong\nThat was the same time the doctor is not going to get more humble because the doctor will know he or she has everything to lose if his or her patients begin to seek another opinion another diagnosis another remedy it's in their best interest to keep patients busy looking at the other side\nSo they're not questioning what he's doing\nAnd well we're all fighting\nOver the cure none of us even if stop to ask if the diagnosis is even correct were

sick I'm I hurt\nAnd I am full of despair or I'm fearful\nOr I just don't have the patience and every time I'm really sick or in real pain it usually is followed by a time where I have to begin conversations with I'm really so sorry I I was just in really bad pain or I was really sick I was having a really bad day\nAnd I know I'm not alone\nAnd judging by our society today we're having a really very bad most difficult day every day it seems and it gets worse every day\n\nI Want those doctors to know I Want those\nI don't want those to know that actually do just want to watch the world
