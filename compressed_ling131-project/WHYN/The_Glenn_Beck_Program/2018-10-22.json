you take the most important medicine [noise]\nIt's called hope\nVery I'm struck here and I'm joined today by a state planning attorney Todd ... from the law firm of crushing and on with your legal exchange quick tip of the day\nWe're talking about drafting Medicaid income trust\nYou know ... ... the average person and frankly the average financial advisor\nIs not going to know whether the documents are right or wrong they need to rely on their attorney which should they be looking for when they're looking for in selecting an elder law attorney or somebody who's going to wrap these trust documents are so critically important\nYeah I think that's a great question because as you say they are challenging him and so they need to be drafted right you know\nUh and and you're going to find that you know it's it's the attorney that's going to be the one drafting it so\nWhen you're when you're picking that lawyer I Would say first and foremost and you can see this right on their car that they give you the letters El Al am what does that mean\nAfter the attorney's name it means that they've got a masters in taxation is so they are so they undergraduate degree law school and a master's degree of some sort in taxation which has from law school it's a specialty law degree they specialize in it so\nVery important because it's going to be covering on\nThe specs of tax years they tax your income tax or gift tax\nAre all impacted when you do these irrevocably trust so you need to know that flat fee or hourly you know another thing flat fee they should say you know how often do you do flat fee mhm right and lastly asked a lawyer how often do you so much of your time in the year do you spend doing estate planning right if it's not one hundred percent folks I\nAmong Republicans and Democrats you kind of can see what happened in the election again we talked about a two thousand six big win for Democrats well when we went into that election sixty nine percent of Democrats said they had a the highest levels of interest in the election sixty nine percent Republicans it was only fifty six percent\nAnd Republicans got smoked two thousand ten or you had a sixty six percent Republican\nA percentage of people who are really interesting the election only forty nine percent of Democrats Democrats got smoked um he says the same thing she thousand fourteen remember Democrats got smoked again they're Republicans fifty nine percent or said they were really interested only forty eight percent of Democrats said that um and\nWhat's interesting is leading up to I Would say Brett Kavanaugh\nYou had the same type of thing playing out\nAgain in this time in favor of the Democrats started to look a lot like two thousand six so up until ... you had sixty three percent of Democrats\nHighest levels of interest in the election Republicans was only fifty three percent so that is a you know a big it's the type of gap that leads you to lose the ... and lose the house or at least makes it possible ...\nSince ... that has changed Democrats have gone up from sixty three to Seventy two percent holy cow Seventy two is the highest number for any party and all of these elections\nHowever Republicans have jumped a higher percentage point basis from fifty three to sixty eight\nSo now we have a basically a balance a very close within the margin of error separation and both of those numbers sixty eight\nWould be the second highest level of interest of all of these elections so the Democrats are at Seventy two Republicans are sixty eight both of those numbers are the highest of any of these elections going back to two thousand six mid ... two thousand six midterms\nUm and I mean which is which is crazy\nIt is a a a ... there's a level here that we don't know what's gonna happen if we this is like you know this is territory that has not been seen before and you know while you can look at the polls and you can see the polls as we've talked about over the past couple of weeks relatively\nAre relatively pointing towards a Republican or a ... victory in the Senate where they maybe pick up a couple of seats and Republican loss in the house where they would lose a couple of seats um there is a you know if you wanna look at the kind of be optimistic way of looking at the house right now\nTo show you how close is is if Republicans were just sweep the races they are favored in okay that's not it's not going to happen it never happens but just kind of generally for understanding if they were able to sweep all of the races their favorite in\n... and they revealed a when all of the races that they trailed by one point so all of these races are either victories are toss ups right I mean they could go either way but if they were to sweep all of those\nRepublicans still hold the house at two twenty two Fifteen now the problem is the idea that they're going to sweep all those races is\nWe know that's not going to happen it never happens the other thing is they will win some races where they're underdogs by more than one point they will win some places you know whatever the down by five in the polls they'll want him winning some of those races\nSo the split is going to be important here but just that gets them only to two twenty two Fifteen which is a I think they lose that's been losing tens seeds from where they are now\nUm but also a very narrow majority to the point where some conservative things could be derailed by just you know your generic moderate house member that you've never heard their name before when they decide they're going to vote against the president so it's an interesting way of looking at it\nAnd it shows that this really could go either way I mean when they say that there's about a twenty percent chance the Republicans lose the Senate about a twenty percent chance that the Republicans when the house\nThat's the way that these models are all kind of looking at it\nTwenty percent is one in five right um so it is very possible that one of these things can happen but right now it looks like those are gonna wind up getting split and then of course still has ... even though you're not gonna be able to pass the Democratic bills because they would either give each other on a train in the house you're still going to have investigative power to have subpoena power going to have imposed\nA nightmare it's a nightmare if if they get the house it's a nightmare okay\nSo here's here's what I found interesting in um in watching the news and watching just the flow of it\nHave you noticed that you know places like the Atlantic and the times and the post are now starting to publish stories about\nYou know it's an uphill battle to win some of these races in the house it's an uphill battle they have changed their tone from\nA you know an absolute positive well we're on a blue wave to now almost laying the foundation of [noise] [noise] yeah we we lost but it was you know it was really kind of a long shot anyway\nYeah I mean that's how badly I think the Kavanaugh facing a has backfired on them I mean it's made the Senate basically I mean again it's just that it's one of the five chance but I mean\nThey had they had a better chance of this uh two months ago I mean they had a legitimate path to victory when Cruz was only up by three points all of these races that looked like leaning Republican we're all toss up are and some of them looked like they might be leading Democrats they had a chance to win the Senate before the cabinet thing now I mean I think it's a real\n... going to come to the independents how are the independence feeling\n... they're in an interesting group because they're not as passionate as you would expect in this environment so independence in two thousand six and two thousand ten where at fifty percent\nIndependents are almost always going to be lower in a high interest in partisans because partisans engage more like typically um that's like of course a blanket rules but it's typical um and she doesn't fourteen it was down to forty percent and two thousand eight or Eighteen up until Kavanaugh was forty two percent\nAnd then uh the jump now to forty six percent so still that's not as high as some of the earlier elections among independents and that may just be because\nThey're overwhelmed with them and they don't they don't like either side and they just want it makes them want to withdraw from\nAnd I wonder because I Would consider myself an independent yeah and there's no way you're going to keep me away from the polls\nAnd so I'm Wondering you know where that four percent jump was at a four percent yup or to preserve four percent jump I'm I Wonder how much of that or people like me who are going to vote for the Republican\nJust because the left has gone insane\nRight and there's a lot of independents that I ... I mean I certainly would fall into this category as well right I Am not registered member of any party nor will I ever being right her life like was that being said uh you know I vote Republican\nI mean I you know don't vote for Democrats [laughter] so I mean for Republicans independents and libertarians libertarian so I don't vote for Democrats but yeah I mean so that's never going to happen so the fact that I'm an independent you can't look at that line as\nThese are people who could go either way at any time between these two parties that's not what that is right people who identify that way it's a group that that's growing and has been growing for quite some time yes people are bailing out of the parties um but the parties themselves are becoming a more rigid in and more\nOf this one could come down to the independence mhm this one could come down to because you can understand the Republicans going up you can understand if you're on the Democratic side Kavanaugh driving all those people but what's driving the independent\n... yeah I mean\nI Would think they are discussed with what's going on right [laughter] if anything they don't like the overall system there's one other interesting is this that and you're going to put good yeah I'm as we're talking about the caravan\nOf of uh immigrants coming migrants whatever ... which will will be illegal immigrants if they if they get all the way up by the way who who said that was coming\nOh yeah there's this burger yeah definitely we talked a lot about a lot about this uh interesting to see the numbers among Latino voters so ah in two thousand six were coming off of the attempt at comprehensive immigration reform that fails ... Republicans very upset about that Democrats win that election relatively easily um\nA Latino at sixty two percent high interest in the election that\nNumber in mid term elections has been dismal since ... in two thousand channels like forty eight percent two dozen fourteen it was forty one percent very low in two thousand uh Eighteen up until very recently or was it was at forty seven percent that number has now jumped\nIn October of two dozen Eighteen to Seventy one percent from forty seven to Seventy one this year so this is a whatever the reason while it was higher than two thousand six for Latino voters who wow and again that was a wave election for Democrats\nIf it I mean the only thing I can think of is the Guatemalan refugees what else has happened I mean you did have also a fairly recently the\nUnaccompanied minors situation where they were being quote unquote held in cages you know I was in July or August yet but still ... relatively recently a I'm a you know the the two thousand each in polls were taken January to September\nPerhaps we need them I don't know I don't like getting into these situations I Wish we weren't there at all but this was a crime and it was despicable disgusting brutal\nI mean unbelievable to people in the west but it happened and I have no doubt that the prince was behind it okay that has no bearing on who he was\nWe can say that this was a despicable horrible crime done by the Saudis and their horrible people for X Y Z and we can say ... did not deserve to die this way\nNobody deserves to die that that way however she's not\nThe guy that everybody in the press is making him out to be he's not some freedom loving guy he's a member of the Muslim Brotherhood\nThe Muslim Brotherhood that he was pushing for was an Islamic state he wants an Islamic state in his own writing in the Washington Post says yeah we have to have\nA an Islamic assist rule if you dismiss as Islam assist rule under surreal law then you'll never have peace in the middle east well wait a minute I'm not against Islam I Am against Islamic rule sharia law tell me where it's working out\nShow to me where is that working out where is it protecting human rights no thank you\nI mean Islamic rule just by none other group of Islam is is what you have in Saudi Arabia no thank you\n\nI'm going to give some of the facts of of this guy and it's not a conspiracy there was a conspiracy to commit murder to hide it\nAnd we have found that\nNow America needs some adults in the room to say okay that's a separate issue but let's not paint ... into some freedom loving prince because that's not true ran\nGreen fields new traffic and whether the\nRadio by sixty\n...\nGood morning it's nine thirty in the WHYY newsroom ... here's the latest\nManchester New Hampshire teen is recovering in Massachusetts hospital after police say he lets state troopers on a three states car chase before stabbing a state trooper officials say ... was first spotted driving a radically in Hillsboro friday and then carjacked another vehicle as he let state troopers through parts of New Hampshire Vermont and Massachusetts when he finally stopped\nHe allegedly stabbed a state trooper before another officer shot him in the tour so the answer troopers still hospitalized as well a man living in Springfield illegally has been found guilty on guns and immigration charges men rail Alta Morocco Navarro was arrested for firing a gun in the air on ... street he faces Thirty years in prison and seven hundred thousand dollars in fines\nSensing a set for January Eighteenth and early voting availability begins today for Massachusetts voters can cast their ballot now through November second if they want to vote ahead of the November sixth elections early ballots can be requested by male residents can check the Massachusetts secretary of state's website and that's what's happening on this Monday morning in the newsroom and for John Bay back I'm Steve\nFord a homeowner you won a company with an attention for details at sturdy home improvement your roofing job is accompanied by an outside job supervisor sturdy prides itself on completing a roofing job in two days or less for you get a two thousand dollar ...\nWhy because a sturdy home is a beautiful home costs thirty home improvement today or log on to dirty home dot com [noise]\nAre you looking for the answers to your questions about investments college planning for one k.'s and more join Rick out I'm In for the truth about money every Sunday Morning at ten am all news radio five sixty W.
