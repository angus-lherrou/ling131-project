is there is no such thing as toxic masculinity\nJust like there's no such thing as toxic femininity there are people who are just plain old fashioned toxic\nSo instead of segregating us more and singling out man why not why not try to get everybody to be nice you know one thing that's really nice\nIs that if you're a gentleman holding a door for a woman\nNot a bad thing [noise]\n\nAnd that's going to do today folks please take a moment of thinking about the men and women of this country where the uniform wore the uniform for those who may be open to sacrifice my uniform [noise] actually national honor the deployed day [noise]\nYou know which honors the person who had to be deployed with the military and a forest their family who technically [noise]\nGets deployed to [noise]\nPlease

a hitting him with and then silently retracting are false but also the media has been under attack\nBy the White House for very long time it's not an issue with just the current administration and stop making it one President Obama was historically a nightmare for the free press and you refuse to say anything about it\nThe crazy thing is today the craziest thing is is\nThat the media gleefully gave Obama a pass\nEven though he was weaponized sing the FBI and the de OJ against the press Donald Trump has gone so far as just calling them fake news and they got their feelings hurt\nForget about the oh I don't know threatening to throw us all in jail\nThis president is calling us fake news\nYeah well he kind of has a point just if you even look at how President Obama treated the press compared\nTo you know President Obama was putting new people in jail he was ...\nThe government against you and you failed to stand up and say anything\nOh\nAs a media was gearing up for its outrage over being called fake the New York times was publishing an article on the very same day these pipe bomb packages were delivered now I Want you to remember this is what you know just just put this in your pipe and smoke it for a little bit\n\nThere being called fake news they're being called liars they're saying\nNo no no no we're not we don't publish fake news we don't have anything against the president is not a vendetta and while\nThis is happening the New York times is printing ... an article titled five novelist imagine Trump's next chapter\nFive novelists imagined Trump's next chapter the main image at the top of this story shows the White House on fire and thinking into the ground as President Trump waves goodbye\nEach novelists had one assignment right out what you think happens after the bowler investigation is completed okay so let's come up\nLet's go to fiction writers and come up with what they think is going to happen with Mueller's investigation and what's gonna happen immediately after\nAndy you mock me you mock me\nEvery single one that's going to come to surprise they found five fiction writers are going to do it but every single one wrote a short story depicting a scenario where the president was found guilty every single one isn't that amazing they couldn't find one fiction writer to write something where Trump was not\nGuilty it's crazy\nOne story had Trump signing the twenty Fifth Amendment or and another even had him of being assassinated by a Russian agent with the help of Secret Service\nYeah\nWell we can write about the president being assassinated were advocating violence I don't\nKnow what ...\nWhat are you are you kidding me\nKnow that it was about the Russians that wasn't about a coup yes yes okay Secret Service was involved but that's not about a cool\nThis is the New York times\nYou know the ones who are leading the way saying oh my gosh the talk of violence is ... oh my gosh and we don't print fake news you're supposed to be investigators you're supposed to be neutral I thought that was the idea let's be neutral\nI now I understand that everybody has an opinion but five for writers and no one can come up with anything other than the guy is guilty and maybe he's going to be killed\nBy the secret service this is unbelievable\nHow is it the two hundred journalists can sign a letter claiming that everything is the president's fault when the flagship of the American media is writing this bull crap while the pipe bombs are coming in\nThis this time's piece exhibit a for why journalism is currently dead in America it is dead in America all of you dancing on the grave of Megan Kelly\nReally what was her what was her big thin she asked a question\nOh my gosh lock her in a tower oh my gosh she's got to be chased out of the public's where you can ask a question don't you dare ask a question\nThis is frightening America fact\nFinding is gone the media has already made up their mind they know the answer and if you disagree they will chase you out of the public square\nThey have no inclination to actually at even attempt to find the truth even attempt to understand\nYes there is a little righteous indignation and me it's not anger is it is righteous indignation\nBecause I have called these people I have talked to these people I have gone\nTo them over and over again we've had in hand and said listen you need to understand how half the country feels\nJust have a conversation you're making a huge error and yes I made all these airs oh my gosh I'm the worst person in the world I'm with you just listen to me please you have to hear what half the country is saying\nThey won't do it they're not interested they don't care and now they're quite literally making it up what's the difference between a novelist and the New York times journalist I don't know\nMedia\n[noise] this is a radical concept and I know you like radicals you love radicals\nYou if you look there's nothing wrong with being radical mob yeah those are those are just people that feel passionately so I Know you love radicals\nBut here's a radical idea if you don't want to be called fake you might want to just start with literally stopping publishing fiction\n[noise]\nTry to kill twenty thicker and back program [noise]\nSelf awareness seems to be dead at this point [noise] in the media in particular Glenn a me give you this one what is the one thing that [noise] if you're conservative Trump make the ACA criticisms of the media and\nThey say hey it's fake news hey these guys are lying hey they're the enemy of the people and they say that's the same as violence like you're you're\nYou're you're creating ... coming after I ...
