it or is it the typical black\nOh beer [laughter] should I guess that ... to be really a as loyal to on their race is yes he is we should all come together and figure out what the typical black beard last week that thanks ... maybe he can tell us can you believe that's the other thing we wanted to talk about on this was\nThis guy I'm Sorry that was said by a white guy he wouldn't be so racist can you imagine anybody saying well you know the\nTypical black experience you know they'll get up and they'll play a lot of basketball they don't take school seriously they get into a lot of fights they drink a lot do drugs\nAnd and go to class hammered I can\nYou [noise] [laughter] oh\nGod I hate this noise already I'm Sarah can I hate you Sarah\n[noise] so um but you're right even half of

that on uh-huh and yeah there's like five horrible I mean the thing that people play basketball ...\n... sorry it's science pain that people that basketball's not a bad thing though it would be called racist if it was a Republican but you're only getting into they don't pay attention to school there was fighting drinking and doing drugs like that is legitimately like just racism\nRight it just to say that entire race is doing that regularly and you know I didn't notice it until that time how many times he used the word typical in his ... he likes he loves the lower to recall and by the way this I mean\nI in a way it really does vindicate to this a moment you had a Fox for many years ago so we have to bring that up like you know I'm I'm I'm a good half of various but let me go now I I mean the seriousness it's like this what you said at the time and ... as you said you've you've poorly phrased it on Fox as we talked about just the next day\nYou know he sees everything through the

an alcoholic and I ... it really was your little line that you get I drew this line this crazy line because they thought\nAlcoholics or drunk all day alcoholics get up and they drink ... so I'm not going to be like so I'm not an alcoholic and I would literally no matter where I was I had alcohol in my hand and I watched either [noise]\nOr anything I watched either on my watch or a clock\nI Would watch the second hand do the five o'clock and when that thing went to five o'clock I drank immediately at five and that was just saying oh you got to fill it up\nAnother another basically I have to mix the beers yeah we'll drink it and then drink another one I mean if you know you're going to burn some you're gonna\nBurn some alcohol some calories by some this is one of the can down by the way
