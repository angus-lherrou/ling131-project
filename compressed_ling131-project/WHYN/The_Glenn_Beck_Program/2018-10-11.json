um\nYou know all of the piece the stuff the me too\nHad and they\nSaid they were seven distinct clusters now in America progressive activists traditional liberals passive liberals politically disengaged moderates traditional conservatives and devoted conservatives\nNow according to the report twenty five percent of Americans are traditional or devoted conservatives twenty five percent\nWow wow that's really low\n\nWill only eight percent of Americans are progressive activists\nExcuse me\nTheir views are even more out of the mainstream and are less typical two thirds of Americans do not belong in either extreme\nOr ... extreme progressive as liberal as progressive activists or as traditional devoted conservatives\nThe vast majority is now considered something called the exhausted majority\nThe members of this two thirds of our society\nShare a sense of fatigue with our polarized national conversation a willingness to be flexible in their political viewpoints and uh have a lack of voice in the national conversation\nMost members of the exhausted majority this like political correctness\nAmong the general population eighty percent believe that political correctness is a

most likely to support political correctness but the difference between them and other groups is much smaller than generally supposed three quarters of African Americans oppose political correctness three quarters\nThis means there are only four percentage points less likely than whites and only five percentage points less likely than the average to believe the political correctness is a real problem in America well eighty three percent of respondents make a a who make less than fifty thousand dollars disliked political correctness\nSeventy percent of those who make more than a hundred
