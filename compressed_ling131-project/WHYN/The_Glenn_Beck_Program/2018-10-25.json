have an an acme style bomb none of them have gone off and you took the time to print a medium that has the ISIS flag and underneath it\nIt's a quote from Larry the cable guy that says\nGet her done except none of your bombs get it done none\nThey they've had zero chance of making it through security screening\nAnd Wylie coyote I think must have known that at some point the coyotes got to go to

George Soros does\nEvery person that has been sent one of these package has mail screening these devices were not designed to kill but to be detected caught and seen\nWylie coyote wanted a media circus and boy did he get one now I Am not going to speculate whether Wiley really is\nFrom the right or from the left\nI don't know there's a lot of not jobs out that are looking to change narratives before the midterms no one knows yet this could be a kid that just thought this would be funny\nAgain there is no chance these bombs would go off\nSo maybe it's a kid maybe it's a guy who's so screwed up she just doesn't even know what he's doing\nThere's also the possibility someone knew exactly what they were doing and wanted to send a message one way or the other this however is not stopping the left from jumping on this I mean you never let a crisis go to waste\nBy noon yesterday we hadn't even found all the bombs by noon yesterday Paul Waldman of the Washington Post already had an article out blaming Donald Trump quote\nGiven what Trump has done and said this was absolutely predictable in fact it's a wonder that it took this long\nIt's not just that Trump advocates violence against his political opponents\nLow he does it's everything about his rhetoric that pushes his supporters in that direction\n\nYou know what this coming from the same guy that if it is ever found out that it is a left wing guy or just a crazy person\nThey will never report that\nThat I asked when the president has actually called for violence\n\nNow you could say in a some of his campaign rallies where he's like rough 'em up okay I'll give you that\nAre calling the media fake news\nIs not calling for violence I don't like it but that's not calling for violence encouraging your electric to the electorate to harass people in their homes their restaurants places of business and Maxine Waters\nIsn't that the equivalent of calling for violence declaring the end of civility or Clinton I mean I did go on\nBut we all know the left narrative and you heard it again yesterday and it will continue until the midterms\nIs\nIs over or that's complete bull crap it will continue and continue and continue many of our friends and the left leaning mainstream media were just utterly shocked that this kind of attack occurred\nOne person or remarked how they'd never seen anything like this directed at just one side of the spectrum first of all that would force\nOne to deny that the latest pipe bomb was sent to Mike Pence\n\nBut I don't know how hard it is for the people in the news media I don't know how hard it is for you to go back so deep in your memory bank you might need a hypnotists or therapist to bring this memory back at it so long ago\nOh wait a minute no it's just a couple of weeks ago\nThe rice and letters just sent to the White House James Mattis FBI Director Christopher Wray CIA director Gina Haspel air force secretary Heather Wilson chief of naval operations admiral John

walking at that time I don't even know\nAnd as far as the identity of Wylie coyote for those of you in the mainstream media it's really best not to speculate\nIf you don't know you should say you don't know here's who I think this is\nI don't know there's no evidence on anything everything is speculation and if I Would say already ... versus ... wife Dwayne person trying to ramp everybody up\nWhat would that do that would choose the people listening\nAnd they'd say oh my gosh that's exactly right so why is it you feel so comfortable demonizing Donald Trump and all of his supporters\nAnd blaming this on Donald Trump and all of his supporters when you have nothing but a cartoon bomb\nYou\nIf you just get on and say we don't have the facts let's wait for the facts\n\nYou do something like that and something crazy happens it's almost unthinkable\n\nYou can actually keep or begin to rebuild something I Know it's a little tiny called credibility\nBut you'd have to be you'd have to be interested in having some credibility to be able to gain it\n[noise] [noise] well for\nThe second day in a row Jason bud ... who is with us it it he is I'm\nA former I'm a former\nMilitary intel uh knows a little something about bombs and and I eat these Jason how ridiculous is this bomb the most ridiculous looking bomb I've ever seen it sort of ... when I when we first looked at I think I was reading a tweet by Jake Tapper and he was talking about how these were\nI'm for mass murder and um I I was looking at it and I was like no not really\nI mean it's a ... you were just talking about it's plastic which defeats the entire purpose of a pipe bomb the shrapnel was what's dangerous in the pie bought the explosives inside or just to make it like basically build pressure mhm so usually it's a potassium nitrate I think charcoal okay we don't need\nGets a fair criticism at times and we made it um I don't like everything that he says about the media but we have no evidence no evidence at all the rhetoric or anything else fed into these bombings we have no idea we have no idea who did them we have no idea what the motivation was yet I mean I think you could probably say there's a political\nMotive but that's only earlier political motive but that's all you could say you don't know it has such these bombs or so ridiculous that it was either done by somebody who is mentally inefficient or\nIt's somebody who didn't want the bombs to go off the sticker the ISIS me right here are done that clearly marks that as somebody from the right\nWhy would you put that on there\nAnd why did none of them go off right I mean again you hope God I'm Glad none of them went off by the way\nUm but it it seems to indicate someone who one of these things to be seen every single part of this that we've just talked about\nA new leads to that and and your in your in your point about the timer before it's like ... there's a reason why there's FedEx and ... like that because the postal service is not an exact science\nAnd you can't say no way often to point to our right at that time on timing to you could've blown up the post in it so that there was a photo time
