[noise]\nClaimed that come and we're thrilled to have a the a great governor from the great state of Texas Governor Greg Abbott on with us now hello governor how are you sir\nReally and I am doing terrific how's it going\nGood it's always good to talk to you I'm a I Want to talk to you about a couple of things first of all early voting um we're seeing this massive turnout in a you know in Houston and in Dallas uh ... what does this or what does this tell us how to turn out the rally around the rest of the state\nWell this may be frustrating and be because the true answer is it was too early to tell right here's what we don't know and and that is is it safe front running of what the overall vote total will be or\nIs it a massive wave vote for your listeners what we're seeing with regard to the turnout is a massive records are not just for mid term elections which is what the stairs up but in many of these locations are the first day of voting exceeds the amount of those that took place in the presidential election on the very first day\nAnd so all we know is is is that is a massive number of people are turning out to vote will know that part but do mania orbits conservatives are saying oh we're afraid of this caravan that's coming up here and we want to make sure people were subject to stop it but here's all I can tell your audience and that is\nIf you care about the future of Texas if you care about the future of America or you could not sit on the sidelines this election we're because\nThere are other people out there who were casting those who might be hostile to you and your values\nYour value must be counted at the ballot box if you're listening this me to make sure you go vote because a lot of other people are going to vote\nSo a governor and a lot of times people have said you all the most important election of your life and I was thinking about this last night I I've always hated that praise\nBut in this particular case we are now seeing the masks come off now we're seeing people who say you know no to capitalism no to the constitution I'm a democratic socialist um this is a game changing a ... a election is it not\nOnly he captured the U.S it was very correctly because it used to be here in Texas and maybe some other places are the Democrats either rent under do label or they would call themselves a conservative Democrat and then they were a liberal and didn't they were a progressive and now they're openly or lifting themselves as\nSocialist ... and get this because it's not just in Texas are the leading candidate for governor\nFlorida a isn't out now that he says as a socialist and end the Bernie Sanders style of socialism is not even further to the lab but the same things happening with regard to governors' races and other key races across the entire United States of America and going here in Texas or some people may not be\nCalling themselves the socialist but when you look at their policies such as the open border policy that is socialism out with a look at the uh wealth distribution because that is socialism and people don't realize and that is\nSocialism is real out there but we see it in Venezuela where the reported inflation rate in Venezuela is over a million percent\nAnd so it's just crazy what's going on and that is why your listeners need to understand that they have the power to make sure the state in this country remain on the right track by going to vote cast your vote\nDon't I don't think\nUnderstand conservatives understand how close this state is to flipping blue there's ... there's only a few counties that are really a a lynchpin here and ah you know unbeknownst to most people is Soros has dumped\nMillions of dollars into this state for a long term plan of of turning us into California\nWhere you're writing and so many of your listeners need to understand is that George Soros has been involved in Texas elections for the past couple of cycles\nAre two years ago he gave a ... million dollars not directly to a candidate\nIn Harris County down in Houston but this year we paid a million dollars directly to candidates in San Antonio on top of that you as bonded these grand games to get out the vote\nAnd so he is trying to turn Texas a into California and that's on top of all this money pouring in from California for candidates like that so uh but let's go back to the first part of your question\nAnd listeners think about this all the large cities where the population basis or the state of Texas or really blew cities and counties you have a Dallas year after that and you have San Antonio you have all that and you have El Paso", "show_name": "The Glenn Beck Program", "year": "2018", "city": "Springfield", "day": "23"}
