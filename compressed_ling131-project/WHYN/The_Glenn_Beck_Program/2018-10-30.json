G. wells famous Eighteen Ninety eight novel war of the world for the Martians invading\nAbout really what happened was it was an example of fake news me saying oh God here we go no it really was seen there were there were some\nPeople it was a very small amount of people who really believed when they tuned in to the broadcast and didn't hear the disclaimer at the beginning or the disclaimer that came later when the CBS Studios phone lines were ringing\nOff the hook they thought it was real\nBut there was such a small number of people what became real was the out rage than the outrage really came from a lot of different newspapers that wanted to sell a story\nThe next day that people believe that a radio broadcast was a Martian invasions that maybe it was a little bit of a media attacking media see newspapers didn't like the fact that radio stations were stealing advertising from them like we continue to do today\nWell it became more about the outrage and then the politicians got involved in said this newly formed thing the FCC has got to investigate this meanwhile it made Orson Welles career and taught a lot of other of of us in the media sometimes stunts get you a lot of attention\nWe don't do that here we don't do silly on just the facts ma'am\nWe take a moment to think about the men and women in this country where the uniform wore the uniform of those are made the ultimate sacrifice and the uniforms strung men and women and blue\nWe lost on this day in history fifty for them twenty nine of them were shot to death police officer Palmo walk from Springfield died on this day in Nineteen Seventy three years in a motorcycle crash will be back\nTomorrow all Hallows eve with us first of all of the show is the best medicine thank you Julie Flynn job's gym once you take\nA\nCall eight five five four zero three\nNinety four six\nStory I'm struck here and I'm joined today by a state planning attorney Todd ... from the law firm of crushing and Dole and with your legal exchange quick tip of the day\nWe're talking about drafting Medicaid income trust\nYou know ... the average person and frankly the average financial advisor\nIs not going to know whether the documents are right or wrong they need to rely on their attorney which should they be looking for when they're looking for in selecting an elder law attorney or somebody who's going to wrap these trust documents are so critically important yeah\nI think that's a great question because as you say they are challenging him and so they need to be drafted right yeah\nUh and and you're going to find that you know it's it's the attorney that's going to be the one drafting it's so when you're when you're picking that lawyer I Would say first and foremost and you can see this right on their car and they give you a ... to letters El Al am what does that mean after the attorney's name it means that they've got a masters in taxation\nYeah so they are so they undergraduate degree law school and a master's degree is I'm Sorry in taxation which has\nUse radio I think we'll see\nWhy in and the only way why NFL Springfield\nBut what do you call a group of people\nTwo thousand four thousand seven thousand strong marching to a border saying you're going to cross whether the country wants your not wild caring another country's flag\nWhat what what do you call that [noise]\nYou know the reason why you have to stop this if it's coming the reason why you have to stop it is because if you don't stop this one there will be an invasion because America can control our own borders nearly eight\nThousand troops to match a four thousand strong caravan fourteen thousand if the second caravan linked up with the first swelling their numbers to seven thousand\nSo any media magician tried to spin what this caravan really is\nAnd I honestly don't know how you can describe a potential force of seven thousand people all approaching your border with the intent of getting through no matter what you say and carrying a foreign flag I don't know what you call it besides an invasion\n\nSo it was the department of defense justified well the news media will say no\nBut what does America say\nIt is classic mail is in military style doctrine preparing now for an unconventional attack on the country this has not happened before but I said I Want to be fair here unexpected in a regular\nTactics call for emergency action and I definitely feel safer knowing that men and women and green and blue or standing watch on the border\nI don't know what you can expect what should you do nothing nothing\nYou had a group of people that were headed to your business or to your house and they said we're going to go into your house whether you like it or not and we've got two thousand people here\nAnd you're not going to be able to stop us because what's in your house we want we're just going to live there\nNow if you had a group of people that were marching saying that\nComing to your house\nWould you want the police to do nothing\nWhat'd you think that would you be happy if the police all of a sudden just that you know what they're not common ... que they they're on the road there on the road there they are there's the video there's the video them saying they're going to come into my house and live in my house oh please\n\nI don't know about you but\nThe next time there was a campaign I sure be running for sheriff\n\nLocal law enforcement protect our streets the\nBorder patrol protects our borders the new standard cannot be the military on our borders a hundred percent of the time\nEmergency situations always give birth to emergency changes which always turn into permanent changes the federal income tax the Patriot act are truly examples of many\nI don't like emergency measures\nThat's why we should have\nA border policy that allows immigrants to come in that are qualified\nCome in through the front door and stops\nAll of the side windows and the back door entries\nThe country needs either serious\nPolicy on the border that will stop this or you need to build the damn wall\nBecause quite frankly the military on the border is not a good solution but I'm Sorry CNN I don't know what\nYou want to call it I mean after all you don't like to call you don't like to call and to fall when they're throwing Molotov cocktails you don't even like to call them a mob\nGlenn Beck program\nDirection by numbers\nLet's take a look at election by a numbers fellows do tell me what's happening\nSo far well uh we're one week away\nAnd this is when we get all the with the chart a little bit because we have a had a lot of races in the middle and they sort of toss up category you have 'em because Poland's been close and now we start to try to move them around a little bit more aggressively because we're only a week away or so here's what we have right now are done it only three tossup races or we have moved uh Missouri\nAnd Indiana er into a lean Republican position I Would say Missouri I'm pretty confident of Indiana the polling is is a little surprising their Donnelly has been favored there for a long time\nUm but we're moving those to lean Republican that the lives there was a Ted Cruz's still lean Republican state\nOr a and a ... a Mississippi and North Dakota is going to get you to fifty one if you if the Republican sweep their leaders right now fifty one Republican senators say there are three tossup races we have that I think are pure tossed up still and we couldn't really moved them\nOr Arizona isn't there Nevada is in there and we moved Tennessee back into their Tennessee had a couple of really good polls were Marsha Blackburn a couple of weeks ago\nWhere she was you know more some of them showing her up fourteen points place falling is a lot closer are really a tough race at this point holy cow yeah so those three are are in the tossup category and we've moved a couple of towards the Democrats as well uh we moved to Florida to a lean democratic\nState uh again this is a tough race cars you've got the governor versus the incumbent senator it's been really tight the entire time but honestly looking at it we've seen a movement towards towards a Nelson in Florida\nAnd we now have that one is a lean Democrat state um we've moved from Minnesota as well from faith Democrat to leaning Democrat pulling their [noise] you know\nI still think that's going to the Democrats but it the polling is closer then I think most people expect there's two races in Minnesota one of them to blow up the other one isn't and so we're keeping that one of the leading\nDemocrat category for now Montana we've moved to lean Democrat as well or was a tossup races where most of the time it looks like tester has enough of a lead there to consider\nThis one to be leaning Democrat at this point ah and let's see we've got to New Jersey and Wisconsin and leaning Democrat as well so if if it's all leaders you've got\nForty one forty three\nFive for Democrats so I mean it's pretty it's I don't think the Democrats are going to win the Senate\nThat is a lot of starting to look shaky it's moving in the wrong direction it is moving in the wrong direction over the past few days the polling has not been good I mean Florida was discouraging I think for Republicans in the past few days Montana's not turning around\nYou know we've seen no signs of real movement I don't think in West Virginia as well which was a big culprit pick up again this was a state that voted for Trump by thirty points and Joe mansion I think he you know\nI think he's solidified his seat there with his pro Kavanaugh vote yeah um but in the opposite with North Dakota and hide camp I think she's done um but\nAs of right now I think you can say pretty solidly that there's that the majority right now is going to stay with a Republican but I mean again Missouri in Indiana are slight leaders were moving these days I Would normally keep those in the top the category but for a week away and we got to pick at some point\nAnd we also are I mean we're in the election right now yeah I mean people are voting all across the country right now uh it's no longer a one day event okay I'm going to take a quick break then come back and give us some of those results on the house terms\nThat lecture and by numbers\nOn the Glenn Beck program\nAll right I

[noise]\nUse radio five WHYY and [noise]\nHey Glenn Beck program [noise]\nWelcome to the program Mr pat gray who ah precedes this program on the blaze radio and television network a and also has his a podcast that you can listen to and download at your leisure and welcome to the program Patt big news of the day to you is\nI Would say the possibility of the president issuing an executive order ending birthright citizenship take problem well problem it's an executive order I agree with\nThough [laughter] so you're all day with it yeah whatever [laughter] isn't that the justification yeah it is the justification I think what would happen is\nIt would be challenged and then it would go to the Supreme Court which finally okay force of the Supreme Court to rule on that the teeth amendment is not about is not about illegals coming you're dropping babies and having them be citizens\nI don't know what it's about no this was clearly again I said yesterday\nEverything after the tenth amendment basically is a read a ration is just to reiterate what did you not get this yes blacks we mean black people to\nCarry that right on the thirteenth amendment fourteenth amendment is oh Gees okay and they get I'll stop it yeah you're gee you literally\nDemocrats knock it off ... ... yes their children are citizens to yeah that's what this was right this is not about coming over here and having a baby and then you know as sneaking in cross having a baby and then being able to bring all your family here ludicrous that what that was ...\nAnd so it's been an interpreter now all this time right but you can't you can't you do it with an executive no\nBut if he's doing it with an executive order so it's challenged and it goes right directly the Supreme Court on kind of okay with it yeah\nAnd that's I think that's what would happen yeah um because they will challenge it they\nWill challenge it and I want I I ... I Hope that there's a way to challenge it more than just because I\nConstitutionally I think no the president can take issue an executive order that goes against the constitution but I Would like more than that I Would like them to rule on what the fourteenth amendment actually means\nSeems to be a disagreement among even original is with the constitution as to what it actually means or whether that's included and it will be internally there is yeah I think that would be interesting to see like how that shakes out because you know one of the things we praised Trump about relatively endlessly is I have been hit the job he's done with the courts\nSo he needs to the judges he's put in\nWould now rule on this and with there being some level of debate even among original is whether this would be allowed or not it was just going to be fascinating yeah it does happen imagine Chuck Schumer and uh and Nancy Pelosi riding up\nThat brief as a friend of the court come in and say no no judge Kavanaugh we we really believe it is that guy has got to be a Superman to not ... not at least think oh\nReally I mean you can usually come with a Pittsburgh shooter and say no really he did it he is really really bad you know we need to incarcerate him not even though we need to incarcerate him and he was you know there's got to be a part of it but just goes\nOh that's what you want [laughter]\nSpeaking of which is interesting to see a everybody bending over backwards in the mainstream media and a lot of the Democrat leadership tried to pin the Pittsburgh shooting on Trump the most pro Israel pro Jewish presidents we've ever had in the history of this country and he's responsible for this it's pretty amazing\nIt is ... ... you know what can we play we play just a couple of things were said listen to this this so far they have gone so far they've gotten here's here's Joe Scarborough and what she had to say listen to this\nMake um [noise]\nPeople get to make a decision is this the America they want to live in\nBecause right now the only constitutional check against this sort of a ... that guy really a guy who was sending a message by time and time again tweeting about baseball we're talking about his bad hair day there that was done intentionally to send a message\nTo white nationalist says about me that much\nWith them I'm going to watch a baseball game I'm going to tweet about baseball World Series\nAnd just not that I'm I'm not going to let it occupy my day", "show_name": "The Glenn Beck Program", "year": "2018", "city": "Springfield", "day": "30"}
