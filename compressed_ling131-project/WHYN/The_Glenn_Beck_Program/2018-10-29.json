in the Soviet Union they couldn't eat kosher they couldn't become rabbis they couldn't live as guarded commanded them for them this is the story of the Jewish people just survive\n\nThat's why the nation of Israel exist if people don't understand that is why no one ever wants them no one ever stands for them they're always the last in line and so the world\nJust cited let them have this scrap of land they say well is there is because of the Bible let 'em have it\nIt's uninhabitable it's it's just nothing but a desert there's no oil there's nothing there just give it to them\nAnd the Jews happily took it restored to their homeland as the only nation on earth to be wiped off the face of the map and then to be restored to two thousand years later exactly as foretold\n\nIsraeli exists because no one seems to want them Israeli exists because they have a right to live\n\nSo let me go back to Russia and our musical friend\nIn Nineteen eighty nine forty years after the battle of Stalingrad the Hebrew immigrant aid society was helping Jews get out of the Soviet Union and go to Israel and to the United states and they provided lawyers money to find homes food even language classes to help them assimilate in their new country\nFor the first time ever\nGregory and the rest of the Jews that he had known that had survived both Hitler and style and could concentrate on something more than just surviving\n\nThey had a right to pursue their happiness they could practice their faith\nCould be proud\nOf who they were they could finally live\n\nThe group that saved him the Hebrew immigrant aid society it's the oldest refugee assistance organization in the world let me say that again it's the oldest refugee assistance organization in the world\nIt was established in the Eighteen hundreds and they're responsible for assisting thousands and thousands of Jews and a few years ago they open up their services not just to Jews but people of all faiths all faiths that are persecuted and need to be rescued\n\nTheir currency a CEO was asked recently why they decided to do it\nHis answer couldn't be more perfect we no longer\nHelp refugees because they're Jewish we help refugees because we are Jewish\n\nReason why I'm telling you the story is this is the organization that mad man went into Philadelphia\nTo try to stop\nThis is the organization that was attacked on Saturday morning at the tree of life synagogue\n\nStory never seems to end the eleven people were killed in the deadliest attack on Jews in our country's history\n\nStories like Gregory filled the synagogue that Saturday morning the horrors that collectively endured unimaginable to most people and yet here we are\nAgain\nThe group of people who now have to concentrate just on one thing survive\nAnti Semitism is evil anti Semitism is a disease\nAnti Semitism is as old as the world\nFrom the moment God said I Will make you my people there has\nBeen anti Semitism and it is on the rise as it always is in times of nationalism and socialism every time the Jew is the canary in the coal mine they are always the first\nAnd if the world doesn't pay attention at that point it's washed in blood\n\nIf the world decides they need to come for the Jews I proudly declare myself a Jew\n\nThe world makes promises all the time and they don't ever intend on keeping them\nBut I Do\nWe said never forget\nI told you you are the audience that will in the in our store the republic save the republic and it's not going to be through violence the world is going to become more and more violent\n\nWe must be a unique and peculiar people because the vast majority of Americans know this is not who we are\n\nThis is not who we want to be\n\nAnd we will stand shoulder to shoulder with our Jewish brothers and sisters\n\nWe will stand shoulder to shoulder with her Christian Brothers and sisters in the middle east\nWe will stand shoulder to shoulder with a Muslim that is being rounded up by the Chinese\n\nThe cycle of hate has begun again and it's not Donald Trump and it's not ... rock Obama\n\nIt's a cycle that has been running since the beginning of time\n\nAnd the world always acts the same way because it always comes in a time of chaos it always comes in a time of fear\nIt always comes in a we cycle when the forget the individual it's what's best for all of society it's why\nOur founders came here in the first place it's why our founders defended the Jews\n\nWe're a different country we're a different people we're not better than the rest of the world\nWe just see things differently\nAnd if we don't shame on us\nOur pilgrims came here thinking that they were completing the journey from the red sea our first great seal of the United states was the pillar of fire and pharaohs horses and the party of the red sea\n\nI don't want to just survive I don't want to\nDo something to earn a living I Want to live\nFDR said\nThis generation has a rendezvous with destiny\nI echo those words\n\nOur generation must be the generation that breaks the cycle\nThere is no one else in the world who will do it who will stand against this onslaught who will stand against their hatred in nationalism and the and the the collective wisdom\nThe extermination of people that just aren't good enough\nWe are headed that way we are headed that way once you cannot talk to your neighbors once the other side has nothing to offer you have to eliminate them because they're the devil\nThey're the devil and\nYou cannot deal with the devil\n\nWill the sixty to eighty percent of this country stand up\nAnd also seems like by all uh understanding of him right now she was just an utter failure in life right for a million other reasons but I mean I don't feel that he's getting absolutely what he deserves it absolutely but I ... I could see what you're saying there\nYeah he was just I mean he was he was a you know a a a misfit his entire life I mean he's he is the quintessential example of a guy who goes out and kills he's he's mad at society because he's never felt like he has fit in\nAnd look how the press just they do they made this and that Donald Trump made this ended Donald Trump\nSo that one is at least you can draw a line from the idea that he is not that he was at the rally it's not Trump's ... you know fault or anything but like at least he was a Trump supporter\nBig the guy who did the shooting at the at the synagogue to try to do the same thing he outwardly hated drum outwardly hated him he posted on social media about how he was really just assisting the Jews\nOr that he that people thought he talked a good game but in reality he was helping Jews and I and we need to stop it he hated the guy said don't try to turn it it is\nIf a giants cartoon safe fell on Donald Trump today and he was removed from the earth mhm\nAll these problems would still exist this is not Donald Trump Donald Trump is a symptom there is a sickness in our society\nOur political system is nothing more than a reflection of us\nAnd people are alone they're tired they're afraid they don't want to be stuck in the middle between two parties that are blaming each other for everything or blaming them\nYou know why America is a little upset right now they're tired of being blamed they're\nOut here Boston their ass they're out here working every single day trying to raise their kids trying to figure out how to navigate and keep their children safe while in a prison system called school that is teaching\nAnd on doing everything that most parents believe\nThey come home they're tired they don't know how to solve it they're overwhelmed society is just pouring into their house with with the media and social media\nAnd then they have to sit and they have to watch people screaming at each other on TV\nAnd there's nobody actually answering questions there's nobody actually offering us illusion none of these things anybody is talking about is the solution is just blame the other side and most Americans are tired of it because they're the ones getting blamed\nThey're the ones that are racist they're the ones that are massage and ... they're the ones excuse me we're just outta here bussed in our rafts trying to make a living well you freaks\nAre limited high on the hog on our\nTax dollars I'm Sorry I'm Sorry but the the what's happening in our society is a symptom\nWe are unfortunately sick\nGreenfield use traffic and weather station radio by sixty\n...\nGood morning nine thirty in the W.

Trump's fault like that Joe Lieberman on this morning\nAnd Lieberman is like you know sort of very slowly gradually but he's like you know did he he didn't go there to help with today is the first question was ah you know\nWhat about the what's going on you know give us your opinion and he's like you know look I live in a country as a Jew where I was basically anti Semitism free my entire life I ran for president and senator\nI I was I was a winning center in a state with two percent Jewish population and uh I never felt some anti Semitism my entire life\nHe he's like you know we have to make sure that we don't we don't have that blah blah blah [noise] this is a terrible tragedy then they're like well\nWhat what what part of of that you think is is the the climate of today and and and and Lieberman to his credit was like look first of all we need to make very clear that this shooter\nA outwardly heated Donald Trump\nYeah we do not like Donald Trump he was not a fan of Donald Trump or has nothing to do that don't tie\nHim to be a ... more broadly we do have this problem with with with discourse and I think that's true I mean I I think that's obviously true that the overall our discourse is pretty terrible at the moment but again has nothing to do with this and all these cable news networks are obsessed with telling you that it does mhm they're obsessed with telling your wife well\nWe don't want us to blame it on a do Trump I'm just saying it's Donald Trump's fault\nRight [laughter] that's really is really that's what they're doing never said that about Bernie Sanders Bernie than ever that guy was working for Bernie Sanders' campaign and he went out and he shot all of the geo ... and another guy and tried to tried to trying to kill thirty Republican seat\nThat's tenth of the Republican paint on was working for Bernie Sanders yeah never said that was Bernie Sanders fault\nNo we never said that and neither did I say ... today yes of course not but they didn't even talk about it because they\nThey had a very balanced view of that one re understood that individuals who are responsible for their own actions that time that's where I understood that then they just don't understand it now because now which is not benefit them in and they always complain about this course isn't that a great example of terrible discourse yes\nWe can sit on both of these things right when if a Republican and now the python think thing thankfully didn't get anybody hurt\n'em but you know we did see that ah with with the Brennan Center situation\nBut both situations we said the individual is responsible the discourse is is is an interesting aside because overall it's not healthy for a country but it's got nothing to do with these individuals shootings and I'm going to do with it and you do not ... discourse does not commit murder doesn't happen\nSo the reason why Rob ... pat him this morning is because uh you know or he sees doing more on trivia and uh and pour a trivia is that is always a laugh and so we wanted to find out how it went on friday a pet uh", "show_name": "The Glenn Beck Program", "year": "2018", "city": "Springfield", "day": "29"}
