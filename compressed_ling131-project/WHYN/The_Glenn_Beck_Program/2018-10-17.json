couple of days and and the bill is going to come in and give us a rundown of the week so far and we have a lot to discuss one of them is Saudi Arabia this story is just getting more and more bizarre\nLet me bring you up to speed in case you don't know\nThis story started a couple of weeks ago with this idea that this Washington Post reporter is suddenly missing well he's not a Washington Post a reporter only\nHis name is Jim ... and uh he is a Saudi Arabian citizen he is also a member of the Muslim Brotherhood\nHis beef with Saudi Arabia in his own what he called self imposed exile is all about the Saudis\nNot befriending and not I'm not excusing the behavior of the Muslim Brotherhood the Saudis are very clear that the Muslim Brotherhood is a terrorist organization and not a friend to Saudi Arabia or really any one in the world\nSo he went into self imposed exile or and he came here to the United states are there are claims that he is he he was still a Muslim Brotherhood operative there are also claims that he was feeding us information\nOr a a a against the Muslim Brotherhood I'm not sure which\nTo believe at this point so he's overseas he's in Turkey and he is going to get married but he's been divorced to his wife in Saudi Arabia\nFor him to be able to get remarried he has to have a a divorced certificate from Saudi Arabia\nThe Saudi Arabia and say well you're going to have to come into the embassy to get it now he is not a friend to the Saudi Arabian prince\nThe one who has been this big reformer and he is going to you know take Saudi Arabia end of the future and he is good for women and he is good for human rights and everything else\nIs shockey is not popular with that prince and that prince has not been popular with ... the he had been trying to get Chicago as a shaggy to come back to Saudi Arabia but ... knew I Would probably be a death sentence to me\nHe takes his fiance they get into a car and they uh drive up to the embassy the Saudi embassy in ...\nHe says I'm going to go in I'm going to get the paperwork they're expecting me I'll be right back out wait for me so she did ours pass she starts to call the embassy she calls his phone no answer\nNothing\nAs it turns out a Saudi Arabia first denied that any of this happened\nUm but uh we now know that they are about to admit we don't know to what extent um but\nIt looks as though he was interrogated tortured and killed he was then hacked into pieces and thrown onto a Saudi plane in suitcases and what happened from there we don't know\nNow there's an additional update today we have our secretary of state over in Saudi Arabia meeting with the king and the crown prince who are now saying privately that yes this was just somebody who went rogue\n... but it's kind of hard to believe\n\n[noise] the new information today and how is this coming from turkey so we don't know if this is true or not\nThere were two stories or one of the United states came out pretty quickly or last week when this story broke and said we have evidence that this was ordered by Saudi Arabia and he is dead\nUm but they never released where that came from they just released that this was a U.S intelligence sources say\n\nThat was the first Nick then the the Turks came out and said that they had audio and video tape of this man's interrogation torture and killing\n\nI don't know if they do there is a possibility that they have microwave technology that could listen if\nThe Saudi embassy was not a prepared to deal with that kind of surveillance you can get that kind of audio from inside of a building\nBut there's also another story but this actually audio arrived first with his fiance because he had an apple watch\nAnd when he went in he turned it on and it recorded and when it finished recording it just uploaded to the cloud and downloaded to her phone I Hope to God that's not true\nFor her sake I Can't imagine especially since we now are getting the story that this audio that we don't know yet if as if it exists includes his interrogation\nAh and then uh the the execution ers come in and the a head of the embassy said you can't kill him you can't kill him in here or I'm going to get into trouble and the what's described as the path all adjust\nOr from Saudi Arabia the guy who was in charge of killing and disposing of the body apparently said to the head of the embassy or if you want to live you'd need to get outta here right now otherwise your next\nThey knocked ... on conscious and he was unconscious for a while then you hear them apparently starting to\nGet all of the tools and everything ready in the room ready to uh start to chop him up he is still alive when they are ... him and apparently it is a gruesome gruesome tape\nWe again don't know if that is true\nThis may be an Archduke Ferdinand moment down the road this may be the thing\nNow is the time and wherever you are is the place\nThe citadel makes it easier to earn your
