we're seeing mobs start to form here it is\nI Believe it's the overreaction of a left when you see people like Ted Cruz getting chased out to restaurants by a mob oh you're not going to use the word totally a mock it is without a\nDoubt that there's no other way it's going to put a stop to it on the mob is what we saw in Charlottesville, Virginia to oh I think I Know what we saw chasing we've right what about the people\nWho were at the Supreme Court banging on the wall what do you call that civil protest or is that a mob I think it's easily along yeah and if there was a party or as we call it a mob pressure come on\nI ... I mean because I saw lots of\nTea partiers going to the Supreme Court in banging on the on the walls and by the way I have plenty of Supreme Court decisions that make me want to hang on the walls of the Supreme Court right but we don't do those things because we're supposed we're supposed to be in a civil society\nRight trying to remember I'm trying to remember all of the people the tea partiers uh chased down with their children you know and the homemade signs how many people they chased down in restaurants and surrounded and not think of one exam in fact\nIf you want an example of this what did dancey below sea do during the health care bill she and a was a John Lewis\nMarched out in to the crowded in to the crowd trying to get them to do that and they wouldn't do you remember where they tried to get them to be violent they said all kinds of crazy things\nThrow gasoline all over them\nAnd then they linked arms in March bravely through that crowd when they didn't have to they were trying to get the Tea Party to become a violent mob they didn't can you imagine what would have happened\nIf Donald Trump and Brett Kavanaugh would have linked arms and tried to walk through the crowd in Washington DC you would not have been pretty it would not have been pretty\nAnd by the way I mean you know you can talk about some of these things I mean ... ... that's not a mob there like ... cities and they're taking over that's the I shouldn't say that's a riot that is why it by a mob yeah did you define mob please look it up in the dictionary find out\nLet's let's make sure we know what we're talking about mob\nMob a large crowd of people especially one that has this orderly and intent on causing trouble for violence okay and and the quote is a mob of protesters that their usage so is this not a disorderly\nCrowd of people that are trying\nTo what the incandescent on causing truck in tents on causing trouble I mean I guess if you think\nWell Brett Kavanaugh's a terrible person and stopping him is good so that's not to I was in trouble I mean if you got to go down that road I guess in that that doesn't does it say there and unless you're right it just says intent on causing trouble right it doesn't say\nYou know ... with an exception of those who are absolutely right what what I'm saying though is that the media does not see harassing conservatives as causing trouble correct that is the issue correct they see this as a parade feed it says like the you know there\nIt's basically a you know charity we're at right I mean they're they're doing good for the people you're stopping\nThese evil or old white people who have names like Cruz\nOr that you know [laughter] things but uh yeah I mean they are by the Irish guy who runs his own or\nLet me tell you what he saw white people he's older white people do ya [laughter] you know really bad oh really [laughter] okay\nSo let's listen to a couple of things first we have CNN we just played oh you're not going to call it a mob BS I'm going to call it a mob a now here's Maxine Waters trying to say we're trying to redefine protesters mob rule here to\nProtest is guaranteed to a democratic society we know that this is guaranteed to us about the constitution they're trying to change\nThe description of protests and call it a mob well no this president is the poster boy for what a mob a protest that looks like he do matter of\nFact he's the one who has been violence in his speech he's the one around things like this I lacked punch him in the face Trump said that at one of his rallies he said knock the crap out of them oh what'd you and seriously okay ...

H. Y. N. in the thunderbirds radio network present the Springfield ... free game show\nAn in depth look at your thunderbirds tonight's opponent and what's happening around the American hockey league now with a preview of tonight's game here's the voice of your Thunderbird Ryan Smith [noise]\nThe light at the end of the tunnel is near for the first three and three weekend for the Springfield Thunderbirds on the twenty eighth team wanting Nineteen season and it ends with those first two fourteen matchups with their division rivals the Providence Bruins a matinee up there on the Sunday inside them ask mutual center second home game in two days for the team ...\nMembers of victims form of hospitals six points in their first free games have yet to lose in regulation science but still\nThe memories in a bitter pill to swallow in last night's five to four shootout waltz into the hands of the Lehigh Valley fan of a chance when they get right back on the horse load today against the Bruins my name is Ryan ... for a second straight day I Am joined us\nBy phone numbers forward balmy ... it was a pleasure having you last night we decided was good enough to bring you back on day number two and a chance for your guys and your teammates\nDown there at ice level to sort of wipe the slate clean from last night and boy they are going to get one major piece of help on the back end of things as Jake McDonald mix of the birds they be\nAbsolutely briefly touched on that last night but you know it's a tough loss um last night but to be able to come back in less than twenty four hours and be able to get back out there is huge in that um edition of victim McDonald's is going to help tremendously\nMacdonald we'll be wearing number forty seven in the white sweater for the ... ... what a great story for him a couple of seasons ago he was an easy AHL regular\nHad to fight to get regular AHL minutes as recently as two seasons ago only does last season with the ... twenty in the seeds in the in the J ran out of the only two AHL defense men to do that since the year two thousand eleven to give you an idea of just how big of an accomplishment that is if this level\nAnd he will immediately I Would have to imagine the deployed in a number of different situation particularly on the main event\nAbsolutely he's a guy who's really worked from the bottom earned everything\nThat he got in his career is awesome to see him get his first NHL going percentage they'll opportunity and you know you're talking about a guy like rented that you saw last night you see a lot of the similarities I'm In a Jacob McDonalds and you'll see that tonight and he brings he'll bring a huge part for this often but you know he's reliable defenses well\nOne of the more fundamental differences between those two players perhaps is just a little bit of a science difference with renting a couple of inches taller but what macdonald doesn't have in the Heidi makes up for like being a great move or the puck and an excellent excellent skater you'll see him jumping other us quite a few times this afternoon\nYeah definitely you know like you said the game's all speed skating now and he's you know one of the best in the back in ... she can really you know the the forwards from Providence really gonna have to be on their toes when they finished checked she's going to be ready to take the check and get right into the office as quick as possible and that's going to really open up\nThis game and Jake played in the eastern conference a year ago with thing I'm just so plenty familiar with all the opponents evil see as a member of the thunderbirds this season will be interesting to see how the tea birds trying to bounce back on a power play and Bobby we touched upon and off the air a few minutes ago\nYou're not frequently going to have nice on the power play where your five or seven like the fevers were on friday in Allentown you're also not got many where you're over eight on the power play like last night\nWhat do you think ... message to the group is to try to find a medium of little balancing point 'cause it looked like on friday the emphasis was on TALK of the night with ... and last night maybe getting a little too with some passing I agree\nWith you as a little bit of a Jekyll and Hyde type of performance there by the thunderbirds but you know that to happen throughout the Seventy six team season I think what's most important is a you know I think the Phantoms made a great adjustment last night and in the neutral zone and it didn't allow it to get into\nThe zone quite as easily I think there needs to be an adjustment made a to come in with a little bit more pace and attack off the rush when there but also when you get in on\nTo simplify Noyes said all the time but I think it's important to get talks and body than that like you said early and start to get Providence running around a bit more of those shots\nBe a Providence scene that comes in very hungry as well because they have not gotten off to the stores that they are used to getting off to in recent years the ones who games against the birds open last season slate of games this year though it's been a little bit of a struggle for Jae Lee just seeing they lost a lot of weapons\nFrom what do you lose Kenny I guess being on all things aren't those two are two players who were MVP candidates each of the last two years and I guess the former MBP in these leaks they're relying on a lot of young players up front that try to fill the void left by those do but one man that they do still have in their line up\nTwo of them actually who have been kind of Springfield men is is the last couple of seasons have been Jacob forced by a car open in Jordan ...\nYeah I mean you lose ... you know in Darnah guys like that are you there real game changers obviously in a in the American league and he lost those two guys and so it's obviously the first four games to the Bruins have been trying to feel things out and they've been you know obviously shifting around a certain things and\nYou know Jordan so Schwartz comes in and you you can't have been a thunderbirds gilly like you said and Jay is well so they have all the tools you know and they're just kind of those beginning a season was those kidnapping sometimes you're going to be the you know get hockey team here today\nWith Boris Becker Carlton Thirteen of his thirty two points in his rookie season came at the hands on the Springfield Thunderbirds and I'm Sorry for bringing up possibly possibly traumatic memories or you Bobby probably on the ice for you and\nWhen we return to look ahead into the match up with the birds will avoid one other normal Springfield killer in Providence that tonight it will not be McIntyre this afternoon instead it'll be Twenty one year old damp dark we'll preview a goal tending matchup up to Twenty one year old on the other side on every talk he has brought you buy an GM Springfield\nHe Thunderbird fans are you in the mood for a great value bit just a Ninety nine restaurants today and score big with their nine real size entrees for just nine Ninety nine they're big hardy portions you can count on all day every day\nLike their hand breaded chicken parmesan or their ... stacked on top of main rocket mashed potatoes before or after the game made the great meal and

changer today at the age of ... dot org backslash game changer and we'll see you on game day [noise]\nOf the same time we've seen on a Sunday night\nIn Springfield Thunderbird looking to pick up standing points in airport consecutive game to start the season far cry from the host the start of a season or go so\nThat's one way I was like well do you buy me for them that's one way that you can try to spent last night into a little more of a positive light for points\nIn the first six games of course a lot of people feel like there could have been ... even six on the table by this point but as you said still a lot of\nWays to go on the season and as you can hear mentioned last night in his post gave it's not something he wants to white clean from a memory back and I thought that was an interesting way for him to put some coaches might of the of the mindset new slate clean slate tomorrow but\nWith ... matter of not forgetting what happened in that situation so that you're prepared for it moving forward to the next situation when you have a lead my third\nPoint I don't think it's something that you ... but I think it's something that you know seizing a memory bank and you learn from talking to do the guy's last night and it's one of those things when it happened during the season you can see it but it's also a valuable lesson\nFor a lot of the young guys really seem to learn and grow from so in saying that you take the positive you start to see them that they have so far\nAnd you're you're already well ahead of the curve for so they can figure that today if I wanted to point\nAnd that in a three and three flight this early on in the season I don't think anybody looking back at Wednesday of this week looking into once a week I could bring I don't think anybody would turn down five of possible six point there's always that production\nIf you want to fix and I don't think you and I are any exception to that but it's certainly a situation that is more on the positive and negative the spark a couple of other changes ... this afternoon Patrick ... comes out of wind up in big bruising Tony ...\nComes in if nothing else I think we see turns out there because of something\nThat may have occurred with you in the free things in between these two teams there might be a little bit of blood between these two clubs it's interesting though because I found in the last year and a half in this division it seems like the real bitter animosity rivalries we've seen those was for it and when we I valley for some reason Providence [noise] in a lot of games it's been rather than have you noticed\nYeah rather shame I guess and I think you know depending on going with you in mind that you do some things might get a little bit\nMore out of control and other times but I think ah bringing\nA guy like only turn down through Sunday game is a huge stink from an energy standpoint both teams are on the back end of a three and three here you need some fresh blood\nYou need a new energy I think McDonalds and a guy like Tony ... really is dressed up on the porch and conflict somebody through the glass is huge bringing on Sunday\nLet's put it this way people know when Tony turns on his approaching them on the floor jak when you're a defense been turning your back you know where Tony version is or else you could\nBump there from dried in on TALK of the far side
