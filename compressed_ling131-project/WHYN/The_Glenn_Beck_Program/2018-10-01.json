of California into the formerly great city of Detroit\nAnd a\n... year in rent ground\nI got something last night have you seen the copy by the way how close do have you seen the a copy of um of a\nRitual Mitchell's memo yeah I'm reading a little bit about it okay pretty amazing this is really amazing now she remember Rachel Mitchell is the Maricopa County sex crimes prosecutor she is the one who interviewed um Kavanaugh's accuser ah Christine afford\nShe was the she was the woman that was made fun of on Saturday Night live this weekend\nShe well she was a highly respected advocate for sexual abuse victims she's twenty five years experience she's not political at all in fact she was recognized by Barack Obama is head of homeland security as the a sexual assault prosecutor of the year let me say that again\nThe woman that the Republicans selected to dig in and find out whether or not Dr Ford's claims were legitimate or not\nWas Brock Obama's head of homeland security sexual assault prosecutor of the year\nSo she's not a democratic hack\nAnd also not a defense attorney right she's a prosecutor yes she tries to prove these things true she goes in her expertise is\nOn old crimes\nTo be able to go in and say All right how did this happen and be able to put it together to make sure that the prosecution can win\nAll right\nBefore I continue and tell you what's in her memo let me just preface it with this we're not going to see any of CNN sock it to be leading with this New York times not going to have this on the front page but it should the reason why they won't is because it is devastating for Senate Democrats\nLeft wing activists the media this is absolutely devastating to you\nI Want you to know if you're easily triggered you might want to turn off the radio for just a minute here's what she wrote quote here's my bottom line\nA she said she said case is incredibly difficult to prove but this case is even weaker than that and quote\nSo I've been saying he said she said that that's pretty difficult she said the same thing that's not what she's saying this isn't even a he said she said case it's weaker than that\nDr Ford identified other witnesses to the event\nAnd those witnesses I'm Still quoting have either refuted her allegations or failed to cooperate them she adds I Do not think that a reasonable prosecutor would bring this case based on the evidence before the committee\nI don't think a reasonable prosecutor would bring this case not to the court not for profit institution but before the committee\nNor do I believe that this evidence is sufficient to satisfy the preponderance of evidence standard and quote\nPretty significant do you think [laughter] again like she's being portrayed as this Republican hacked to go after this uh this poor woman because she was a girl ... yeah Iraq Obama's ah homeland security prosecutor sex crimes of the year they picked someone who should have incredible amounts of credibility ... with a left\nYes so\nShe's saying that it's it's it ... won't stand up in court wouldn't no prosecutor would even bring it and know prosecutors should even bring this to the committee this explains in my opinion\nWhy it was leaked in\nThe final hour\nBecause every one who saw this knew exactly what it was\nNow she explains why\nShe says Ford has significantly changed her story several times in recent months in ways that are shady have not been explained and defy common sense\nOkay wait a minute it may look like she's credible ah but based on what she said not how she looked\nIf you're looking at what she said her story falls apart the most glaring issue with Dr Ford story is that she has given for different dates for when the attack occurred\nAnd we're not talking about the difference of a few days according to this is this is from her memo according to the Washington Post the twenty Thirteen notes from a therapy session lists the attacks have having occurred when she was in her late teens\nFast forward five years July sixth of this year in a text message to the Washington Post reporter Ford said the attack happened in the mid Nineteen eighties\nThis would be consistent with their therapists notes since Ford was born in late November sixty six and would have been in their late teens from Nineteen eighty four through Nineteen eighty six\nBut then something changed three weeks later in July thirtieth letter to Senator Dianne Feinstein office the date of attack changed to the early eighties\nYou might say what difference\nThat may well if you say you're in your late teens sixteen Seventeen Eighteen Nineteen you're in high school so you're Seventeen or Eighteen late teens you've been saying mid eighties anytime you've ever talked about this before it became political mid eighties late teens\nOr why did it change and how did it change within the span of three weeks she changes the date by a couple of years it it gets better this is the\nAgain I'm quoting I'm quoting the um the report\nIt gets better one week later when she goes to take a polygraph test with their lawyers she was asked to write down a statement describing the events in that statement Ford wrote the alleged attack attack happened in the early Nineteen eighties\nBut then something strange happens if you look at her written testimony for the lie detector test she scratches out the\nEarly Nineteen eighties and leaves it the Nineteen eighties perhaps because she knew early Nineteen eighties was falls\nAnd it was fresh in her mind and might set off the polygraph\nThen finally by mid September on her first on the record interview with the Washington Post Ford narrowed the date of the attack down to the summer of Nineteen eighty two so let me recap Dr Ford provided for different dates over the span of a couple of weeks\nUs and Canada are agreeing on a new trade term or a deal that will replace NAFTA it will give us farmers access to the Canadian dairy market us has also
