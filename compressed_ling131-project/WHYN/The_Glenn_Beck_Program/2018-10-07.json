evidence\nFor any of the charges as far as we know we haven't seen anybody emerging say yes I remember that and that is an important part of the story as well\nThat is not just an important part of the story that is the story\nThat is the story and I for one I for one we'll not condemn Ford and I will not condemn\nA Brett Kavanaugh I wasn't there I'm not God there is no evidence they need to vote to confirm and we need to stop the witch hunts [noise]\nYou're listening to claim that program so [noise]\nMy village addicted outrage um there are lots of examples of\nOf why we should really be talking about something entirely different why we should be talking about how do we make how do we strengthen this and spread this around the world right now are dialogue is America's sucks nothing is good everything is bad and that is absolutely not true\nIn the middle chapter of the the book I I ask this question is this worth saving nobody is asking this we're talking\nTalking about getting rid of capitalism changing our whole system changing everything about it it doesn't work no one is asking\nThe question that must be asked first is this worth saving is America and the west good or bad\nIt can be both because people are both but is it on the on the whole has it helped to more people or hurt more people\nWere not having that conversation we are having an now Arthur Brooks is the president of the American Enterprise Institute he's the guy who grew up in Seattle I grew up in the Seattle area\nUm he remembers the first time he saw poverty and I think it's the first time I really saw poverty as well I think it was it was probably the Michael Jackson a\nThat fund raiser we are the world where we were trying to raise money for Ethiopia and we saw these kids with the bloated stomachs and the flies on their face we had never seen anything like that that was a pivot point for Arthur Brooks in his life Arthur welcome to the program\nHey brother Glenn how are you very good viewing months how're you doing\nI'm I'm I Am great great um I I wanted to get you on because we do not talk about what capitalism are and what this country has has done what the western way of life has done and we're just allowing it to be thrown out the window\nAnd you make compelling case because you didn't commit this with politics in mind\n[noise] no I don't you know and and a lot of the things that we're talking about today I was listening to the last segment of your great show [noise] and and you you're talking about this big war this big cultural battle that we're having in those countries or whether it's about the Kavanaugh hearings are about\nThe Trump Administration or about capitalism in general these are really kind of proxy cultural battles that we're having in in our country today it's a culture of outrage you've talked about this a lot\nUm you've done humans work on this important topic and it's important for all of us to remember we are so unbelievably blessed in this country we live in a peaceful society I mean it it's going to ... if you dare you know if you if you can stomach it\nAnd listen to people saying they will file a gas leak things to each other but but let's remember there's going to be known knock on the night there's going to be no jak booted thug nobody's going to take after prison God Bless this country and we have to stop taking for granted the fact that we live in a democratic peaceful society\nAnd we have to stop trashing each other all the time and having the dome proxy wars that's completely unproductive\nSo ... right now I you know the big ideas are being trashed the ideas of freedom of speech or because you know you have to have a safety the safety space all of these all this nonsense\nYeah but also capitalism itself when you saw the pictures back at the eighties of those starving Ethiopians\nIt bothered you and you actually that that set your feet on the course of trying to find out what happened to them right\nIt did I mean the fact that I'm a political conservatives today has everything to do with the fact that I share the objectives of most of my [noise]\nMy my left wing friends and family that I care about poverty in ...\nAnd I started to look for the way that you can wipe out poverty everybody listening to us clan believes\nAnd their their obligation and check their privilege to lift up their brothers and sisters at the margins of American society and and and society around the world what really matters is what works what system works while you sleep I became a proponent of American free enterprise system\nAs a gift to the world because I wanted to do more to help my brothers and sisters and I found that there was one system it pulled people up to billions all around the world these are big issues that we need to be talking about in America today and how we can do this better\nThan you give me some of the stats Arthur I Know you don't know if you have them off the top of your\nDo absolutely so some Nineteen Seventy\nUntil today you know when when you and I were really little kid um that was when the world sort of open up and people started to see what was going on it was really in the seventies but people saw the Ethiopian famine I went to India for the first time when I was Nineteen years old in Nineteen eighty three is starving children it was ghastly\nFrom Nineteen Seventy until today eighty percent of the world's poverty has been eradicated starvation level poverty has been eradicate no Seventy percent of Americans actually think that poverty is getting worse and the reason is because it's never\nLike front page and the New York times or any of the newspaper millions saved from poverty I mean that's not a news story you only see the things that are going wrong but the truth is it two billion of our brothers and sisters have been pulled out of starvation or poverty Glenn since you and our kids\nAnd there was one thing that did that and that was democratic capitalism and that is America's export to the world\nThere I don't think you would disagree with me Arthur um that we are not using the first task of wealth of nations moral sentiments we are we uh we have we think that capitalism is just going to be good no matter\nYou know who's wielding it and and it's just going to produce wonderful things no it as Adam Smith lines out it can produce really bad things as well yeah capitalism depends on the people who are willing ... are wielding it\nBut also uh depends on on what our goals are yeah slow and it's corrupt now would you agree with that\nYeah that's well that's the problem is is not capitalism a lot of what we see today wired deals cronyism all the special stuff that's going on with powerful people in Washington D. C. and in every state capitals around the country\nThat's actually not competition that's trying to shut competition down on behalf of powerful people [laughter] so so competition is good competition politics and economics and then the competition of ideas factors that\nYou know the ... the Glenn Beck show is part of the competition of ideas and a free and democratic nation is very very important [noise] anybody wants to shut down competition on behalf of powerful people\nIs not a competitor doesn't believe in capitalism doesn't believe in democracy doesn't believe in the free exchange of ideas\nTo compete means to do it better than the other guy barely peacefully and respectfully and to win over an audience and that that's really what we ought to be doing and that's what we're moving away from\nOkay so Arthur I'm going to take a quick break and I want to come back with the question I cannot find a satisfactory answer on I Am a big believer in capitalism however there throughout history\nSome people like Vanderbilt et cetera et cetera or they get so much money they have so much power\nThat they are controlling things and it just seems to spiral out of control when you have\nYou know a just a lock on this wealth and we are creating people through Google et cetera et cetera that are doing the same thing how do you balance the power how do you how do you make sure who's who can compete against Google\nHow are you going to do that how does that work when you get to that point to that like to hear your answer on that when we come back\n[noise]\nClan back\nWeekdays at five thirty Easter join us for a brand new program where were\nFired up about the time ever wonder why we to the stories we ... I Want to hear on the way that important for why he just got the things that mainstream media won't touch it was like it's your lucky day you're like me and the\nGuy for our hands and yes and why it matters we wrap\nYou wanted more so you've got the news and why it matters weekdays five thirty only in the police TV [noise]\nGround zero we ... news radio ... W H y in Missoula\nLast summer when bitcoin was down forty\n'em and um and he's got a fascinating life and it was just really searching for answers\nCame to find that capitalism is is what solves all these problems that we have and has made huge huge increases in happiness around the world and health\nSo my problem here is ... and the only loose and I can't tie up is people like Rockefeller that have you know they do something because you know they're ... they they discovered oil and they were smart enough to put it all together\nAnd they accumulate this power and then with all of that money comes corruption and they start to control everybody else's lives and start making all the decisions because they have all of this money how do you\nHow do you reconcile that uh because I don't want to take the money away from people\nRight now I got a glass and you know it is distressing when you see something like a family where there was a patriarch it was a good entrepreneur\nBut then kind of built in load around the castle and that kept a bunch of wealth and the family for six generations and made it harder for other people to rise through crony capitalism that's a big problem that's actually not capitalism that's a different system that's a\nThose basically system over wire deal so you could find in any socialist system any monarchy any place all around the world\nAnd that's something that we have to fight whether it's capitalism more or whatever ... whatever is on whatever economic system that we've got we have to democratize opportunity of the problem is not that we've got very rich people the problem is people have a hard time rising and we have to be putting our resources and our energy in our law in our initiative toward\nPeople that are at the bottom not so they can all get to the top but so that they can get to the middle the essence of the American experience them the moral basis of the American experience is that the the you know three generations ago the Brooks is in the backs\nWere who were just like stretching out potatoes\nSomeplace they're they're nothing more than ambitious riffraff who came to this country and wanted to get to the middle and support themselves and their families and we have to be warriors\nFor system that make sure that people can go from the bottom to the middle [laughter]\nYou know right now it's a very distressing thing you know you go to any good Ivy League university and you're gonna find that there's a system of preferences for legacies you know if you went to university is four or five times more likely that your kid is going to get into that great university which all it is it's just saying you got into the lucky genetics club\nYou know that's that's actually not compatible with with a system of American opportunity with a system of equal dignity of experience so so that's actually what we need to be thinking about don't worry about Google\nWorry a lot more about the fact that people at the periphery of the bottom of our society can't arise today that's that's really an American thing\nAnd why can't they rise [noise] they can't rise because we have a discriminatory system of unequal education were poor kids or or locked into public education system of their parents don't have choices number one number two\nIs we don't have skills training in our communities we tell people that if they don't go to college there somehow losers [laughter] we don't have a vocational and technical education systems which are the ultimate education reform we don't have an apprenticeship system in this country and most importantly glad we don't culturally value\nThe skills that come from actually not going to college for people actually do work skills where they can get when they can get ahead if we do those things we can really recreate the opportunity society\nHow did the printed system go away\n[noise] but went away for a bunch of different reasons but part of it had to do with the fact that you know back in the Nineteen until the Nineteen sixties there was a parallel tracking system in America\nWhere white kids would be tracked toward college and black kids especially in the south will be tracked toward the trades\nAnd and you and I know that one of the great advances in American society was the civil rights movement where we did away with stuff like that unfortunately there were some things are we threw the baby out with the bathwater white kids black kids every kind of kids should have the opportunity to succeed through hard work and skills in Portland issue without going to college\nAmazing or there but it's it's that the early I think of apprenticeships that I think you know you're going back to\nCharles Dickens time since we've seen it it's amazing that those that really disappeared in the sixties and seventies\nWith more Arthur Brooks and is America worth saving that Mm\n... am when\nThis audio is for your review and not for broadcast Internet posting or

back with a Arthur C Brooks he's the president of the American Enterprise Institute Arthur though\nThe ... who is we're talking about is this system even worth saving yesterday in politics it was a nightmare and people are just turned off by it and I think they just don't want anything to do with it um on both sides of the aisle I think anybody who is is a rational human being is like\nThis is this is not good none of this is good um however we're not having any one stand up for the bill of rights the constitution that's why politics has gone awry because we've deep ... you know unpaid from that\nCapitalism is is got a horrible name you now have fifty percent of young voters saying you know socialism is great I Want what they have over in Sweden but that's not what they have in Sweden isn't\nIt isn't and and by the way there are some people standing up for the bill arise in the constitution guys like Glenn Beck and when you've got a major megaphone and you're standing up for what's right and true in good\nThe big problem is that there are too many people in media and politics and entertainment and on college campuses on the right and the left corner or dining out on the fact that we have a culture of contempt in this country contempt for each other\nI mean Glen you and I we both have and everybody listening to us we love people who disagree with us politically that's fine that's a good thing I mean we all should have friends and people that we were just really have to agree with them we should disagree strongly but we don't have to hate it when there are people that are making money and getting famous and getting powerful\nBy trying to get us to hate each other even more we should be talking about these good things that you talked about the things that really bring us together\nAnd then try to disagree in a way that the competition can actually convince other people persuade other people of our ideas but that's the big problem right now too many people are getting too rich\nBy by getting us to hate our neighbors and that's not right\nSo Arthur let's have let's have the conversation I'm I'm somebody in college and I say capitalism is evil and you know there's nothing wrong with socialism socialism is graded works in the Netherlands\nYeah I Know so I hear I hear it all the time we saw him on college campuses all the time they're waiting not to take that on is by trying to create liberal tears that's the wrong way to do it is to attack somebody's motive into say their belief system is stupid\nThat will you can never ever ever insult somebody into agreement and by the way it's an immoral thing to do because these are your brothers and sisters as well\nThe key thing to start off with an any argument is to acknowledge the objective a moral objection to the people is to is to give voice to the fact that\nYou you want these social systems 'cause you want something more poor poor people have more equality where people have more opportunity right\nAnd get people to say yeah yeah yeah okay well let's figure out the best possible way to do it\nAnd then make the positive case for capitalism and democracy and free enterprise and entrepreneurship because it was lifted more people out of poverty in any system in human history it's created a system of of equal opportunity that nobody has ever thought of in the history of humanity and say\nAnd now the problem is not that this is an equal but ... we haven't actually tried to make it as equal as possible and push it all the way out to the periphery of society let's do that together\nCan you give the arguments because most I think even most conservatives um fold on the the Netherlands or Sweden when people say I want socialism like Sweden and you describe what that is\nAs leaders we have an opportunity to help Americans to love their enemies and in so doing to find the basis of our strength\nArthur Brooks thank you so much for being on the program or you have to have you on more often you are a well spoken well thought out full of facts and you're on the right path\nArthur Brooks you can follow him at Arthur Brooks that Arthur Brooks dot com slash podcast you

H. Y. N.\n[noise]\nI Will tell you one thing I was impressed with\nAh was Donald Trump or\nMost Republicans if not all I've seen in my lifetime since Ronald Reagan sold immediately immediately somebody's even bluffing\nAt the table I've got this they fold they don't want to fight they're not willing to fight Donald Trump allowed this to happen and that Kavanaugh would have been completely discredited\nI think under any other president he would have just gone away discredited because they would have said you know what it's not worth it\nWe don't believe those charges and he would have had no platform to defend themselves mhm\nDonald Trump is there one thing to say about him he is a fighter he does not give up and uh\nSo sometimes that's good sometimes that's bad it was very good because I Can't think of any other president in my lifetime since Ronald Reagan that would have stood for this and would have stood against it you\nKnow I the heat surprises me a on a pretty regular basis and I guess I should be used to it by now but um you know that's why that's why people voted for him yeah for for this very reason he's willing to ... he's willing to stand in make this fight because he believes in it\nShe's teaching but what is she teaching\nWith all the ranting she's doing what does she teaching hatred\n\nI feel bad for this woman I really do she goes on these rats quite often by the way\n\nShe doesn't like Brett Kavanaugh she doesn't like President Trump\nThe reason why I bring her up is well a Twitter you got to kick her off are you going to kick her off if this isn't\nIf this if this isn't the epitome of threats I don't know what is\nWhat she really tip advise the [noise] the insanity that has overtaken the left no amount in evidence in favor of Kavanaugh will change your mind and you know what I\nI really I can understand how you might emotionally connect with her especially if you were a victim I can\n\nBut she is possessed with this on ending hatred and there's nothing anyone can say or do anyone who says I Know Kavanaugh\nDidn't do it you're fooling yourself anyone who says I Know he did it you're fooling yourself\nYou're filling in blanks that you cannot unless you're God let me check yep no I'm not God today might be your turn unless your God you don't know that\nYou cannot know that I mean this is one of those cases where it is so crystal clear to me\nJudge less you'll be judged how you judge other people\nI'm telling you\nIf he did it he's out if he was perjuring themselves I don't want a guy on the Supreme Court was perjuring themselves but that requires evidence that requires\nSome sort of of case to be made not accusations\nBut a case to be made here destroying a person's life so you here's the problem with this

I'm Sorry was Gandhi guilty\nWas gundy guilty really 'cause he was a man was Martin Luther king was he guilty you know the\nBoth of those men were flawed both of those women had things about them that I don't like both of those men or they had one was a\nAlleged land or the other was a clear racist gundy I still think they were great men there were just flawed\nWhen you go into social justice and you believe in collective salvation or collective justice\nThat I'm going to right the wrongs of the world because men are collectively evil because of all of the wrongs that men have done in the past they are collectively evil\nYou go mad\nAnd I am warning and begging people to calmly and rationally explain this to their neighbors when you go down that road you always always end up killing people\n\nNow a few years ago that was hyperbole\nBut today if you don't think we're on the edge of a civil war of people like her saying we should feed their genitals to the pigs\n\nTell me the difference between that and Nazi Germany\nRate rhetoric\nAnd what a surprise once again it's coming from the elites in the universities\nIn the\nProgram all [noise]\nIt's really hard really very very hard\nTo [noise] to remain [noise]\nReasonable when the world is unreasonable\nBut we must we must because no one will listen to any message if we are just hurling insults if we are fighting fire with fire it will change no one's mind if you\nBelieve me how many minds did we change did we change the course of two thousand ten and I I Want you to know I don't think that um we did the fight as much as the press\nTried to convince everyone we were these evil monsters saying X Y and Z and demanding violence\nSo I understand that but because of that which we don't necessarily have this time the media has changed its\nNot as important social media is much more important than the regular media\nAll right\nSo\nWhat's the best way to get people to come on our side it's never to point the finger at them it's it's never to call them names and I know this from experience I Know this because\nI'm going to be honest with you I did that to you because I was so convinced I was right\nThat I did that you are you instead I didn't listen to you I just thought you're crazy these are the earth you're flushing down this and that and blah blah blah and you're wrong no no\n\nYou saw things a different way and as I have said on many occasions on this program since the election I was wrong on multiple occasions\nBut what amazes me is when I say those things\nThe number of people who just want to rub my face in it\nThat's okay if that makes you feel better but I just want to tell you that's foolish you do it to me all your wide please don't do that to others please don't do that to others who\nSay you know what I think you are right or you know what I Can't take my own side and and while I don't like your guy that much I mean you guys are at least make in some sense\nBut if if it's the Republicans that cause it I don't know the kind of where I don't think it'll work okay another scenario he is confirmed\nThat house impeached is Trump the house or in peaches Kavanaugh on perjury think that is\nIf they win the house you know they're gonna at least attempt to they will attempt jump and probably Kavanaugh to correct if we lose the house and the Senate these things are happening and there will there was no chance of them being removed but you will have the next two years of non stop impeachment hearings of both capital and Trump\nOK mhm\nThe only one that seems good to me is\nI'm a ...\nIf Kavanaugh loses the vote\nAnd the only one that I think works out is Kavanaugh loses the boat which could be really bad because it will be the Republicans that do it\nUm however Donald Trump comes out and while she says yep that's over here's the guy she ups the ante and you get a guy that all conservatives are rabid about guy somebody who you just know oh my gosh that's a ...\nRight now Brett Kavanaugh has not been a lot of people's favorites I mean they're okay with them but no I was willing to die in a sword for em em remember remember Kavanaugh was not on the initial list of judge right from Trump and there's lots of them he ... them later I personally think the best course of action\nIs to nominate let's say let's say flake and Collins come out and go you know what I Can't do it I'm not going to vote on friday I Can't vote for him great\nDonald Trump with in ten minutes should be on television and say in my opinion Mike Lee is the next a nominee and you know what he's already been vetted for the FBI and every senator knows them\nSo we're going to be calling for a vote next week easy easy you know yeah that that's the thing to do because then you have them battling just on abortion right there at the same place they'd have about everybody correct and that's not going to hurt\nConservatives getting to the polls if if you put a staunch conservative somebody who says yeah I think abortion is wrong and if it comes before me I'll look at the case of course but I think it's wrong I think it's murder\nAnd that and world versus Wade was a terrible decision you then have\nRepublicans running to the polls you'll also have Democrats but I think that to your best case scenario gets Laker Collins\nFlank on coming\nDream among them next week
