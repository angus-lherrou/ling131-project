I think he just he contributed to the Washington Post was he actually is he actually a staff\nMember of the Washington Post columnist wasn't any or he'd written it's relatively new yeah because he left there was a lot of problems over there he realized he might be on the wrong side of whatever internal craziness was going on in Saudi Arabia so that that's fairly new\nAnd you know critics of Saudi Arabia I think have a have a ... first of all places in the American media that is just right like I mean an important that we are able to air those things\nAre but also you know there's a lot of opposition to them\nAnd people don't I mean you know remember Saudi Arabia was like the main uh accusation made by Michael Moore in Fahrenheit ... was it Fahrenheit nine eleven was the one he's made like he's tried to capitalize on that so many times I Can't remember which one it is now but they're in it and I live in the first one with the biggest political documentary of all time\nUp in that was just a giant conspiracy theory about how the bushes knew this guy like they've got to go all out there and they're working with this group is working with the Saudis and was all about defending the Saudis and that's why you you know you don't know the truth about nine eleven\nUm right so this is not a new accusation and when it comes to Republicans working with Saudi Arabia but you know every president has worked with him for a very long time and it's something that we've been critical about four they been our allies since Nineteen thirty three I think\nUh so yeah a really long time and this goes back to the FDR administration so it's not just Trump who's been a\nFriendly I guess with Saudi Arabia certainly Bush was always always accused of that being too friendly with Saudi Arabia but Iraq Obama was plenty friendly with them\nTo exactly I mean they've been allies for a long time and there is no way that Brock Obama would have done\nAnything a severe to Saudi Arabia by this point now there and they wouldn't have done anything about this to a great point and it shows the problem with Ninety percent of the media coverage today the difference there is that they perceive\n... Obama as the intellectual deep thinker\nWho is expensive right I mean remember good I'm bringing Fahrenheit nine eleven again the big one of the other big criticisms of this was Bush was in school\nWhen he found out about nine eleven and he sat there and you let the kids finished the book and then he he took the call and it took him like nine minutes before he ... he walked out of the room remembered this accusation and they they showed a large chunk of it and it was a big deal at the time\nKnow like but they saw Bush as the bad guy who who was who's incompetent Brock Obama wait what was it Seventy eight days when he knew were were Osama bin Laden was before he did anything and it was universally praised for this decision it was the most difficult\nThe decision and five hundred years since the lower than me so it was a tough decision you made since Charlotte Charlotte me to go get the worst criminal on earth\nAh what is is a tough decision in in the minds of people who want to praise the zoo and\nBy the way we made a on about nine twelve two thousand one\nTo kill the guy right you know tens of thousands of military members signed up just to do that yeah they all knew I mean yes of course there is risk in the mission like that but these are this is ... ... talk to any military members especially people who are serving at that time and they'll tell you\nThat was basically the reason I got into it yeah I mean you know a lot of people got in just to hopefully get the opportunity to take that shot\nSo it was not a difficult decision um but Brock Obama was an intellectual thinker he was a deep thinker that was just considering all these options in and weighing all these impossible choices and he finally came to the conclusion to go and and act on this\nThe opposite is what they feel about Trump you know that the fact that Trump is going out there and saying wait a minute let's hold on a second let's get this evidence let's figure out exactly what's going on with investigate this before we act irrationally\nIf for Rocco bomber was doing that it would be seen as he's a deep thinker he's not being reactionary with Trump is that he doesn't care it's all about money and it's all about Saudi Arabia because Jared Kushner like Saudi Arabia or something it's just the you know\nThe the the overwhelming problem is that everybody seems to see everything through the lens of this one individual on our planet\nThey just are completely obsessed with Donald Trump yeah and and I just don't I I Can't connect to that I think as as a person who is a a small government guy I don't want the president to have that much of a role in our lives\nAre just fundamentally whether it's brought about by or Donald Trump but ... you know CNN I think they've made a decision and MSNBC certainly on this board and and pretty much every other media source is that this is this is our this is what we do\nAll we do is talk about every issue and how it relates to Donald Trump this is a man who was murdered\nOr potentially cut up into little pieces maybe by mistake of falling with your own self but something happened there ... and all we can talk about is what does why Donald Trump is acting the way he's acting well isn't there are more of a story here maybe that's the story you run in three weeks when you're looking back at this incident but like\nIs it the story now much more about the details of the incident\nOr and what happened there were still at that age yeah should be\nA breaking news now um Chicago Tribune is reporting the United states just received a payment of a hundred million dollars from Saudi Arabia\nAre\nActually we got it on Tuesday the same day secretary of state Mike Pompeo arrived in Riyadh to discuss the disappearance of the show the\nUm Saudi Arabia publicly pledged the payment to support us stabilization efforts in northeastern Syria so I'm sure that this will be twisted into oh we're not doing anything to them 'cause they just paid as a hundred million dollars\nOf course there are always paying a hundred million dollars [laughter] our relationship with them it is they send us a lot of money and we send them stuff that kind of I mean look at it it's not completely in significant to the relationship right I mean that there there are these considerations\nAnd that is why when you're making a decision as the president of the United states your decision is not solely based on you know what the media wants you to do\nRight like it's about American interests and that should always be the primary choice if what the idea at the end of the day of American interests are harmed long term\nI'm by a decision you might make you have to take that into consideration it has to be your top priority for top priority is not a ... murders in Turkey\nEven less explore couple right\nThe here you have a situation where it is the name is spelled the same but were pronouncing it different at least you can understand that Osama went to summer they shouldn't get a letter [laughter] they just said no it's not an issue it's a you know the guy went from like mid range pick in kick ball to last pick\nI [laughter] like ... when this happened ... the guy is dead\nAnd no one ever ... you know no one ever said you know Osama is wrong it's it should be Usama ... you know will know it just started and if people just started using it\nVery strange it is very strange uh it and like some of it I I guess I understand like for example are here we say the tiny little country that James Bond goes to the casinos Monaco right mhm in if you're over there they call it ...\n... everyone calls it Morocco now I've never heard that I Will say here's another one here we say monster for the car ... if you listen uh as as as a\nCanadian sports celebrity I Do quite often to Toronto blue jays games on the radio they seem as though it's mad stuff Toronto that's ... really irritating I wouldn't get into that I Would say I mean would you be pissed off of you also yeah they'll call us ... that were not as though\nWe are I've also noticed the jaguars are being called jak you what you are on the commercial on a giant you are what\nIt's like they like if you come up with a name on your own maybe you can describe to us what how how it's pronounced\nBut what is the word we already know and when I say you were a hundred years yeah stop it we it's an animal yes and they're not just a car it's an animal to right now what do you ever says jak you are [laughter]\nThe Jacksonville Jaguars or no I think that I think that's jak you are trying to seem refined right like there's like there's something nothing a little snooty about the way they pronounce ... er jaguars like at the that that stupid animal over they're ripping up my dog and this is Jackie why on earth [laughter]\nWould you be gone [laughter] or\nThey're ripping up by a painter and into my dog is terrible I but luckily I felt with my bones on top of it though everything's\nGoing to be okay [laughter] that happens\nIs you know ... three times last week alone for me and it was fifty some for you all over the last three weeks okay
