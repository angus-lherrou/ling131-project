telling you this is one of the top ten\nYou must have been salivating in that I couldn't wait\nTo use this real life story I mean I feel bad for the people that's not to the point and I explain to them I'm going to do this just to help other people\nNot necessarily give away the property in reserve a life a state this is a real life situation right don't do that if you really want to reserve

visit our website\nThey explain ... explain how that works\n\nSure well we're bombarded as you know by all kinds of information and all kinds of media sources or\nA you know people ranting and raving on the radio and television and newspapers and magazines law that stuff is competitive and people are very wary about it you know they they're\nThey're biased detectors or have always working uh you know even even when they listen to their their favorite commentator they're still kind of you know it's you see the human hand\nYou know and everyone knows humans are kind of All right and it out when\nPeople are you yeah of course but when people are using it turns out my research shows other research shows when people are using something like a Google Search engine\nThey turn off the bias detectors they automatically become very trusting 'cause they think this is an algorithm not that they know what an algorithm is but this is an algorithm and I can trust and subjective and impartial so that when Google Answers your question about anything\nAh what what tends to happen is if people trust what's higher up in the list they think the the algorithm has very carefully and objectively selected and it must be true so if you favor one candidate or one cause or one company or whatever it may be one product\nIn search results uh people tend to believe whatsoever closest to the top and\nAnd what I showed him in a series of randomized controlled experiments of it and that we've now done with for national elections involving no more than ten thousand people\nA I've shown over and over and over and over again that by favoring one candidate\nYou can shift in a country like ours millions of votes with no one having this latest idea that they are being manipulated and without leaving a paper trail for authorities to track you know that is scary\nIt is you are you leave this out in the in the um creepy line I'm about how\nGoogle has really stripped itself of all ads and everything else so it it looks totally clean and neutral and\nWithout an agenda [noise] um and then uh how they have ... you know the\n... when you first did it I think one of the tests you did you did it where you you were clear with an agenda then you added one that might go in the other direction and then you added to search results\nOf that would go in the other direction and you got it to a point to where Google is to where you don't have any idea you're being manipulated\nCorrect absolutely no idea of someone we we did this and national a study in the U.S almost no one was aware\nThat they were seeing biased or a search result search for those that favor one candidate that this really creepy thing there was that the very very few people who could spot the bias they shifted even farther and the direction of the bias so you know being able to spot the bias does not protect you\nUh we did a a big national study in India right in the middle of their election there are two thousand fourteen Ninety nine point five percent of people in the study a casino bias whatsoever they couldn't see the favoritism\nUh and and and yet we're still getting these big chefs are in their voting preferences so you know this is this is unprecedented in human history this is this is just this is an ability\nTo shift people's thinking and behavior worldwide it's not just in the U. S. because Google is is you know use a ... you know Ninety percent of all searches conducted throughout the world\nUh you know and and and it was they have the ability to shift people's thinking behavior votes purchases attitudes beliefs\nOr around the world they are doing so twenty four seven with out people knowing and without leaving a paper trail because when you're showing something someone search results I felt like a news story\nThan just stays there for people to look at it's generated just for you on the fly at that moment disappears gone forever stored now where\nWould you is it an overstatement to say whether it's um you know we'll send in Bernays or in World War one\nOr or uh you know ... ... World War two that\nThis is the this is the system that they would have dreamt of for propaganda [noise] [noise]\nOh and this goes beyond their wildest dreams or because it's not just the search results I just published a big article\nA called a can of ways big tech can shift\nMillions of both in the November elections without anyone knowing now that was the one we're talking about which is called the search engine ... factors seem FEMA that's just one of ten ways\nAre that I've identified over the years that I've been studying I'm studying seven of them at the moment\nAh that these big tech companies have to shift votes ... and that are unprecedented in human history they've never existed before uh and they they they're I mean some of these the effects that that that I've discovered are among the biggest ever discovered in the behavioral sciences\nAnd they're ... or ... years and there is no doubt in your mind that Google is engaging in this\nWell into thousands sixteen early two thousand sixteen\nOr working in secret uh I developed a system for actually monitoring what people are seeing while they were using the Google bang and Yahoo search engines that was the election related so it's as if we were looking over people's shoulders\nIt's called the monitoring system and so it was a first ever created\nAnd so we actually monitor for more than five months before the election in November two thousand sixteen\nUh and we found a systematic bias in search results favoring Hillary Clinton whom I favored by the way as you mention\nA in all ten searched positions on the first page of search results now that's\nThat's pretty late and that's pretty extreme wow these leaks these leaks that we've seen recently from Google or you know they're they're they tell us you know that yeah people at Google will have a very strong political preferences and that they act on them\nAnd uh I don't think we should be surprised\nUh that we found that and of course now I'm working with with business partners and academic colleagues that three continents to try to scale up monitoring systems like that so for the first time actually\nBe able to see what these companies are showing people all throughout the U.S and ultimately throughout the world and will will I think be able to make these companies accountable to the public at some point\nUh you know ... we well I Wish we could be fully up and running and time for the midterms and uh at this point I Would say that's not going to happen\nBut we will definitely be there for for twenty twenty and beyond and and we're looking at more than elections because it's there there are lots of ways in which these companies\nYeah well sure but you know ... you know this is this convenience thing over and over and and their products are so good so but you don't realize that these aren't real products they're just surveillance platforms that's the only reason they run them every single service they provide as just another surveillance platform\nAh I Do have a little bit more good news about what does that film that you mentioned the creepy lie has\nA when ... when you had a my ... one of my new very good friends Peters flights are on your show recently though is uh uh he's the one who would who really got that film running\nA it sure wasn't available but now as of right now it is available both on Amazon and on I tense for for rental or sale and it's it yeah and it really is a fabulous film\nAnd builds Google it just go to the freebie lying dot com when you came out about some of this stuff and again you were a Hillary supporter when you came out about this ... were you you were blocked by Google for a time where you are not\nWell when I when my research a first hit the news and the Washington Post a you know I found that starting the next day I couldn't access any Google products they couldn't even access to Google dot com so I have these\nAmazing screen shots that they're just shocking to people because you can't even imagine not being able to access Google yeah but I have three and shot showing getting these time out saying no you know you can't get their sorry\nAmazing okay um ... let's go through some of the uh ... some of the uh affects that you are monitoring we have about about a minute here so why don't you just take one of them on you say there was the\nLast seven ten ten of these that\nYou're following there's ten altogether okay out and all the other okay so let's take on one real quick begin\nVery good when okay here we go this is called the er the search suggestion effect and when you start to type a search term into the Google Search bar you are being manipulated from the very first character that you type\nSo if you type a depending on your history and other things chances are you'll get Amazon right away they'll start slashing suggestion that you and Amazon it turns out is Google's biggest advertiser paying them three hundred million dollars a year and Google sends more traffic to Amazon than any other single source\nBut beyond that we've learned through our experiments that Google can use search suggestions that their flashing asked you to turn a fifty fifty vote among\nA fifty fifty split among undecided voters into it Ninety ten split will buy one having any idea they're being manipulated\nOh my gosh oh my gosh\nOkay we're going to come back and uh and go through the others if we have time he'll talk about some of the other things Google is doing and\nWhat we're supposed to do about it you need to know about it you can see it in the creepy

live from Steve\nAnd I ended up killing one of these hey hey\nUh to publish open access journals that has apparently fairly low are very low um review standards and so it didn't prove what we wanted to prove or didn't even really offer good evidence for what we're looking at\nBut it was we learned a lot of fun it was really fun you know a fun right hum that\nHe misses don't exist but they called all of our problems anyway\nRight out of that um but yeah so we learned our lesson we we\nTook the criticism we got from that to heart ...\nUh it was fun but it didn't work people criticized us I think fairly pointed out where we were weak by using these journals and dead we committed to a few things going into this new project one is that we would not use paid published journals in any sense a secondly\nAnd by the way they don't charge like a hundred dollar they charge like a couple of thousand ... ... it's really kind of a financial racket going on there is some big problem and I hope people continue to address it a secondly we decided that\nUm we would use the highest ranked journals within the disciplines that we're examining that we could get into so we would start at the best rental we could find for what we were doing and then work our way down if that one didn't take it would go to the next one and then thirdly\nWe committed to being transparent about our results no matter what happens so if our if we hadn't gone crash and burn complete failure then um [noise]\nWould have would have been what we report it I don't think it would have gotten much attention but we would have come out and and they did that we were wrong but it's it's not what happened um and uh early on in the process not just to keep us honest because I think we would have kept our promise\nBut early on in the process we ended up in contact with a documentary filmmaker who is interested in this stuff already but he's been recording us for a year and I'm like ... ... and he's been recording us I mean clearly whatever happened is going to come out so there it is\nOK so before we take a break a and get into what you actually got published I'm telling you about the work behind it just took a year to do what kind of time or are you looking at\nWell easiest kind of look at what this is I had exactly five social outings between\nThanksgiving and when uh the project was came out to the public eye took may be that many days off including weekends I work probably eighty to Ninety hours a week almost every week um\nMy two collaborators worked\nAlso very very hard I'm Peter put in at least a fulltime job Helen did most of the same and I talked to hell and the other day yeah\nAh so this was in ... in the men's amount of work it required learning these feel very quickly writing academic papers a typical academic all published a couple of year maybe if they're working hard\nAnd we wrote twenty\nA holy cow\nYeah it's a lot of work there was an insane amount of work and these are all fields we have no expertise and know Helen has a little bit of background in some of this\nBut this was primarily having to learn this material on the fly with no education with no teachers instructing author only feedback was how our papers fared and the peer review process and then reading what was out there to try to emulate it\nAnd so what does what does having something published in one of these the magazines mean what does it mean to the author and to the educational community\nSo for the author it is the absolute pinnacle of what an academic is trying to do and the research died of their career\nIs to get papers published in well established journals are for example hype Asia is one of the journals we got a paper and and I ... is the feminist philosophy journal was probably the higher standing so it would carry a lot of weight\nLooking at the academic community that that scholars and better than so they could take that to their university and say hey I got this many papers published\nIf people are being considered her tenure there is a research component to that depends on how the school wants to do their tenure in process but typically seven papers banning seven to ten years is considered there were the basic research requirement to be qualified for tenure um our paper spanned\nThe ones we wrote spend Fifteen sub disciplines of thought the ones that got accepted spanned seven and so we've got big journals we've got seven discipline of the papers got into we probably would have had more how do we not been a short\nSo there's you know you had to you at twelve in the pipeline that looked like they would be published and then this came out and so you you pulled those but you might have had as many as twelve\nI think honestly we had fourteen that weren't dead yet and I can say with some confidence I think twelve would have gotten in and possibly possibly Thirteen so I Would guess was pretty good confidence is somewhere between eleven Thirteen would have gotten in in the end or do we not gotten old\nOkay so when we come back we will go into and remember we're on we're on public airwaves so so are as careful as we can to to discuss what was

door which is not something we are going to discuss here it's really great rubbing one out\nOf the violence of objective vacation through non consensual masturbation uh then we get to some really disturbing ones um the progressive stack\nJames tell us about the progressive stack\nYeah that progressive stacks of pretty horrifying piece of work and in fact it's evil ah fortunately it does not get accepted the journal was inviting us to re submitted and um give it another go\nIt is it says this is a START I says it's a solid that say that with revision will make a strong contribution to the growing literature of addressing injustice in the classroom\nSo what did argues for is that we take students in college classrooms and we have them go through some kind of a inventory that determines how privileged they are it recommends a thing called step forward step back game as a possibility\nOnce that are turning how privileged they are the students are ranked according to their privilege um then the more privileged few are the worst you get treated in class so the most privileged white and male students are invited\nListen and learn throughout the semester which means they\nAren't

terrible scary idea properly evil and that's the worst part is is it's only a small step from what already exist in a great deal of the a feminist than race based education literature\nSo this was not really terrifying this was not accepted because it didn't it wasn't bad enough\n[noise] ah at first yeah and then later they were a bit concerned with the death of a scholarship and and the kind of routine thing that you would expect out of a scholarly paper they claim for example that we grew on too many concept and it would be confusing for the reader and to try to narrow it down to something a bit tighter\nAnd so on but um but the idea that that giving students experiential reparations and asking them not to be able to speak in class or to be broken over interrupted to teach them what
