only shouting things down\nOr you just out in the street directing traffic\nBecause you feel it's your right well have you even look at what your rights mean where do your rights even come from\nToday I saw I think progress right at whole article about how the constitution has failed that was the headline the constitution has failed\nAnd then\nIt goes on to explain how it is really a slavery document and the three fifths in the constitution all lives all lies\n\nNow you can argue that or we can begin to teach our children you can argue that and you can throw it back in their face with some sort of\nEpitaph or name calling of some sort\nOr\nHere's the question that we all have to answer is America a force for good or a force for bad\nThat requires real thought and discussion because it is neither in my opinion it is both it has been a force for bad and I warn you\nIf we leave the bill of rights we will become the darkest force ever on earth\nWith our technology we will make the Nazis look like rookies make no mistake\nWe have been bad we have rounded up the Japanese we rounded up the Germans and the Italians we rounded up the blacks\nWe told people they couldn't vote including\nWomen\nBut we're also the people that freed the people\nWe freed blacks and we fought for it we fought and died\n\nWe fought to free the Japanese\n\nWe've brought to free the Germans and all of Europe and the world we fought to free Russia from the tyranny of communism\n\nAnd we failed in the time of peace\n\nAre we good or are we bad is the declaration of\nIndependence still a viable mission statement because that's all that is the declaration of independence is a mission statement period\nDo we still hold these truths to be self evident forget how about the past let's talk about the\nFuture we have never ever reached the heights demanded by our mission statement\n\nBut have we gotten better\nIs it still worth striving for we hold these truths to be self evident that all men are created equal that means we're born equal we all have an equal chance\nDon't judge somebody by the color of their skin but by the content of their character\nDo you have\nDo you have everything the baby laying next to you has when you were born\nAs far as human rights and dignity\nDo you still believe that\nAnd I'm not talking about well it's not the way I Am asking you as an aspirational mission statement that is the mission statement of our country do you want to live in a country that's bribes and falls short but picks itself back up again\nDo you want to live in a country that says all men are created equal and they are endowed by their creator why would you have to throw got into it I don't care what you put there\nIt just must be bigger than man\nThe reason why the creator is important\nIs if you don't have something bigger than man then man we'll print and take away rights\nSo if you want to see the moon but he's turning to ease the grave cause most whatever\n\nBut he didn't doused each of us with certain on changeable rights and those rights are life liberty and the pursuit of happiness now there's a lot more and that's where the bill of rights comes in do we still believe in this\n\nAs an aspirational statement we're only talking about the past\nWe're talking about the mistakes of the past\nYou cannot fix the mistakes of the past with out saying\nWhere we're going so where are we going to fall you want to terrorists down there now I read your website I read your mission statement I strongly disagree capitalism is not the problem\nCapitalism that is that has no morals sentiment\nIs but you don't fix that by a state run economy\n\nBy co ops it's always\nSales no you\nAnd your allies in the press refused to point out that that is exactly what you're looking for\nIt's a failed system this one has been this one has failed us because it has been usurped\nThe constitution no longer means anything the bill of rights no longer means anything why because it's not talk to anymore anybody who takes the oath of office in Washington Ninety percent of them are liars not even not even intentional liars\nThey don't know it they don't believe in it they will tell you they do as was told\nTo me by a very powerful individual once looked Glenn we all believe in the constitution but you know you gotta do what you gotta do\nNo no you\nDo not to do what you have to do that the ends justify the means we either believe in this or we do not and that is the question America do you believe\nA neutral half\nAssed not sought out sitting on the sidelines\nAll of those answers mean nothing in the end only those who know it who understand it who have done their homework who can intellectually defend it\n\nThose are the winter soldiers those will be the ones that restore freedom for all mankind everything else is lip service\nThe game and actually a tool\nIn the hands of those who wish to create chaos and destroy all we have\nAn\nAunt that monologue\nIt's about anything so what we need to do is to turn that negative and positive actions like when President Kennedy challenged America you get to the moon we need to turn or negative thoughts and chew the positive thoughts\nWell I don't think it's ever been easier do you I mean we're just ignoring all of the positives that are happening to us I mean you know what a moon shot OK learn must go into Mars twenty twenty five\nI mean what's bigger than that it's just not a national project do we do we need to wrap it up in national money to be able to get excited about the future\nBecause that's what that was all about the moon shot was all about doing things because we can\nDoing the hard things not the easy things I mean that that was just that was the whole goal and it did galvanized people thanks Scotland you know what people don't think about is Nineteen sixty eight\nIs when we went to the moon same years Woodstock Mm\nWow yeah that's weird yeah so you were

I responded\nAh ah to that\nAs a growing member of the fat community\nI find the real problem is when I look at myself in the mirror and I define myself by my body I Am more than my body you can define me any way you wish it's your loss what you say after I Am\nIs much more important than what others say about you\nSo which are we going to be America because of the choice is here and the choices so much more than Donald Trump or Kavanaugh heat is so much bigger than this who are we\nAre we the people that role in the mud and are constantly looking down and ... basing ourselves\nOr we the people that look up\nAre we the people that look to the future\nAre we the people that say I am getting better every day\nI Am part of a\nPositive community that is going to make a difference to ... million\n[noise] Greenfield new traffic and whether the radio I think\nWe ...\nGood morning nine thirty and the W ... here's what's happening the president has apologized to Brett Kavanaugh and his family for the way he was treated during the confirmation process the president under the Supreme Court justice at the White House while it's not\nThe state has ordered national grid to stop all construction work in the state\nAfter a filling worker inadvertently over pressurize the line and that took three hundred homes in wall burn off line over not\nFrom the ... roping signing and windows weather center bodies guys most of the day to day we could see some sun in the afternoon a high will be near eighty partly cloudy sixty five overnight sunny for Wednesday the high will be in the lower ...
