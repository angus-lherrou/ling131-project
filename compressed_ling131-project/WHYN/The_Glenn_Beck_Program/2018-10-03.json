and and we're talking about drafting tips for your medicate income trusts\nTaught you know I keep reading almost on a weekly basis about stories where states are challenging irrevocably trust and Medicaid applications what's up with the increased scrutiny on these trust yeah\nThe problem is that you know many more and more people maybe are trying to draft a more and more lawyers are trying to get into the field that that maybe aren't ready and that's the safest way to say it and and they're putting paragraphs and that that just cause problems if you if you want to put it in English it causes a crack in the ice\nAnd allows them to reach in and you know grab those assets from the trust and it's that bad paragraph that causes the problem and so they're starting to realize that rather than just pushing dates are all\nStates are saying you know we're gonna we're gonna take a closer look at every one of these trust and see if there's a way that we can find a crack in that ice\nAll makes sense now what are what are the what's the result if you lose if you go to a fair hearing and you lose what happens well\nIf you were to lose in the assets basically the assets in the trust that you might have told your clients are going to be protected from the nursing home are no longer protected they would be considered accountable assets\nAnd exposed to the cost of nursing home care so it's a big deal it is a big ... if you lose it it's all about drafting Barry it's all about making sure you put the write paragraphs and the trust folks\nIf you have in Medicaid income trust you may

is the place I don't remember how many years ago was that I don't know [noise]\n\n[noise]\nWhat was it and I don't know how to stop [noise] you'll notice that people are not laughing they are smiling and they are cheering but they are not laughing\nHe's not meaning this is a joke he is instead stating the facts and the absurdity\nOf this case\nAnd people are cheering because finally someone is saying it in his case to give President Trump a bonus points here he's saying things that I don't think any other president would have the balls to do at least no other Republican\nPresident bronco bottom I Would have done this but only\nOnly Iraq Obama in ... if ... you know in the last recent memory George Bush wouldn't have done this Bill Clinton I don't think would have done this he just would have left it alone Republicans\n... never would have done this because they wouldn't still be standing the minute blaze he said\n\nEnding the minute blaze he said I Wanna testify the Republican president would have run I run for the hill\nI get your point I Would point out Clarence Thomas did go through something very good except for raising a Reagan and that was Bush right and that was a new one that was was that Reagan\nNo Thomas was mentioned I didn't want to know wow okay I thought that was Reagan pointed out it usually you could easily see this ... and it's a different era right everyone seems to fold over these things immediately or you know you make one bad joke you lose your job and the audience to the galaxy like ... you know like the ... ... is a different time okay so\nAh he's not mocking he is stating\nThe facts that's what's happening now Trump mocked ... victim ...\nStew I've got a few words for you to look up that I think America needs a refresher course on\nCould you look up victim ... huh\nI mean I think that's definitely one of the word victim Glenn victims in Newtown than by the way we should point out that yesterday around this time we look at the word booth yeah I'm ... trying to do so this is this different court if a little bit a victim that was a one on one class [laughter]\nA person harmed injured or killed as a result of a crime accident or other event direction a person armed killed or injured yeah a as a result of a crime or an accident and okay well the one interesting thing as an observation\nHere Glenn victim is if you call her a victim you are condemning his guilt oh\nYou have already decided the case if you call her a victim huh when you are in a headline for example and you say he ... a mock victim\nWhat your saying is Brett Kavanaugh Kevin always guilty correct so you're saying it without having to say what's your say what you should say instead could you look up the word accuser\nAccuser yes here okay ah accuser accuser a person who claims ... wait this is starting to sound accurate it is a person who claims that someone has committed in a fence or done something wrong okay so in at all sure either her\nAn accuser so he wasn't mocking he was stating the facts of the trial or the or the hearing and a A N condensing the ridiculous ...\nOf the accusers claim\nWe must stop using the word victim\nThey are accusers they may end up being a victim that we can call them but if we're going to presume innocence and I know this is an old fashioned idea if you're going to presume innocence you
