Danny and Steve said we wouldn't be in the world series\n[noise] and now we are [noise] maybe that's the trick [noise] I don't know if we take a moment to think about the men and women of this country

enjoy your retirement you need to get my brand new guy on how to develop a retirement income strategy is guide will help you understand various elements that are critically important to your plant whatever you safe to date has to last for the rest of your life so you're going to want that money to continue to grow over time even when you start drawing from\nTo to a border reforming immigration reform yeah it's just a weird tactic and do it\nThree weeks before an election it's almost like Donald Trump was like hey guys would you be creating a caravan and sending it this way and I what I Will do is that we'll talk about it and it will help us win this election and then afterwards you guys can go back home will pay\nFor your boss I was reading about the makeup of the care of it too earlier um some of them are children with their parents many of them are children unaccompanied by their parents so I Try to figure out All right out in that\nOccur at home did you did the parents just say hey you know what sign for you to walk to the United states\nAnd I want you to walk in that group of people and here's a guy and paying seven thousand dollars to walk you know somewhere in the group with you and you get you across the border is that what you're doing or you just you're in trusting your children to\nWho knows what and where is the personal responsibility of the parents here yeah I mean there's got to be something there is and I think their\nCase would be or at least the case to left would make on their behalf would be a you know things are so bad so\nBad in Honduras Guatemala I mean they can get a lot worse she can be killed or on the way here you could be molested on the way here somebody may not be there on the other side of the border you I mean there's so many things that could go wrong you talk about a helicopter parents I mean that's\nPretty much the opposite direction and same\nThing we talked about this yesterday I you know letting my kid walk who's seven ... the uh the dog up the street not the whole street but part of the street yeah I mean you know hawking over him the entire time makes me as a parent freak out\nI told the story a few times I you know we live in a neighborhood at the at the end of our a block in there there's there's a giant pond there in a green area is a common to the everybody in the neighborhood and when my daughter was sixteen she said hey that I'm just I'm going to walk down to the\nPond like\n[laughter] without your brother [laughter] I Know [laughter]\nWhat do you stop and think about how you know\nPretty protective ... yeah exactly I\nI don't let them walk down to the end of the block let alone hey why don't you walk to Honduras\nWith a group of people that I don't know [laughter] look\nThere are situations you could argue right like if you were in a you know you're in North Korea right and you had a chance to get your kid out you probably pulled the trigger on that whether you ever see them again or not right there's certain level of this and and that's not to say that none of the people in these situations are like this or is there probably are some\nBut it it's just ... you try to it's the same thing with the dreamers right they they try to give you the picture of ... everyone is a four year old who came across the border right in reality like most of them are teenagers most of them were sixteen and Seventeen years old ... ... this is a different it's a different story or and\nYou just want her first of all why you would do this because it's a gift to Donald Trump if you want to talk about hardening the borders\nThis is an easy way to get people together to do that mhm when people hear a story like that it it does not soften their hearts that makes people say whoa this ... you know because the word invasion gets used with illegal immigration or sometimes from people who oppose it or you know in a hawkish matter ... right\nAnd you know like four thousand people are kind of qualified right in the four dozen people coming across the border it whether you like it or not feels like an invasion right it feels like waiting does there just top like they're they're taught the only way they can do anything hears over running but we have right let the overriding the security\nThere and you're you're coming in the right way or the overriding security\nAnd you see that Mexico does not want to deal with this but they know that they're they're not the end they're not the end location so they can let them into Mexico and say well you guys to apply for a for asylum and in six months to come back for that for that hearing and of course they're just gonna keep walking north\nAnd it's interesting how other countries deal with this and yet\nOr the vitriol directed at us for trying to deal with it in just even a fairly reasonable way every time we do worry were hateful\nA war on carrying were racist whereas Mexico certainly protect their border or do you remember what Felipe Calderon said when he came to the United states and he was trying to influence our immigration policy\nOf course if somebody's snakes them from Nicaragua or some other country in Central America through the southern border of Mexico they wind up in Mexico they can go get a job they're going to work\nIf somebody do that without permission with ... with them back then\nThey ... they send back to them they send back to them if they do it without permissions\nThey sent back them but we can't we're expected to just accept everybody we don't know who they are we don't know what they're doing and we don't know what they bring to U.S Mexico has a pretty stiff immigration law they've got to streamline law that insurers\nForeign visitors and immigrants are in the country legally have the means to sustain themselves\nEconomically they're not destined to be burdens on society\nThey are of economic and social benefit to society weight you're you expect your immigrants to contribute\nTheir own good character no criminal background and their contributors to the general welfare and well being of the nation or they make sure that they don't have any sort of a\nCriminal record they make sure they do have visas they make sure they they ban foreign visitors from interfering in the country's internal politics\nAs I mean can you think of it I mean how many illegal immigrants protests have there been where they're waving the Mexican flags in our faces where they are demanding writes ah that they think they have coming to them in Mexico you can't even\nGo can't interfere in their in internal politics plus if they think that you're going to throw off the balance of their demographics may deport you know I mean that's a a\nRacist right I mean like that is not yeah it's it's not an argument there we would never know I Can't do that you know you can't do that and know should you you shouldn't be like well I Would like this percentage of African Americans in this present we want to make sure we're still Seventy or eighty percent yeah I mean I think I Would you I wouldn't I Can't I Can't think of one Trump supporter\nWho would've above a supporter policy where we had to keep the exact same percentages of white people versus other races you what you want to people who are productive who are here because they want to be here and be part of it\nDeciding or going to add something to our community instead of taking things from it\nI mean I you know that's what you want the hypocrisy is mind by that really is incredible lying to buy it really is ... ... security for me but not for me and that is not a a that is not a that's incredible I mean that's an incredible [laughter] a line there that they draw it is a you know it's not it's not the right thing and and it and it's\nPolitically wanting to look at the bottom line is we're we have a lot of illegal immigrants here there will be more that are coming we need to tighten up that is a completely with a larger argument that needs to be addressed and we've been talking about it for years and years\nBut politically speaking you got three weeks to a mid term election there is no this is a complete gift\nTo the Republicans to people who care about the border yeah people who have any uh did Donald Trump and the people he's supporting ice the gift\nIt is and and he's telling Republicans that yeah St ... used this use it in the ... election campaign start talking about immigration 'cause I haven't heard\nAny of them doing that are any other Republican candidates using immigration not that I've heard I mean maybe some warm someone somewhere is but it doesn't seem to be a general theme\nFor the party I did hear cut all talking about it in the debate or I don't think I don't know you mentioned the caravan per se but I mean he was talking a lot about border security I mean there's a really close race in Arizona a race or where a mix ... has a I think a\nGreat chance of winning or people because her opponent there is like if you took Michael Moore\nAnd put him in his brain into a female body of a congresswoman\nYou would have all of these tapes that they've been finding about her where she saying you know she's bashing Arizona oh young it's the lab of democracy she's saying people are crazy in Arizona she's talking about how I mean she's on nine eleven truther shows I mean she is\nAs it's incredible but they decided to run her\nAnd ... and thought that this stuff would not come out\nAnd and ... you know you're talking about a one of the first female pilots in history and the ... of the air force incredibly accomplished yeah has a great chance of winning in a in a tough environment or in Arizona adding on this situation where\nAre you know your image gives a coat pink worker a code ... staffer is running for Senate in Arizona\nIf that is a thing this is an example of it yes\nNow I'm not going to sit here and tell you what the thing I think it's a ridiculous thing
