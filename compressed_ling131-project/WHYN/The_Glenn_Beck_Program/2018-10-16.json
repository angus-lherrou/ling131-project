Eighteen Mitsubishi Eclipse across all we'll control with twenty five mile up to three thousand dollars of MS RV drive your little goblins and a new one Eighteen outlay injury and save up to four thousand dollars off on America's most inexpensive seven thousand years for you for a drive but he was twenty eight ...\nThe as with forty one miles per gallon for only fourteen one twenty five shop that would save up to thirty five hundred dollars off on a twenty Eighteen ... so most of ... me and every new Mississippi she comes with a ten year or one hundred thousand mile warranty but remains to be the\n\nSo that everyone who just donated you just paid President Trump's lawyers over half a million dollars\nAnd as the kids as the kids say nowadays than [noise]\nIn October ...\nGoing back program we need to have a power about Elizabeth Warren to about ... we need to make that a oatmeal do that she made in power found don't know I think we should try that I Hope that somebody smoking peace pipe on this whole thing because\nThis is this is just outrageous don't you think yeah she released this big uh basically I Would say presidential edition video yesterday\nAnd show everyone that she was for Native American yeah super duper NATO she was ah she's Cherokee she's Cherokee and Delaware\nYes ah which is a is something that does not seem to be backed up by the facts now they first came out and said well the DNA test shows her to be one thirty second\nUh Cherokee and then they revise that you won the ... the media revise they can they actually looked at the report and says one thirty second two one five hundred and twelve and ... then they realized hoops you do see we made a a matter of serious correction they didn't want to do in the corruption but they pay they should have\nA cause that always makes everything better sure but it was between one uh one sixty fourth in one one thousand twenty fourth I Believe it was yeah one one thousand twenty fourth now that of course in and of itself\nSo he got the human body up to what one thousand twenty four pieces that one of them one of those pieces would have a little bit of Cherokee\nNow this theoretically right could at least give her a\nTechnical defense of her bull crap over the past fifty years right where she's lying and saying she's a you know she's a Native American and she's uh getting benefits for this and she's getting her stupid super recipes and pow al ... which is the goal of almost everybody\nIn America how how how wild child and they talk about appropriating a culture powwow chow that's where I'm going all ... I'm going all full\nI I'm I'm just I'm going to I just but let's all complain about the names of out both teams but ... lawyer or how wild out already or from here on out our our audience is called our tribe and we mean it is the Native Americans since it's a tribe to trial it\nDoes the I mean there are studies that show that the average ... percent of European descent ... has more Native American blood in them than Elizabeth Warren is even showing\nIn her study average person the average person because he I mean look this is not it it's a very DNA is a complicated matter and and it doesn't exactly show what they try to make it out to show that they\nJust didn't show any DNA from an actual Native American yeah what it shows we don't have any DNA DNA Native American tribes have said we're not participating in DNA studies we don't want\nAny DNA studies so they've never given any DNA so we can't use actual Native Americans to test\nThe DNA against we\nHave to use people from Peru Mexico and Colombia Colombia yes well\nWay and there's the the theory is that they those the same people want it migrating further south so you can use them as a stand in right but it does not show that she has Native American blood that it's not even what they tested or and even that is it's a weird thing DNA doesn't really do that right like if you\nIf you were born like Ted Cruz right Ted Cruz was born in Canada as many people have noticed in like to point out over the years it would not show the his Canadian blood\nFight like that's not the way this works they said oh well he was he was three miles over the border therefore he was Canadian DNA does is it shows a lineage of game shows it's it can be interesting in some ways show migration patterns and I wonder if he would it would have his blood would show that\nHe's a thousand times more Hispanic\nThan a prominent friends disorder or it's true it probably would show that uh\nBut so it's interesting you know from that standpoint of her trying to put this issue behind her and\nFalling flat on her face first of all it does not even show the Native American thing second of all the other part which is interesting about this is they do have an idea of who they believe the Native American relative was um it was her great great great great grandmother I think ah several generations back\nAnd um when she register it was in the Seventeen hundreds she registered as white\nNow the theory again as put forth by the the war in a campaign and and and then this is true\nThat she would have had an incentive at this time to identify as white instead of Native American because there was a lot of violence against Native Americans at the time so if you could get out of saying you know it's like if you're in Nazi Germany and you said you were not a Jew right ... and they were able to get away with that\nThere'd be some serious incentives to do that\nNumber one obviously well that's true we don't know that it's true with this person right we don't know that it was true with ... her great great great great great great grandmother Titanic secondarily yeah go ahead\nWhat have we learned from progressive we've learned that if you identify as something you are that thing this woman identified as white\nNow or denying her what she herself has identified as she said she was white and now we're going to tell her she's not\nThat was what I mean we're not allowed to apply to any well we can't do that to her but Elizabeth Warren is identifying as Cherokee so we have\nTo accept that she is but we can't accept legitimize what what are great great great grandmother identified I Know well it doesn't matter it doesn't matter doesn't matter I mean it really seriously this is so ridiculous story is just so rich I don't really care\nI don't care either but I don't care that she's lighting and the people you know she's lying or let me just play look I Want a cigar store Indian with Elizabeth Warren's face\nMore than anybody else on the planet so don't get me are they selling those yet those got them you know we've got to start making them\nA [laughter] I Want one more than life itself okay so you know where I'm coming from however\nYou know we all have things I have a story in my family okay of ah one of my great great great grandfather is now my my grandfather actually took a horse a big a full size of course he was a he was kind of a vet\nAnd he took him and he grabbed him underneath the chin he didn't have anything to put this horse down didn't have a gun or anything else it but and he took him and he punched him in the head and knock the horse out\nOkay so ... my family my on my mother's side they're big people are and they they they they had muscles in them that I don't app okay\nNow the legend in the family is that my great great great great grandfather or was this guy I don't know why they always involve horses but one of the neighbors horses kept\nA jumping over and getting into his garden or whatever I don't even know what and he picked it up and threw it over the fence\nI don't know if that's true I got to go out and say it's not my family you don't know [laughter] so he could be truly might not be true oh who cares that's what I grew up hearing the same thing with her she might have grown up hearing yo yeah this is what it was\nBut it was it was it was not true how many advantages through your life did you get because you had people in your family who threw horses over over walls I was ... I almost made it into WWE but\nHow many times have you told us that you've been on the air for how many years never never I've never lose you you've you've yeah yeah yeah I get it again if she is you're trying to play identity politics if you're going to play identity politics you better be right on these things and that's why I Can't give you that I got what it's about it I give you that it's not a huge story I mean you know\nWe well you know what is a huge part of this story\nIs the Cherokee Nation came out yesterday and said quote\nA DNA test is useless to determine tribal citizenship current DNA tests do not even distinguish whether a person's ancestors were indigenous to North or South America\nSovereign tribal nations set their own legal requirements for citizenship and while DNA tests can be used to determine lint lineage such as return ally a to an individual is not evidence for tribal affiliation\nUsing a da in a ... a test to claim any connection to the Cherokee Nation or any tribal nation even vaguely is inappropriate and wrong\nIt makes a mockery out of DNA test and it's legitimate uses wildest honoring legitimate tribal governments and their citizens whose ancestors are well documented and who's heritage is proven\nSenator Warren is undermining tribal interests with her continue the claims of tribal air at the edge okay look not a good look yeah they're they're not they're not offering the piece by peer to her or she should probably\nZip it and it does not go on this whole saga of the last few days with the ... as you point out ridiculous story does this not ... the whole uh serve as a gigantic warning sign to Democrats to not nominate her this is a no no no no I look I Want to know\nMaking it about identity politics more and more and nobody cares you know people are done with the identity politics I'm telling you they're done with it and the the the first candidate and well we already know the first candidate was Donald Trump that said I don't care I don't care\nI don't care what you say about me I don't care what you accuse me of I don't care that's why he won because heat that's white twenty percent of the people who voted for Donald Trump and you'll never hear this from mainstream media because they don't they don't the Democrats don't walk this known\nTwenty percent of the people who voted for Donald Trump voted for Barack Obama at least once many twice\nSo they came over from the Democratic side they're sick of it they're sick of it\nNow they may not like his extreme tweets and everything else\nBut they definitely don't like the idea that yeah we are going to get rid of capitalism gives it's an old outdated idea yeah you know we think we should shut down free speech oh I hate those cops they're all murderers\nMan boy man or trouble especially white man did you know that I'm Indian and that's really great I shouldn't have said India and it really should be Native American because India\nShut up nobody cares\nWith all of this stuff that is going on in the world\nShot up the issue here is\nYou don't win that twenty twenty primary with twenty or thirty candidates in it without appealing to those activists who do believe all that craziness\nSo and they're they're so they're stopped their hearts Clinton incentivize right who when those people over early which is why they're all coming out and you know why the Spartacus moment happened is white Kamala Harris was so crazy during the cabinet thing it's way ... he's on TV with you know with the crazy a crazy stunts every day\nBut she does do how do you see what it used to happen is you'd have to you'd have to go over to the extreme and then you'd moderate\nYou're not going to be able to moderate but those people how do you moderate how do you go over to the side of anthropology and say hey I don't think anybody is wrong with that divide shout your abortion and then when you get the nomination\nCome back close enough to the center to where people are going oh she didn't really mean the shell the abortion thing oh she didn't really mean ... cars and so far in the show your abortion people are not going to let you get away with it\nYou're you've been eaten\nYou've been eaten by the hard left and the Democrats are waking up to it they don't like what's happening on campuses they don't like what's happening in the news\nMay not like what's happening in the White House either but they're not about shouting their abortion\nDumped Greenfield view traffic and whether the radio by sixty\n...\nGood morning nine thirty in the W
