{"month": "10", "state": "MA", "station": "WHYN", "content": "Down brings over thirty five years at his experience to our discussion about retirement he's here to give you advice as your journey to and through this world average time down great to be here with either get it always is\nFirst of all tell us what is it that you're hearing family retirees in the pre retirees you've been meeting with this past week let's put on their minds in their heart\nWell you know when it's funny this week actually just yesterday I met with two folks that both had decisions on their minds as to when to retire when they're going to retire kind of exciting yeah it is but it's also very confusing and very scary for a lot of folks I had a physician he's Seventy four years old and he's actually kind of a funny guy because\nI actually called him one day and we started ... having a conversation and it's Seventy four he's still I'm practicing medicine and he was actually in the surgical ward\nWhile we're on the phone he said whoops I've got to go get a little bit of an emergency here\nHere my goodness that's funny I didn't talk to your while he was doing surgery [laughter]\nNo but the anesthesiologist so it was okay I was okay and I also had another another woman that was a she had to make a decision within the next three days because apparently she works for the federal government she's been there for thirty two years and it's by a package looked pretty attractive to her and she had to make a decision within the next three days so\nTough decisions to make going towards the end of your career it as a scary scary scene indeed for a lot of folks\nYes and and something that you really shouldn't take lightly and and definitely not just make a decision and in a couple of days [laughter] no\nNot at all no because you know it's\nFor Leno's mentioned fear a couple of times and it's really fear of the unknown and I think one of us don't like change the land and and you know we're used to the routine of going to work every day and then all of a sudden we're approaching those days when we enter the world a permanent unemployment and and it is scary so again that's that's what's going on this week that's what I saw a voice in in one day actually now\nRight very good I always wanted to hear you know what's what's on their mind so I like to start off the show with that today we're going to be talking about retirement risk and you know we're\nAll like to avoid risk I think especially the older that we get you know I Do not want to go up in a hot air balloon again I did at ones now I'm like this that thought of it you know just totally scares me and I won't do it again\nAnd so we're going to talk about how much risk you may or may not already have in your investing strategy in your retirement what what are your accounts do certain market events happened is your retirement portfolio prepared to withstand as risk that we're going to talk about today\nAnd that when we're talking about this risk explains what are we typically talking about\nYou know limb risk comes from a lot of different forms but first and its most basic the risk we fear the most when it comes to our retirement portfolio is our medical don't last as long as we do second for better or worse risk exists with any investment choice whether it's cash small cap stock or something in between\nAnd you know William really the key is to understand risk and how it may or may not be balanced by other choices you've made your portfolio\nThere is market risk also known as systematic risk and it is the likelihood the security or investment will move the same way in the same degree in the overall market so ideally when you look at your portfolios\nYou really don't want all of your investments moving with the market at the same time you want different degrees of direction in timing\nSo that if the market's going up on one of your investments it maybe all the money's not going\nUp and down the same time\nAnother thing I think that's important is also interest rate risk which is commonly tied to the fixed income investments this is a risk um that the price of a bond or buying mutual fund will decline is interest rates go up because there is an inverse relationship with insurance and bonds\nAnd why collection bonds with a range of maturity ... can be helpful so you look at the maturity dates and interest rate risk um credit risk and market risk all those things are are things that we need to look at\nAnother is inflation risk\nWhich is a risky portfolio takes on the growth rate that it won't keep pace with inflation so it's a risk the purchasing power decline over time if you're poor ... doesn't go up at least to the peso inflation\nSo this is why we tend to invest in select securities in equities for growth over the long term and even though they're considered conservative there are still risk when it comes to blondes and I just mentioned it that's credit risk or the risk that the bond issue or doesn't have the credit worthiness to be able to repay that debt when the bond matures so\nWe look at things like Moody's and standard and Poor's those are agencies that kind of rape the bonds and they determined whether the likelihood of a of default so all those things are a risk that we need to associate with our retirement before there's risk with any investment choice include choice to to not invested all\nThat's why won't you know I think a lot of folks really need to work with a financial professional in maintain a diverse collection of investments to help balance risk and provide growth and protection not take on too much risk not be too conservative those who don't keep pace with places a lot of things we look at it but my\nGoodness this sounds like such the balancing act you know it reminds me of the old Ed Sullivan show and the guy would have all those multiple thinning plates in the air and if one fell because everything else to come crashing down and we don't want that to happen with our retirement strategies so how should we felt confident about our approach to retirement\nYou're right and women you know we're also dating ourselves because if we know about it so [laughter]\nAct I remember ... G G O\nIdea of over [laughter]\nSo but you're right when it is a balancing act and that's why you should uh seek out a financial professional who should not only be willing and be able to address all your questions but really to give clear concise straightforward answers\nAnd here's some of the questions I suggest asking one final financial professional to work with you know and again not everyone

give you his website it's Dale Frank financial dot com and\nYou can find out all about Dale in his team there it's altogether really one word gal Frank financial dot com\nToday we're talking about retirement risk are you taking on enough of it are you taking on too much or just the right amount like the whole porridge thing with all these risks in mind that you talked about Dale how do we figure out how much risk we already have in our own strategy\nYou know when there's a lot of different ways we can look at it but it's pretty basic a hit this process overall and essentially you end up in categorized all your investments and you want a tally of all of it the different types and how much when you have each\nAnd also understand the range in concentration of each of those assets types you want to know whether it's small caps international names high yield bond reads all these act differently and this includes what's in your retirement account what's in those mutual funds for example what what types of mutual funds all types individual stocks and bonds\nSome portfolios also may include real estate or alternative investments like hedge funds and commodities and you really want to break them all down in and determine how much they're worth and you know their value\nThen with the help of either financial ... ourselves or sometimes even using an online tool you can look at each asset and look at a basic risk factor\nSo when you look at small camps for example small small kept stocks\nThey're riskier than large cap names and treasuries are safer than junk bonds and so on so there's a risk skill to assemble ... all of your assets and for many of my clients it helps to visualize the impact of each of those different investments so so often\nAlong with a risk scale\nAnd sometimes to make a pie chart but we also look at how we evaluate risk so those are all you know you can look at those each individually and look and feel report for oil and see what's happening without\nSeeing your assets altogether and categorize like that might really show a different story than what you thought those quarterly statements for showing right yeah\nThat is often the case and when you add it all up you might find you have a lot more large caps or how you'll bonds originally thought because you happen to have similar holdings in two or three different accounts or because a portion of the market was enjoyed steady returns so it's rebalancing but you know Lou in one of the things we do in our office we use a system called risk allies", "year": "2018",
