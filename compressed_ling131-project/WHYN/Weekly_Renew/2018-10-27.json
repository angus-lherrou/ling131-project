{"month": "10", "state": "MA", "station": "WHYN", "content": "Right this market volatility really makes us start worrying you know what does this mean for me or my investments going to be okay and especially if you're in a retirement it's scary\nYou know people started saying well this is this going to be the trend for the future or is this maybe just a a little bit of profit taking a little bit\nBlip in the market it it's really hard to say land\nBecause again the fundamentals you know the economy is humming right along with more jobs than their employees you know healthy economy is is strong and and you know you kind of look at the women say what the heck is going on in ... what about my money what about my own retirement what what do we need to look at what's of concern we see a dip in the market like that\nRight in my team colleagues sat down with financial educator and New York times best selling author David Baake to find out how it all impacts you it's an interview that you won't want to mess and that's coming up later in our shall so our whole so I was going to be dedicated to talking about market volatility and\nWhat that means for you and me so tell why don't we just start off the show with a history lesson about market volatility\nYeah sure Louisiana and just a quick aside I did have the pleasure of meeting David Buck and a couple of occasions and I have heard him speak and and your listeners are in for a real treat when I when he comes on later on the show but one of the things that I talk about and I do a lot of seminars to help people learn about market volatility Social Security benefits retirement accounts and the like\nBut one of the things that we talk a lot about is what you just mentioned market volatility\nWhen I look at market volatility and let's say we had some extreme years where maybe you had money in the market and the first year you had money in the market say hundred thousand dollars and the first year it went up by fifty percent\nBut then the next year the market went down by fifty percent the third year one up by fifty percent and the fourth one down by fifty percent\nLewin what do you think I hear from you know folks that I talked to my seminars when I ask that question of a fifty percent down to ... a fifty percent down fifty percent what do you think I hear as the average rate of return what would you say\nUm they would be zero\nZero well that's what most people thing but it's really not when you actually do the math\nIt's actually a negative forty three percent so if you start off with a hundred thousand dollars the first year the market goes up by fifty now you're one fifty down by fifty or Seventy five\nUp by fifty at one twelve five hundred and the next year you down to fifty six two fifty so going from a hundred fifty six two fifty is more than forty three percent loss\nOh my goodness it's really yeah I didn't think about that you have to kind of do the math each [laughter] I really\nDo and you know if you have a significant loss in the markets see loose thirty percent you it's not just a thirty percent return just break even it actually takes a lot more financial energy to recover from those losses and coincidentally it's about a forty three percent ... return just to get your money back if you have a thirty percent loss\nIf you step up to the next level and so you lose forty percent it's actually sixty five percent return just to break even that's not to make any more money but just to break even\nAnd unfortunately when we did see some downturns of Americans say two thousand and seven eight and nine you know if you had a fifty percent loss you literally have to get a hundred percent return or double your money doubled returned just to get your money back so and that's likely no no not in today's world not in today's world\nYou know when when you look back at history and you know maybe we can remember back in Nineteen sixty eight\nUm and I go back three markets cycles because each markets cycle tends to be about Fifteen to Twenty years in duration again there's no all encompassing type a view of the market but that seems to be what happens Fifteen to Twenty years in ... so when you go back to Nineteen sixty eight Nineteen eighty five roughly that's Seventeen year span\nThe down started out in Nineteen sixty eight roughly a thousand points\nBlue and do you have any idea where the downed it up in Nineteen eighty five Seventeen years later no I have no idea yeah well many people don't but it was roughly a thousand points so based on what I just said is it possible do you think that people made money during the Seventeen year a junior spin\nI I don't know it's okay so is Nineteen sixty eight was one thousand as well\nYes it was sixty six days a thousand points eighty five was roughly thousand\n... so I Would say no they didn't make much\nWell it really depends on when they get in and when they get out his possible if they made money it's also possible that you lost a little bit of money but you know journalists Seventeen year period essentially no game so imagine if you started saving and sixty eight and went to return eighty five you didn't have a heck of watery rate of return how yeah\nBut see them in Nineteen eighty five we saw a significant shift in the market we went from a thousand points in Nineteen eighty five\nAnd we hit a new piece in the market roughly in two thousand\nAnd from that period of time of the doubt it twelve thousand points in the year two thousand so we have twelve fold increase in the market during that period of time now do you think that during our lifetime we're going to see the market increased ... fold again\nWell you don't know but you know it's going to increase again yeah\nBut you know twelve fold is pretty pretty aggressive and I think many advisors and many many just investors got very complacent and really forgot that you could lose money in the market ... low in in the year two thousand we started to see some market volatility\nSo when you kind of follow the trends and again these are exact numbers but roughly as I said the Dow was at twelve thousand points in the year two thousand\nFrom two thousand or two thousand and three dollars from twelve thousand points down to a thousand points lost nearly a third of its of it's a of its value\nBut then you know again we always hear it it's always costs and don't worry about the market always always comes back and that's true\nBut as you get older and close to retirement unfortunately time is not on your side to to make those recoveries so you have to be close attention to market volatility but\nFrom two thousand and three to two thousand and seven the market did recover and hit a new all time high hit about fourteen thousand points out really yeah but then again then what happened from two thousand seven two thousand nine to recall what happened then land well yes [laughter]\nI totally know what happened yeah yeah the bear market\nYeah and we saw a lot of reading during that to a three year period so from two thousand seven to two thousand nine the Dow went from fourteen thousand points down to about six thousand points significant losses some in some cases folks lost fifty sixty percent of their of their value in the portfolios\nAnd I'm going to tell you that I had a lot of people that I was talking to that had to delay taking their retirement um because they just they lost so much money and I had people that didn't open their statements for you know two or three years or time rather than that's that's all that's all true\nSo basically from the year two thousand nine to current you know the Dow did recover as a matter of fact it hit all time highs and we keep seeming to get higher and higher and the doubt\nSo the Dow went from about a six thousand points in two thousand nine and we did hit an all time high of twenty seven thousand points and we seem to be covering somewhere between twenty five thousand to twenty seven thousand points over the last month or two\nSo you really have to pay attention to volatility you have to pay attention to your investments in what's going on because you know we do we look at these portfolios everyday we help folks with their retirement income one to collect Social Security went to collect the pensions how to do that\nAnd there are financial professionals out there who thrive on helping people to put their retirement finances back on track which is what we do\nBut you know if you do it yourself or who's

my summer and he took advantage of the free consultation gimmick there was no obligation\nAnd I sat down with him and he had done quite well a huge saved about a million dollars no part of it was a distribution from a pension plan and I'm not sure the ... would have recommended they took the lump sum distribution but that's what he did", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Weekly Renew", "city":
