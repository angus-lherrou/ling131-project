W. J. D. stands for what would Jesus do but we're not asking that were saying what would Jesus like to undo in other words what kinds of stuff bothers Jesus\nWhat would Jesus like to change now to get ourselves into this message this morning let me bring you back in time and all that this is a true story out of my life\nNo um [noise] let me tell you just a little bit about me at this time I was a teenager teenage boy that tells you about everything you need to know about my personality at that point right I was a teenage boy and I come from a family with one sibling I got a little sister\nAnd I'll tell you this one little sister she bought a heck out of me\nShe would follow me everywhere I went and tried to be a part of my friends' group and me and she would tattle on me so she just bugged ... the heck out of me so one year's Christmas Time\nAnd I have to get her a gift right she's my sister so I put a lot of thought into it and decided upon something that would absolutely express my tender feelings for my little sister\nSo for this special gift for my sister I went on I found I found the biggest box I could possibly find\nA rapid and beautiful wrapping paper it was my sister right I put a big fancy bow you want to stick on both on the top of it and I wrote her name with big fancy letters on it and I couldn't even put it under the tree because it was too big so I put it right there beside the tree\nAnd when she saw that her eyes became as big as officers\nShe was so excited to see what her big brother got her for Christmas she thought what could be so big so grant so expensive so strapped again I mean this was the world's biggest gift the world's best gift it was the jackpot of all Christmas gifts\nWell Christmas morning finally arrived and she couldn't wait to open that gift she was very disciplined in control so she saved the best gift till the last gift and then finally\nShe opens at Grand prize of all Christmas is she took that she took the big gift lifted up trying to shake it and figure out what was inside of it and then she she finally rip the bowl off she tore through all the wrapping paper and she opened up the box and phone inside that box\nNothing\nIt was ... little league and the she looked at me I looked at her\nIt was then I realized how badly I had missed judge this whole thing I thought I was being areas\nBut\nShe looked at me like I was the most horrible brother in the world and my parents looked at me as if I was the most horrible son in the world and now you're all looking at me like I'm the most horrible human being in the world and I believe that to this day my sister is still in therapy [noise]\nThe disappointment of an empty just\nAn empty gift\nWhat if all the songs that we sing in church one of all the sermons that we listen to what if all the prayers that really we recites\nAre nothing more than ... gift to our God what if we're sitting here on a Sunday Morning\nAnd we're looking good and we're looking spiritual overlooked in fine and we're going through the motions on the outside but on the inside\nOn the inside our heart is far from God and we're actually offering or God just an\nEmpty gift what would Jesus undo entity worship hollow worship\nLet let me show you something the Jesus said\nAnd I'm going to take a look now at Matthews gospel a Matthew chapter Fifteen let me start reading at first one this is kinda strange explain what we're talking about as we get into this so first one says this\nIs in some ... and teachers are the law change of Jesus from Jerusalem and asked why do your disciples break the tradition of The Elders why don't they wash their hands before they eat now\nFirst of all you have to understand this is not at all about hygiene this is about religion because the ... the the fairest sees were like these\nWho were religious\nAnd they had rules I mean strict rules for everything in life and one of the rules as you had to watch a certain way before you had any food you have to understand it in a mindset of a fair seat the whole world was divided into two very distinct categories clean\nAnd unclean and so you looked at the world and you saw that there were some\nUnclean people and you want nothing to do with them\nAnd they were clean people and they're All right there's unclean food and there's clean food and and in fact\nIf you have any kind of a skin problem like dry skin or eczema\nYour unclean you're no good if you have a bomb the discharge year like clean if you happen to touch a pig your unclean\nHere's the worst part of all if you touch somebody else in your unclean it's contagious it's kind of like\n... when you were in third grade you know you run up to somebody go Cody is you got it and you run away right\nThat's what it was like in their mindset and so you could get you could touch accidentally touched something unclean and that meant you're totally unclean and you go home and before you say anything your wife gives you a hug now she's on clean energy happens to touch the kids who touched the food getting ready for dinner now that's all unclean so the big question then becomes\nHow do you get yourself clean again how do you get religiously ceremony spiritually clean again well they had a rule\nFor how you could do it and it was a very simple one you had to take a certain amount of water and wash yourself in a certain way you suggest how much water while I can tell you you had to take exactly a quarter\nOf a log of water you suggest what\nIn the world is a little log of water a quarter of a log of water is precisely the amount of water that fits in one and a half\nEggshells so one and a half\n... very precise decided to be or didn't count\nSo let's say you're trying to get ready to eat before your meal which you have to do is you get gotta get somebody who's cleaned to help you out and they pour the water over your hands while you're rubbing your hands together briskly now be careful because if it happens to run down on your wrist now your wrist is unclean tune you have to start all over again and if you're really religious if you're really pi if\nYou want to do that repeat that before each course in the mail servers Sunday afternoon you're you're having your Sunday dinner and you you you wash up you've got you've already you're clean now take a bite of your hamburger out\nAnd then you're looking to go ... good I Want my ... I guess what you got to stop and watch all over again so he could have ... ... and and that's that's the way these guys are living their entire life\nIs that kind of mindset to things and so they come to Jesus and they start complaining and criticizing they said why don't you are disciples wash their hands correctly for they eat sometimes I've seen them skip of that process why aren't you follow in our rules why aren't you following our traditions\nAnd get this Jesus just\nOn loads on them he says you guys you guys are more concerned about\nHow you look on the outside\nThan how God sees you on the inside\nHe said you hypocrites\nI as a as a prophet Isaiah was right when he prophesied about you these people on our me with their lips but their hearts are far from me they worship in vain we're talking about worship today\nThey worship me in vain their teachings are bud rules taught by men in other words\nThey give me lip service but their heart is not right how do they worship", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Christ Lutheran Church", "city": "Springfield", "day": "28"}
