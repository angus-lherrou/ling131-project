W. J. D. a lot of people you're especially few years ago people were wearing these bracelets these wristbands and said W. W. J. D.\nSo let me tell you a little bit about the story of that because those those things that W. W. J. D. was I mean as a super super popular just a few years ago kind of like\nMe in high school you're all roll your eyes all at once right there so what happened was way back in Eighteen Ninety six there was a pastor of a local church\nWho kind of got this concept and he wrote a book and the book was called in his steps that one little book went on to sell thirty million copies which is approximately thirty million more\nBooks than I've ever sold [laughter] so\nAnyway the concept behind this book was a very simple one but it was a powerful one\nYeah I did was he wrote about all these life situations that we go through just live in our everyday life and he said what we need to do is we need to stop and say what would\nJesus do in this particular situation what would Jesus do\nW. W. J. D. and then like a hundred years later it got popular all over again and\nPretty soon they were putting it on coffee cups and I'm ... markers and on posters and all kinds of things like that and it's a great book\nWhat would Jesus do if he was in my situation I'll tell you what if that's all you get out of this talk this morning\nIt's worth the price of your mission right there what would Jesus do about what we're going to do in this series if\nWe're to kind of flip through the whole thing upside down\nAnd instead of saying what would Jesus do\nWe're going to say what would Jesus on do in other words Jesus was a real man with a real personality and when Jesus looked at things\nWhen Jesus these things what kind of things bother Jesus what kinds of things what he'd like to change what kind of things\nMaybe even break the horrors of Jesus grieve the heart of Jesus and we're looking for different things for different weeks\nWhat would Jesus on do now to jump into this whole thing this morning let me just start by telling your story I Know this guy\nI Know this guy that got a chance to meet his big hero in life and because this guy was a big hero he he wanted to make sure that he had a gift for um there was going to be a great gift so you research the math\nAny determine what he really love what his passion was what do you collect it in a life and he determines this particular individual loved rare books Swiss ever find them both together as a gift\nSo we went out and he he looked all over and found a genuine\nLeather bound first edition\nSigned by the author volume any wrapped it up beautifully and he brought it to this dinner where he was going to get to meet his hero when he got there he presented\nIt to zero\nThe wrapped up gift it's amazing gift and it just kind of sat down on the table in front of him when he went around talking when I'm telling a story\nWhen it came time to end the meal the guy got up and left\nAmazing expensive\nThoughtful gift\nSitting there on the table\nDidn't even taken ticket with him now that got me to thinking and I think this through with me what do you think Jesus feels like\nI mean what do you think Jesus feels like\nWhen Jesus gave us this incredibly awesome gift of what\nHis life\nIs life and so often our reaction is well that's nice right what\nDo you think Jesus feels when he left\nHeaven and came to earth he set aside is power and his glory and his majesty he emptied himself completely sacrifice everything for us I mean torture\nCrucified in tune or isn't from the dead kick some devil tail\nYou ought to be going yeah right about now\nI mean he gave us he gave you access to the very throne room of God he gave you never ending life he gave you a resurrection power he gave you haven't\nWhat would Jesus undo in difference apathy that's called spiritual in difference\nNow do you know what let me tell you something ... something most people don't know\nDo you know that Jesus after Easter Sunday after he was originally from the dead some years later\nWrote seven\nLetters\nThat he sent to specific churches that we're in operation during during that day that first century time period did you know that\nYou suggest how in the world you know that well I'll tell you why because it's right here in the Bible\nYou can read these letters in the book of revelation\nSeven letters addressed the seven different churches matter of fact let me point out one just one of them to you today\nThere was this one church and it was in the city of ... you\nKnow ... to see it was a big bustling wealthy city back in the first century was an Asian and about thirty five years before this they had suffered a massive earthquake and what happened then is rural reinvest it tons and tons of money in that place to rebuild it\nAnd it became like the big boom time boom\nTown of its time I mean think like\nHow modern day Dubai as would cranes and and scaffolding everywhere I think I think a Las Vegas all the glitz and all the people\nThat's what label just see it was like back in those days I mean they had they had the best of everything they had brand new public parks and bands and shopping malls in theaters arenas I mean you name it you name it it had a great economy was growing like wildfire the only problem they had\nThe only obstacle to the growth\nWas their water supply they didn't have enough water for all those people\nSo what they did their their answer to that problem was they devised this very complex system of aqueduct and tunnels like the pipelines and brought the water into the city center from far away and in fact it was so sophisticated that they actually drew their water\nFrom hot springs natural hot springs that provided boy not boiling but steaming hot water to everybody in the city you can take a hot bath\nRight there and yet like hot water coming to your place or hot water for the public bath they had other other springs that provided ice cold water and the ice cold water was just great for drinking\nNo the only problem I had was every so often upon occasion they would have a water pressure problem and when that happened the water that would reach them would be kind of\nIt'd be stale and bitter and follow tasting it would be some kind of rusty and it was lukewarm and so you would it would put your cup under a fountain you think you're gonna get this beautiful ice cold water crystal clear water and instead you taste is lukewarm stuff and you ...\nYou just gotta spit it out immediately 'cause it it tasted so stale well with all of that context in mind right now you know your understanding this now you're seen it the way a first century later just seeing with the things we're all of that context\nHere's the words that Jesus chose when he wrote a letter to the church there and lay out to see it\nHe said I Know your deeds that you are neither ...\nNor cold I Wish you were either one or the other\nSo because you are to lukewarm neither hot nor cold I'm about to fit you out of my mouth\nLiteral translation right there if you're interested is I'm getting ready to vomit you\nI mean whoa it's pretty serious right wall over Jesus saying\nYou've become so lukewarm in your face\nSo ... so stale that you guys are making me sick to my stomach\nAnd boy I mean you want to say Jesus tell us what you really think right", "show_name":
