the Ninety eight percent of whatever my needs happened to be but then I have to get a catastrophic plan the God Forbid I have the heart bad heart attack\nOr the God Forbid I get cancer the God Forbid I get in a bad accident right\nRight uh you you don't have a car insurance for gasoline you don't have home owners insurance for long term care insurance just for the big things and we've tried to ensure everything top down and that's led to the west you know really each ten years of\nInsurance premiums that have doubled or tripled more we need to do is insured less which is how every other insurance product works they keep it that is means doctors have to make more of the services they provide affordable and they can if they cut out the middleman and streamline than a simple\nAnd how big is your practice how many patients do you have in your facility at Seventy in Wichita\nIn Wichita we have five doctors in over thirty two hundred patients\nUnbelievable and your age and you give concierge care at all I could pick up a phone and I'm getting a doctor at three in the morning that it's going to answer my call\nYou do you have and I could go down and see somebody at three AM in the morning\nIf you need stitches or is it true emergency you know a lot of the tree and phone calls or chest pain which we might send the ER but a lot of times the kid who's sick and a mom who's worried and um you of if you can avoid the\nYou can avoid a thousand or two thousand dollar bill that's how you get health care health insurance is a card in your wallet healthcare is access to your doctor yeah\nAll right and then how many other practices around the country have you been able to to provide your model that they have duplicated how you you've been out and about and a champion of this for a long time\nYet we've helped over five hundred and fifty doctors convert to this model in the last few years but there's about a thousand total there in forty eight states in every state except north and South Dakota right now but we have one about to launch in North Dakota [noise]\nUm and then it's even gotten a little bit international so um this is a a sound tried and true model\nNow and what do you do Dr grows in terms of your president of duck a doctor patient care bound nation you know now that we have alternatives that are working real life experiences seems to me that we ought to be able to duplicate it a lot more than we are\nAbsolutely a so doctor patient care foundation is a physician or on health policy because doctors never seemed to be at the table whenever we're having important conversations about health care\nSo we put traditions are back in back of the table to have conversations\nPersonally I I also have a primary care practice much like that with them either in southwest Florida ... ... email ... when he was\nA wire using insurance to pay for health are for basic primary care services all it does is create obstacles blocks lesson huh you know and we're ... ... ... ... points as Dr Josh and we're seeing patients come to us\nFrom all over the state of Florida and even from outside of the country was ... medical tourism are and what we're finding is that you know not not the same thing about about health insurance we're using it wrong and you know when somebody is you know place twice the amount of money for a service because of the ... shots\nWondering insuring it's using insurance drives up the cost of the product so ... cash price Ross is two hundred and twenty dollars while using her your commercial insurance you know we go through all the the hoops to give it authorized\nAnd your co pay five hundred dollars or so we we see this time and again on the more people are are coming out of pocket to pay for health health or\nA with inside adoptable more insurance seems to be becoming an obstacle on ... solution so when I'm pleased to see that you know we're shifting the conversation from\nOur coverage for everyone wants to talk about reducing the cost of health care\nI think the real close enough I was about ... upon us some help committee on this exact topic\nWould it be a better idea I mean I'm watching for example they have this race out in California everybody shock\nGather news and who is now offering free health care for everybody\nIt whether you're a taxpayer whether you're in the ... the state legally or illegally\nEverybody's going to get free health care well I basically put a sign that says come to California but you get sick\nUm but there's people are going to go there now what's interesting to me is that a real public and his within striking distance and that gubernatorial race out in California because instinctively people no we can't afford to pay up for every illegal immigrant in the country\nBut the reality is is that if I Lived in Wichita, Kansas I Would be a part of at the same day and I would be your patient Dr ... because I I think it's the best deal I liked the idea of being able to call my doctor whenever I'm sick or if I have a kid that sick every parent wants the ability to do that\nAnd you're sort of service provides it fifty bucks a month now how much is the average in Wichita, Kansas catastrophic plan of it for the big things heart attack\nOr accident or cancer how much would one of those plans cost\nAbout five hundred dollars a family\nFive hundred dollars per year or a month a month so\nAnd the current rates closer to you know a thousand twelve hundred a across the nation people are paying more for health insurance each month and they're paying for their mortgage if\nThe Trump tax cuts only put a hundred dollars per household per month in and they're being credited with the economic boom of your four point two percent GDP\nIf we fix health insurance we could put five hundred dollars back in the pocket of every household or the the real ... and the the politician their heads and California is to send them an originality just throwing more money at the problem has never fixed it\nThe what we're doing is Dr Lee and ourselves and and a thousand other physicians is is innovating and saying how do we get ... cheaper how do we make it so patients don't have co pays how do we provide stitches for no cost because they're so affordable [noise]\nUm you actually looking at ways to fundamentally fixing the system that's what we need not just promises of more spending\nWay and if I could add to that just a a ... you know as far as the cost of care you know the biggest one of the people ask what's his now can I just get major medical you know we we can afford what what services the ... armored care practices are providing but we just need something catastrophic\nWell mama care made that illegal or so something a little strange and just brought on to explore that access these major medical plan called ... short term medical plans and some would argue that these are actually true insurance they don't cover anything except the major medical expenses Seventy five dollars a month or\nWhat it is this going to be implemented easily city by city town by town we can duplicate the model it already does take care of individuals with preexisting conditions if somebody wants to sign up for atlas MD and they have a preexisting condition a doctor or do you deny them service\nThat everybody's welcome everybody's price the same just based on age um we know we're going to work harder for some patients ... Wilson oh we're going to not have to work as hard for other patients and we don't want to be judged by their illness\nHow did you get to who directly negotiate these prices with these pharmaceutical companies\nBoy I I Wish I could say was because we're so darn good at it um the the truth is it's so much more simple than that\nAt a doctor's in forty four states are allowed to work directly with pharmaceutical wholesalers so just like you can go to Costco and get something for much cheaper because you pay a membership we do the same thing and we're able to\nGet the you know the actual cost of medicine might be at ten dollars for a thousand pills and because we don't have a staff of seven people per physician fighting insurance we can lower the cost and and pass the savings on directly to the patient\nThat this is a win for everybody we we don't take care of of Republicans or Democrats we take care of people\nSo how does somebody had a group of doctors in New York say implement those cars they're going to look at this and say fifty bucks a month I Can't make ten cents off of that\nBut they're gonna have to move to New York because they don't make it easy but um they could work with a pharmacist in New York state's one of the few states that make it a very difficult but then a pharmacist could say um if you do a five dollar a month membership with them then you get the medicine that cost that would be an amazing model it it would cut down there right\nLet's take the New York out of the equation for California out of the ... let's say any other state Louisiana Florida um I don't know Missouri yeah how do they do it\n... it's as simple as signing up effect shopping on Amazon there's there's almost nothing to it um\nYou know we have one supplier that makes it very easy overnight shipping and that's just it if I Want to buy a bottle of a hundred pills a blood pressure medicine I can if I Want to buy a thousand pills I can [noise] and it's about the same price um but it's fundamentally cheaper than what\nAbout Lindsey Graham is saying that what only block grant the money that we're already providing to individual states and let them come up with these innovative you know like centers of innovation all around the country and I think naturally people would move toward your system\nI I I Would agree with the logic or the federal government's basically saying we've given your money with strings attached before and we haven't received full value for that because we've wage you down with regulatory burden so we're going to cut those strings and just give you the money and say go forth and do the best job that you can't make\nQuick break we'll come back more Dr Josh ... outlets MD and Dr Lee as grows president docks for a patient care foundation\nAnd money dot com the\nGround zero week nights at ten on use radio five sixty W. H. Y. N. [noise]\nHard as we continue with Dr Josh jumper atlas\nMD and Dr Lee as rosy as the president of docks for patient care foundation and other bound or the epiphany help direct primary care a network how much would it cost a ... a woman as breast cancer which is now I think one in seven women will get breast cancer in the course of their lives or\nA guy maybe has prostate cancer how much would a treatment with the best medicine for breast cancer cost one of your patients six dollars a month\nOkay slowdown breast cancer chemotherapy treatments six dollars a month and we're talking about the best most advanced medicine that we have\nWell it it really depends on what the oncologist says is the best medicine for that patient I'll be the first\nTo say their dollars a month of your breast cancer and need breast cancer treatment\nAs low as yet as low as depending on the chemotherapy or\nWe've had patients who go you know we we find make the diagnosis sending the oncologist they say based on all of their tests and experience this is the best medicine for you [laughter] they take it to the pharmacy they're quoted six or seven hundred dollars a month\nThey called us and said I Can't make it any better and we were shocked but the wholesale cost of that medicine to six dollars\nSo we're ... the whole system with paperwork and and and dropped or see me to streamline and in and innovate just like Silicon Valley does with anything else\nHow does this go for all the other cancers that are out there leukemia and uh you know prostate cancer lung cancer\nSo we have a peace will come to some of the country was ...\nA ... one of the Caribbean would cost or a hundred thousand dollars she came to six months these uh uh and we did her surgery her her imaging every state or ... or

good with the church raise raise money in a big sale\nAnd you know considering that most people out of pocket expenses now for health insurance plans of eleven thousand dollars per year what do we ensuring when the once in a lifetime ... won't can be treated mature for less than ten dollars ...\nUnbelievable well look I Hope everybody will pay attention because in twenty eight days Americans are going to go to the polls in Obamacare won't work and we know the left and the Democrats want to keep it in\nA I applaud you guys for what you're doing and the fact that you've been able to

then literally leaking it strategically to get the special counsel may you know using the same source of information but making it appear like there are numerous sources here so they're all saying the same thing so creating enough smoke so that there would be right buyer\n'em and all the FBI guys they all knew it wasn't true from the beginning Lisa Page even testify to that fact that's right I mean you cannot\nUse double triple quadruple here say from anonymous sources to launch an account or intelligence investigation that is strictly prohibited yet shown that is exactly what the FBI and the de

boss he was the chief of counter intelligence at the FBI he told\nHe told the congressional uh a committee that at the time they were submitting defy using that information ... they had just gotten betting if it hadn't been and yet the standard for the five is it must be substantiated before you can submit it to the court Greg ... exactly right\nThey they hadn't even begun to substantiate process and yet they're using it in presenting it as fancy to verify the court when you look at this\nPoint they willingly lied before ... ... ... and light it as an advisor court application and they also purposely withheld key information like at the fact that Hillary pay for it or how much of these are crimes here\nOr the God Forbid I get cancer or the God Forbid I getting a bad accident right\nRight and you you don't have a car insurance for gasoline you don't have home owners insurance for lawn care insurance is for the big things and we've tried to ensure everything top down and that's led to the last you know really eight ten years of\nInsurance premiums that have doubled or tripled when we need to do is insured less which is how every other insurance product works they cheated that is means doctors have to make more of the services they provide affordable and they can if they cut out the middleman and streamline than a simple\nMath and how big is your practice how many patients do you have in your facility and at the same day in Wichita\nIn Wichita we have five doctors and over thirty two hundred patients\nUnbelievable and your age and you give concierge care at all I could pick up a phone and I'm getting a doctor at three in the morning that it's going to answer my call\nYou do you have and I could go down and see somebody at three AM in the morning\nIf you need stitches ... it's an emergency you know a lot of the tree and phone calls or chest pain which we might send the ER but a lot of times the kid who's sick and a mom who's worried and\nUm you of if you can avoid the ER you can avoid a thousand or two thousand dollar bill that's how you get health care health insurance is a card in your wallet health care is access to your doctor yeah\nAll right and then how many other practices around the country have you been able to to provide your model the day of duplicated how you you've been out and about and a champion of this for a long time\nYet we've helped over five hundred and fifty doctors convert to this model in the last few years but there's about a thousand total there in forty eight states every state except north and South Dakota right now but we have one about to launch in North Dakota [noise]\nUm and then it's even gotten a little bit international so um this is a a sound tried and true model\nYou know and what do you do Dr gross in terms of your president of duck a doctor patient care foundation you know now that we have alternatives that are working real life experiences seems to me that we ought to be able to duplicate it a lot more than we are\nAbsolutely a so doctor patient care foundation is a physician or on health policy playing because doctors never seem to be at the table when ever having been caught in a conversation about health care\nSo we put traditions are back in ... with the will to have conversations personally I I also have a primary care practice much like that with them here in southwest Florida a practice of health or plus when you was\nYou know why are we using insurance to pay for health are for basic primary care services all it does is create a ... tour you know where ... ... ... points as Dr Josh and we're seeing patients come to us\nFrom all over the state of ... and even from outside of the country\nWas ... medical tourism are and what we're finding is that you know not not the same thing got about health insurance we're just using it for all and you know when somebody is you know pay twice the amount of money for a service because they are how some shots\nWater we insuring it's using insurance drives up the cost of the product so ... cash price bras is two hundred and twenty dollars while using your your commercial insurance you know we go through all the the hoops to give it authorized\nYour co pays five hundred dollars or so we we see this time of the gang of the more people are are coming out of pocket to pay for health health or a with you signed up to ... more insurance seems to be becoming an optical\n... solution so when I'm pleased to see that but you know we're shifting the conversation from a coverage for everyone wants to talk about reducing the cost of health care that real close enough I was about ... upon us some help committee on this exact topic\nIt be a better idea I mean I'm watching for example they have this race out in California everybody's shock\nTo gather news and who's now offering free health care but everybody whether your pay a tax payer whether you're in the ... the state legally or illegally\nEverybody's got to get free health care well I basically put a sign that says come to California but you get sick um because people are going to go there now what's interesting to me is that a Republican is within striking distance and that gubernatorial race out in California because instinctively people no we can't afford to pay\nFor every illegal immigrant in the country\nAre but the reality is is that if I Lived in Wichita, Kansas I Would be a part of atlas MD and I would be your patient Dr ... because I I think it's the best deal I liked the idea of being able to call my\nDoctor whenever I'm sick or if I have a kid that sick every parent wants the ability to do that and you're sort of service provides it for fifty bucks a month now how much is the average in Wichita, Kansas cat is\nPlanet if the big things heart attack or accident or cancer how much would one of those plans cost\nAbout five hundred dollars to family\nFive hundred dollars per year or a month a month show\nAnd the current rates closer to you know a thousand twelve hundred a across the nation people are paying more for health insurance each month and they're paying for their mortgage\nThe Trump tax cuts only put a hundred dollars per household per month in and they're being credited with the economic boom of four point two percent GDP\nIf we fix health insurance we could put five hundred dollars back in the pocket of every household a the the real ... and the the politician there has in California is to send them on a ridge analogy just throwing more money at the problem has never fixed it\nThe what we're doing is Dr Lee and ourselves and and a thousand other physicians is is innovating and saying how do we get ... cheaper how do we make it so patients don't have co pays how do we provide stitches for no cost because they're so affordable [noise]\nUm you know actually looking at ways a fundamentally fixing the system that's what we need not just promises of more spending and if I could\nAdd up but that's just a a book you know as far as the cost of care is you know one of the people ask us as well how can I just get major medical you know we we can afford what what services the armor care practices providing but we just need something catastrophic\nWell Obama Care made that illegal or so little stretching just brought offshore export with access these major medical plan called ... short term medical ... and you know some would argue that these are actually true I'm sure they don't cover anything except the major medical expenses Seventy five dollars a month a\nLot but what it is this going to be implemented easily city by city town by town we can duplicate the model it already does take care of individuals with preexisting conditions if somebody wants to sign up for outlets MD and they have a preexisting condition or Dr ... denied them service\n... everybody's welcome and everybody is priced the same just based on age um we know we're going to work harder for some patients ... Wilson oh we're going to not have to work as hard for other patients and we don't want to be judged by their own\nWell it it really depends on what the oncologist says is the best medicine for that patient I'll be the first\nTo say their dollars a month of your breast cancer and need breast cancer treatment\nAs low as yet as low as depending on the chemotherapy or\nWe'd had patients who go you know we we find make the diagnosis sending the oncologist they say based on all of their tests and experience this is the best medicine for you they take it to the pharmacy they're quoted six or seven hundred dollars a month\nThey called us and said I Can't make it any better and we were shocked but the wholesale cost of that medicine to six dollars\nSo were inflating the whole system with paperwork and and and dropped or see me to streamline and innovate just like Silicon Valley does with anything else\nHow does this go all the other cancers that are out there leukemia and you know prostate cancer lung cancer\nSo shall we have a peace will come to some of the country was by were cancer\nOr an ... one of the Caribbean would cost or a hundred thousand dollars she came to us on the six months these uh uh and we did her surgery her her imaging every single or ... or ... thousand dollars low so that's a Ninety thousand dollar saving\n... at a hundred thousand dollars a conversation that she's going to die from thyroid cancer a ten thousand dollar ... dollars that's a good with the church raise money in a big sale\nA and you know considering that most people out of pocket expenses now for health insurance plans of eleven thousand dollars per year what do we ensuring when the once in a lifetime catastrophic won't can be treated mature for less than ten dollars into\nUnbelievable well look I Hope everybody will pay attention because in twenty eight days Americans are going to go to the polls in Obamacare won't work and we know the left and the Democrats want to keep it in\nA I applaud you guys for what you're doing and the fact that you've been able to duplicate the model around the country speak volumes about what your real mission is and that is saving people's lives in his very inspiring thank you both\nThings on we'll talk more about it in the day is coming up throughout the election eight hundred nine four one Sean ... telephone number when we come back\nWide open telephones if you want to be a part of the program straight ahead\nYou are listening to the best of the Sean Hannity showing stay tuned more memorable moments interesting guess and a lot of fun coming up next [noise]\nSo with your back against the wall and her birthday rent averse or he just days away who do you trust one eight hundred flowers dot com right now when you order a dozen red or multi colored roses\nTwenty nine Ninety nine a one eight hundred flowers dot com we'll give you another doesn't end up vase absolutely free choice between gorgeous red or multi colored roses is absolutely yours one eight hundred flowers dot com click on the radio icon\nWould in my last name Hannity one eight hundred flowers dot com promo code Hannity this offer ends on friday\nHi Michele I'm often hear one of the biggest outrageous I reported on was the trial of abortion doctor Kermit costs now how the woman goes into a clinic comes out there and there's no police report I helped expose the crimes the mainstream media tried to cover up we had instructions\nNot to divorce ... amazing Cormac does know is perhaps the most prolific through\nReading of B.
