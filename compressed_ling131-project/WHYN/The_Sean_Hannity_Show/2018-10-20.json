there there there's no covering this up if they have to admit that they did this ... and the details of this come out there\nBecause we think of this going to be some explaining to do I just encourage everybody to keep the whole global picture in mind here uh when doing we can't start World War three over this although stopped there has to be a some form of a upcoming queen by the Saudi some form of a of retribution there's no\nDoubt that they want to pass it on to people and the consulate and I don't believe for a second that they didn't know or at least the crown prince did no sooner than

we'll get back to the rioting that took place in New York in Portland over the weekend Sally cold shutdown of Pfizer self as part of the resistance but you'd never be a part of those trust me but break right back will continue\nIn New York between different groups some group that identifies themselves I never heard of them before Proud Boys\nA bird seed versus some other left wing protesters\nI'm a think any of this might be connected to the rhetoric that we've been hearing Maxine Waters and Eric Holder and Hillary Clinton you can't be civil and kick 'em and getting you know follow them into department stores and gas stations\nYou know maybe on the heels of nobody in the Democratic party condemning what happened up Pam Bondi here's the Nielsen the secretary of homeland security or Sarah Sanders or Ted Cruz and his wife in a restaurant or Mitch McConnell at an airport you know it's just play a little bit of uh some of the marching orders\nYou cannot be criminal with a political party that wants to destroy what you stand for what you care about that is why I Believe if we are fortunate enough to win back the house and during that twin civility can start again\nYour body cabinet\nPlease don't just come here today and then go home go to the hill today [laughter]\n[noise] we get off in the face of um Congress people\nShowing you know when they go low we

up in their face well I condemned the violence on all sides here I I don't ... patriot prayer proud boy I don't care who you are this is this is the United states of America is not you know some banana republic where people are out there killing each other on the streets everyday\nI invited on somebody that I disagree with strongly politically but I think makes a good point and condemns all of those with me\nOr Sally cone she's a of a super hard left wing or ... you don't mind me saying so they all through the book the opposite of hate and the host of a state of resistance a podcast or do you tell people to follow Pam Bondi and\nAnd Sarah Sanders family and and secretary Nielsen into restaurants and getting their faces and confront them and create a crowd and push back in ... that advice you give people\nSee you know Sean does this one where I first one Hi nice to hear your voice and\nThis is Kelly hates when she had surgery with me and she's going to now like\nI'm not I'm gonna I'm gonna tell you the answer is ah when I was working either you know before you and I met a community organizer I used to organize protests like see I'm going to people's workplaces or\nYou know not just the halls of Congress right which are that's where the people's business is supposedly done but we're talking people's lawns cetera\nUm you know look I support and free speech absolutist I support free speech on all sides so am I and the and these protests those sorts of protest now make me uncomfortable and look I did speak out against a you know going to you know in a costing people in restaurants or\nYou know what happened to stare at how these centers et cetera\nI Do think you are I I Love you said you're dancing 'cause you're kind of ignoring you know I I don't know what I'd like to punch I'd like to punch him in the face or not the crap out of them or you know maybe they should have been wrapped up or\nYou know that if we talk about violent rhetoric and we're going to look I think it's all bad but like ... rhetoric\nIs now the tactics of the the heart of the hard left you know people don't like when when the president says you know fake news and they're not real news people and their pony journal is I think that's just that's the exercise of free speech my hearing you write used to organize protests in front of people's houses\nYou didn't hear me correct yes why\nWould you do that knowing that there could be kids women and children in the house because I kind of a role leave the women and children all oh well I I I haven't met maybe maybe it will say that I don't know maybe I'll be accused of being\nSome of those policymakers might be winning so leave the husband and children alone to where the partners whatever again I'm not saying it a ... or some kind of bragging rights I'm saying it because I condition on that has changed\nBut we'll hire hearing now regularly issued these sound to me like marching orders creator crowd push back followed them into gas stations department stores restaurants you see a cabinet member you go at him getting their face\nI'm I'm not hearing the Republican side and my point to you is this look I I think it's very hard to try I I ... I wasn't there I only watched what when the fights that started the videos that that everybody's been putting on line and um\nI got to be honest I think Rand Paul and we saw what happened in the Brett Kavanaugh hearings during the hearings which is fine that was free speech I didn't have any problem with that at all but I think we've gotten to the point where we're going to have to kick out citizens so that the men and women are now hunger is\nGet to walk the halls without what's now becoming I think it's dangerous confrontations own interest\nIn protest on the left and and the right in Congress including disrupting during the by the way all within the last ... to\nIt but I don't have a problem with the with the speaking part but I Do have a problem if they're not letting these people walk there screaming at them they're in their face and if something's gonna happen Sally here's the praise my fear is just rhetoric is now crossed the line if you're talking about physical violence confronting members of the government\nYou know you know one thing I and I pulled by play it for you right now I always said about Obama the number one leave us kids alone that both he and Michelle seem like good pair\nAnd so they really did and I ... and I also said we've got to protect our presidents and I said it when Obama was president so many times I can play a loop of it if you like to hear\nWhat I don't need to buy what I Would love you to play it again look first of all\nYour during the ... of nonviolent protest the phone calls to petition the whatever those are the marching orders and second of all you have your seemed to be ignoring the examples that Donald Trump really when people were stood up protecting him saying well I got to hurt him if you can send you in court don't worry about it\nAnd you talk marching orders for violent\nOkay I remember one nothing is another one I saw sort of like well people are saying oh no no no no no if you want me the other question\nI didn't take that and it's the same intensity and messages I'm hearing regularly but this is an everyday thing that is now happening with the Democratic party by the way I have the evidence of me saying about Obama\nOnly play I mean ... you're talking about protecting the president of the United states of America and it's just there's no room for error you got to protect the president that that represents the free world\nSo they've got a very difficult job they've got to almost be perfect and anytime any incident happens ah lately is becoming pretty high profile I\nMissed the

as I said I didn't like those statements I did not support them I continue to not support them and at the same time what Maxine\nAnd others are talking about is a small woman water they're talking about is getting it's getting visible and active and and speak and that is part of democracy can be messy ugly and it is part of free speech and if we believe in free speech I mean I like it and I said I don't like it but I Will still defend now that\nThe trend that as well but I knew somebody is going to get killed mark on buddy is going to be severely hurt or killed ... we're getting as your
