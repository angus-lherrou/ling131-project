I Would I ran into um\nWhat's his name Blumenthal the Connecticut Senator\nAnd when I was in Washington went during the Capitol hearing said he was a total jackass during those hearings\nIs coming out of where I was going in and I said senator Sean Hannity how are you we had a very cordial conversation if he was sitting at a table I Would never I might go over and say you know send a drink over you know I might just because I disagreed vehemently with them I don't feel I have a right to tell them you don't belong here\nHe has a different point of view than I Do what we get to settle out at the ballot box\nI have I have a fear and when I say it wasn't him regarding myself but one of these people might walk up to me in a restaurant my fear is that my response will go viral\n[laughter]\nThat's my fear I mean I've asked myself how would I had to wait situation though man of the ... that's why I say I have a fair I'm like yeah I'm going to stand up well at all Amy the old me would come out and then I found it home with my wife told me would come out and then it will go by what my response will go by what but I think they pick and choose the targets that's exactly\nWell may be but you know I listen I train five days a week an hour and a half ... and they know this well it's a it's it's not going to stop crazy people\nBut I got to tell you something I Will walk I Will do everything I can do to walk like I Do part of martial arts all the arts that I practice we ... we bow out if we're doing weapons training we show great respect if we're doing grappling or or\nOutright full contact we do it with respect we respect the tap we were you know we're not there to kill each other we're there to make each other better\nI'm so there's a certain discipline David associated with that and but most people age don't know how to defend themselves and be they're going to react like that's just not then they're going to get past and somebody's going to get hurt\nI couldn't agree more and it is a danger for people in the public square and especially people who hold themselves out as Christians whether you're a pastor or you have a Christian themed blackout you really gotta be careful at it but we do anyway we need to be civil and and when some people on Twitter ... and our other interactions\nBut I don't think that means we don't fight I don't think it means we don't uh communicate our ideas as passionately\nAnd as intensely as the left now that this is we don't have to get his dirty as they do\nWell I look I don't know I I we just had Newt Gingrich on and pass to what he was saying is between Cavanaugh I mean all these American\nValues that have have served us so well due process presumption of innocence and then you see that there was no core operation any of these charges\nIf the Democrats really cared about the issue they'd be going after Keith Ellison right now demanding an FBI investigation of an Cory Booker will be having an FBI investigation and Claire McCaskill's husband will be having an FBI investigation\nAnd Bill Clinton would be in jail for the rest of his life but they're obviously playing politics with with very important issue so the hypocrisy is there but between Kavanaugh the mobs the caravan that's happening and the fact that we've had on paralleled economic success fourteen state record states record low unemployment\nRecord low unemployment for African Americans Hispanic Americans Asian Americans women in the workplace are vets record low unemployment youth unemployment lowest ever I I'm hoping that people factor that in in fourteen days when they vote or if they vote early\nI think the man on the street will factor then I don't think the people on the street are stupid Democrat or Republican\nThen that stupid to party leaders are stupid you know but the man on the street they're able to see this process that they know that Kavanaugh was that whole cabinet issue was a sham they see the hypocrisy of the left on full display\nThey know that this a caravan is not simply a random\nOccurrence that you know a a all these unconnected people just randomly deciding to all walk thousands of miles to America to look

O. J. what's up Joe how are you glad you called sir\nJohn ... the number one supporter of Donald Trump in the country I think he's the best president moral history he needs to send troops down to stop this invasion and I think you would agree with that we just can't afford to take all these people and we we have a Twenty one trillion dollar debt and so I Hope he will send troops down to stop this invasion of our country\nWill be nice of Mexico did their job and Mexico would stop them in their country and\nYou know now they're trying to precipitated crisis that could be a really disastrous for everybody involved in this\nAnd yet you keep reading reports that you know people are being well taken care of well fed food and water you know the goal is to get them up to a southern border but\nYou know what's happened to the seven thousand is going to be ten thousand more is it going to be a hundred thousand more what do we know about anybody that is in this caravan you know everybody would come here because ... ...\nWell I think between and I've been saying this and I believe it I think between the horrible treatment of Kavanaugh the elimination of due process and the presumption of innocence meanwhile they're silent on Keith Ellison and they're silent on Cory Booker and they're silent on Claire McCaskill's a husband\nBetween all of that hypocrisy and between the caravan and the mob that were out all all over the place this weekend and the success and failure Obama's failure Trump's success I think that there's a lot to get people to get out and vote\nWe'll see what happens in Fifteen days though Joe thank you eight hundred nine four one shown our number Brian is in Lexington, Kentucky Brian how are you and we're glad you called sir\nSir I was calling about the migration and rush on our border and I want to know what your thoughts about who might be behind the scenes organizing this basically\n[laughter]\nMine's getting sicker every day I mean noticed the same thing the Maxine Waters you know you get a crowd and you follow these people into a grocery stores in department stores and gas stations and you tell them we don't want them here\nAnywhere anymore you know telling Henry Kissinger to leave the country Mitch McConnell not only did they tell Mitch McConnell to leave the country\nBut then they're talking about the guy smashed literally ripped\nHis leftovers I guess just maybe it's taken a meal home to somebody else\nAnd throws it outside the restaurant door banging on the guy's table somebody's going to get killed here you watch somebody is or hurt severely it it's going to happen then nobody on the left ever can critique their own side for the rhetoric they're using Anthony Scaramucci is with us I just finished cover to cover his ... brand new book\nUh and it's phenomenal and it's the Inside Story about Donald Trump it's called Trump the blue collar president\nAnd held billionaire living on Fifth Avenue identified the struggle a blue collar Americans had won the presidency you know those are the forgotten men and the forgotten women in this country and I don't think they're liking this mob mentality I don't think they liked the way judge Kavanaugh was treated ...\nAnd I don't think they like watching this caravan of thousands marching towards our border\nI mean they they literally are mishandling everything and so we're with what's happening is uh the the president has almost like this light showing like you know you and I were out on Long Island in the summer or parents would hang\nUp that insect light well the president has that the Trump Twitter insect light and they're all going towards the light in their vaporizing a Senator Warren she's got to get a DNA test\nShe's less of a Native American and your mate\nInto the vapors ... big caravan issue the way they're handling the care of an issue if the galvanizing his base that Kavanaugh's thing was absolutely ridiculous they were making up one story after the next they figured okay\nMe too movement seems to work there is no due process and the meat you meant let's take this guy that did very well credentialed judge\nOr he's got an impeccable adult life let's try to destroy him going back to Nineteen eighty one in Nineteen eighty two and so again right into the Trump Twitter insect vaporize or so so for me I'm enjoying this the polls are tightening of the end of the president's base is actually going to turn out\nMuch higher percentages and people predicted in so\nOnce again he's going to defy logic here I think we've got a very good chance to possibly ah keep the house we're certainly going to gain seats in the Senate and it couldn't happen\nWithout the energy and the ... President Trump\nWell if they do when I'll say this he's carrying a lot of these people on his back but you know what if you like Nancy Pelosi the dangers are what we're gonna have endless investigation higher taxes keep Obamacare open borders\nAnd the president is is battling back on all these fronts in Guatemala Honduras El Salvador he says they're not we're not able to do the job of stopping people from leaving their country and coming illegally to the U.S\nNow we will begin cutting off substantially reducing the massive foreign aid we routinely give them and Trump tweeted out every time you see a caravan of people the illegally coming are attempting to come into our country illegally\nThinking blame the Democrats\nAre not giving us the votes to change our pathetic immigration laws\nRemember the midterms it's so unfair to those who come in legally and he's right um well and and we don't know anything about the people that are coming here we don't know when when one thing about them and I know the media can be sympathetic because they want but you know who might mix in with the people that maybe just want a job is a big problem for us\nBut but it's but you but here's the other thing okay the American people intuitively notion that it's just all it is is he cheese recognizing with the legendary built for even one set about any country\nIf you have a welfare state in the United states does have one you need to protect your border because free market forces dictate that people will cross over that border\nTo participate in your welfare state and so every country has a strong border and so should the United states I don't get\nA you know ... on on on promoting my my uh my vote today in the last couple of days mom a lot a left leaning shows ... they go they go nuts so crazy on the president's\nResponse so you want to illegal immigration you have democratic and Republican presidents and democratic elected officials that have voted in the last I don't understand why just enforcing those laws have everybody ... ... ... well ...\nWhy don't they well it's a lot of things are we better off economically than we were two years ago\nBy every single objective measure the answer is yes the growth of the economy consumer confidence jobs created the number of people leaving food stamps or out of poverty eight million Americans so you know by every measure and more job\nOut of the bottom ten percent of the society showing the wages of five and a half percent according to the wall Street Journal over the last Eighteen months but as a direct result of the president's policies but also the fact that he cut the slack at the border\nAnd so he made it tightened up the labor supply and it's giving lower middle class families shot you know to have real living wages\nWell that's the story that you actually tell in the book by the way Anthony Scaramucci is with us all through the brand new book it's out today we put it up on Hannity dot com it's on Amazon dot com and bookstores everywhere it's called Trump the blue collar president I first heard that term from one of his sons of his either Erica Don I don't remember those Donnie\n... get it on he called them the blue collar billionaire yeah and then they said ... Don if you don't mind going to hijack the nickname and just switch out billionaire and put in President he was at the end of the day he resonates with these people for a reason\nYeah look I I I think it is and you talk a lot about his background you you talk a little bit about your family background it's similar to my background and and it's amazing because the only thing that I really care about what motivates me it's not politics itself it's not a game to me\nBecause the policies that we have in a country as we do now greatly impact whether or not people are on food stamps or whether or not there are jobs we now in two years\nHave us a scenario that is not unfolded in this country since Nineteen sixty nine and that is we have a million more jobs than we have people on unemployment you know that I identify with that that's what you identify with you you did not have any better than your mouth\nAnd you know I saw it as a dishwasher at twelve and and look what you started I you know\nSean short list that I mean I think that's the message and I think that's the reason why you're so clearly popular at the end of the gay America is about aspiration\nIn America is about passing
