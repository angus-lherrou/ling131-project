Springfield\nI made that viral moment of Lindsey Graham literally just shook the entire hearing as it relates to judge Kavanaugh and Senator Graham of South Carolina joins us right now he's on the Senate Judiciary committee\nA senator good to talk to you thank you for joining us there's a lot going on Mitch McConnell just earlier said that the FBI report will be finished and we will have a boat on Capitol and uh I assume it's going to happen at some point this week do we have any any timetable idea\nI don't know yet but uh I think that's correct so here with the agreement or with our colleagues\nAnd Chris Coons was never part of the agreement he's a Democrat from Delaware L like Chris but he was never part of the ... what compromise has been reached for Chris Coons he is voting no he's asking for the investigation to continue our around whether or not he's been honest about it as drinking habits so Chris Coons is a non factor here\nLisa Murkowski Susan Collins and Jeff Flake expressed a desire for the FBI to talk to the witnesses around the Ford allegation and mystery Maris and the fall and incredibly any credible lead\nWithin a week I think the FBI is about finished everybody can look at that report for themselves and said this changed anything I Hope we don't move the goalpost Geoff oh did you sing committee with the understanding that he wanted to see what the FBI found about these accusations and hopeful and get this done this week\nAll right let's talk about this agreement because it was supposed to be limited in scope and now it is expanded out further we now see the ... ah your your colleague on the Senate Judiciary committee the great senator from the state of Hawaii who wants men by the way to sit down and shut up\nYeah which was a pretty outrageous statement but anyway as senator her own out now is saying she wants an F. FBI investigation into the quote I throwing report yeah\nYeah that's where we are so my dad owns a bar\nAnd so a throw in ice is like a good day in a bar so the bottom line is this whole bunch of BS and she's not part of the agreement she voted and she's the one that said the goal was to lay\nA the hearing long enough to get into the mid term soon and I have a Democrat replace\nA Justice Kennedy in twenty twenty she said that not one media outlets said ask her what did you mean but they're great and then I just outlined it was the three witnesses that Dr Ford named mess for ... isn't there any a credible leads within that world of FBI will follow them and that's it and we're going to vote this week\nOkay let's talk a little bit about your on the program last night on on Hannity and I thought you dropped\nA huge bomb shell and I was asking you look I have no idea how Jeff Flake is going to end up voting in this I have no idea what Lisa Murkowski is going to do I have no idea what Susan Collins is going to do\nOr they are your colleagues maybe you up some more insight than I have but to me they're the ones that met privately with Joe Manchin and they decided on this course now that it's an FBI investigation but\nRight close to be limited in scope is now expanded out into other allegations but if you fall one vote short you end up with a pretty interesting and thoughtful idea that I kind of like\nWell I think we've got the votes and then some but here's the question does the Republican Party abandon Brett Kavanaugh we legitimize\nThe way he was treated if the Senate is it forty nine what I Would like to see happen\nIs to appeal the verdict at the Senate\nAnd the November election and take it to some of the states and see if the people in those states agree with senator about Brett Kavanaugh the swap would abandon capping off the traditional way of doing business is if they fail one vote short just pull the plug\nHe's never quit I don't want to quit on him so I think Trump might be different I think Trump would say listen this man's been abused I'm not given up on him\nHave an election to see if the vote in the Senate really represented the Trump states were Democrats a rain\nWell I mean this is the thing I mean we have people like Joe Donnelly ... he's a no he said already Claire McCaskill's know already as a matter of fact yeah most Democrats would know no matter who Donald\nTrump s ride they've already against score six\nYeah All right so now what's gonna happen to Bill Nelson of Florida and Joe Manchin and Heidi Heitkamp and Joe Donnelly and\nWell a smart question Martha\n... a great candidate for the Republicans in Arizona most served their country with honor and distinction I Hope she wins um we certainly could use a win out in Nevada or do you think this impacts the race and do you actually think you're going to get the votes and why do you think you'd get the votes\nWell number one I think we're going to get the votes because Jeff voted in committee yes I don't believe the FBI is going to find anything\nA relevant to this limited investigation that would show that that are ... Ford's planes are more credible and that there's anything new about Brett Kavanaugh in terms of the investigation\nI Would hope they would stay consistent with this vote I think the other two Collins and Murkowski or friends they're warning the FBI to check the committee's homework I get that\nThat will be done here shortly but you're asking the hypothetical I Can't imagine how we would explain to the Republican Party\nThat we gave up on Brett Kavanaugh because for one vote short\nWhen a lot of the states that led to that vote being short Trump won I Do not believe North Dakota once a highly had camp to vote no I agree with you I Am so this is why you have an election\nAppeal the verdict of the Senate if we have to\nTo the people of of the country and November\nLet me ask you if you've spoken to the red state Trump state Democrats that are up for reelection if you talk to any of\nThem doing it right now uh\nSo you mean you're you're communicating Hannah though I'm not sure if they're all Hannity listeners and viewers are beyond doubt\nI doubt it they're lifting I think we're fine but here's the dilemma that you that this process has put us in this is about the future of the judiciary\nThe stays couldn't be higher is about the reputation of one of the finest man I Know it's about who would come forward after this debacle is about setting the tone and the standard that will destroy the ...\nAnd eat the Senate alive\nSo I Know President Trump pretty well I think we've got the votes and then some but I think he's a different kind of politician\nThat he wouldn't let the system get off the hook\nThat if we had to as a last resort where one vote short let's say hypothetically we would take this issue to the ballot box in about thirty something days\nThirty five we can I find that extra vote that way we would have a good nominee or have the lights salvaged have a process uh fate and the people finally get to speak up here\nI think we're fine but you asked me a question and I thought about this yesterday and said if Brett Kavanaugh is on the ballot in some of the states\nI think it changes the election you see in North Dakota there's a poll out today the number one issue in North Dakota is a Brett Kavanaugh's nomination is far ahead of anything else sixty to twenty eight people in North Dakota North Dakota support Brett Kavanaugh\nAll it's fascinating to me that the Democratic leadership is showing no support or comprehension or understanding of what their colleagues from states that are not New York and California have to go through in terms of reelection but the reality is\nThat I Would even argue that if they do vote for cabinet oh it's only an election year conversion and there were only doing it because if they don't the people in their state will throw him out but they'll probably go right back to being a party line vote would Schumer at the end of the\nDay well you know I'm I'm not a psychologist or a political scientist I don't care is like you know I'm a bad this I don't care how you find Jesus as long as you do you know if you can figure out that Brett Kavanaugh was highly qualified and these accusations have crumbled\nAre good for you and now here's the point\nThis has become the most despicable thing I've seen in Washington and that's saying a lot\nIt would change the face of the judiciary forever if we condone it so it's just not a complicated issue for me if we follow vote short a less take this to the ballot box and see what happens\nLet me ask you about this whole process now we've gone through and and I do think the Republicans and you know I'm pretty honest broker I'm pretty critical of Republicans when they're wrong I Do think that they they have handled this with the seriousness the charge deserves\nA them ... [noise] yes no I think they handled properly because these are serious allegations but she identified in and look I won't go through the ... the entire\nWe don't need to we don't need to reach try this case I made I don't mind you've made up your mind there five accusations that have are are are not verified or just made up not true outrageous so it's not about Cabot I'll\nPut that on them is

Kavanaugh and his friend mark judge can spike punch at parties in our interview she said she saw them near the punch but did not specifically say she saw either man's spike it\nChanging the Brett Kavanaugh you know fighting a punch putting Brian Hi and I I saw him gathering rent solo cups to quite a few girls during that time frame I saw him around the punch bowl or the punch campaigner is\nI don't know why he did but I saw him by them or their friends who are a number of these parties to remember how I think everybody in the county or members of the park and we have we haven't heard from us friends so I'm asking you know are there people alive today I had a party so yeah there are people that know that that is part and he's\nThis morning sweating it provided for names for him she says went to the parties with her one of them said he does not recall a Julie sweating it another friend she named is deceased we've reached out to the other two and haven't turned back\nRight twenty five now totally a top of the hour there's NBC News going forward with nothing at all this was was absolute how\nDoes this past spring news story\nWhen on top of everything they even admit there's massive inconsistencies from the statement she released just a week ago you would things you can stay consistent in a week\nAnd the people that she says would corroborate remember she's charging here that there was a ... a systemic party culture\nWhere almost every weekend that women girls young girls were being drugged with ... and and ... forced to be an ... and young boys would then lined up\nOutside the rule waiting to gang rape women and girls and that does happen thirty six years ago\nAnd nobody ever ever ever told a parent told a teacher told law enforcement and she gives the names just like in the case of professor Ford of individuals that would quote\nCorroborate this story and it's not corroborated just the opposite well this guy is dead and on top of that than we've got oh this one doesn't even know who you are\nHow does this how do you where is the news standard in any capacity here\nTo put this on the air Byron York is joining us he's been running a lotta columns about there's not the least of which is how high the bar\nHas risen in the goalposts we've come a long way from oh it's going to be very limited in terms of the FBI investigation it's only going to be maximum a week and they'll get the job done and will move forward with a vote now you see that a Camille Harris she's now coming out with another allegation just today\nMyron\nHey Sean listen on this on this NBC thing I think everybody's got to be in two minds about it a war on on the basis of the lack of governance and all ah there's no way the story if you've ever had been reported publicly just shouldn't have best\nBut it was given in part a due to the news networks um same about Michael I have an ... her lawyer so\nOnce it was all out there the fact that NBC has recorded this is probably a good corrective or at least where you can see what I think what it was a parent to a lot of people are ... there was nothing to this story\nUm and when she offered a witnesses who could corroborate the stories you just played a one had no idea who she was\nAnother was deceased and to others didn't answer the phone so I'm the story is already out there and has already gotten the damage it is a good thing to knock it out\nAll right so let's go through all three cases that the the Democrats now want to expand the investigation they they never wanted a limited investigation they want to know fledged investigation is now being the seventh\nFrom every indication at all I'm reading though that the FBI is moving expeditiously and it seems like they're very close to probably completing their work but if we start with professor Ford professor Ford claimed\nThat these four people were at the party nobody remembers any such party that she describes\nAnd the one person that supposedly was an eye witness\nTo the charity knowing that there's been a condition applied to it that it's got to be used for your care one I don't think the nursing home can accept it and to the trustee would reach us by do share duty if it then did that distribution remember a gift to a charity that benefits you\nIs not a gift to a charity it's a gift to yourself right\nAnd the other fair hearing officer said

for your free copy of Todd's brand new designing guide eight six six eight for eight\nFive six nine nine that's eight six six\nAnyway well Deborah Katz is the one that well she didn't really believe Paula Jones and she did take Al Franken side\nAnd you know as you know you just you've got to watch this\nIt there's no end to this now they are not going to stop until they get a no vote on bread terminal that's\nJust this this should not surprise anybody and Jeff Flake is now in Massachusetts today trying to run for president thinking he's going to which by the way it is a way to do it you don't like Trump go beat him in thirty six days\nDemocrats they'll make their case\nAnd they're going to ask you to give the house of representatives to Nancy Pelosi and the Senate but the Democrats to Chuck Schumer if that's what you want on election night in thirty six days and you want to turn on the TV and find out the results it'd be a stay home well you'll get the government you deserve we always do\nYou want all progress that we have now achieved in two years to stop that will happen too but all the senators saying well no no no we got to limit the scope but it's got to be very quick expeditious in and just have the FBI do this that's not what they ever intended\nThey want this to drag on through the mid term elections in the hope that Donald Trump doesn't get to make is cream court nomination\nAnyway joining us now is Carrie Severino she's the chief counsel and policy director\nFor the Judicial Crisis network a welcome back to the program well as predicted the bar has shifted and now the Democrats won an extensive FBI investigation but from my standpoint as it relates to professor Ford there's really only for people that need to be interviewed and I would assume by now all four of them probably were\nI'm sure they were it was either find people because they already had been interviewed\nBy the Senate Judiciary committee look the the the goalpost are moving faster than the speed of light here it's it's very difficult to that could believe that any of these people\nUm it it can take themselves seriously they said\nIt's going to be four days a week and now they're going I an artificial deadline you know they were saying the FBI the gold standard there impartial there you know she works at that at every Democrat that\nNow they're going up the Trump is evil puppet master controlling the FBI are actually going to be as horrible part is an organization you know it it it\nIt is and it would be laughable if it wasn't a man's life long reputation here on the line [noise]\nTickle your jokes that are doing two weeks ago as far as everybody else knew Brett Kavanaugh had an impeccable reputation that is now that's gone forever he'll you know re Donovan famously one said after being investigated for a year and a half where do I go to get my good name back mhm well in this case\nI I don't think Brett Kavanaugh ever gets back in many many ways I mean Clarence Thomas will forever be remembered because of the last minute accusations of Anita Hill\nYeah it it it's very discouraging although I have to say I I Do get some on that you know someone who clerk for Justice Thomas and knows the why he he you know there are certain ... ... people who are going to get simply use that as their excuse is counted but anyway this couch them because they disagree with them any way\nOn a clear someone who does commanding incredible amount of respect on that that judge Kavanaugh is a kind of person where even when he was on the DC circuit as a lower court judge the Supreme Court\nThey saw him as someone to really take seriously you know more than a dozen times they fought to fourteen different times he found out they vindicated his opinion they had a huge amount of respect for him I don't think that's going to change I think um they are not going to\nBe watching this with the same knee jerk or part is in response as I Hope that that that we're seeing some some of these people are ... but but it's\nThe parents' reputation now\nIf you read James Comey's New York times piece that he came out with the ... it to me it's absolutely stunning\nAnd the things that he's saying because while the FBI's packet in the middle of it when we handled the Hillary Clinton email investigation while he was running an exoneration himself prior to the real investigation which didn't happen until three days before he publicly exonerated her\nUm but then he goes on to trash the president at length\nAnd then he talks about FBI agents are experts which they are and interviewing people and quickly dispatching leads to their colleagues around the world to follow up with additional interviews\nAnd they will confront people with testimony and other accounts and\nYou know yes the alleged incident occurred thirty six years ago but FBI agents no time has little to do with memory um which I found a little strange\nUm and then you know for example everybody remembers if it rained on their wedding day uh I don't think that's a political in that particular sense maybe to somebody who is traumatized by could see that but for somebody that's not traumatized maybe not\nUm once they start interviewing every witness knows the consequences he says\nIs one thing to have your lawyer submitted statement on your behalf it's very different thing to sit across from two FBI special agents and answer their relentless questions of course the bureau won't have subpoena power only the ability to knock on doors and ask questions most people will speak to them that there is what he says refusal to do so\nIs its own kind of statement now I Want to just address that because my FBI friends my friends in the in the bureau special agents have all said to me never ever\nTalk to the FBI unless you have a lawyer ever and I'm like why I'm somebody who loves the FBI I don't love the upper brass on their Khomeini and the cave and struck and page but the FBI is is the FBI people I Know the salt of the earth people and I sort of course I Want to help him he goes no\nAnd then they say look what happened to General Flynn General Flynn is accused of lying to the FBI and the FBI I didn't think he was willing to them and you just it's dumb to ever talk to any law enforcement\nWithout a lawyer that's what all my law enforcement people friends say because it's a crime if you lie to the FBI let's say you said something in the Senate Judiciary investigation and it doesn't exactly match up you could be charged with a crime of lying to the FBI it's ridiculous\nAnd you know the the irony that says look he he told me coming ammo right now is just to try to destroy the Trump with everything he can and it's just another another section in that play book\nBut the Iranian exact same federal law provision that says it's a crime to to lie the FBI is the one that says it's a crime to lie to the Senate and they're with their that's getting it's not just you know a similar penalty is exactly the same statutory violation so\nThat's just not they've been kind of pretending there's that that I guess playing a little bit on people's images maybe from the movies of what the FBI guys to say that they somehow it's going to be a separate different thing what they're really doing here is there going down the same list to people\nThe Senate Judiciary committee has already talks to they're getting the same statements in some cases they might get exactly the same thing because the FBI can't ... can't force them to talk to them especially if all you know it\nI don't remember that I wasn't there they can they could be dealing with taking the same\nExact statement from the same lawyers for the same the same individuals that that's ... that that is all we can no ... just because of the nature of the old investigation so the FBI\nThe protests are shouting I Will not consent and shame on you as senators were making their votes there were also protest today outside the U.S Capitol and the Supreme Court opposing the cabinet confirmation the majority supporting Dr Christine Blasey Ford who accuses Kevin ... of sexual assault\nPresident

[noise]\n\n\nAll right let's go to our busy bones Eric is on Florida Eric Hi how are you and welcome to the Sean Hannity show from ah the swamp the sewer that is Washington DC\nI shouldn't have me on and I'm ... ... talk around there earlier um I grew up watching a and you cannot cross by reminding me and my dad who were just he just died a few weeks ago and so I think you'd be happy me calling him getting on to your show so\nI appreciate it you know cross fire was a defining show in the history of political debate in the country and and Pat Buchanan and breathing and all those original guys there there was an amazing show of its time\nYeah so I can empathize with I'm Brett Kavanaugh was one of those middle school nerds that you know it was probably watching those types of shows them the during the things that people want to block now but I'm In any event I think there's a silver lining potentially till the FBI investigation number one for so where conservatives we have a moral compass if we\nA senator good to talk to you thank you for joining us there's a lot going on Mitch McConnell just earlier said that the FBI report will be finished and we will have a boat on Capitol and uh I assume what's gonna happen at some point this week we have any any timetable idea\n... I don't know yet but uh I think that's correct so here with the agreement or with our colleagues\nAnd Chris Coons was never part of this agreement he's a Democrat from Delaware L like Chris but he was never part of the ... what compromise has been reached for Chris Coons he is voting no he's asking for the investigation to continue our around whether or not he's\nBeen honest about his drinking habits to Chris Coons is a non factor here Lisa Murkowski Susan Collins and Jeff Flake expressed a desire for the FBI to talk to the witnesses around the Ford allegation and ... and the fall and incredibly any credible lead\nWithin a week I think the FBI is about finished everybody can look that report for themselves and said this changed anything I Hope we don't move the goalpost Jeff voted yes in committee with the understanding that he wanted to see what the FBI found about these accusations and hopefully get this done this week\nAll right let's talk about this agreement because it was supposed to be limited in scope and now it is expanded out further we now see the ... ah your your colleague on the Senate Judiciary committee the great senator from the state of Hawaii who wants to men by the way to sit down and shut up\nYeah which was pretty outrageous statement but anyway a senator Hirono now is saying she wants to nip FBI investigation into the quote I throwing report\nYeah yeah that's where we are so uh my dad owns a bar\nAnd so a throw in ice is like a good day in a bar so the bottom line is this whole bunch of BS and she's not part of the agreement she voted ... she's the one that said the goal was to delay\nThe hearing long enough to get into the mid term soon and I have a Democrat replace\nA Justice Kennedy in twenty twenty she said that not one media outlets fed ask her what did you mean but they're agreement I just outlined it was the three witnesses that Dr Ford named mess for ... isn't there any a credible leads within that world of FBI will follow them and that's it and we're going to vote this week\nOkay let's talk a little bit about your on the program last night on on Hannity and I thought you dropped a huge bomb shell and I was asking you look I have no idea how Jeff Flake is going to end up voting in this I have no idea what Lisa Murkowski is going to do I have no idea what Susan Collins is going to do\nOr they are your colleagues maybe you up some more insight than I have but to me they're the ones that met privately with Joe Manchin and they decided on this course now that it's an FBI investigation but\nRight close to be limited in scope is now expanded out into other allegations but if you fall one vote short you up with a pretty interesting and thoughtful idea that I kind of like\n[noise] well I think we've got the votes and then some but here's the question does the Republican Party abandon Brett Kavanaugh legitimize\nThe way he was treated at the Senate is it forty nine what I Would like to see happen is to appeal the verdict of the Senate\nAnd the November election and take it to some of these states and see if the people in those states agree with senator about Brett Kavanaugh the swap would abandon Kevin ... the traditional way of doing business is if they fail one vote short just pull the plug\nHe's never quit I don't want to quit on him so I think Trump might be different I think Trump would say listen this man's been abused are not given up on him less have an election to see if the vote in the Senate really represented the Trump states were Democrats or rain\nWell I mean this is the thing I mean we have people like Joe Donnelly he's a no he said already Claire McCaskill's know already as a matter of fact yeah most Democrats would know no matter who Donald\nTrump us ride they've already against Gorsuch\nYeah All right so now what's going to happen to Bill Nelson of Florida and Joe Manchin and Heidi Heitkamp and Joe Donnelly and\nWell a smart question Martha\n... a great candidate for the Republicans in Arizona most served their country with honor and distinction I Hope she wins um we certainly could use a winner\nA ... in Nevada or do you think this impacts the race and do you do you actually think you're going to get the votes and why do you think you'd get the votes\nWell number one I think we're going to get the votes because Jeff voted in committee yes I don't believe the FBI is going to find anything\nA relevant to this limited investigation that would show that that are ... towards claims are more credible and that there's anything new about Brett Kavanaugh in terms of the investigation\nI Would hope they would stay consistent with this vote I think the other two Collins and Murkowski or friends they're warning death the Atta checked the committee's homework I get that that will be done here shortly but you're asking the hypothetical I Can't imagine how we would explain to the Republican Party\nThat we gave up on Brett Kavanaugh because for one vote short\nWhen a lot of the states that led to that vote being short Trump won I Do not believe North Dakota wants a Heidi Heitkamp to vote no I agree with you I Am so this is why you have an election\nAppeal the verdict that the Senate if we had to\nTo the people of of the country and November\nLet me ask you if you've spoken to the red state Trump state Democrats that are up for reelection if you talk to any of\nThem doing it right now uh\nSo you mean you're you're communicating Hannah I'm not sure if they're all Hannity listeners and viewers beyond that\nI doubt if they're lifting I think we're fine but here's the dilemma that you that this process has put us in\nThis is about the future of the judiciary the states couldn't be higher is about the reputation of one of the finest man I Know it's about who would come forward after this debacle is about setting the tone and the standard that will destroy the ... and eat the Senate alive\nSo I Know President Trump pretty well I think we've got the votes and then some but I think he's a different kind of politician\nThat he wouldn't let the system get off the hook\nThat if we had to as a last resort where one vote short let's say hypothetically we would take this issue to the ballot box and about thirty something days\nThirty five we can I find that extra vote that way we would have a good nominee or have a light salvaged have a process uh saved and the people finally get to speak up here\nI think we're fine but you asked me a question and I thought about this yesterday and said if Brett Kavanaugh is on the ballot in some of the states\nI think it changes the election you see in North Dakota there's a poll out today the number one issue in North Dakota is I'm Brett Kavanaugh's nomination as far ahead of anything else sixty to twenty eight the people in North Dakota North Dakota support Brett Kavanaugh\nAll it's fascinating to me that the Democratic leadership is showing no support or comprehension or understanding of what their colleagues from states that are not New York and California have to go through in terms of reelection but the reality is\nThat I Would even argue that if they do vote for Kavanaugh it's only an election year conversion and there were only doing it because if they don't the people in their state will throw him out but they'll probably go right back to to be in a party line vote would Schumer at the end of the\nDay [laughter] well you know I'm I'm not a psychologist or a political scientist I don't care is like you know I'm a bad business I don't care how you found Jesus as long as you do you know if you can figure out that Brett Kavanaugh as highly qualified and these accusations have crumbled\nAre good for you and now here's the point\nThis has become the most despicable thing I've seen in Washington and that's saying a lot\nIt changed the face of the judiciary forever if we condone it so it's just not a complicated issue for me if we follow vote short a less take this to the ballot box and see what happens\nLet me ask you about this whole process now we've gone through and and I do think the Republicans and you know I'm pretty honest broker I'm pretty critical of Republicans when they're wrong I Do think that they they have handled this with the seriousness the charge deserves I\nThink ... [noise] yes no I think they handled it properly because these are serious allegations but she identified in and look I won't go through the ... the entire\nWe don't need to we don't need to reach try this case I made I don't and you made up your mind there five accusations that have are are are not verified or just made up not true outrageous so it's not about Cabot off\nFor them is that this is the environment we live in senator and I warn those arguments on radio and TV every two and four years\nIf you're a Republican or a conservative and you're running for office you're going to be called a racist or sexist appoint a massage it is the home of ... Lama polled you're going to be accused of wanting dirty air and water you're going to be accused of wanting to kill children\nAnd it's got to be all look alike of youth throwing a grandma over a cliff [laughter] it is as predictable as the day is long and now with Supreme Court nominees\nThis message is brought to you by America's family physicians\nReveals you try again whether she use radio by W. H. Y. N.\n[noise]\nRight as we continue with Senator Lindsey Graham of south\nCarolina as we continue also from DC um Saturday look where's this go from here you mentioned earlier that in fact that they're not going to be good people that ever want to say yes to get positions like this I wouldn't say yes who wants to live through this\nWell I think the the contrast asked a question here said there's a report out today or poll out today that at the FBI supplemental background check doesn't change things\nSixty percent of the people leave the judge Kevin I should be on the bench so if if if that doesn't you know all I can say is it the stakes are high who would follow Kevin after this\nThey will destroy everything we stand for us Republicans if we legitimize this it only happens to why is it always just a\nThis is a time to fight back stand behind Kavanaugh getting the votes he needs he's a great judge and destroy what I think it's been a process that will destroy the country\nI got to tell you I don't think anyone would even want to run for office under these conditions or you know even for you taken a strong position I mean you've been mirrored in slandered or if I all the right people just so yeah I mean people that hate me too so I have you okay [laughter]\nWell I don't think you'll find that I I don't think you had a finer moment and all the years I've known you and you know we've had disagreements over Alina cake but Kagan Sotomayor there's two but I think right now where you're righteous indignation and your leadership has has stood out and I applaud you for all you've done and\nAnd uh I Hope it works out the right way thank you sir\nThank you for the research you do to prove fact versus fiction you're you're the best on television talk about what actually

punch Brian Hi Hi I saw him giving random fellow cops to quite a few girls during that time frame I saw him around the punch that when the malls or the French campaign or is\nI don't know why he did

does not recall and Julie sweating it another of the French she named is deceased we've reached out to the other two and hasn't turned back\nRight twenty five now totally a top of the hour there's NBC News going forward with nothing after all this was was\nAbsolute how does this passport news\nStory when on top of everything they even admit there's massive inconsistencies from the statement she released just a week ago it would things you can stay consistent in a week\nAnd the people that she says what corroborate remember she's charging here that there was a ... a systemic party culture where almost every week at that women\nGirls young girls were being drugged with ... and and ... forced to be an ... and young boys would then lined up outside the rule waiting to gang rape women and girls and that this happened thirty six years ago\nAnd nobody ever ever ever told a parent told a teacher told law enforcement\nAnd she gives the names just like in the case of professor Ford of individuals that would quote\nCorroborate this story and it's not corroborated just the opposite while this guy is dead and on top of that then we've got oh this one doesn't even know who you are\nHow does this how do you where is the news standard in any capacity\nHere to put this on the air\nByron York is joining us he's been running a lotta columns about there is not the least of which is how high the bar has risen in the goalposts we've come a long way from oh it's going to be very limited in terms of the FBI investigation it's only going to be maximum a week and they'll get the job done and will move forward with a vote\nNow you see that a Camille Harris she's now coming out with another allegation just today\n\nMyron hey Shaun McCutcheon owner under is going to be a thing I think everybody's got to be to mind a war on on the basis of the lack of evidence and uh there's no way to store if you're ever had been reported publicly sugar\nBut it was given in part a where due to the news networks I'm praying about Michael ... her lawyer\nSo what we call out there the fact that if it was recorded there probably were good correct or at least we can create what I think where it was a parent to a lot of people are there just was not going to the story\nUm and when you offered a witness to corroborate the stories you just played a one hit the writer who she was\nOn the other was these parents who are good answer the phone so I'm the story is already out there and has already gone to manage it is a good thing to knock it out\nSo let's go through all three cases that the the Democrats now want to expand the investigation they they never wanted a limited investigation they wanted to know floods investigation is now being the seventh\nFrom every indication at all I'm reading though that the FBI is moving expeditiously and it seems like they're very close to probably completing their work\nBut if we start with professor Ford professor Ford claimed that these four people were at the party nobody remembers any such party that she describes and the one person that was supposedly was an eye witness\nTo the alleged abuse in her case was mark judge and he said
