the reason why I said this is because of the fact that\nA couple of nights ago I did a show called new new justice no peace [noise] [noise] and ah I attempted to point out that ... the traditional way we think of civil war in this country is crowding the fact [noise]\nThere were already in one end well no one will attribute school shootings the pizza gate shootings Las Vegas attacks the symptoms of civil war in progress our leaders both left and right acknowledged that violence will be an inevitability in this country after the after the November election\n[noise] President Trump has warned\nThat there will be violence if the Republican Party loses the November's midterm elections and he stated that the rights of the American people were under threat from violent people\n... and I'm sure he mentioned he did mention that they were on the on the left many people have told me the left or violent Clyde you gotta start talking about how the left or violent yes they are violent\nI've seen it myself here in my own home town I seen it all over the country now this type of rhetoric do the Donald Trump talked about the violence if we don't when he's now being foot noted in being pointed out by the news that you know they're basically saying we'll see you see you see he wants violence [noise]\nYou see the arguments are such that they can be both ways [noise] and extremism\nBecame even more intense after CNN's Christian um and poor sat down with the interview with Hillary Clinton I'll listen to what\nChristian ... says she talks about the mirror and the black

this process and she said it ... left wing conspiracy it echoes what you said about when your husband was being pursued by investigations back in the Nineteen advised white right wing conspiracy\nSocial you comment on that merit language and secondly\nDo you see any way even a conservative think who I was speaking of yesterday said the only way to repair America should try to get back to some civility and to try to make it even if we have to go disagreements we're not going to war with each other we're not trying to destroy each other\nWell certainly I Would love to see us return to civility listening to one another or working out our differences that is not the Republican Party that exist today and that is certainly not the administration that we have in power right now\nWhen the Republican Senate denied\nThe right of President Obama to have his nominee for the Supreme Court Merrick Garland a Kurd\nI think anything that they stole a justice from the ...\nI think they did I mean to keeping the court said open for a year\nOr to deny it distinguish jurists they could have voted down they could've said well for ideological reasons philosophical reason ah we're not going to vote for him but no they fell in love\nAnd that was that a breach a horn of Africa and the constitutional responsibility of the Senate to advise and can harm on nomination [noise]\nThat

a political party that wants to destroy you stand for and what you care about and that's why she said I Believe we're fortunate enough to win back the White House in the Senate that's when civility can start to get there you have a declaration of civil war and a license for violence\nDonald Trump said violence if the Republicans don't get the vote [noise] Hillary Clinton says violence until we get the boat or we we haven't since really until we get the votes so [noise]\nThe motive of course is getting what you want by any means necessary not not that their vote matters just how much trouble intimidation and instability you can create\n[noise] in order to change the direction of the vote and that's that's very disconcerting\nAnd it's on president I mean while while the media will say that Trump's words are to be expected they failed to expound upon the comments she made Hillary Clinton made no one not even an interviewer\n[noise] Christian I'm a poor [noise]\nShe didn't stop her and
