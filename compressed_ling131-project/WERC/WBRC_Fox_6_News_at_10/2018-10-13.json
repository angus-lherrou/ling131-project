he's not nearly as much of a a an arch conservative as a lot of people have been led to believe I just don't believe it I I don't think that it's accurate\nSo that's a thing that I Want everyone to remember I I Do think he's more of a Roberts type justice where he's going to try judicial ...\nOr from the bench and now we're generally as conservatives because we are trying to conserve right

Bush started the conversation about putting them back on the moon and twenty Fifteen and he said the natural with just a new spacecraft was called the crew expiration vehicle by two thousand eight and conduct the first band mission no later than twenty forty\n[noise]\nWhere we are four years after the fact nothing we don't we don't have men men started back on the moon again we're we're just really talking about sending the first speech to receive the same even land on the movie industry go around the moon\nBut the President Bush had a goal set of having a man on the moon living and working there by twenty twenty having a base there and it's not out of the question I mean if you look at what Bigelow Aerospace as up to with\nMaking these inflatable moon basically I could have been done even Mars base could've been done\nWell in two thousand nine we were told the natural was carrying out this LCROSS experiment and they were lying to us about it about what they were using it for they said they were looking for ice on the move there are plenty of missions prior to the moon landing plenty of missions like the Clementine mission where they were scouting out in the moon finding ice pockets\n[noise]\nAnd so they didn't need the LCROSS mission but ah of course NASA had five hundred million to spend on a rock and there's going to slam into the moon blow up and then a copy of created it's about six miles wide\nAnd uh you know people say oh my God they're going to new moon and they were going to do this two days or two days shy of the forty anniversary of first landing on the ...\nAnd there was a lot of stuff about that mission that did all add up didn't make any sense\nAnd\nTwenty love and after the LCROSS mission failed rock Obama cut funding for the proposed constellation program and the space vehicles he he basically cancelled the five year nine billion dollar effort to build new Orion spacecraft an aries rockets\nNew space vehicles were slated to replace masses three aging space shuttles and launch astronauts into orbit and onto the ... that was the thing but no Obama pulled the nine billion and they put the money towards better than I thought that climate change\nClimate science\nSo Obama kill the space program in order to turn out in the climate change beliefs and that's that's really sad I mean there was ever a time\nBut now that we went to the moon at all that with the time because it you know they just shut down you know here we have this dream or your money forward then Obama it's just not that we're not going to go so here we are and twenty Eighteen again been told that the moon is the goal and later Mars\nTo do stories today that I Want to tell you about that really helped me excited but uh some bad news first of all a Russia seems to be out of their minds a parent late may have detected would appear to be to colliding star\n\nAnd I think somewhere I have the sound of the stars will try and dig it up but uh yeah they they detected these stars are putting off a sound gate of weird sound and are there going wait a minute or these really colliding stars are we looking at a space armada coming our way\nAnd if they're moving is asked we think they're going to be here by twenty twenty two [noise]\n\nPutting I'm not kidding Russia found these colliding stars and cycling stars and they before them out there saying well if these look like cutting stars the sounds are giving off the map intelligence in them so they may not be gliding stars at all\nWhat are they well they are um are there are no mater of of huge space craft coming our way um\nNASA also reported today that Seventeen scientists often to report stating that searching for signs of life should be part of every future national mission\n\nThe breathing was offered by the national academies of Science Engineering and medicine it emphasizes the importance of including astrobiology the study about life originated on her than how it might evolve elsewhere in the University in every phase of all NASA missions destined for space from inception conceptualization to planning to development and operation\nSo once again we're Seventeen scientists saying guess what guys every mission that we do from now on is going to have the purpose of finding life out in space\nOnce again every\nMission is going to be about finding life in space that have to have a a quest of finding life in space Russia's says they picked up on to quote colliding stars that may be a space our mother heading our way\n[noise]\nSo I Believe that the reason why this is happening why they're saying hey every mission has to have a fact finding like giving whatever is because they have confidence that there's intelligent life out there and the recent reports of techno signatures in ... actually passed radio burst [noise] or the motivation behind the quest [noise]\n[noise] I don't know that it has anything to do what he's claiming stars are possible are modest coming our way but it certainly has a lot to do with a techno signatures\nAnd get this astrophysicist are now saying\nThat with all the thousands of exoplanets out there and and how they're uncovering new insights into the complexity diversity of life on earth the authors also sit in the briefing that not only are you going to be looking for techno signatures guys we want you to look for bio signatures [noise]\nSo this is pretty amazing don't you think I mean I think it's cool I mean this bolsters the chance at life could exist out there and therefore\nAll space exploration missions should incorporate technology and find traces of alien organisms [noise] bio signatures take those things I mean look I'm president of the universe is more crammed with plants and never before [noise]\nWe have two thousand three hundred confirmed exoplanets discovered by NASA's Kepler Mission and that leads the effort to six out of every ten stars could host Earth like planet so the sheer number of known exoplanets operas exciting opportunities for finding ... signatures\nFighting chemical markers indicating that yeah there's live out in space in the report\nSciences recommended at NASA accelerate the development of technologies to detect microscopic organisms citing the current lack of a single flight ready instrument can travel to a distant world and measure the composition of its elements minerals and organic matter\nA report also suggest that direct imaging systems that suppress star light should be used outside our solar system to improve detection of bio signatures from planet that might or but those stars [noise] NASA could also play more missions that that peer under the surface of exoplanets [noise]\nWhether or not they're rock the icy or ocean worlds defined
