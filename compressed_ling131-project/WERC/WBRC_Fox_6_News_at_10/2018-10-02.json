this uh evil intelligent dusty talking about right that um it's a it's everywhere and I remember we said that was in his intelligent evil dust\nAh because of this quote unquote top secret thing we revealed\nA back last month I mean even a few weeks ago I Believe about three or four weeks ago\nThat we talked about this leak classified statement that ah you know somehow they were releasing nanoparticles nano bought a and of course Muskie\nEven talked about the ... project with which is another nano technology type of project\nAnd nano domestic oil was with something that we were talking about in the theory in the in the deliverance of the of the notion in the interview classified statements and we said well look there in her but hey everybody had them everybody has picked up on them\nAnd of course a lot of that said well and everybody knows that this nano particularly is actually connected\nTo more gallons and I'm a Brad Olson called the program who's a writer and he said uh who has had more gallons or has more gallons he said that everyone can be tested for it and we all have their propensity to develop is because of the nano particles that are in our body\nAnd men I'll tell you people were like going this is nonsense it's a pseudo science this is crazy and now Julian Assange\nHe said that she made this he made the statement before he's he's last this was this was his last broadcast that he said before and we don't know what's going on will join his sons right now\nJust today well I don't have time to get right into it but uh it was funny because ah today is I was looking over\nSome of the reports\nAnd in the in the clip service I go in every day and they check out the clip service from these reports have links to all kinds of stuff with the stuff that I use the stuff that I don't use but I always have to see things in a follow up since then as I talked about the beginning of the program the blowback of course there's always blow back to some of this stuff but when you talk about in all blows back and\nYou have to say well look this is this is how it is now\nBefore we were talking about if you were like God\nThat and now it's like this is the real deal people smart cities uh they're they're saying well we have trillions without one trillion sensors that we have to put in place by the you're twenty twenty\nThe FCC saying you got six Ninety Days to start figuring out how we're going to install smart city networks in your part of the woods and you got to do it quick because if you don't we're going to go in and do it for you\n\nSo this will control spectrum is going to be mandatory by twenty twenty or at least moving into twenty thirty\nRight\nAnd so the FCC say it's got to be done it's got to be done it's got to be done and people are gonna be moving like crazy and of course you're going to have to pay for this installment of his new matrix of surveillance matrix they want to put in there but how are they gonna move all those sensors\nHow they had him put trillions of sensors ain't place by twenty twenty that's a lot\nBecause that's a lot of sensors to putting by but we've seen two years or even less than two years so how do they how do they fix that problem\nEvil intelligent dust that's the way they do it each easier to drop\nTrillions of nano particles the size of a grain of sand or a grain of salt and they can do it\nIn a less amount of time I'm sure there'll be putting sensors in the bigger and and and more capable\nAnd and fiber optic and all this stuff that people daddy and yeah the infrastructure is going to change and yeah the matrix of all things are going to change your city of tomorrow weights but while they're still trying to get things settled while they're trying to get the antennas in place for
