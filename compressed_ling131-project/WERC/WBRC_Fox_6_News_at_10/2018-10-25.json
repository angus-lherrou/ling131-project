I always know that\nWhen I when I get the areas as part of that is that the NBA crew\nWhen when they write in telling me I'm doing good on something I Know I'm really really do an excellent stuff

insider threat Taliban infiltration this keeps happening and uh in and they got a general a rustic and Afghan general\nAnd you know now they're going after senior military a very very senior military officers\nAnd we can't protective or senior military officers the masters of that sends all the way down\nThe uh the chain of command is no one safe anywhere in Afghanistan now that that's the message\nAnd it just goes to show you that uh we are not look we're not one of the war in Afghanistan my friends and we're not holding the line either in Afghanistan we're losing\nOur area of control was receding\nAnd we think that because we don't have that many of our soldiers doing front line patrols every day that they're not\nQuite in the same you know they're they're not really in harm's way quite the way they'd be at other stages of this war but there's still a threat and if things go really badly then it's going to be all hands on deck so to speak and that means our men and women are going to be the ones that have to keep ... from falling\nSo attached to thank you for the reminder I did read about that story and a dose of research on it\nI I have also reached out just a you know

baseball game\nI notice how I mean this does not seem to register with the media today this is all about\nBeing attacked on the on the left\nBe continued attacks on all political figures from shootings to attempted bombings are part of a civil war tactic that is becoming more and more pervasive these are attacks on the republic and the intelligence linked to the resistance is usually get for sympathy the truth is\n[noise] Democrats are not unique snowflakes [noise] they too will suffer the consequences of the civil war that they want to perpetuate and conservatives will also suffer
