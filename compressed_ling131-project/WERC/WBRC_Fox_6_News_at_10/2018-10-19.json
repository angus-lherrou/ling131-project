books that I've read and all books that I could\nVery much recommend to you ah so\nThere you go I Hope that's a good start that that was just off my Jindal on\nMy iPhone up that's what I was reading that one off\nSo Adam writes a book I'll keep as short as possible your show last night hit home when it came to how the left has radicalized at a form of psychological warfare is now going on not just with prominent figures like your self supporting the president or espousing conservative principles\nBut also regular folks like myself where if you outwardly express your belief in small government individual liberty et cetera you not only run the risk of being labeled a Nazi but also have your business or family threatened I Want to speak out but I have my own business and a family to protect to eight month old twins\nWhat's at liberty loving a person's supposed to do because I don't want to see the battlefield of ideas to left blog anonymously support your sponsors is I Do and also support outlets like see our TV on a road cetera I hate the idea of being anonymous\nUh because I'm not saying anything hateful I just say what I Believe and it's coming from a guy who didn't even vote for Trump extra listing taking care of the fight daily shields\nHigh uh yeah I I think you've got the right idea if this is not\nPast I mean if you do not actually work in conservative media don't suffer the consequences publicly of being a conservative unnecessarily now\nThat doesn't mean don't be a conservative because you're a conservative and how you act every day and how you deal with other people and how you view yourself as a citizen in this country are and you're also a conservative in the actions you take to support other conservatives\nSo while it is certainly a helpful for me and for the show and I tell you please do check out our sponsors pleased to use those codes you know that is how you show which you care about and that is how you show what what matters to you or because especially in a businesslike radio it's about every single person who listens to the show\nAll the support that you get from every individual\nHe's what matters and that's what gives you a show so who you listen to who sponsors you go check out and also you know what you do to support those who are on the front lines of the ideological fight those would all be ways that I Would say\nUh that's how you get into it and that's how you keep your shield high a\nGino writes dear book\nGreat fan of your army veteran guard instructor militaries joined it now ended up in the film business in LA\nI Would listen to your show talking about how immigrants are now know what to say at the border it reminds me of how we found pamphlets both in Iraq and Bosnia a when kicking down doors outlining exactly what they should say what country to go to and where to go in that country how much money they can ask for and expect and what they claim\nThat is why Europe as in filling the refugees fleeing economy's not war\nEurope has been deliberately flooded by these people the efforts and pamphlets were professionally printed in uniform I suspect a similar effort is taking place out of our border it seems there's a deliberate attempt to flood the west with people who not integrate a and deliberate effort among the intelligence services in Europe and especially Germany\nTo destroy any patriotic politician or effort to gain any power\nUm so there you go and if you never need a sofa in marina del Rey it's always year shield science or sharp Gino Gino thank you so much and thank you for ... thank you for your service\nAnd a marina del Rey sounds great but why specially this time here man it's already getting kind of cold here in in the swat man out now it's not just a wet damp place of\nNo morals and no scruples the swamp is now also getting cold\nWhich is not fun ah so that's something I got to keep in mind here as as I Try to get acclimated to being a swamp creature a but you know I'm\nGonna say uh you know ... this showdown that's coming at the border is orchestrated I Can't say by whom or how exactly but it's definitely it is definitely being put together by people the timing of this\nIs not an accident and this is going to be a ... this is going to be a real showdown for the country so we'll see um we have Brennan\nWrites a book and looking at Twitter today don't want the clowns gets you there talking at you know because you're a prominent you're becoming a prominent young voice\nA much respect keep up the good fight brown well thank you Brent and you know the clowns don't don't get to me um I I don't worry about that stuff and occasionally I have a little fun slapping around the trolls but I I generally ignore because it's just a waste\nA just a ways to engage with with him missiles and losers on Twitter why doesn't mean anything I like Twitter for falling the people that I Want to follow him for being able to communicate with all of you I don't I don't need Twitter\nFour left wing fake socialist cause I'm Marxist hipster wannabes uh that's that's not why on Twitter but occasionally got a buck slaps on people so you know you gotta do what you gotta do\nJames writes all this and people talk as me wondering how long are we supposed to sit in our hands when is it going to be fair to fight fire with fire Well James we don't want to become with the enemy already is\nAnd the good news is for all their whining and uh for all their upsetting is and everything else I think upsetting his is a word rage there you go that's better word a they don't have power right now they aren't going to get power either if enough Americans\nDecide to send them a review by showing up at the polls and making sure that they do not take power\nJackie rights or love your book I really try to watch rising\nCrystal never disappoints she always something that makes me say I'll never watch again oh well I decided to get another try to answer you didn't disappoint segment with guest Jennifer and Matt crystal laugh and ridiculed the guess Matt first comment about Texans and ...\nAnd then she stopped the conversation to tell the guests Matt that what he said I'm a beta was gross but wouldn't stop interrupting him or let him explain what he meant by the bitter remark\nShe was ruined and confrontational on her behavior church or gas was why I just can't watch rising crust will never fails to get elastic and to make one more comment disparaging though she disagrees with and I just get tired of it I ...\nI applaud your parents for teaching you to hold your tongue just let things go you do it every day on that show don't know how you do it shields I Love your book\nJackie ah Jackie I just thank you for your support and ah it is not is not an easy thing to sit and have to be\nRespectful writes wanting to sit with somebody and you could argue that every one and\nTry to own the lips but when you have to sit in and ... and be respectful of somebody else a day in and day out when you really really disagree I Will tell you it's not an easy thing to do\nA that is fair and as for the situation that you mentioned with that specific gassed [noise]\nYou saw it and what else can see it and um\nI Will leave with that that's going to be for that team thanks as always she'll tie [noise]\nThis reality redo we're going through a retro causality creating conspiracy theories that really are more than theories but attempts to somehow put reality into prospective without letting anyone know but secretly tucked away and all of our utility drawers he's a tinfoil hat that will probably where it because we know that no one truly lives of the universe is fully objective [noise]\n\nI mean what we're seeing limited concepts of time we're hearing about\nHow there are different dimensions we're hearing about there are different ways of thinking we're hearing that you know we're hearing in the quantum immortality I mean science is basically going all\nParanormal and they want to quantify all the paranormal and a scientific way scientific way like ah they want to be halfway with their religion and they want to eat half way with the conscious that they want to do ... and this is where I've spoken to bore about how here we are\nGoing to ship this ... this is a a major paradigm shift\nAnd we have a temporal blind spot in some regard because events happened or we perceive they do\nAnd then later we're schooled on the idea that everything we perceived\nAs wrong or\nWhat we think we know is not exactly what is in that somehow we reach a point\nWhere we're satisfied with their opinion and all that it's based on his bowl nebulous stimuli we all agree to this and it's like this is my opinion and this is my truth and you say\nWell it's not truth it's just what you think it is the it's all about your selective perception\nAnd we know that selective perception is necessary because we didn't have selective perception we would be transfixed by the hyper reality and sensory overload we're now getting today our brains are being filled with all sorts of sensory overload thing about it we have simple perceptions of light light like love survival spirituality God you know\nAnd then we're exposed to a media print television Internet videogames\nCell phones many other things that you do that are pushing the brain further and further\nAnd all that stimulus his place in a limited area known right there than compartmentalized area called the brain we don't know if the brain is limitless we've learned that in old age would boost memory\nAnd we lose perception of time I mean the brain can be objective if it chooses to however\nIt's emotion that is driving his eye guy since so there's this war going on between the brain and subjective\nExperience and this is what they call the explanatory gap where we've had to bridge the brain causes cystic springs emotion critical announcers were struggling with primary consciousness right now where we wonder if the experiences worth feeling at all we get this shoveled in this disenchanted experiences and feelings we get now are both natural and organic\nAnd of course\nNow we experienced virtual meeting hyper reality from electronic allusion\nIt's unfortunate that we're seeing more and more people\nResponding to the electronic illusion they're becoming a non player they're becoming a person who just sits there and watch it watch things that you know go in front of them they they they decide that you know it's better to read the script that it is to follow the follow their own hearts and follow their own minds [noise]\nSo there are a lot of people that are getting fatigued right now\nOver what George Orwell called double speak double speak actually disguises the nature of the truth\nGiving new meaning to words with what appeared to be scripted dialogue and it's provided by the party and it's never ending propaganda that keeps pushing and pushing and pushing see many people but if they're not had the the time nor the I guess desire to read the book Nineteen eighty four\nOr by George Orwell usually but you know they say things like a big brother's watching you ride ha ha ha you know or you know ignorance is strength or you know that kind of stuff they they know a few lines right\nBut big brother was not only watching in Orwell's dystopian he was capable of brainwashing and skipping the drones are groomed to follow the which is the ministry of love\nThe George Orwell was a British Intelligence officer and with his ability to see the possible future he predicted a totalitarian world with the government had corrupted the language forced the citizenry to believe lies as if they were truth and they were being tracked with the ubiquitous tell a screen\nThat was basically extent in every home place of business and public facility today we up till the screens there attached to our hands there and virtually every communication device so you're the first thing we look at it in the morning there the last thing we see at night [noise]\n\nThey are programming the masses with emails music can beams and with every algorithm we're slowly being coerced into following anything that seems to be calling her confirmation by so this process where not only beginning to wonder if someone is watching us we're also notice he was somebody is scripted us or is it Lee scripted some people and acting like\nWhat are now being called non player characters the non player characters and PCs or the newest beamed and it appeared on Twitter and Facebook and they seem to be a form of kind of propaganda against the liberal left\nNow\nNBC is a mean there are there are and the season games gamers do it in PCs are okay or actual NBC's or computer controlled characters and video games with limited scripted responses I'm given the parameters of the games which they appear for example NBC's bad sign missions to a player like in skyrim\nOr they joined the players a companion like in fall out [noise]\nBut they create is NBC me and what it is is that it's basically there to um to attack or mock what it's called left wing propaganda and I think\n... cleverly I I think it's being used cleverly to explain what we usually hear his program responses regarding things like fascism\nWhere it's like not seeing overused outright connections to the KKK and the NBC me mocks leftist and they make it the base of getting expressionless\nFace this kind of like a a statement face in it and and you can see these things on Twitter read it in fortune and over the weekend twin responded by suspending more than Fifteen hundred accounts associated with the NBC name as they claim it violated the terms of service mainly intentionally misleading election related content\nSeveral months ago unfortunate and read it online you know where you go to look at messages on the porch and read it they started using the term M. P. C. three for the liberals and these people said well they said that\nYou know they joined the anti Trump crowd because they're sheep\nThey're brainwashed she that's what they believe in and they'd been conditioned to parrot left wing orthodoxy in the matter of scripted characters so when you look at one of these and PCs they're basically this crudely drawn great cartoon avatar\nHas a pointy noses in the blank face and it's just like a stick figure face in fact if you remember back in Nineteen eighty four when apple had their little commercial about uh the computer and all these people were sitting\nThe masses were saying that they're all bald and kind of like staring like zombies that's exactly what this is [noise]\nSexual symbol that that sort of big brother drone image if you will [noise] so uh [noise] this is a program in a counter programming left and ah it's certainly a", "year": "2018", "show_name": "WBRC Fox 6 News at 10", "city": "Birmingham", "day": "19"}
