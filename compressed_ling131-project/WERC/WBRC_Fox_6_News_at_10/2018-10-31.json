{"month": "10", "state": "AL", "station": "WERC", "content": "Ah I think that one would probably go too far even for Trump though that's my sense of a thank you so much for it and my friend made dean rides I but I Know I Know he was kidding I Know he was kidding I just I didn't want to step on the man's thought process so I moved to the next roll call\nMaria right does it make you wonder where all the anti gun folks are after the synagogue shooting\nThey usually don't miss an opportunity to spin that narrative while Maria they are already out spinning a narrative perhaps not quite as clearly as they have or as a in full throated a fashion that they have in the past\nI think that's mostly because\nThe anti gun anti Second Amendment left knows enough to know the right now there are Democrats who are in some tight races in states where gun rights are very much\nA supported by folks who vote and so they don't want to create more problems the Democratic party right now that's the only reason I think you are honestly not seeing more shrill uh anti gun commentary\nIn the media and while you're not seeing more people running around protesting and all that kind of stuff\n... right I'm a proud member of team buck Israel thanks for unwavering support for Jewish people everywhere feeling the love well one of the love Israel so I'm Glad you're feeling it thank you very much for writing in from teen book Israel and please\nSpread the word to your Israeli brothers and sisters that we\nWould love to have more and more of them listening in on the podcast joining in on the freedom which uh aries my buddy Roger bought this weekend the leftist media\nIncluding fake tapper have proven their either agenda driven subversive spend on tearing the country apart for their own purposes or completely stupid and insane there is no simple misunderstanding of difference of opinion on this point by calling Trump's nationalistic rhetoric anti Semitic\nThey're literally feeding into and agreeing with the talking points of anti Semitic groups like the Nazis the nation of Islam and ... who say Jews cannot be loyal to their country et cetera et cetera uh yeah the media has been horrific on this aries and\nA top or has embarrassed himself insofar as he spent so much time creating this oh I'm such a serious newsman brand I have no bias early age and he's a nasty snide little fellow\nAnd does a lot of stuff in public that is meant for public consumption but I can tell you that are behind the scenes not a nice guy not a good guy and that's all you really need to know\nUh and it's made a joke of his whole show I mean he had somebody on saying that ISIS has not radicalize as many people as Trump and let it go didn't immediately say well well you can't say that on here\nSo that's all you really need to know about some of these folks John\n... book I've been following all the quote justified violence from the left\nI Know how to beat it ah the anti ... and be all end folks are just paid thugs they don't really want to fight they just want Republicans to fight back to defend themselves so the left can point the finger at the right and say see they're they're violent fascist they're willing to be bloody didn't beaten up for it\nThe real way to beat this has to follow the money why can't people with the right skill sets infiltrate these groups at a high level and expose the leaders and expose the money or John falling the money is very important that's why we had our friend rocky and cut some on yesterday to talk about\nWho is trying to fund these are the fun the\nCaravan organized the caravan there are definitely people work and I think there are definitely people that are putting money into this just a question of finding out who they are so I got to find the money and we're certainly looking into it willy\nRight seems like everybody forgot how the media were searching for a Tea Party member called James Holmes after the Colorado shooting yes Willie I remember that there have been efforts to try and tie the Tea Party to violence and they were unsuccessful because the Tea Party was\nA remarkably not just non violent but peaceful and entirely law abiding movement and I think that that doesn't get talked about enough for obvious reasons media doesn't want to discuss\nHow well behaved and how civic or how much did it responsibility there was in the Tea Party movement um shoes and rides you're so right on the TST\nI've got the real thing and I'll trade might be GST in for election loss trauma any day because it's not really a but not really because these are my protecting yourself it's coping skills Susan\nAre yes Jews and the fact that liberals are running around\nSaying that they think they have the DSD because Trump won the election tells you a lot about the fact that they do need a safe spaces evolved a nice uh writes vote Shay as stop\nPot or ... or saw her\nAh I Do not speak Espanol vibe and he says so I have no idea I assume it means something to converse\nVote Jay ... is this where he we converse I guess the answer's yes but I Do not speak Espanol so pleased right back uh and on and go in English or anything but it's not even I say that\nUh let's see Joanne rights would you address the issue of unvaccinated individuals' coming to the U.S in entering school systems all over the country\nWell Joanne this is a concern a real one but people get very tense about it because whenever you talk about migrants and disease they say that that's inherently racist you're saying migrants are dirty and unclean and all this\nThat's not what anyone should say or or is saying who is reasonable on this issue\nBut there are concerns about vaccination a lack of vaccination of some of these Margaret populations and there have been diseases that have been popping up popping up across the country that were thought to have been eradicated not in large numbers but it it's something to think about\nAnd they don't want to have this discussion and the people that want to get the CDC more involved want the facts out there and there are a lot of immigration activists on the left who don't care and\nThink that this is either ally which it is not there are people who are going to be having different levels of vaccination that that come into the country as part of these caravans\nOf and also just want to shut the whole thing down even if it is in July because I think it's more important than we're closet open borders\nArchie and that's the show today please please spread the word tell somebody listen to the ... show\nYou can always listen on the on apple pie Kass on the ... heart podcasting platform and the more that subscribe to better please also writes them reviews for the show just give me the the star rating if you can on apple pie cash and say something about the show that you think\nAnd uh they just did the whole thing about possession which I thought was interesting that um and then the timing is a perfect because they were talking about\nUh The Exorcist movingly rose you were talking about to get out which is kind of a possession film and they were talking about The Exorcist and everybody was influenced by The Exorcist and Stephen King said\nThat\nHe felt that The Exorcist was a film about social change basically a finely honed\nFocusing point for that entire youth explosion that took place in the late sixties early seventies he said it was a movie for all those parents who felt in a kind of agony and terror that they were losing their children and could not understand why or how it was happening and today we can all agree\nThat perhaps were not only losing our children to the devil but we may also you know we might also be losing ourselves to the devil it's also been argued\nThat the movie The Exorcist addresses anxieties about changes in the structure of the family and how evil and trauma can be handed down from generation to generation only to be eventually manifest for all the see in some explosive demonstration of mental and physical breakdown [noise]\nNow I think a lot of people don't realize maybe some people do realize that the movie\nAnd Peter ... novel is based on a true story\nIt's based on a\nMonth long ... Ninety day exercises um by just would prefer them a fourteen year old boy who prefer to sign a pseudonym\nRolling do the extra system happened in Nineteen forty nine rolling does boy who had homeless in Prince George's County Maryland where this report the possession began and uh it went for Ninety Days three months uh it started in the winter\nAnd then in the spring of Nineteen forty nine ah ruins parents relocated from Maryland to a relative someone Saint Louis wherever the course of two weeks there in St Louis there was there were nine just would brief ... participated in the boys' actresses ...\nOne of them was father even bishop or he kept a diary of being encounters there were a number of others that were involved that uh\nUh certainly uh you know they're all getting up in age some of it passed away I think and of course uh we were approached by a a number of people to discuss ah this case because apparently one of the nurses that uh was there\nAre witnessing the situation was actually told they took a sixty your vow of silence that we're going to talk about the case and now those who were survivors are are now talking about the case and one man in particular a mark Terry\nIs an RN with forty two years in the medical field including over Thirty years and I use in the yards US Army veteran and a medic during the Nineteen seventies he was a Catholic brother of or or monk\nAh with the Alexi and brothers for four years working on a working with the sisters of a crime to him\nAnd he sat down\nWith John Grinder who was one of the nurses that was there during the night of the exercises him and he uh recorded a a a video that we have a and this is interesting we have exclusive rights to this video and it's basically John Grinder giving up his sixty your vows sounds about what happened that night\nOr in Nineteen forty nine with rolling do a mark welcome to ground zero\nAll oh welcome to the show it's good to have you here\nBut um yeah I called you a few months back and talk about I'm a ... or ...
