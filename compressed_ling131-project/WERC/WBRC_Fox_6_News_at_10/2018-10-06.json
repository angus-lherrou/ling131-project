V. in your house in Nineteen forty seven you were a Rockefeller\nTVs were harder to find than cars in this country\nAnd TV signals weren't exactly what they are today either so Truman doing this first broadcast yeah I'm sure it is historic and all that but many more people heard it on the radio than watch it on TV that day and what was true in talking about\nWhat was so important that he had to do a national broadcast\nHarry Truman was appealing for Americans to cut back on grain you use in order to help the starving people in Europe this was post World war two and while we were the bread basket for the world\nUh Europe was starving and Truman said look we got to cut back a little bit so we can be the benevolent leaders in the world\nAnd now if you fast forward sixty Seventy years America is not the leader and wheat production anymore\nYeah we still do well but thank God a lot of other countries are starting to become self sufficient\nBut that's what that speech was about on this date in Nineteen forty seven also in uh Nineteen Ninety One if you're a Mark Wahlberg fan you probably and you're you're my age you might remember this understate Nineteen Ninety One\nMark Wahlberg at the time known is Marcie mark and the funky bunch\nHad the number one pop hit in the country with something called good vibrations not the beach boys song it's more of a dance track with Mark Wahlberg wrapping over it\nAnd now Mark Wahlberg is a massive box office star and how did he get there how did he go from being a\nA an underwear model and with the funky bunch doing good vibrations to one of the biggest stars on the silver screen well if you've ever read Mark Wahlberg daily routine you understand\nHe gets up at three thirty in the morning and he does two things for half an hour each every morning he prays yes he said he praised for half an hour in the works out for half an hour\nHe works out like three or four different times a day he also spent time with his kids he works and he goes to bed at seven thirty so while he is up at an ungodly hour three thirty in the morning he also is in\nBed very early and ah one more little note here on this day apple

to have it in the studio again and we welcome back to the show bill home and Hi Bill\nB. here it's a it's always interesting\nFor sure yeah tonight is it's going to be even more interesting because as I said earlier when you came in we were going to not only take a look at is what we call ancient technology that we may paired up with the technology we have that basically taps into the consciousness of the planet\nWhich is of course what it is the scolded at the time of its construction because crystal itself is a recording mechanism it absorbs the the entire consciousness of the planet and how old is the skull bill or you know\nThere's other all kinds of people with all kinds of things it's believed to be one of the Thirteen original skulls which would put it a pre ... so what ages that I'm not really sure\nSo it was the pre atomic would prevail anti and be pre a dynamic I mean we go all the way back before pre genesis\nOr well it's in all that it's your gas as good as mine 'cause you know it it's the most amazing artifact and what I Do with it mainly is use it because it is a tool for helping people especially right now that the\nWorld seems like it needs a lot of help and the skull is works on that very well\nPsycho Ryan was saying he said we need to take these are symbols and we need to take away the warped values and add value to them and use them to help with some guy to us and uh and uh keep us or you know pretty much on track\nFor what these ... I mean sure a lot of problems she may be dark a lot of props you may not be good but there's always hope that as a lead with it as well and I correct\nOr I think the hope is the real thing and I think the ... the minds of the men\nAre given hope and working for a positive future we can we can make major change in the ... and what's happening right now in the world and it's not like we're\nNot we're just one person or whatever\nWe can work together on this and we can make big changes of the skull\nOr you know when you some people see it they say they don't think of it as something positive because they have these thoughts and their mind about uh schools but when you see that especially in the Mitchell head just go and you see the workman ship and the love that went into it\nAnd the uh just there's a special energy that you you can you can feel the energy and it's a\nIt's a really really neat so that's what we do\nYeah and every time I mean this is an amazing ... this is the one that ah I've always admired for its work which ship and how beautiful it is and the power it certainly possesses since through\nAnd uh the power in the room we have denied and what we're feeling it's certainly a is inspiring a and and I guess for people who know nothing about the schools why is this crystal skull so important and why is this president so important in the room tonight\nWell it's a considered one of the ancient skulls and\nLike you say the skull stores knowledge for everything it's seen been around for all the years and so\nUh it's believed to be a receptor call of mind and at the ... mind has been programmed by the ancient masters with the knowledge of the universe so uh it's it's here and it comes through it's very very\nYeah ... but very powerful\nYeah certainly I'm sure it has a lot of things to tell us I'm sure it has a lot of things that tonight we have a of course we have a lot of things a lot of uh I'd say uh\nYou know people who want to join into the program tonight we have Joe Davis coming up\nTonight who we've found on the program before she's a medium uh also uh I guess a psychic can away she's she's she is a person who communicates the skull\nAnd she'll be on the program tonight we have Seventy Phelps who which has come on the program tonight and of course we have with is also a we have a a ...\nVon ... eat in the evening or nothing to do and what is what is ... what does your mind and he's written books about the crystal skull heavy not\nA he's he's one of the more experts on the crystal skulls he he works with them for a number of years he's written books he's a doctor and a ... a he has a lot to say about my that's what I Would I think it'd be interesting to hear what he has to say\nOr even a drop out let's go to let's go to jump right no job you there yeah I mean here\nAnd it's good to have you on the program thank you for being on the program with us we're here with the bill and of course the crystal skull or tell us about your interest in how your interest began in this in this subject\nWell it began ... experience all and in Nineteen but looked at the Nineteen Ninety four I met ... well at least I didn't know what it was but it turns out to be a crystal skull that somebody puts in my hand\nAnd a ... disclosed eyes\nAre asked me to feel a lifestyle to cry like a little baby\nAnd that was a reason to stop a ledger and he goes why would a girl up guys are crying is something he doesn't know what it is and it turns out to be a crystal skull and what's interesting because it was a contemporary crystal skull it was not a lot of that ancient walls is a lot of information and\nYou may understand that I couldn't let go anymore\nThat is how I started to search to wheat and it is interesting in that time is up many festivals calls route and so on the Internet ...\nWhich was the first of all I'm that it appears\nThat Michel ... is the all I'd had this fascination that one day I Would need an angel and just a ... to ... thousand tests on bill and bill came\nFor the call that the that I call organized and that is what I saw this call but in the meantime I've been studying calls I'm trying to understand and it was interesting what you were saying about the ... the black box um but ... is that survived name of that\nLike ... like you\nAre because the key words I think as soon as you start working list crystal skull is\nConsciousness yes we're mentioning and that's absolutely true you also work with material that calls for a mother earth so it links and to the earth but it also links in to the fact that the ancient people\nOr putting information in a system is while the best systems or you are without acknowledge where you can put information as that is quite right or they use these ancient courts as a storage of inflammation that'd be now try\nTo access at a lot of the interesting things and that is if\nWe have not being very successful yes there are channels and that it isn't that far more information and officials call [noise] so people are searching for how can you access even this information because ...\nContains Charlotte's inflation I remember a story of a company which which
