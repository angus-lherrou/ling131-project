I was going to say a flock of per on us but now I'm mixing things up a like a school of angry raging Peron has a ... they they would have torn apart if he had\nAgreed to what they said he should agreed to about one statement you made or another better just stand and fight and constantly push back on these issues these things that I'm learning from Trump isn't just like all of you\nI have to adapt my approach and my thinking for the the current moment I have to actually think about what's working what's not working and I I reevaluate I'll say one of the most important lessons I've seen\nOne of the biggest uh differentiate or when it comes to whether someone is successful or not is do they have the capacity for self correction\nOr do they have the ability to look at whatever they're doing in life how they're treating themselves how they're treating other people\nOr how they are doing their work or whatever how how they're taking care of their health and an objectively assess what is going right what is not what is going wrong are not going well and make changes\nAnd I'm constantly making changes I mean I have core principles and a and an approach and an east coast but I'm counting making changes to what I think is going to to work best in this this ideological fight I mean that's really what I Do hear everyday yes I like to present information and there's an aspect of this that's\nA really just about dare I say to bar from the left community right we're all a community here on the show um but there's also how can I equip\nThose listen to the show with the best arguments possible and ...\nQuip them also with the knowledge that they are in fact correct in their beliefs either ... explain not just what we should all think about different issues but why we should think that way\nSo I think that's all very very important um and and yeah I I Am also in a process of of learning all the time I don't want to ever make it seem like I'm just the one guy who thinks that he's doing it the right way and and it's never adjusting I'm adjusting all the time\nBrad writes dear book I just read that Hillary Clinton security clearance revoked at her request\nI was wondering what are your thoughts on this are and why in the world would she make such a request especially if she's planning on running again in twenty twenty I'm a loyal podcast listener and wanted to thank you for releasing your podcast earlier\nSo us folks up here in Alaska and listen to it on the way home ... thanks for keeping us in the know Brad a well Brett first of all I'm so glad you liked ... out sooner and I'm hoping that everybody in the west coast knows that we're pretty much now our podcast is going up for this show for the buck sex and show in drive time on the west coast\nSo you know ... there's no problem with you decide and that you're going to just get a little bit ahead of the game and a and listening to it a little early ... you don't have to wait you have to wait for it to be rebroadcast her to be broadcast on whatever stations near you you can listen to it on the\nOn the podcast however you consume puck is\nUh and so that's great news and you're listening up in Alaska that way and as for keeping everybody in the no I certainly try Hillary under a security clearance [noise]\nLook let's just let's just call it where it is Hillary should never have been able to keep a security clearance after the debacle that occurred with her private email server private email account all that stuff and that was just\nCompletely it should've been terrifically embarrassing for anybody not just associated with Hillary Clinton but who was willing to defend that nonsense\nThat she held to a new clearance until this point just goes to show you how broken the system is\nOr mind you all that just this Friday I Will be doing an event with my friends that stands for research will be about what's coming next in the markets and\nBig big things to tell you about I'll be joining them for a full\nLive event this Friday just go to book event dot com free to register folks totally free you can watch the whole thing register for free all free book events dot com and getting ...

for those ski a position by demons type of thing\nUm in fact I brought up those ... those ... story\nOr when I did my show the other night\nUh when I was talking about uh what was happening in Portland but we had over the weekend we had a the the the rival a groups get together and fight in downtown Portland and so uh it was a certainly you know ... the thing that I had to stay out again and do work\nOr because of the fact that uh they needed someone to go wall to wall and I'm not complaining because I I Want to be you know and be a I Want to be in on the secrets I Want to know about the big things are being planned I Want to know\n'em I Want to know who's involved and why and so I brought up this book called possess the double the book was written by a ...\nAnd uh it was pre revolutionary are worried the details but the middle class society would be destroyed drew a crackdown on dissent\nDenial is expected to revolt in a way to\nThe time where the people would rise to the occasion and give the power structure a reason to pounce on them and remind them of their place in the food chain\n\nDenial is expected some sort of revolt so they waited the time whether people would rise to the occasion and give the power structure a reason to pounce on them and remind them of their place in the food chain basically giving\nThe power structure heartening to resolve the power structure to literally come in and clean house\nOr you know it began and does the U.S\nBut can begin with the silencing of the people the silencing of those people who are putting put the fire state power\nThat would happen you know they went and they shut down they shut down the you know the printing presses they shut down the you know journalists silencing people their free speech the freedom of the press everything taken from them and little by little information became scarce and the result was a\nFerocious anger that erupted in several fires destroyed the main city\nThen came the flashpoint a will to power that ended in destruction and violence and it ended up in a huge war where\nYoung people were sacrificed in order to empower the leaders with the blood bond where the blood bond or a blood cement they would hold their grip on a frightened world the American people\nHave actually managed to solidly\nAdapt\nTo intolerant ideologies to dissent all these forms a\nOf a you know groups that are are supposed to represent neo Nazis and fascists and and then we have the anti fascism a left wing umbrella of its shades communism and and all these factions fighting together thinking there's one side of the other side wouldn't reality that there is no one side of the other side there are several factions within both sides\nAnd everybody's trying to identify them is one thing but you can't anymore\nI mean what are your conscious of it or not you can say that doing this\nDividing and fighting his anti liberty it really turns out to be very difficult for the media and the center except that is why they say well we have these guys over here that are out right we have these counterprotesters the hour they never say who they are\nI've never I mean maybe I can find someplace by every time I have never heard anti bobbing spoken up by the media and\nYou know the only ones I hear about are Proud Boys in anti ...\nBut there's also others and you know\nWe have to learn and we have to remember that there are two main dangers to liberty right now one that comes from the left and when that comes from the right and that is this bond receive from the Warren groups of the city's\nLiterally adapting there's blood cement back in the time of Germany in Hitler was blue kites they called the blue the kite blue kite demeaning blood Senate meaning that the leaders would commit acts of accidents murder and violence and the others would follow suit\n\nAnd that's what's happening now we have a little blue type going on\n\nIn in the deep state certainly is breathing this boots kites\nAnd we are\nHaving a little something called fascism and ah and fighting ... this is this is how we do terrorism American style this is how we do civil instability or instability was reduced incivility uh American so\nI mean\nYou know the jak boots of course are coming from our own people now be enforced is their own people police show up made this kind of stand there and wait kind of a referee between the factions fighting\nBut here we are following the footsteps of or well we're following the footsteps the dos yesterday were following in the footsteps of all these guys who forewarned us\nWell I mean given all we know about what's going on and given all we know about the new world order and what it's going to do and what the new I mean this is this is the example of new world order it treats the citizens like faceless statistics and economic units three bought sold barter traded in tracked\n\nLies the system why is it cheats it steals it spies it kills breaks laws\nOver reaches authority abuses its power almost every turn and they love to violent their empire so what they do is they create wars they they ah\nThey take over everything they they're swallowing up everything little by little and so we have this deep state that is a superpower\nWorldwide deep state a global industrial deep state\n\nAnd so it's like ... like you know network where uh the\nMid ... he says there are no Russians there are no countries there are no ... there is no west there's only one organized system of systems and that's money and that's takeover and that's dominance\n\nAnd that's that is that let's become becoming true you know conspiracy theory but it's becoming a a a true thing\nFor everybody\nAnd that's what's the most terrifying as it is it's very true ideology we we were first afraid of terrorists now we're afraid of each other we were afraid of the rising up\n\nRising up the middle eastern terrorists now it's us but needs to be careful because you know we have a fourth estate that's failed us\n\nAnd and what they have they have these controls in place now would you be crucial in creating a warm climate of politically motivated violence\nMay want you to speak politically correct speech politically been dismissive talking points political fanaticism I mean we manufacture racial tension we for fifty one people that we don't like\nWe burn the books in the same places we burn people\nAnd it's because of the global establishment has risen up against the people and the people responded by radicalizing political ideology that by all intents and purposes is eating us from the inside out\n\nAnd we have a large number of people that always cannot be got be happy with themselves and let's say pressure other ... other people into believing the whims of of of the deep state or believing the whims of this ... solution or this course of project to get people angry at one another but see in the end\nIn the end we're all terrorists to one another all mean to one another somebody's going to step in and say well you got to clean house\n\nWe got to clean house we got to make this place say because everybody's at each other's throats we got to go in and we got to get everybody to play nice we needed an intervention of some\n... you know we do that with other countries\nWe did that with other countries are ... you know we see going something going on in Iran or Iraq we see a civil war we step and we sending soldiers we tried to clear up the problem\nAnd how would you feel if we all are fighting like we are right now and China's says you know what there's a problem we gotta send troops there to take care of the United states and when they're done they're going to thank us for what they've done for them\nThat's how vulnerable we are that that's how fragile we are ... you realize is that if someone decides that we're just\nAt each other's throats too much they decide they just want to walk in and clean house they will and boy you won't like that will you will be fighting against one enemy or will be fighting amongst ourselves well there are coming in and taking over\nBecause the whole future
