pre position all the materials necessary to build a tent city\nI mean living quarters shower everything\nHave the grounds all staked out and ready for construction and bring in Sheriff Joe to supervise the whole thing along with all this we should bring in ten or twenty functional FEMA trailers\nThat can be used as temporary courtrooms that have all the judges already there to adjudicate any claims and all of for sanctuary status right there none of this come back we're three and three or four years for hearing bull crap\nOut early and you know you're you're actually much more\nSolution oriented than a lot of other people who think they are on this issue because\nProblem is not that we don't have enough people to catch people at the border from this caravan the problem is that they will turn themselves in and claim false asylum that's what they will do\nRight so it's not a decision oh we need more people to catch them I don't think I don't think everybody really really get that part of this\nYes they may be initially prosecuted for illegal entry if they don't show at a port of entry if they just try to cross the border\nBut think about the the value proposition from their side if you get close to the U.S Mexico border and you're a Honduran as part of this caravan you can either just try to sneak in the United states free and clear or if you get caught then you say oh well I'm claiming asylum\nDefensive asylum is what they call it I'm I'm I needed a song can you will still get process for the illegal entry but that's a misdemeanor and they're not going to deport you for that and so you've had your asylum hearing\nSo you really get two shots to stay in the U.S under the system as it is now and we do need a much speedier process uh but keep in mind how do you even here these ... properly\nThey're not providing any ... any specific documentation of a threat against him they just tell a story and the question is is their story compelling\nSo but already or you're at least thinking about this and the right way which is that if we had a\nA a set up at the border where it was essentially you know when they have the a producer Mike knows about this they got the uh\nCourthouse under the the eagles the eagles play you know the football stadium they have a courthouse in the stadium for all the drunken brawl so their take you write down there and you know you get justice dispensed right away you get your fine are you going to jail or whatever\nSo it it sort of like that at the border would be what would you can do so or when you're you're on the right track my friend\nBryan writes box still laughing out loud about trying to mediate discussion on the heated topic between crystal in Kansas we're actually well beyond time can just did an incredible job holding her ground oh to be a fly on the wall pre and post that segment\nCanisters spheres no there's no two ways about it I mean she you know you can come at her with with everything you've got and I'll tell you look crystal from the left is also very tenacious so it was quiet it I could tell a lot of you that does all this that it was quite a thing\nIt was quite a thing that uh that happens or by the way there's a rumor that junk weaker from the young church maybe there tomorrow and while I'm not planning to be in any way hum disrespect floor aggressive ah I have a feeling we will disagree profusely on some issues I have a feeling that could very well happen so\nWe will see a Josh book I Want to thank you for writing my day after long stressful day

bit\nToo creepy it's like it's like something ripped right out on the script of a horror film like last week there were thirty eight unintended corpses that were left in the Detroit funeral home\nEach one and different points of the composition and find the living dead babies including tend fetuses they were they're discovered hidden in the ceiling last week\nAnd they were finding them when they

up today first time he's done that in a long time says Clyde there's a story you need to know about and what is it because otherwise these\nGirls sixth and seventh grade girls' in Florida or\nThey arm themselves with knives they planned on attacking their fellow students during the school day\nAnd according to police department you know they were thinking there was going to be a school shooting something bad is going to happen so the police were aware that something was going to happen and uh\nSo uh somebody and warned that would be a a something bad is going to go down in building five hundred of the middle school or they're in a bar to bar to middle school or the staff immediately began to search the campus they found two girls in the bathroom\nThe girls were holding a goblet which should have been a string of suspect who's going to be used to drink alcohol but once they're in the principal's office\nThe girls empty their pockets and in their pockets or a knife knife sharpen her a pizza cutter um they also found a butcher knife\nOr in the girls are they had a bag they carry a two admitted the two girls admitted the planning to kill students as they entered the bathroom and when asked about motivation of the girls said well we worship the devil\nAccording to police the girls plan to drink their victims blood\nOut of the golf but they were found with they also discussed eating their victims flesh and living body parts of the schools in France before killing themselves\nI'm at now you know there's always good for a scary story or send to report some strange shadowy figure the\nNight hiding in the bushes but man blood feeding proceed that's that's a new one kids' blood feeding per se that that's a new one for me in Halloween is a you know Halloween is a time for fun but you know this is not fun reality is a\nIs not looking too good lately I mean the darkness seems to be spreading things seem to be out of hand and so\nWhat do we do now I mean you've heard the stories in the last hour\nAnd\nYou know there are a lot of people say well Halloween is is you know the festival for all the evil people\nIt's an evil holiday in fact I had a I was a actually a\nListening to a colleague of mine to a show and he was talking about what they they talk briefly about Halloween and whether or not as I said panic holiday and someone brought up the because of how he sees as a mixed bag both Christian and taking traditions that have evolved over time and it's actually a time\nWhere it was time to perjure yourself of people's spirits that's why ... because they were put out to scare away\nEvil spirits that of course uh it was appalled festival that was put on by the ... called the Sam hanging summers and not say I mean sorry Sal when I said Sam hey that some people call and say I mean I used to call and say I mean for the longest time it's our in\nA meeting summers in but then the Christian missionaries came along and they used as an opportunity to learn about the Christian heroes and martyrs so that day was set aside to remember the Christian heroes and martyrs in fact the day after Halloween was observed is a moment to officially recognized and commemorate the soles of their bless the dead\nWho'd been declared sings\nAll Hallows eve or how low mass is what they call it but you know it kind of you know things have evolved over time
