I think Trump delusion disorder had gone further and become liberal or progressive delusion disorder there is no area in which they can see troops\nHuh Interesting\nThank you so much writing it yeah I Do think that there's a a mass hysteria and really a mess psychosis those overtaken the left Michael writes a high bucks it's short shouting regarding Elizabeth Warren here's some phone nicknames a lie or walk the fraud resume or\nThey could ...
