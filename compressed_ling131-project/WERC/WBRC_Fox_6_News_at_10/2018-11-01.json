was something about a little girl who's breath was being stolen by this ugly little ogre\nAnd there was a cat that defends her you know what I'm Talking about that I've ever seen that movie and I was a kid and that scared the bejesus out of me I'm a\nCat apparently I Know you have no idea I'm Talking about that's all right I'm probably miss remembering it a little bit\nJaycee and riots book buddy last night talking about daredevil and the teenage mutant ninja turtles the creators of the turtles comic book came and the same auto accident the blood and created the daredevil mutated the turtles a thing of toxic waste hit daredevil then ran into the stores were the turtles were\nHowever this is on official at the turtle comics and the daredevils are made by two different companies\nI don't know Jason that's a cool theory but I've never heard that before I think up put on a flag on this one brand new we buy this\nMay be in like an alternate universe you know comic graphic novel but I've never heard it now yeah they might say Breaking Bad as the prequel to the walking dead it just a fan theory fund ban theory\nOh yeah it's a cool idea I just never seen that and I would want to little I'll be honest I'm a little more proof on now before I could accept it as being\nThe real deal um let's see here Robert Reich table are much more open to allowing immigrants and asylum seekers into the country\nIf we can guarantee they could never vote to take it a step further their kids could never vote we need to modify the fourteenth amendment which was intended to help the slaves and not for national I Believe the left as usual is playing the long game get as many poor immigrants in we're likely are going to be dependent one way or another on the government\nTheir kids will be citizens are much more likely than not to vote for the left um yes that is true that's why Democrats\nLove them so much because they know the people that are\nUh especially the children of illegals or illegals themselves are chart statistically speaking look I'm sure that there's lots of valedictorian amazing you know children of illegal aliens that's this this is not about judging every individual or by their immigration\nThat is this is about the law as it is and what that means for us as a national level policy\nUm but yes there's gonna be a lot of people were depend on government Taylor W photo it's amazing and then he wrote an eat that\nDry age bone and ... forty five days amazing how much labor brings out soaked in butter and salt cheered and grow the perfection one I'm going to be the good with the bucks that's due to the other ... now that steak looks world class so\nThird or fourth Halloween with us sometimes we bring them in on Halloween the atlas ranks walk on the ground zero they strive for having me on it now I used to introduce you as the [noise]\nWhat do you call the magic stirred a manager of the church and state and\nI was a magistrate in the church\nSo you're a manager of the church said now you've created the carrier the chaos imperial\nYeah I have my own my own order\nNow ... now what kind of order is that is a the a six eight and a shorter is it a witch order wizard order what kind of magic quarter isn't\nThe case I'm hearing is the most advanced black magical order in the world and essentially we see the prince of darkness as a a ... and being at a doesn't exist inside of physical space time is outside of that is not involved\nUm inches center around the idea of worship but that to this being can actually be contacted through a actions involving um the highest forms of black magic\nAnd ah we've seen this being as something that we can learn from directly because we can become like it it's the our position is to become God like beans\nOr in a\nIn the elation of his first foreign principle which is responsible for all things in life in the cosmos\nSo we're talking about a dark figure that you have this contact with well it's on it's dark as it's it's not generating right it's not safe to say and then in of itself is that [noise]\nHas a a a kind of a dumbed down I'm a\nIdea of this super consciousness inside of physical space time it's a and this guy stiff 'em rebellion\nAnd a a decadence and I'm a hedonism\nBut uh the ultimate elevated form of this is still exclusive furry and form which is where we are [noise]\nAre actively involved in so\nI'm forever action as an opposite and equal reaction so as you see manifestations of ah forms going to a a higher spiritual form or as a decision to to forcefully moved the intellect and the psych through physical space toward a higher\nUh form you're going to the replica ripples in in its back wash that are going to manifest themselves as decadence and degenerate but we're also living inside of the cyclic nature of the Kelly yoga\nWhich is a ... and understanding of cyclic time in this position that's happening right now is the degenerate\nI'm a self oriented um cosmological construct within the human physical ... uh action and form that is at its lowest\nA continuum it's it's the worst possible position we can actually live in so you're going to see this like all across the board politics philosophy art music um you know a cultures et cetera\nIs this something that ah the chaos ... do they relish this or were they like to see a higher form of been lightened meant there would be more refined satanism runny absolutely ... absolutely\nNo interest in what happens to the rest of the world no interest at all no we're we're we're we're Paul bearers of western civilization were just watching it happened the rest of us are just moving toward something that's a continually outside of that\nSo you're waiting for all of us to destroy each other than you guys move in and basically we'd be the unless\nI Know we're not even interested in in in the earth we're interested in transcending me on even that position so transcend the one thing and they are really unhappy about is the fact that there are so much\nA destruction of the beauty of this planet and a lot of that was manifested in things such as an animal abused child abuse this type of thing we think this kind of thing is really a a really horrific actually animal is even worse as far as working or because of the true I'm\nA a\nHolders of of the of the planet you know they were here before we were and we've come a long ways like eradicated or their\nLand um [noise]\nAh their position in the world you know they're they're sitting there simple rights to live so\nWell actually I don't really have their place to live well I guess is that the you know we've we've completely overrun all of that and I just think that there should be some kind of vengeful action against that type of thing but it will actually get settled using child ... oh yeah absolutely\nUm you know it's interesting because like I said that statement earlier I said satanism now it's harder to find black magically well yeah I mean you will for more you are you talking about ... black magic\nBut I'm Talking about how now what the definition of what satanism is it's not easy I remember when I first met you and I talked over\nA back when you were part of the C O s I uh I I was trying to put a handle on what's Satan is believed or at least the way in St Louis believed\nAnd uh before it wasn't easy to find satanism it's getting even more difficult to divide said that the ... say that uh would say is in his anymore because we'd go for like a like I said we go for the most ridiculous definitions to the more psychotic definitions\nOf what it is and I was just curious if this why you left the church\nIs safe you know a ... satanism which is the ... a a fairly universally and philosophically recognized as the first manifestation of a true a church devoted to satanism too I'm an acknowledgement at the devil I'm as a a as a symbol for um\nA form of personal internal evolution and that each and every man and woman is their own satanic ... moving to try and become something greater than what they are um\nThere's [noise]\nWithin the like the last Twenty years there has been literature that has flooded at the literal\nA cottage industry of books that have come out claiming to have been some type of of former ... age old undiscovered um clandestine form of a U.S the satanic worship\nThat um that you can tap into you and that's just not true I'm a scholar of black magic in the states\nAnd I researched it and it's it's either a um [noise] highly embellished\nIdeas around ... or be blatantly meal a manifestations created by people who are who are betting that you don't know anything more about it than they do well\nMost people that I remember when I first was interviewing you there are a lot of people identified with what you say they were saying well we identify with what rex who say we we we'd been and\nAre either of them and say well I find uncomfortable because I find it uncovered all that I agree with what he said because of your position in the church or said now you have your own group of black magic magicians and [noise]\nI mean your message really hasn't changed all that much only that you seem to be more or less like you said Paul bearers to the fall of western civilization meaning you're standing there watching it all the collapse around you and then you'll be cleaning up and basically we won't be\nCleaning up are escaping it altogether I when I say Paul bears I'm just saying that you know I\nI Am I'm looking at what's happening and I'm I'm recording it but I'm not
