or but you know the women in your life mom's friends colleagues sisters\nAre are never as safe as when they are in your vicinity because you were on or as a man is at stake the moment that any of them are under threat\nSo I just you know just trying to give the full context to this trying to make sure that we approached this discussion from all sides page writes I now have a Fifteen year old daughter named Reagan Cheney listening to your podcast as well\nShe sharing with their friends and they started a young Americans for freedom club at their school page thank you so much for Israel Reagan Cheney is an awesome name\nAnd my name is ... so I Know something about\nAwesome names or at least weird names depends on who you ask\nBut that's very very cool about your daughter and I really want to get as many of the young conservatives across the country tuning into this program and and the way we're going to do it as much\nAnd when people to listen to the the pod cast of the show a so there you have it Ronnie writes ah who shot the big bucks\nThree friends okay this is a joke Ronnie I'll have to read this one on my own time I was like wait someone no one shot buck buck is fine he's right here Peter writes a book that quote whoever told you your goal in life was to be happy is from ... eight and a half\nWhen a widow Marcella must Rio on me or talk to the cardinal if you like for an art films is absolutely brilliant it's one of those where you watch it again and again figure out the layers and symbolism actual literal translation is who told you would come into the world to be happy\nOr I knew it was from somebody smart I ... a very ... writer friend of mine is one who said it to me once but it's it's an important point who told you come to the world to be happy\nThe answer is nobody really we\nAre led to believe that by the society around us especially by the more commercial and a self indulgent aspects of the society around this now because we live lives of but would have been inconceivable comfort\nIs even a hundred years ago really in terms of our day to day needs and\nAnd all of that um but that does not necessarily make somebody happy does not make them feel hole and happiness is not just about\nPleasure naturally worthy that's really where the the breakdown I think comes in the in the way that we all exist today\nA Caroline right hey look you said something yesterday that that I've been thinking about for years the regional after so furious and on a hinge and so rabbit in their ... stations is because deep down they know they don't have logical on their side\nEvery one of their ideas when enacted results and failure\nThey simply don't have a good historic track record so with logic and facts out the window they react emotionally I think Shakespeare put it best they'd dust protest too much shield childcare on the first of all props for getting the Shakespeare quoted the roll call always appreciate that\nAnd on July the less get so upset yes I I think that\nThe the weakness of their arguments is one of the reasons for their outrage right the the weakness of their arguments is one of the reasons that they are so unreasonable when presented with the opposing point of view\nWhat people tell me I'm really wrong on something and I know I'm right I don't get angry I tend to be pretty calm and serene and self assured\nIf somebody tells me that I'm wrong on something and my first instinct is oh gosh maybe I'm wrong I I can get a little defensive and I have to be aware of that because my initial impulse is to try and cover up the fact that maybe I was wrong on something I think most people are a lot of people at least\nHave that as a as a response\nBill of rights Tom Nichols announced his departure from the GOP in the Atlantic on MORNING Joe usually Morning Joe or rejoice at this I look forward to listen to your opinion on the departure of the expert\nBill I I have ah had have had John Nichols on the show times in the past and he is a is a smart and we'll read guy and I think at\nThe end of the day he is a very well intentioned individual when it comes to this country and\nI just I think he's so wrong on all this I really do and I don't engage with him anymore publicly because\nI I don't think that he's fair minded about what you know he said recently on Twitter so I'm not portraying any confidence here but he said that what the Democrats did a Kavanaugh was bad but Kavanaugh's response was worse\nThat's just garbage I mean that's just not a defensible position that because he was snappy with them when they were calling him a gang rape is that's worse than ... than that that's just not it intellectually serious position and so for somebody who takes the position\nIn general as Tom does um that there's a lack of intellectual rigor among the Trump supporters I look I think that ah I think he's gone down the wrong path on this one he's not the only one who used to be a conservative\nAt least he's honest though I you know give him some credit for this he says he's a Democrat and because he is he's a Democrat he so disgusted with the right that he is now playing for team left but I'm more okay with that than people who say oh I'm Still you know they pulled the Jennifer Rubin the Washington Post oh I'm Still a Republican don't you're not\nI'm Still a Republican I'm just going to crash Republicans all the time no that's not how this works\nThat's not acceptable so that's how I feel about that and Max Boot whom I Know from\nHe wouldn't remember me I was just an interim but I was in
