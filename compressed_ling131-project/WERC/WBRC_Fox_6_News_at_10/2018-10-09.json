two different conversations I won't so badly to find a way to kind of make my case\nJust to get them to explore the truth outside of the talking points but I Can't even get there there's so much

independently minded observers do you think the Democrats wanted ... to come forward you suspect as I Do that once wetness accusations occurred they knew it was actually damaging to their credibility\nI I think that's why it was a disaster for the Democrats because she was a it was ... it was it was obviously incredibly disruptive and just and disgusting but it was completely non

really protections north prophecy maybe some of the future man we're back on a good day\nWell future man looking back on them and they are pretty interesting predictions if their predictions that come from Nineteen forty five and a some of them are accurate some are a little off by ... by just a a tad I think\nBut when you're dealing with something called revelation of the method we have science fiction people all the time making predictions and having them come true I mean we're warned through this type of predicted programming about how we should be prepared to accept certain ideas certain ... certain ideologies\nWe see in film and TV shows many things that eventually come to pass and would they do we wonder about the theory of retro causality and real time travel is these physicists have been talking about retro causality and whether or not there are things that\nShape the past future shaping the path time travel is a fantastic concept but most would consider the stuff of science fiction and yet we hear more and more that\nThe idea of dream through time\nHe's he's he's quite possible actually a but to change the course of history\nYeah I don't know I mean we're we're told that there are different timelines that if you go back in time uh and you kill baby Hitler that won't matter 'cause there'll be another time my little form after that that kinda thing I don't know\nBut um [noise] it is possible or hearing more and more about time travel is becoming more and more possible plausible but um [noise]\nThere are those who are before us have had insight to see the future or

found most interesting is in the film a they discuss a secret society called plus ultra\nNow according to the fictional history of the film I did some studying on this uh the story goes that good stuff Eiffel\nMet Jules Verne and Thomas Edison at his power apartment to start a secret society of optimist plus ultra was founded it'd be Eighteen eighty nine world's fair in Paris, France\nThe organizations purpose is to create moderate and expand upon new scientific advancements for humanity now key members of this group included people like H. G. wells Ray Bradbury Amelia Earhart Mark Twain Nikola Tesla and other scientific figures well Disney eventually became a member as well\nSo it started in Eighteen eighty nine and there were people who became members of this plus ultra group and what plus ultra was was a group that created a breakaway civilization in another dimension ... okay\nSo I Know science fiction right but is there any truth to it that's the question well\nAs we do as we dig deeper into the story okay it says now this is according to the movie fiction this this is the story\nTomorrow land in Nineteen fifty nine had an expansion of Disneyland it was actually about and this is what they said in the film that tomorrow land was actually a training facility\nFor future societies future members of societies they were training them for a journey to an alternate universe and at this alternate universe was found and later developed by plus ultra\nNow the blueprints for the expansion he'll keep technologies that enabled the journey including something called the super transport key VIPs\nWere encouraged to join plus ultra were given special VIP audio tour a tour as the world's fair or the attraction there there was Ford's magic skyway there was the it's a small world world ride and for those who couldn't attend the fair there was a ... there was a record player or record that they could play to get information about the details now Walt Disney\nHad the it's a small world attraction at the Pepsi Cola pavilion in the Nineteen sixty four New York world's fair\nThat believed to contain of portraits tomorrow it [noise]\nThan reality does he does have a secret place\nAnd it's near the pirates of the Caribbean it's below the pirates of the Caribbean ride it's called club thirty three it's a private club a club thirty three is not acceptable to the public and it's for exclusive use of its members and is the only location at Disneyland that serves alcohol\nNow the editor clubs thirty three a guest house depress above the buzzer on an intercom it's concealed by hidden panel and a doorway\nAnd Walt Disney was a young boy he was a member of the de ... society makes on a quarter\nAnd so a lot of people leave the thirty three is related to the thirty third degree a Scottish right free masonry so\nA fictional secret society that is a dimensional secret breakaway civilization called plus ultra\nI started wondering is there something like plus ultra that I can present for you tonight\nThat would be sort of a revealing that there may be some dimensional breakaway civilization or there may be some ties to time travel [noise]\nYes I can do this and it it is as I was digging through this this ... plus ultra it's Latin for further beyond now I Need for you to remember\nThose words plus ultra because those are the two words that are going to be the ones that are going to unlock the doorway ... unlock the key it's acute opens the door where the doors of perception of your mind to maybe have you thinking about where we are right now and whether or not\nThere are people in high places that can manipulate the future changing the passes or well said he controls the future controls the past well there may be\nA few people [noise] Mitt are these types of plus ultra people\nThey're actually [noise] using the future to correct things for the past or [noise] or using retro causality in order to do it on to the county [noise]\nIt'll blow your mind as to what I found and I'm sure you'll with his night I'm really excited so stay to Tripoli six seven three thirty seven hundred as Tripoli six seven three thirty seven hundred I'm quite Lewis you listen to ground zero and we'll be\n[noise]", "year": "2018", "show_name": "WBRC Fox 6 News at 10", "city": "Birmingham", "day": "09"}
