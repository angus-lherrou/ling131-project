really liked the cartoon growing up and then also even the first major turtles movie I saw that so many times I really I really enjoyed it of people thought it was kind of intense and violent at the time if you go back and and check it out you'll you'll see what I mean but it was a\nGood movie I really enjoyed it and it's a really creative concept who would think that turtles\nIn a nuclear waste named after renaissance painters who have ninja skills would be a hate well it was\nThere you have it Gary hey book greetings from team buck Hungary I took her advice and started watching the first season of picky blinders\n'em and last night it was awesome hook thanks for the recommendation\nI'm all for the next week and that is what I'll be doing in the evenings lover you do brother keep it up shields Hi Gary Gary she'll try to you know I'm so glad you liked the blinders on I really I really do enjoy it I I think it's a very entertaining very well done very entertaining show a little bleak for sure but\nIt's ah it's well executed the writing is good and and there's some very interesting twists and turns in it I I started watching\nThe third season of daredevil all over the weekend which I Would have to say\nYou know the thing about daredevil is that it's also a little bit dark a little bleak I think it's well executed for what it is I just can't understand how they made daredevil such a compelling show at Netflix\nAnd they made iron fist which was just on washable garbage in iron fish was crash it's also a superhero story also set of New York same\nYou know platform with Netflix you'd think they'd have some idea how to do it the iron fist got cancelled and thank heavens because it was such\nA piece of of waste\nAnd ah anyway but yeah I have to say I think that daredevil three so far as it's a little slow and getting going but so far it's it's pretty well done I find the acting all very good I I enjoy the performance is even if you're not that into superhero stuff\nI think you might like daredevil I I think you might find daredevil to be a pretty good show\nA Carla\n... wash U and ... the other day with a B loved her comment about someone writing his comments about the bomber on teleprompter like no one ever did that before love the show so all the pick of you and your parents in D.C looks like your dad has the same swoop\nCarla thank you for that kind of comments about my parents I'm Bret Baer I I think that I was able to say exactly what I really wanted to you on the circumstances which is always which I think is a very important for whenever you get one of those performances whenever you're doing that\nI also went on Shannon show on friday as you guys know so that was another chance for me to say what was really\nOn my mind uh and uh after my dad yeah my dad has great\nHair it's true great hair he's got he's got a silver scoop now in fact I could probably be his call signs silver scoop\nBut it was so good to see my parents um I got the best parents in the world so that's a big advantage that I've had in life you know I Know you've probably got great parents too but uh other your parents are probably second best parents world I think modern number one but we can agree to disagree on that\nUh so it was it was great to see them we a lot of fun and it's nice to get some visitors down here in the swat man the swamp can feel a little little lonely not enough team bucking the swamp got to be honest with you guys are spread out all around the country and a lot of you are in states\nWhere you've got you've got fellow patriots all around you're not like knee deep behind enemy lines can be crazy\nUh let's see you miss the rides what do those of us in liberal California\nDo about the fact that we are surrounded by these crazy well you know it's uh there's no easy answers um I Wish I could say that I\nA straightforward do this to tell you but I you know I think you engage where you can and that's it you know ... you don't where do you think it's a bad idea it's not worth it sometimes\nJennifer right table yesterday I attended a lecture presentation by Arthur Sulzberger German up in New York Times called the impact of media and truth on democracy\nI went with an open mind as always try to approach things in life this way because many people surprise me over the years\nHowever I found Sulzberger statements so cliche is an interesting he said all the things you talked about recently on your show speaking truth to power how we live in dangerous times journalist or unsafe et cetera et cetera I lost track of how many times to use the words danger or dangerous however he's definitely a capitalist\nHe bragged about I'm In New York times successfully mounted monetize their online media and when asked a question from the audience about how the New York times could be more accessible middle class Sulzberger said the cost of bank New York times is worth it in order to get the truth\nWhen you find yourself in northern California again I could ... have you speak at a local university we need to hear a more conservative voices especially on campus in California keep finding a good fight shields Hi Jennifer\nOh thank you Jennifer for that interesting perspective and and telling me what's going on with that Sulzberger lecture that that's not surprising at all by the way the New York times is in many ways the most arrogant of\nAll media out there and the and it's left wing and I don't know how many of you saw at the last week I asked their chief White House correspondent for the New York times are you a liberal paper and he said no\nAnd I just look at him like dude I I understand that you know that's the that's the company line but come on it\nReally we're we're going to do this we're really going to do the New York times is not liberal because oh the editorial pages liberal\nBut the overall paper is is just a newspaper no that is not true the New York times is liberal paper and they should just own it you know that they shouldn't beat around the Bush and pretend or something that they're not I don't see this is\nReally all that complicated I really don't but they they make a complicated because they like\nThe pretense of being neutral\nThey think that neutrality and objectivity heightens the strength of their voice whereas if they admitted to partisanship even though they're hyper partisan then they could not claimed to just be the troops objectivity they're clearly not that\nI Will stop with uh what's up with this one a book\nYou miss the anniversary of the battle over Pancho bread and your right I Am so sorry I forgot to tell you guys all about ... if you want to go to go to Google and type in the ...\nShow and the battle of ... and you can listen to

powerful and a number of Collins who share their engine heritage or some have used their I guess you'd call them magical skills for\nEvil and some abuse their power for good\nAnd so when I looked in did some research into the open ...\nYou have ... or ... well like a snake of course like serpent and you have layer which would be like the physician\nSo you have the ... or the or the ... physician pretty much is what I got from uh the the etymology of the name and back in Seventy ... Britain's right after a Seventeen Seventy six\nAnd we had the ... associations and all that the ... islands with the Collins their names appear in one of the well\nWhen you look at the Thirteen most powerful\nCommonly associated names are blowing lines the Nineteen twenty century the euro American industrial ... you have the Astor bloodline the Bundy bloodline the cones blind the dupont bloodline\nThe Freeman bloodline the Kennedy bloodline the announcers bloodline um go down the list of all the bloodlines here Russell Ross child Rockefeller so when you look at history\nI'm a particularly important secret society within America and Europe you have to go far back as the grand drew council and it's believed that for a time that the Collins always were the heads of honor\nOf the most ancient occult power of the blood or of the healing powers of the blood so you know\nThe nature of the most powerful and most secretive ... a secret societies ah\nIt it's hard to prove unless you dig deeper to find out more about the holy ones disturbance in fact the colon ... name uh once again the is the calling physician of the woods so you're looking at combination and you look at the snake called with the staff of the cross bar\nYou have some of the origins of the divine medicine man of the woods the dividing holy men and that's what makes it fascinating the Khan family has been kept out of the limelight because they have more coal power than the Rothschild says the Rockefeller's they're actually one of the Thirteen aluminium bloodline families that can be traced back to the original ... now\nThrough the average of writers like print spring Meyer Indyk Redfern the Collins elite or the or the ... group they're part of an even greater group that considers itself a think tank when in reality the secret group relief magicians\nWho are responsible for unleashing what are known as the ninth soccer's namely shadow entities that feed off the energy and blood of animals and humans some claim that these alleged nights soccer's are in reality the aliens that have been reportedly mutilated and cattle abducting humans living humans are\nSome of the mill abduction cases and stuff are all tied to these possible ninth soccer's there were unleashed by the ... the lead\nNow what's interesting is this program that I'm doing tonight is is been a long time coming because I've been wanting so badly\nThe here from Nick Redfern on this subject because honestly because of the fact that he wrote a book about it and um I uh I heard about it I I Can't remember who told me first about the book and a and what and what what it's called final events\nAnd ah I read some of it was really intrigued by the ... the lead and whether or not there weren't any ties the vampires are we're ... or anything like that so I decided tonight it'd be great to have big Redfern on the program\nTo talk about this and so Nick Redfern of course works fulltime as a writer lecture and journalists he writes about a wide range of unsolved mysteries big foot UFOs Loch Ness monster encounters you've seen him on all of the shows are from ancient aliens to a lot of other special ... and I've even

it's good it's good to have you on tonight I'm like I said you know Nick this has been a long time coming because I Know you've been very busy\nAnd uh I remember back when final events or came out I I was turned onto the Collins elite for the call ins group and the family goes all the way back to the engine druids and or\nThe um the the meeting you had with rabies Shay\nAnd how that all came about can you give us a little bit of a background of of what the current leader about and and why does the secret family secret society are so ah are tied to perhaps the vampire legend that we're ... legend\nAbout that [laughter] I I\nActually don't know what the ... family is that\nThe Collins elite Collins family I've not heard of that oh you never heard of the constants that you've heard of the columns lead right\nWell yeah relatives that fits um any links with ... and I'm so\nOh you haven't you heard of aliens right what's that\nYou've heard of the ... were the ones that are ... are are ... you you're meeting with rape but Shay remembering your book you talked with ... and he was with new funding in Nebraska and he said something the effect that perhaps the aliens that have been released it or ... or mutilated cattle are probably tied to the columns elite\nWell I mean well yeah but not in like a ritual they stick or anything like that\n... how are they tied up what what the caller insulate tight to\nYeah what what what was exactly the story with you and rabies Shay\nWell basically what it was back in two thousand is seven I'm\nLooking for a new idea for a book and I thought about doing water on the rental ... forest UFO landing case in England in his eye and say ha and the reason was thought of that too and it was you know I mean that is a number of folks on the subjects already but it was interesting\nThreads and late suggesting that in my face like\nAlmost like an ... type things sort of testing new technologies on the on the militia personnel on the base rather than a rail UFO London and he tends to write about Shay\nA it was um fall brass getting a direct ... and also appraised so yeah you know it's sort of unique back right when you get to you and ate background as well as as a ... director and the other one is a priest\nAnd I spoke to write that isn't a seven\nAnd he said yeah you know we kind of a ... day and age and they feel like if I have to do some stuff and I thought about doing a book on it\nBut when they get on the phone and he said well listen even more interesting story and might be interested in in so intrigued about it and that which we all make it better story I said well let's face and he said that\nThe guys in the government in the departments of defense she told him that the rental showcase\nWas basically like a fabrication is holograms and mind altering technologies and whatever [noise] um he said that they were actually part of a program that was trying to or is it was sort of looking into the angle of the UFO phenomena as being demonic rather than actually\nA rash drill than bay and so basically he told me the story of how he met two representatives of this particular group um and there for a number of
