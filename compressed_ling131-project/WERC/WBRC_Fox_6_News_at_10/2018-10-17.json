yeah the media did circle the wagons around more and it was a disgrace but that's what they did\nGet a close up shop in the freedom tonight team excited to be with you every day this week every day\nEvery week pretty much up\nIn what I got to take a day off but uh until tomorrow one request tell one friend to download the bucks acting show podcast on apple pie and then she'll die [noise]\nDon't feel like you have to use one of these social media sites that you know is infected with all kinds of left wing bias or they have all this conversational health nonsense going on and they are constantly trying to find ways to kill the table toward the last [noise]\nGo to a place where your opinion is value\nSlowly but surely he was like all biological systems so disease causing organisms admitted victims evolved it happens that's how it is and we noticed is with the uh the change in the flue last year or the flu mutated into something you know like a pneumonia some kind\nOf a [noise]\nWe look back at some of the medications that have been used by the public that have led to\nA lot of bad effects that Philip am I a situation in the Nineteen sixties I Believe was one of the perfect examples of a sedative ... it was anti knowledge medication medication pregnant women were taking in pregnant women who use the drug cause serious congenital Mao formations and their babies\nNow today they're still drugs that are on the shelves right now than when misused or when they're taken responsibly can cause accidents and you can get anything from the just of intolerance to dying and that's why they call it I have to ... artifacts\nAnd physical dependence can happen with the chronic use of any drug including many prescription drugs he would have taken his instructed physical dependence in of itself is not constitute addiction but often accompanies addiction [noise]\nAnd it stinks in many people cannot or discern the distinction it's difficult to discern\nParticularly prescribe pain medication switch the need for increasing do just dosages actually represents tolerance or worst thing underlying problem as opposed to the beginning of abuse or addiction and I've always learned as a general rule\nBut if you're taking a pill to kill the pain you're dependent if you're taking a pill after the pain is gone you're addicted\nBut if you're taking your bills was directed in the paper says your body has gotten used to them overtime or the worst case scenario would be that the drug companies are doing the equivalent of watering down the alcohol and I've always talked about that as well be advocacy\nOf of a pain medications I Believe the yo yo wing of the doping mean is what is causing\nThe opioid crisis and so what we're getting is adverse effects for getting opposite expectations outcomes it becomes a no CBO effect\nSo called pandemic of opiate overuse may be seen as a as a no see the ... no CBO effect itself tonight and I'm going to be the spoiler 'cause I don't really give a damn about the TV show it's called ah the Connors\nA you speed Roseanne on ABC Roseanne it said that in the show they were going to kill her off\nThey were to kill her off the program a with an opioid overdose they did it they actually killed or off\nFrom an opioid overdose everybody said how does how do they know how do they know they're trying to cover up the fact that she's spoiled and for everybody weeks ago and I basically had said well if you're following the Roseanne program she was actually are in need of knee surgery and the show\nAnd then she'd been taking pain pills from friends and others and having a stash around the house so it was a given\nThat they would kill her off by giving her an opioid overdose and see this is the thing that bothers me about the opioid the opioid problem in the opioid overdose in and out the opioid overdose scares that they're giving everybody and that is if you are addicted or if you overdose\nOn pain medications it's a moral failing people will have you believe it's a moral failing of propaganda will have you believe that you're ... you're an addict when you're not [noise]\nAnd so the killing off of Roseanne with an opioid overdose in my opinion is exactly what they were expecting is exactly what was going to happen and uh and that's why it was done so tonight I wanted to\nBring on a friend of mine who uh I've I'm I'm not sure we haven't had him on a long time\nBeen Fuchs and he's a registered pharmacist he's really fishes and cosmetic chemist and has been\nCompounding custom medication formulating nutritional in skin care products and consulting with doctors and patients who graduated from the University of Colorado School of pharmacy in Nineteen eighty six distributions recognizes nationally for his work as the on air pharmacists nutritious hosted the bright side radio program been through talking to ground zero\nHey if I talk to you yeah I Love that during the show because you are so darn television Clyde thanks you [laughter] I ...\nI really appreciate it and so so Ben I mean what is it with a propaganda when the world today making people who are using pills for paying give it get making them\nOr treating them like moral a pariah I that's what they did was Roseanne denied they actually killed her off on the TV show or said she had opioid addiction and she died of an opioid overdose ... why are they\nDoing off her twenty six for you I answer a pool according to his father\nYou know people are so silly it's just ridiculous how we have this idea\nThat uh we're okay to judge people or whatever their behaviors are OK to captains Persians on others or whatever their behavior is acting human body is hardwired to substances as hard wired especially being in the substances that are already inherent in it and that's opiates are\nThey are analogs of bio chemicals that are already in your brain so when you take it home and say that you have you have a pain problem and you take opiates an opiate tell will immediately happen is your ... your brain was down regulate\nThe production of its own in dodging it opiates and you will in Athens become efficient like taking artificial opiates you'll end up in the fission which we'll put you in an deficits day and there's a there's a pills in Iraq right here at the almost impossible to resist them\nNow I Know that I Know that we have a a sort of a psycho social context surrounding the patient Dr relationship the patient farmers ... pharmacist relationship\nBut I I think people that tend to ignore the fact that you know right now if you're using opiates you you become pretty much a ... you become a dark and NPR why we're what's that\nYou're award you're awarded the state yeah you belong to say you belong to the medical model and that and they love that yeah well now what you're ... you're hooked on okay so you you have to go to the doctor you have to go to the pharmacist even if it even if it means Dr pharmacist shopping\nYou ... your compels me to be a part of the model of the paradigm once you get on a city that once you get on the drug ... shut illegal drugs too by the way that people get that's how dealers and and a drug drug dealers gets you hooked on heroin\nWell and that's the truth out you know one of the thing I did a show one time about crocodile and it was interesting because ah I was talking about he was cheap heroin and that many people that look very attractive to use this cheap heroin\nAnd uh I was saying you know be aware of crooked deal because your kids may be using it and blah blah blah blah blah and boy did I have an education I had people calling me all over the country\nIn their sixties and seventies saying to me that they were addicted to heroin and that they are they're the ones that ... that the they worry about that that that uh they said you should be worried about grandma and grandpa\nOr have gotten their pain pills taken away from them\nAnd they have to resort to using heroin or they have to get heroin and they get like a really low dose of heroin but if they can make cheap crooked deal in their kitchen they'd be more than happy to do that get rid of their pain and the stories I heard were heartbreaking stories of like a guy called me and said I was in a motorcycle crash\nAnd I was in a lot of pain and the doctors gave me my medication then one day they just decided we weren't gonna give it to me anymore and so I had to use heroin\nAnd I'm going wow you know and and I never thought because I always thought you know be where the kids taking drugs but no be where grandma and grandpa who aren't getting their pain medications because the doctors don't know how to treat the pain\nIt's a terrible situation is absolutely terrible situation they as you our talking before a lot of it is based on the fact that we've created a society and we've created a culture that is conducive not not cynical him at the psychic pain to to access the actual pain and guess what opiates work on that too\nYou know it's not just work on physical pain they work on us\nSo hang on and I ... I Believe in the pharmacist that this was a really big part of our our addiction addiction problem is we are in pain", "year": "2018", "show_name": "WBRC Fox 6 News at 10", "city": "Birmingham", "day": "17"}
