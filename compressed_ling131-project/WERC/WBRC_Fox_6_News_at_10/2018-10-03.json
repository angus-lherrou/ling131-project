Renacci alumnus and the most telling devil's triangle which basically describes them as sports as happened with the two boys\nHe dismissed them all with Lindsay explanations that would never sixty during questioning by any parent or principal or dean doesn't he realized that many of us were there and it's counter shows use of two or three people I'm like I got I got to tell you\nI'm I\nI just disagree with everything you're saying Sally and and I say that with respect\nI think that you are\nI Can't say misinterpreting but I think that you are not properly ... how a person like having all would feel under the circumstances\nI think that you're taking a lot of your outside observations about as you say preppy spoiled kids and and try and supposing that onto a man when it doesn't matter if other people have done terrible things when they're in prep school\nIt doesn't matter a fraternity brothers are off in a in coherently drunk and there's far too much sexual misconduct among them none of that actually matters\nWhen you're looking at the innocent or guilty of an individual did cabin on do this thing is there evidence to believe he did this thing I answer those questions no and no\nAnd I also think that your your being far too kind to Dr Ford's very selective memory and her recall is such that she cannot be challenged on anything and she's only certain\nThat Kavanaugh's the bad guy I find that a little too convenient I don't believe it I don't believe that her memory is accurate\nMaybe she believes that this happened to her but I Do not think that her recollection of events squares with ...\nPolicy that said Sally I Do like when people write in who disagree I Do like when people want to try to convince me of their side or just have a different voice heard so don't feel like I'm In any way trying to shut you down or shout you down I I just have to tell you why I strongly disagree with your entire\nPremise on all of this um or I should say I disagree with your analysis on all this\nMax wrote a book a with a new FBI investigation look into the will the new FBI investigation look into the new accusers background where we learn is lousy for ever had a substance abuse problem or a diagnosis of bipolar disorder or borderline personality\nWill we learn what she was like in high school and college or if she ever complain of any other instance of sexual assault or having been molested aren't these things that we should note to assess the reliability of her memories from thirty six years ago\nMax let me tell you uh I I agree in the sense that your question here is why is it that we don't get any answers about lousy for why is it that lousy Ford\nIs sacrosanct she cannot be cross examined she cannot be challenged her sexual history when she was in high school her sexual history in college or as an adult beyond that none of that can be discussed ... meanwhile Kavanaugh can be trashed why is that\nBecause he's accused I'm Sorry but we have a system of justice that relies upon oppositional narratives\nAnd it's not just you get the first crack at somebody and then they don't get to come back and tell their side of the story or this is fundamental to our justice system we are letting it'd be abused in front of us right now because there are so many people\nThat just want to believe lousy for desperately want to believe and for reasons of politics for reasons of their own emotional attachment to the notion of sexual abuse is something that has not taken seriously I reject that by the way I think the sexual abuse has taken very seriously there's\nA reason that sexual abuse in many different ... you know many different iterations is a very serious felonies people go to prison for a long time so I I reject this narrative of sexual abuse is not taken seriously which a lot of people seem to want to believe\nUh Jennifer I'd say their pocket cash listener here first thank you for being a voice of sanity and reason and being hilarious at the same time quick question maybe you can help me with this in terms of the lie detector tests what I've seen release was documentation of missed for being asked\nTwo questions by the administrator in regards to the statement she wrote but she testified June invasive an arduous process that was longer than she expected\nShe told her whole life story being asked a lot of questions and crying a lot which is it as a person who has had to observe a lie detector tests being administered I've never seen a ... question test they're similar to her description under oath long did I miss something and this new cycle it's possible know Jennifer I don't think he missed anything I think the two questions test\nSeemed suspect me all along and I think that the whole polygraph in a way that they have been trying to hold this up as the biggest piece of objective evidence they have I think that it's\nA I I think it's a scam quite honestly I think the polygraphs aren't used in court for good reason and I think that we should all be very clear that what's going on here is all coordinated if you didn't want if she didn't want to come forward\nWhy don't you take that polygraph no one's ever given me a satisfactory answer answer that question no one\nRaymond ... unrelated to current political happenings I've heard you speak briefly on investments and some stands for research

[laughter] I don't do that but anyway uh he asked me what I thought was going to be\nThe the final blow that\nAnd I hate it would be you know get put on the spot like this because you know I'll say something and immediately who's on trial I said there's at least so full of crap you know I I you know sure you know you can make\nPrognostications improper season you can predict stuff and the weatherman does it every day but no one says he's a liar you know and if he makes it makes them every messes up no one says he's a liar well it's like what I Do is kind of like being a weatherman\nI feel around in a in a look around and I see what the atmosphere is I'm Wondering what's going on and\nAnd ah so I made my determination so Jones a PIN me and he said hey so tell me what this final blows give me what do you think it is that I said it's going to be a biological attack on the United states\nWhen he was a great either he's has um and uh I think I've been going on the show again soon probably this'll be a good follow up for that you know when you're talking about this uh\nBut yeah I told him that I felt it would be a biological attack on the United states and speculate on many different occasions that this will be carried out because I started off talking about ... acts in may I talked about the the tabletop exercise of a pandemic\nSo they're they're preparing for some biological attack some contamination some toxic release um I talked about Dina function exercise is something that most people don't know about it and bring it to the forefront of talked about how sometimes in order to do a test run they they take a lesson Marilyn form of something and they released into the public\nAnd they just test to see you know how people react to it\nSometimes they provide them with the antidote sometimes they see how many people checking the hospital how many people stay home how many people bring it to work that you know it's just the way for a the CDC and others to to to monitor the movie the disease and some people don't support this and a lot of people say it's not good to do this but they do it anyway\nUm\nApparently there's a new TV show about doctors called New Amsterdam\nAre barely that was a ... that's a show that's on TV Now and somebody had said that it deals with a guy who gets a bowler Andy brings it to the United states on a plane\nAnd of course we talked about the arrow plague we talked about you know the situation that happened\nUh with the uh Emirates plane before other planes where uh you know there was a different diseases monkey pox and uh gosh all kinds of things are happening and it's all happening at once and they said this is a is is again of these again are forced to exercise\nAnd uh I said you know something is going to happen where are the real things going to go down and when it does you know we all know that this the beginning is the beginning of the\nFinal blow them and so I actually well and it could have been ... through the camp trails and could be you know given through mosquitoes and so today I read that the Pentagon reporter the envelopes containing biological poison\nRice and arrived at the Pentagon\nOr the office of the president and senator Senator Ted Cruz's campaign office\nSo two packages containing rice and\nWhere is intercepted by on the way to the Pentagon and the existence of the suspected packages was had been confirmed by the department of defense officials who indicated the packages never made it to the Pentagon itself the packages were flagged in the mail delivery building on Monday\nBut in announcer they were here until Tuesday that was located next door to the defense department and right there it's at its headquarters the FBI has been called in now\nTo lead the investigation ended up packages which we're addressing the secretary of defense James Mattis out that there was an address to James Mattis chief of naval operations admiral John Richardson and the president Ted Cruz's office they're released this statement\nThis was a statement for the FBI on Tuesday October second twenty Eighteen in coordination with the Pentagon force protection agency FBI special agents took possession of too suspicious angle ups but it'd been screened at the Pentagon mail facility is envelopes are currently undergoing further testing\nIf this is ongoing will have no further comment on this\nShow as Washington DC has been working to figure out of this you know this was any threat to the president Ted Cruz has often said they received a piece of mail it was addressed the Senator Cruz happened this morning when the male is opening contain white powder\nAnd so the night for the Phoenix tower was evacuated after packages found Pentagon also reports that rice and was detected and that uh and and so we're having a full on biological attack biological a poison rice and and just reminded\nMe if you remember when I was talking about the project for the new American Century I said something to the fact that ah one of the other ways that they can change the direction of anything politically is to use biological warfare and even biological warfare that has a certain abilities to mark\nA you know biological markers that would you would actually activate this stuff and and rice and acts upon your DNA if ingested or if it's injected\nIf you inhale it it's a you can survive a inhaling a rice and it's just that you can die if you're not taking care of\nSo uh it's just some uh pretty scary stuff going on right now and so you know timing is everything and uh I think that uh once again we're seeing history repeating itself because remember back in Nineteen eighty four the Russian each called here in Oregon tried to poison the group of people to try and change the vote\nOr in Dallas, Oregon and ah\nI think here we're seeing a somebody trying to either stop the investigation into cabinet or to believe that the investigation into Kavanaugh or what they're doing is they're trying to find a way to a distract us from it\nOr there's there's a number of things you know especially going down during this time is that I think is volatile time in this country and ah I said the other night on the ground zero lounge they probably will have this investigation wrapped up by Wednesday\nThey'll hand down their decision in the American people probably won't hear what the decision is and they don't have to be happy I doesn't have to reveal anything about their investigation they could put it to a vote and Kevin I'm going to be confirmed and I think it would trigger a lot of anger\nWith a lot of people in this country if Kavanaugh actually becomes chief justice and so tomorrow it to Eighteen eastern time they're gonna be doing that tests and emergency test on your telephone so as I said timing is everything this peculiar\nAnd uh I think we should have a discussion about this because I think that uh you know as we were predicting it I predict it on our showing the show I talked about it at great length\nOn this program for a good long time and people who is this program know\nLived on this people who let's this program know that if I'm On to something and I see the patterns these things go down and when they go down and it's not necessarily to the exact you know 'cause I remember when we talked about the pope stepping down when Ratzinger stepped down and we said oh you know he would\nProbably leave retired die even within three months he left the ... he left the papacy and one of my friends was really blown away by this but it was because we can see you know the talk we heard that we heard the Marines and rumors coming up from Rome\n\nThere's several other times in instances where we have a pretty much reported ... be prepared for the students happen we're not always right before damn close believe it or not or damn close\nSo we're obviously seeing the beginnings of what would be the final blow if\nThis gets out of hand [noise] I'd say be prepared because if the work goes down tomorrow that cabin off and some people aren't pleased we can see some more civil unrest in some of the major cities across the country [noise] so we have to prepare for that not that it will happen but repair if it does happen [noise]\nDribble a fisherman three thirty seven hundred extra
