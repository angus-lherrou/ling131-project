of the unpopular votes and the unpopular choices but they don't particularly like yet they are going psychotic [noise]\nBut there are some that are responding butter justice psychotic the the those are the right to responding so yes everyone is driving a nail in the corporate America [noise]\nMore so one side to the other teams actions that we're ... we're basically motivated by sure emotion about been motivated by\nIt was rage it's beyond emotion now it's all about right and this is getting dangerous and while it would be prudent to tell people that perhaps it's time to heal and choose our battles no one will listen because there are vendettas to be settled in revenge is a dish that his best served cold in America\nYou whenever I speak of civil war ... civil of people in America I often get told that it will never get that bad Clyde and then I fear mongering for the sake of clicks or ratings or whatever you think I'm doing well I always say back to people\nBut it's certainly cynics that are there in order to keep telling yourself that America is still United however it appears that that ship has sailed\nAnd living through a civil war in South America can teach you what to expect and it it's a real experience that I talked about that and the first hour\n\nI mean I Want to make it clear that during the civil war in a modern day in a modern city modernist city like when a ...\nI mean life was normal except for little things that would make you wonder if you would make it through the day or if you will be able to do routine things I mean I can imagine that the United states the civil war would be similar\nExcept that we have the Internet that's the difference see I mean the outbreak of a civil war in the United states wouldn't look all that different\nTo the normal news cycle regularly you know and that's the thing that I think people don't understand it doesn't look different than the normal news cycle and what they would regularly report it's the same thing I mean he begins with something like a politically motivated mass shooting\n\nAnother example would be a biological attack on the United states either in a major city or directed at Congress or to the president\n\nAnd I know I've talked about the final blow I don't know if that was the final blow but it certainly set the ball rolling\nBecause it was a political attack using rice and a poison that was aimed at certain people including the president the United states if they would have sent all that the members of Congress we would have had an attempt to the decapitation exercise\n\nWe all know that the anthrax attacks happened in two thousand one after the nine eleven attacks\n\nSeattle we have the rice attack that happened just before the cabinet vote\n\nWe talked about the Russian each cult and how they tried to use biological warfare is a way to get people not to vote or to somehow change the direction politically of an area here in in Oregon I mean these are simple politically motivated attacks\nAnd these attacks are usually supposed to not only change directions politically but they're also there to generate copycat attacks\n\nAnd these can be both domestic terror attacks in foreign attacks whose sole purpose is generating a backlash they're simply done in order to provoke a response if the response is overwhelming and police department's going to keep up with a politically sectarian violence then we will see the next phase of civil warfare\n\nAnd that is the domino effect if there is an insurgent and the domino effect is in play military crackdown on any kind of insurgency will be inevitable this will be your martial law scenario except it will either be the military working with an already militarized police\nOr the police working against the military\n\nThere also be restrained to start with how or if there is an insurgency there will be some re straight at first but then the insurgency military weapons\nMartial law all these things can be applied to a situation I don't know if they will go that far but it can be applied I mean there's a misconception that in a modern civil war there'll be two sides\nAnd the reason why we think this\nIs because we look back in history and we all know that it was the union believed to be into less slavery and the confederation really being more slavery but most people are thinking right now but if there was a civil war in the United states it would be two sided and that's it\nLike Republican against Democrat conserve against liberal no not how it's going to be\nThat's not what a civil war will be in the United states if this happens you know it's not modern civil war would have many so called side's\nSeeing the dirty war South America there were several sides that we're fighting there were the parent is kind of nice there's the radicals radicalize the communist coming east is the Nazis the Catholic Church the Jews who into the police the moderate plaza I can go down all the list of who are fighting against to\nThe age group would have their own band of terrorists carrying out executions abductions and torture of course the government had access to the police they had access to corrupt cops had access to ... military and so of course the government utilize them whenever they could the church would utilize them as well\nYou're pope by the way was part of that group\nSeeing America we didn't have a left wing group incite violence or insurgency that what sparked a response from black lives matter or me too but all eyes would be an anti far because they're usually the ones that carry out all this stuff\nOn this stuff hits the fan\nOver the weekend there was a vigil in Portland, Oregon for Patrick Kimmons there was a black man who was shot by police afterwards members of anti five blocks streets directed traffic getting harassed drivers and other people the police booked on and allow the harassment to happen it was horrible\n\nAn elderly man who made the mistake of not following orders of anti pot what's called a racist at a Nazi among other things and there was chased down by an angry mob where they proceeded to use ... times and other weapons the damages vehicle\nThe police looked on\nThe driver says he was following two other cars that made a right hand turns instead of a left when one protester stepped in front of his car and the other surrounding the man was out numbered probably scared and did not know what he did wrong the truth is he did nothing\nWrong and it could have wound up\nWith him being beaten or shot once again the police looked on didn't do anything didn't intervene\n\nYeah I had about three thousand dollars worth of damage done to his car\n\nOnce again of a civil war breaks out there that are here or in the United states would not be two sides fighting\nWhere you can see hundreds of sides with hundreds of agendas yearning and fighting for independence\n\nThere are separatists groups in America the militia groups oath keeper storm front patriot prayer Proud Boys Christian sects Muslim groups all these guys could come together and feel the flames for civil war other and certainly the\nKennedys could be criminal gangs I gave us their team black nationalist groups white nationalist sovereign citizens generally any armed organized group with some kind of history to it now with the Internet\n\nWe would see more organized insurgency through social networking\n\nIs anybody remembers the purge threat August Fifteen twenty four team the mainstream news was reporting on the events that were happening in Ferguson, Missouri for the first time in\nSince the LA Riots in Nineteen Ninety One\nThe United states was watching what appeared to be a scene from the movie the siege\nWere
