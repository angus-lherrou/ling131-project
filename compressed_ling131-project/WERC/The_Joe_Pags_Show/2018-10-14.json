you want to hear from this person\nOn some of the networks will say that the person who's a contributor well that means is the person's getting paid for your parents or an analyst\nGenerally speaking

amendment\nThen\nChristie lousy forward would have stopped the Kavanaugh nomination an appointment\nAnd she's never really said why and again I don't really care why ... why she is not an expert\nI talked about this but talk about this for a while now but we just we sometimes see our top athletes with people that we really like or actors or actresses people that we see you on the tube or or on

she actually makes intelligent people arguing may\nSay well I'm definitely not going to vote that way\nLook how dumb just the thing is that she's saying or looking at taking selfies or taking videos while sitting in a very serious hearing\nOr look at her blindly saying you must believe every woman 'cause every woman who's telling the truth when we've got documented case after case after case

because you brush the but you took my first time in ... her let's say that's her that's ...\n... and not know you got a hold of me because you are seeing what was unfolding uh in in Washington DC I still to this day sir I have no idea how Lisa Murkowski ... became the senator as a write in\nRelief so that's the starting point for me and then she says as a Republican IQ support Brett Kavanaugh and the reason she said she couldn't support him was that he's not the right guy at the right time [noise]\nDo the people of Alaska except that excuse you\nKnow and go back even further\nWriting campaign after he lost the primary up here remember what's her Senator Frank workout after having served twenty two years in the U.S that he gave her daughter the job\nWhen he was elected governor up here right there on charming and I ran against him in defeated yep right at least in the in the man once\nYeah and and you have these special interests from around the country right a funding you you know you should have to it's tough to hold them accountable and say okay enough is enough time to go but no I'm irrational reasoning that she provided regarding that that\nThat vote against Kavanaugh because as you point out she said he's good man it's not about qualifications and I'm like wait you know about calls like of course it is and whether either good matter\nYes I'm so no it didn't make sense and then her speech on the Senate floor which is kind of talking in circles are very very very disappointed because Joe as you suggested as an outright set on friday\nThe things that she's putting in jeopardy just for the state of Alaska but for his country I mean it come down to the Supreme\nHaving so much with in its graph having to do with our call see our sovereignty and she was willing to play some games with that\nWell she was willing to play games and the point that I made that I really appreciate but you but you are you like was it up and our circuit court of appeals at all over the ... opinion of course the former vice presidential nominee for the Republican Party back to two thousand eight and of course\nThe former governor of Alaska and just a great all wrong person or you know this but I wasn't a vote for John McCain who's going to write of my mother's name until you got on the ticket and then I voted for you\nSo I think a lot of people actually did that the point I made friday was Lisa Murkowski and people like her were actually putting in the hands of the most liberal court in the United states the Ninth Circuit court of appeals\nThe the um the more issues of Alaska and their money in the west coast in other words if the Supreme Court has eight members and it's hard for the foreign almost every woman would be for the for now it goes back to the previous court in the Ninth Circuit court of appeals will decide the first amendment Second Amendment Fourth Amendment Fifth Amendment Pence Amendment for Alaska what does that make you think\nThey know that that's exactly right and Joe I was impressed because no one else was talking about that share what her\nAction was was essentially bolstering the Ninth Circuit had she had her her way and that's the Ninth Circuit out of\nA Francisco right he talked about injustice and justice being delayed for Alaskan because that court a million people they are to quote unquote served it's the largest by far\nThe second largest the eleventh and they are only serving thirty five million right so there is such a backlog of cases and not even talking about the ideology behind that very very partisan very liberal Korea is just a practical reasons why we don't want to give them any more power\nAnymore say over Alaska so for at least to be messing around with that uh that was very very dangerous and

governor the former governor of great state of Texas Rick Perry he's the energy secretary for the United states of America no and you might wonder well with the actors that person do\nA lot clearly and a lot of travel is well we talked to about bad we talked about liquefied natural gas we go to an war as well ... how are you\nJoe I'm good thank you very much we're I'm up in Washington DC for a few days here so you know taxes but it's a it's what I call temporary duty\nAnd you're fighting the fight very well it's interesting as you know I'm connected with several people on your staff and I I can see their travel\nOn Facebook and on Twitter and so on you or your or a globe Trotter now is it did you know that was going to be part of the job to be over in Africa there'd be over in Europe to be over in Asia and then back home base it on your back over Indonesia where did you know that that was going to entail all those\nAre not necessarily but what's happened is is the\nEnergy revolution runners off that occurred in the United states it makes sense in hindsight that would be an all those markets because it's you know we're now selling American a liquefied natural gas into thirty different countries on five continent that's great\nAnd uh there there's more to be done so I'm being there uh I I consider one of my jobs of it obviously being a regulator making sure that we're\nA you know were regulated at the permit process is smooth and as\nA as as transparent as it can be but it's also to be the you know a salesman for American energy whether it's a a liquefied natural gas for the rich are crude whether it's our fossil fuels whether its nuclear energy whether it's a A R renewable technologies all of that is desired around the world\nAnd the secretary of energy that ought to be their job\nIt's the United states secretary of energy Rick Perry so I'm watching the the the terror of talk of the trade talk and the leverage that are that the president has and and he's putting it on the EU and everybody in the left in this country ... they're all complaining he's no good he's putting terms is going to ruin trade and in no time flat\nBiggie you stepped up and said we're making the deal we don't want the terrorists we want to have fair trade him in a big part of the deal was liquefied natural gas\nNow are you are you consulted as the president's doing that as you like Rick can we do this Ellen gee thing can we make this happen can we make a part of the deal how does that go down\nThere he he obviously talks of you know [noise] extensively with his cabinet or the as the secretary of treasury my notion and secretary of commerce Wilbur Ross day all have\nA role to play and that and and so absolutely there's\nA there's there's good and a correspondent back and forth and a ... everybody's on the same team\nI Want to get back to you know this is what people should expect I mean I Know the left doesn't like it for a lot of reasons that I you know ... that is what it is right uh but they're not being realistic they're just they're just they don't like him because he's not Hillary\nA true\nBut it's true and and and the point is that what you would expect to see out of a a negotiator a person who goes in what they really hard line I mean he he plans on winning me his his theory here is that listen if I trade yet and you agree to it\nYou know that's your fault not mine\nUh and and that's exactly what he's doing with these trade deals where he comes to a certain really hard stuff\nMade me think about with you and then a young and came back in here uh after they laid out some really tough sanctions are not sanctions but ... ...\nA trade deals with the Europeans and they said you know what we decided we want to buy your allergy and let's let's find a way so to the Chinese ... again you know hedge blew up when they announced the tariffs to originally with China and then the Chinese came back a few days later\nThe Chinese know that they will lose a\nThey know that we will lose a a trade war or the Chinese or they'll lose a trade war with us so yeah\nI guess where their biggest customers they don't want to screw with us that would be doing it\nSo we just want you to be fair we want you to be right an equitable we want you to be transparent oh and we don't want stealing our IP either our international uh our our intellectual property\nRights of a good neighbor\nYeah that that's another big part of it it's a energy secretary Rick Perry you're in the state of Texas so efficiently and our economy here still booming under the great guidance of a great guy but now when you get into a position where you know there's so much bureaucratic red tape\nAnd there's so much garbage that you've got to go through before you can actually get to the source of the issue when you finally got to see what these trade deals worth especially energy wise with these other countries\nWere you surprised at how uh how completely out of balance they were we got very little they get everything it was very strange\nIt it was really pretty fascinating and\nHere's the other side of it is these things were outdated do you think about the north American free trade agreement that was put in place I think in Ninety two as one side\nThat was twenty five years ago and and think about where America was twenty five years ago from an energy standpoint I mean completely a hundred and eighty degree uh we were dependent on a lot of countries that didn't necessarily have our interest in mind who are uh\nA the energy sources that we were buying and now I'm you know Mexico and and and and Canada both very different positions than we were twenty five years ago so makes a button that good sense that the president will say you know what

not associated with is offering media and its affiliates in that responsible for the information\nThe information exists I tend to better knock on wood the information\nFiled with the securities and Exchange Commission news radio one oh five five you we are see\nRight when he was sent to cross the land Joe packs dot com faceless litter Instagram email always there also the live video stream it is the weekend with Joe packs lab\nYour long for the ride so talking about a ride the stock market as we took a bumpy ride some say a roller coaster some say just went straight down I'm the president calling the fed logo\n... I guess I guess that's the issue I'm not even sure what that means but whenever the financial markets thing or potential question I always go to my friend Doug Adler use the manager director and senior vice president of investments ruby dreams that associates or Doug I always appreciate it [noise]\nHow's it going brother Joe I'm great thank you\nSo uh all the president has to say is that the fed is logo and that we get eleven hundred\nPoints it due to the negative on the stock market people obviously you're freaking out some of them are dug you know be I think the stock market as a slot machine anyway so but I don't really worry about it my four oh one K. still looks great today um but people are freaking out about can you point to one thing that made this happened ... conglomeration of things\nYeah I think it's a conglomeration of things Joe it what's always interesting about the market is\nThings that we know that are potential headwinds the market looks at it stares at it shrug it off drugs that often and so it it it matters I think what's got manifested here is we know that the Federal Reserve is on this trajectory of raising interest rates so\nWhat does that really at the end of the day designed to do cool off the economy so that brings into question next year twenty Nineteen what earnings look like\nTrade a China looks like a tough a a photo if you will in in this regard so that's problematic we've had a few companies a pre announce their earnings which don't didn't look necessarily great\nOil has gone up the you know this I'm up to Seventy five now it's pulled back the last couple of days like everything towards Seventy but still it's a much higher than it was Eighteen months ago I had went on the economy should have some of these things that no those have all been there but suddenly that mattered and people that sell button\nDo you have a video ... managing director senior vice president over at a room a gym that associates you have an opinion as to why the fed would want to cool off the economy [noise]\n[noise] well they have this in a state inflation target of two percent going here and then when you start to see how much oil as an example there's other places we can point to that are that are showing some inflationary pressure\nWhich is part and parcel of course to a stronger economy in this economy as much stronger than it was when President Trump took office right you're getting some of those pressures\nFed tries to stay in front of that because it's kind of like you know the old porridge three little bears story they don't want it too hot or too cold yeah they want to just right and so they're trying to\nDo that meaning a slow things down into that sweet spot where we have reasonable growth but maybe that's three percent with reasonable inflation which they were there do you mean to be two percent so that's that's why they're doing it\nIs it rational or reasonable Doug of a I heard today somebody may mentioned that there's a rumor that the left is trying to do this before the midterm election if the if the Trump ... starts to tank and they said oh let's see it didn't work all those the through the tax cuts and all that stuff is it reasonable rational depicted politically people can make this happen [noise]\nUm I that's a stretch that's a pretty big stretch um I think about it if you're on that side of the political ledger you're kind of hurting yourself right if you write festival if things go down I I don't see that yeah\nOkay a gambler he's managing director of the vice president of a investments of regimes that associates so as we watch this you know Obama when he was an office that I talk to you about this before we started so he doesn't pay attention to the daily dry rations of the stock market or when it wasn't doing so great and and what it was doing great\nLook how great I Am I'm this of course the left politically is saying well see the bubbles burst for you know sixteen months Eighteen months almost two years now they've been sending the bubbles going to burst this can't continue like this do you think this is something temporary\nAnd it will correct itself again or are we seeing that maybe you do get too big for his bridges yeah no I I think\nAre so investing the one thing that gets lost a lot of times is people either think it's a bull market or bear market and they have an opinion based on how they feel about things\nBut really what it it's a probability business and so if one were to answer that question by looking at the probabilities I think you say this fed some deregulatory reform that's positive we've had tax reform massively positive we have an economy that had been held back because the consumer\nAnd then very low in terms of their confidence in the outlook All right now and this is actually right we're at twenty year high something like that in consumer confidence I think last week we hit an all time high since Nineteen sixty nine for small business confidence so when you feel good about the prospects what do you do you open up your wallet\nAnd in that regard I have to tell you this is really for found two things first one is\nDebt service so that's just simply what comes in and income or into a household and then what goes out for obligations like student loans car payments mortgages credit card debt okay read at the lowest level the percentage of income and go into debt services the lowest level since the mid seventies\nAnd household net worth in this country such assets minus liabilities it's a hundred trillion dollars a hundred trillion although I'm Hi yeah\nSo if my debt obligations are low if my wallet or purses is full of cash as it's ever been and I feel good about things what's the odds that I'm going to suddenly just stop spending money because the Dow drops eleven hundred points\nWell it's not affecting my spending that's a great question and it's interesting but you bring it up that way because I think it was two months ago maybe a month ago we were hearing that big box stores are reporting better sales we've ever seen ever restaurants we're seeing more people go out to eat\nThan they've ever seen the big scene in two generations so clearly people do have more expendable cash", "show_name": "The Joe Pags Show", "year": "2018", "city": "Birmingham", "day": "14"}
