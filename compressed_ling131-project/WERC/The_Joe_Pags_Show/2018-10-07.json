E. R. C. Birmingham\nComing you we are seeing them over and I ... radio station it's nine o'clock\n[noise]\nA judge to a justice I'm rich Dennison Fox News the centered on Saturday confirming Brett Kavanaugh to a seat on the Supreme\nHer her very good friend Leighton somebody a girl that I have absolutely no recollection of that ever happening and I don't think I've ever met bright capital\nAnybody and everybody else but she said was that the party has refuted the quite well Christie lousy Ford testified in front of his panel beside the Judiciary Committee\nAnd leaving their left and right middle everybody's orange credible credible witness credible which is actually true she's not credible she might be believable that she really is\nWhich really does believe that she's a victim and something really did happen to her but it is incredible that it was bright cabinet and it's simple due to go down logically as to why\nShe doesn't know when it happened not even a year doesn't know where it happened not even the neighborhood doesn't know whose house would was doesn't know how she got to the party doesn't know how she left the party she's been incorrect about everybody she says was that the party and she's actually give it a couple of different numbers as to how many people were at the party\nBrett Kavanaugh on the other hand has\nCorroborating his story and he's got a a calendar that shows what he was doing every weekend and every weekday basically\nIn Nineteen eighty two or whatever it was\nSo as much as she might have been believable that something happened to her and I hope she gets built CDs and help the person who did it is brought to justice but it was not credible her allegations against this guy specifically\nAnd that's a appointed ability Asia and that the the legacy media didn't want to have legacy media didn't want to say well\nShe's credible as somebody who probably had something happened to her but it is not credible what she's saying about brick cabinet the legacy media didn't do its job and then to report that correctly the second accusation\nWhich I'm a woman named Deborah Ramirez who says that at a party there were playing some game\nThat I don't know it was due to spin the bottle or is it was a quarter as if they were playing something to where if you lost you had a drink and they were purposely making her drink and got her so drunk you're going to remember anything and then uh she's told\nBrett Kavanaugh put her but whose member were pulled pulled it out and put it it near her face\nNow she admittedly doesn't remember it\nAnd when Democrats staffers from the Democrats senators that are on the panel calls are contacted her she spent six days calling old friends asking headed something happened to me\nYou remember anything happened to me and nobody remembers that either\nBut after six days she decided yeah I I guess it did happen\nI wasn't I wasn't sure but yeah I I Am now you did it I don't remember him doing it but I remember people telling me that he did it\nToo much Kavanaugh said you know there was anything like that what are you talking about the third one\nIs from slime ball lawyer ... it was really sweating ... who says that for three years Brett Kavanaugh mark judge worthy organizers of parties where there would be trains are boys partake in gang rape\nCabinet and judge she said which bike the punch with grain alcohol\n\nAnd quite moods she knew this was going on but she was smart enough to not drink the punch\nThen one day and this happen between Nineteen eighty one Nineteen eighty three she said but one day a one party you went to ten of them in Nineteen eighty two she somehow was the victim and it was gang raped will continue to go into the parties for the another full year\nAnd instead of calling the police\nWhich she said was just don't drink the punch she changed her story to NBC News at least once NBC News instead of saying we can't run this because she's not viable not credible not believable\nThat ran it anyway and then said it's important to note that the stories you're saying today is different or there are differences from the stories you originally told us her story is changed a bunch of times in her history comes out especially somebody that makes you got about allegations all the time\nSo completely not credible\nBut that didn't matter to grow because Booker and that didn't matter too lazy that didn't matter to Feinstein that didn't matter to close it didn't matter to Kamala Harris\nIt didn't matter to any of these people he was he's guilty Cory Booker grow because the colds all Spartacus but he's admitted Grover when he was Fifteen he groped a girl he he admits that he's a senator somehow\nHe actually said at this point it doesn't matter if he was guilty or innocent\nCory Booker said that and he meant that\nIt doesn't matter if judge Kavanaugh's guilty or innocent at this point well that I Believe galvanized us as a people we said that's not fair due process of there's been this country is guaranteed you are innocent until proven guilty and if that's the threshold than it is\nThen he's innocent\nNothing any of these women has said or the the the slimy lawyer has said or the far left wing resist lawyer cats who is a lawyer for Ford nothing they've said\nHas proven anything\nAll you have is Deborah bureaus completely uncorroborated in fact refuted by people Julie sweating it just seems to be a ... from outer space story she's given and received Ford\nOnly vase say something happened\nEverybody else named and the FBI spent five days\nSix days interviewing many more people who didn't come to the ... offer of evidence that there is no corroboration there is nothing more here\n\nYet the left is still today going Twitter read your favorite website they still today have these paid\nProtesters showing up in the Senate halls their dachshund people which means are putting out their information their their phone numbers or addresses\nIt say a violent crew of idiots better still just completely disconnected from the rest of us Melissa mulatto is your spokesperson Amy Schumer is your spokesperson\nAnd their argument against Kavanaugh they're still attempting they're still exempting these days are rapists\nSerial rapists and about a rapist on the court it's it's a disgusting this way\nThey are trying their best to change the best although flawed system judicial system on earth to to being Saudi Arabia or something or China\nCome on man\nSo Brett Kavanaugh and again as I Do a show it's not happened yet but I assume that he will be confirmed later today there are a couple of things that could happen between now and men and and yes we've got to talk about Lisa Murkowski\nWho is a an alleged Republican from Alaska who is going to vote against Brett Kavanaugh today\nAnd she the reason she gave was\nHe's a good man just not the right guy for the job right now with what come home and so I Need your thoughts

of the left politics [noise] eight hundred five zero one Seventy eighty let me go to the phone lines to see where you are on this goes were either a country divided or were country galvanized I think this was just\nAn absolute practice\nIn futility for the left and I think that it probably served to motivate bows on the right I think you'll see a lot more conservatives and Republicans do\nGo to any centrist that lead right go to the polls for the midterm whereas they might have sat at home before I think the Republicans will gain two or three seats in the Senate and we'll keep control of that body or it's still going to be very close to my house\nBut it'd be a better troops now because now the bases riled up\nThis was a really bad miscalculation by the left in this country the

a very good point the Republicans were very weak in the beginning venture with the goal by the way I'm very weak in the beginning they just didn't want her to keep decorum they wanted to keep it all up and up and I and I can appreciate that but when the hearings distorted let's go back to that a month ago\n[noise] as soon as grassy started speaking Kamala Harris interrupted him rudely [noise] you know all this fake outrage about how Kavanaugh interrupted Feinstein and some others because he was fighting for his political and personal life and for his family\nKamala Harris purposely interrupted him ... Cory Booker purposely interrupted him I think ... [noise] ... ... it was it was set up but you had protesters that\nThere are some pictures out there that suggests they were getting paid to go to the cheaper in protest all this week outrage about Brecht cabin on it and he's ... and his temperament is it's all be yes\nBut I agree with you the Republicans aggressor you I think that in the end they did it the right way but as that was going on hey wait a second elections have consequences we won were in charge of that can be I Will clear this room would be given interrupting\nThen it would probably would proper protocol is when they were breaking it on purpose\nJust been really thought through putting on a show which somehow women for them it turned out it made them look like idiots will be it used to that they are Clyde in Lexington, Kentucky I lied what's going on\nYour back by much taking my call really you've got a\nI think the Democrats are definitely oh now they're [laughter] they're getting worse every month they are just getting worse and worse and to try to take this man down it's just\nVery frustrating thing is I Can't understand how anybody could think that Corning crying or at a man makes him guilty\nAnd you got to listen to both sides if that's true but that's why the court case and I just I get off of what they're trying to do to Brett Kavanaugh because the guy obviously has a lot of classic that very well rounded young man I call and young because I'm sixty six I'm over the hill\nBut ice he he he's just a great guy and I hate to think that people think that our justice system is going to come down to just pointing the finger and you're automatically guilty of due process in this country now and I understand that that's what makes this country great everybody gets a fair trial\nSo here's a store

Will never say them survivor of a sexual assault more than one\nUm I was in law enforcement as well and I think that if we listen and we let off allegations like the ...\nI'm Dr Ford may have been I felt it but there is nothing can compare that with Kavanaugh\nRight if we let women like this come forward and did it kind of damage to announce reputation it's actually going to set back women have to find like decade [noise] um I I went through a horrible time in the seventies when I was attacked\nAnd it was because of women that come forward with I mean that's why we have that term crime rate ... women have notoriously gun at when they've been scorned or that\nOr or or many other things and the fact that we would want the ... that we wouldn't want judge Kavanaugh\nWho surprisingly enough he's now in the second highest court in the country nobody came forward before now it it's just a political campaign and I do I do agree with the whole idea that they're becoming more socialist\nI have a friend that that would actually grew up in Argentina and came here and became is that if she is\nA hard core Republican and and try to explain to people what it truly like to live in a socialist country\nWe don't want to go that way but I just find it so hypocritical that here we're examining the person for a job in a courtroom he's supposed to be fair right we get that when he showed his emotions when he's being attacked unjustly\n... you couldn't be more correct I mean do you use facing something one of the most honest there are things I've ever seen and then be charges no go and be fair and and ...\nIs it about this uh I'm Sorry I'm Sorry that happened to you and I'm Glad that you're a survivor and you're not looking at yourself as a victim no I I I Wonder do you

nation's high court\nIt's one of the slimmest Supreme Court confirmation votes ever\nNot listen I I wanted him to do it I you know ... it up I'll go he'd been so you know tough on it and and it was time you know you you see the nonsense that is going on you say that the reality is that there's no one that could have accomplished what he's been able to do\nThat no one that you know with so few that ever signed the front of a paycheck so few that had ever you know in our whole political system that had ever had their someone's family some of the livelihood their safety and wellbeing of their kids and grandkids dependent on their success he'd actually done it I mean\nWas the big laugh I had last week when you know Obama's running around claiming ... you know\nI remember when Obama say hey you didn't build that it's like\nNow now now he owns it right because his policies of oppressive taxation insane regulation general hatred of towards the business and we went oh you didn't do that I mean Obama himself when my father I I don't know why we couldn't have three\nThree and a half four percent even even better right GDP Growth Obama goes and well there's no magic wand for that right now we have to New York times back them up and I don't know because you know of course he can do no wrong\nNow this is the new normal what Africa Deborah yeah of course we expect Obama to be able to fix anything you've ever done anything\nIt turns out your ... your damage\nDone anything it never had any experience there was no and we should expect him to be able to fix anything I can\nBut guess what my father has done that he has built businesses or he didn't build that\nAnd so it shouldn't be a shock to people that were able to turn that around and now the Democrats won a reversal of that they want to take everything into one eighty why because we have an all time historic lows for blacks and unemployment for Hispanics\nFor women you you want a reversal that I mean if the Democrats the ... as far as Donald Trump came out today in favor of oxygen\nDemocrats would be against it I mean that's their policy it's just hate\nBut we have to show up we have to stay on the fight because people's they've done I Love your dad to doing it so great it's amazing it's\nYou know but I say well how are you voting for who your congressman they are voting for November what do you mean it was November right they're not they want to vote and twenty twenty but they don't realize that it can all go away in twenty Eighteen they don't realize that Donald Trump is on the ticket in twenty Eighteen Donald Trump is on the ticket in six weeks\nSo we got to get out we got to mobilize if you like what's going on\nMixture of fight for it because the other side I don't know what they're motivated by I don't even know what their platform is other than you'll hate and outrage I mean you know what their outrage or they should be outraged about their platform and their failures over the last few decades but they are outraged about something else\nBut they are turning up we got to turn up I said all the time they're like no no no the same fake news media that said Donald Trump can't win and saying that he's going to lose now\nBelieve it I see the numbers you got to get out you got to stay in we can't just be fat how being lazy and expect this stuff to continue he needs he needs guys like Ted Cruz he needed guys like ... to all of the congressional people in Texas that are up he need those guys helping them he can't do it by himself and I didn't giving the house to Nancy Pelosi\nSeries like is there a question I think about it I mean that would be a disaster for this\nCountry because we got to turn I mean we've got to bring our friends\nIt's trending on drugs today the ... you blows you use saying I'm going to be the speaker again it's Donald Trump junior and do we we always appreciate the time a couple of things they didn't realize that your dad had the magic wand the whole time and one\nWas common sense and experience right you know this isn't a magic wand it's just you know you can't expect a community organizer to ... understand let alone actually affects the way it real change when it comes to economic our fiscal policy by on fiscal what I think about it we we've discussed the economy I Know him what about foreign policy\nI look at the end you look at the Israeli embassy you look at what's going on in North Korea that took guts\nFine you know we don't just draw red line in Syria like Obama did when they crossed that they slap you in the face will they they tried doing that at least fifty seven Tomahawk missiles in there and guess what the rest of the world was watching\nOkay we were not going to let people take advantage of something whether it's trade deals got NAFTA it can't be renegotiated can be done\nAnd never been against what congratulations Mexico and Canada now on board done ... when when when you have a real leader\nI Wish that we had somebody in journalism in journalism was dead known him and he says is all the time to use it didn't go on one person steps up and says\nFormer President Obama just told me one thing you did that caused this to happen because how do you take credit for it if you look you're dead when one eighty on everything Obama dude and fixed everything how can Obama even for a second even think to himself yeah I did that because we're\nNot we're not fighting a fair fight and that's why we all have to get out because we're fighting with one arm to arms to arms and a leg it feels like at times because the media will yeah like I said oh no this is the new normal one point ... percent what doesn't that doesn't have to be why why would the New York times back him up on that because they needed to make him a success because they all believe in the asinine policies you see that\nI mean look at what's going on in fact that in bed or August putting up a challenge I mean Beto O'Rourke and run for mayor of New York city and be on the left side of a ticket\nI mean and that's really the only way you know his his money's coming from all places other than Texas\nBecause you know those are in Texas the values that he espoused or you know the attacks on law enforcement want to eliminate ice in the ... I mean ice only save nine hundred kids last year from you know a sex trafficking but there are terrible we should get rid of them I mean these people are insane and so we have to get out we have to stay motivated we have to bring our friends\nAnd you can't buy into the media stuff just look at what's going on in your business is look at what's going on your place of work looking your paycheck I mean you're winning with these policies these policies are moving the needle these policies are making a difference in America's getting respect again because we're not going to let little third world countries push us around and slap us around\nYou know I gained ... and we have\nTo remember that because they can all go away in November\nAnd people need to realize that it's Donald Trump junior and I appreciate the extras let's talk about Texas I as you know I'm based in San Antonio Fifteen stations in Texas we've got a hundred and twelve around the country but we focus now on taxes because who's been over ... challenge Robert fruits as a war because what I call these somehow called appropriating but he's Hispanic and he's\nNot he's not at all Hispanics and he'll pretend he is for the road but that's a democratic ... you can get away by the way if Ted Cruz did something like that now he happens to actually be Hispanic swimming but if it's something like that they would destroy ... absolutely you you you were an every day for ... or\nIt's not a problem when he said something about what was the voluptuous breast or whatever that that's not a problem that only one day story of Ted Cruz did that it it would be you know he shouldn't be disbarred he should be you know write it killed ...\nWe're not fighting a fair fight and there's down ticket races that are dependent on this thing has been great for Texas He's done he's fought for those values I look at the ... platform and like I said I mean this is in New York City mayoral candidate running for senator in Texas\nWell he's getting big support from Ellen so you know that's good it was like oh this is Donald Trump junior so you're in Texas you got Ted Cruz who I've known for ... wait longer than he's been a senator and he's always made promises that he's always done exactly what he said he would do what's your ... your dad and then went out in the primaries but they're very very similar politically in that they're not\nDoing it politically they say I'm going to do this this this ... and you're dead and Ted actually believe I should do those things I promise veto it was just given us you know a rainbows and puppy dogs it's weird well\nOf course I listen I I really respect that I mean it was it was a brutal primary and a little story I don't know if I'd actually even said this publicly but you know a couple of weeks after that and it was a brutal primary there was a big ... a a dinner in DC you know the usual you know this stuff\nI I went and all my friends are from Texas I'm there all the time hunting fishing her is a lot of money to campaign down in Texas I'm sitting there at the Texas table and a couple of friends\nTests at the table and we actually have a great dinner good conversation at the end of the dinner and say hey you know we're going back to the Trump Hotel right in the middle of the AC on Pennsylvania Avenue we're gonna have a couple of drinks hanging out whatever you want to come along\nIt came with us and that and the Trump Hotel we had a great time for three hours knows\nThat got you know but you know when it showed me beyond the guts is he understood dumps I was going to be president and he was going to help support policies that he believed in that we're going to be good for America and they were going to be good for tax and he was able to put all of that aside and now they have a great relationship\nBecause they're doing what's right for their constituencies that was impressive to me that was a great\nA testament to his character and everything and I don't think I've ever told that story before but I think it's actually relevant huh because you're doing what's right for your constituency and I don't see that everywhere else I mean they can look at where\nBagel rocks money is probably coming from that probably doesn't represent the average guy in Texas right now that it's probably represent the average guy in Hollywood studio somewhere else you know that's\nThe difference and I don't want Texas to become California at Texas a I mean just look at the economic success if it had to look at all this debt but you want to become California give me a\n... and the people from California bringing their politics but that doesn't make any sense to me it's a it's Donald Trump junior\nYou have an opinion as to why anybody would listen to I'm going to take away your tax cut ... I'm going to lower your paycheck we're going to open the border we're going to get rid of arguments in forcing the border in every single week they are either catch agreements Thirteen or stopping sex trafficking why would anybody want new you blows you to be in charge of getting things are going so great right now why you have no idea but like I said\nWe're we're not in a fair fight you know the media will\nShow this was all the right thing to do if I Am all for taking care of other people want to take care of our own problems but we've got plenty of friends who are going to disastrous education system where what twenty eight and the ... the world after a long list of third world countries to the gym and half of you know to spend that I have\nSpent the a small fraction of what we spend per capita right I mean we had we had that problem that we're working on fixing and they're making great progress with all of those things but like we need to keep going and you're going to have people in there that basically the next two years until twenty twenty you will be a total\nStalemate nothing will get done it'll be a total disaster I Want to keep this winning going for another six

coming up uh to me it was inappropriate for a time it anytime Jillian what's that going to be honest with you you know we actually when I used to build for Glenn on a ... on television and radio in the day\nI met Kellyanne Conway probably live or twelve years ago she was on TV show\n'em back then so we've been friends for a long time about Kelly and I appreciate ...\nI'm wonderful how are you today\nI'm doing great you you know I started out when I answered the phone I used to manage bizarro world and you actually very positive we said you know really glass half full ride it\nOut for me always as that Kavanaugh satellite stake somehow to wake up on the center I had in the mountain right\nI'm sure that great time to be alive as president is doing a fantastic job in keeping us peaceful and prosperous sounding you can you can't argue with the jobs numbers which I think it's by the mainstream media refused to comment and they've never seen a positive data point that they had it ignored enough and I guess I'll start they'll start down ever\nCovering this economy gel if God Forbid it ever starts to go down but even all the numbers you already know the low unemployment numbers among\nAfrican Americans and Asian Americans in Hispanic Americans and winning they're teenagers and veterans and and the growth rate of that but even today I was very little coverage anywhere\nBut there was an accident at one hundred and eighty five thousand new private sector jobs created for the last month and it said it was two hundred and thirty thousand\nSaid the wages are up the job of Vail abilities that people feel mobile they can move around and find a better job closer to home maybe with better health care and retirement benefits and that's the freedom looks like the deregulation agenda that the twenty eight or so judges on the United states circuit court of course justice Gorsuch and [noise]\nAnd perhaps soon followed by justice Kavanaugh\nIt's Kellyanne Conway a counter to the president I got to tell you you know and by the way she was also the woman that the president says was really the reason why you want to win the election and I agree with that when we talk about cabinet or they couldn't make anything stick to that they throw at an early on as he said\nThey couldn't get him on the merits now let's go back and find out who he you know it might have stopped the auto of back when he was fourteen but now the guy drew a piece of advice allegedly somebody at a bar after you'd be forty concert\nWe visited ... seats bizarro world they really have nothing against the guy we have no way to stop the guy sold as mulatto sitting behind him and you've got a far left wing resist lawyer that's that's helping out you know some of these witnesses mean when you step back just for a second and take a look at it\nThey weren't going to be okay with anybody where they\nAnd whether or not they're not going to those who said that they oppose anybody that Donald Trump nominee Supreme Court are certainly not going\nFind their way to supporting\nJudge Kavanaugh after the FBI investigation they demanded to happen certainly not after the testimony they demanded to happen and so they should just be honest about what this is this is about destroyed destroying a man's life because he he was nominated by Donald Trump this is about the laying and keeping that seat open\nPass in terms of not three twenty twenty and Americans had it\nAmericans are smart and they're watching this process people are disgusted by the process Christine Blasey Ford has Dianne Feinstein a Democrat is due to blame that she is now a household name recognizable everywhere because they're the ones who smoked out her identity she asked to remain anonymous they did it by sitting on it by dropping it\nAnd after the twelfth our had told\nAnd what for the Republicans\nBloody Ford may not have ever had a forum\nTo testify under oath it's the set is Sherry committee and the majority the other Republicans I gave her that um but you're right they're talking about ice and beer this week and so that's probably a positive sign we respect the process of folks like Senator flake and others wanted the FBI investigation expand the um\nExpand the supplemental investigation here since the FBI has already completed six\nVetting on Brett Kavanaugh including one completed this last July which is on the desk of every senator so we'll see what happens\nBut if you're if you're a few of those red state Democrats Joe pads you're really nervous today because you're caught between a on one hand you are Democratic Party drifting so far to the left towards socialism and toward destruction and resistance in obstruction and delay and and and stop sign as a symbol of your party\nAnd you're stuck between that and the will of your own people right because West Virginians\nAnd and ... and who's yours in Indiana and certainly people in North Dakota knows where they want judge Kavanaugh confirmed and they want their senators to do their jobs advising contending and voting for him\nIt tells you the president Kellyanne Conway till you do you think that there should be an ethics committee I'm a ... investigation into Feinstein or whoever on her stuff leak that out you settle for two months she could have talked to terminal better directly when they met privately\nIf you could have brought it to the president's who's got the letter you're right she's not on that because you hope that they would be them down on the merits they couldn't the guy is supremely qualified to be in this job news are going to be an investigation should there be\nWell I saw some members say that they were going to investigate it I saw Senator Tom cotton last week and say that very thing that they should investigate the leak of the\nOf the letter and uh the other thing that's happening as Senator Hatch made reference I Believe it was yesterday Joe to the to the odd consequences that could follow to Ford's lawyers who either neglected to mention to her\nWhich was their their duty they mentioned it to Ford that she had an opportunity to testify under oath privately and in California well it ever having a kind of washing either\nForeign lied under oath that she didn't know that or her lawyers failed to tell her and if it is fair to tell us you know there are no cameras and clean lights in private testimony in California there's no Washington based\nObsessive media right to to to go and cover every jot until and a new client base for them afterward so that there are many things that could be investigated long after the vote for his confirmation happens\nAnd get away from the same old pine experience and family time today in our

race he'd wanted to go there\nUm it's but this has has been a cliche for some time I'm I've been noticing this Hillary you probably don't remember this but in one of her slams of Trump during the
