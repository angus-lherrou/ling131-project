[noise]\nCommunity mourns as police search for answers I'm Steve Rapaport Fox News at this hour or two of the victims are said to be fighting for their lives victims of twenty minutes of terror this morning at the tree of life synagogue in Pittsburgh the suspect identified as forty six year old Rob hours trading gunfire with police now said to be in fair condition\nThe bomber was going after Trump targets no\nNot the case would you have is a bad guy who did something very bad and calling him the log a bomber is not only inappropriate it shows that you shouldn't be in the journalism business at all\nThose of us on the political opposite side we're not calling the shooter as a congressional baseball game ... shooter even though he was a vehement Bernie Sanders supporter that's not what we do\nBut it's also not being honest and it's not reporting the news\nAs as it is in reality\nSo we've got more violence today we don't know why other than this person allegedly shouts some sort of hatred and um\n\nIncredible hatred and loading of of people over the Jewish faith\nWe don't have any motive other than that\nWe don't know his name although it's been a reporter to use a white guy with a beard\nAnd also it was reported that the bombing suspect who was a white guy to that guy list themselves as Native American as first name is ... says are so he could be Hispanic as well I've also reports that he's a talent getting Filipino\nThe media always the quick to say it's a white guy remember George Zimmerman\nThe guy who killed Trayvon Martin because Martin went back and was beating the hell out of them in in self defense he shot and killed him they reported him as a white guy for a long time until they had to once his picture was out there admitted that he was a panic so then they started calling him a white Hispanic\nSo dumb that is\nSo the media always is looking for a spin I'm always going to give it to us rate is again and that's what we have a Pittsburgh I'll give you updates as we go I definitely want your thoughts on this uh this bombing suspect that is a\n... that's under arrest and even more than that I mean it looks like it's some nut job who had some crazy delusion about\nWhat his role should be in politics in this country I mean just the pictures the van itself if you're looking at a going what there was a guy riding down the street with a band that looked like that and nobody suspected and even years ago where they are a substantial criminal record\nYears and years and years of convictions who by the way was a registered Democrat I've seen reports that he switched to Republican in twenty sixteen\nAnd suddenly Trump made them do it according to the media sends out a bunch of alleged bombs I'm not even convinced there were really bombs but it sends out a bunch of alleged bombs\nTo people we return addresses armies wouldn't fake addresses on the actual said into an area they were supposed to show up at all these prominent Democrats houses and their officers they never made it there\nBut it's for the media it's not about are the bad guys off the street thank God nobody was hurt it's more about\nTrump did this because there were some letter signed by hundreds of journalists about how Trump is somehow inciting violence against journalists that's not true he's done nothing like that in fact that sounds really stupid and an journalistic to even say something like that\nIn fact I can make a good argument that the media is inciting violence against those who support President Trump you if you were a make America great again hat your target and that's okay if you go to a Trump rally or you have a drum bumper sticker\nYou're a racist than his Lama awful but it's either fall but that's OK the media school with that you'll late night talk shows calling the president's mouth a blank holster for\nFor ... that's okay that's perfectly fine\nFake news incessantly that's just the way it is will correct it later\nAnd there are there is an example every example example of that\nWith the media again playing the victim in fact Jim Acosta from CNN the other day tweeted out this appointment or ... over the fact that when President Trump was talking about\nThe bombs that were they were going\nHe didn't mention CNN specifically you better not this is a guy whose job is supposed to be the gold and report the news and he's not ever supposed to be the story is mad that he wasn't the story when the president does call CNN out than a cost in in in his ilk say he shouldn't be doing that\nHe's putting his endangering denigrating what we do for a living and make you make your mind up either you want to be mentioned by the president or you don't want to be on the president you don't get to tell the president what mentioned he has to make for you\nSo I mean we're living in bizarro world here really are\nThose who perpetrate violence on the left should be arrested and or or killed in the act like the guy with the shooter was in that congressional baseball practice\nThey should be prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law and sent away for as long as we possibly can those who committed violence and they're on the right same thing should apply\nBut this is elected reporting and there's the desire by the media to pretend like one side is inciting violence and the other side is that it's just a crazy person that was on ... D vats irresponsible\nThat's responsible\nOr by the way the the bombing suspect very odd the whole thing's odd claims he's a seminal Indian\nIs family or a family friend or a lawyer or somebody claim that he wasn't at all that he is a one by one name that he went by different name one name sounded Native American or American indian and the other one sounded battalion first name certainly sounds Hispanic who knows what he is\nWhen we do know is he was some promoter for chip and bills\nAnd some bouncer at at a bar even the night before he was arrested so whatever the leftist trying to glean from him and put it on Trump is irresponsible and stupid\nAnd the media needs to learn it's job again the job is to go there observing and tell us what you saw is not go there observing and tell us why Trump caused it\nThat makes no sense so I'll keep you updated on what's happening in Pittsburgh certainly we've got a bunch of interviews coming your way a bunch of interviews I might take us impulse led called ...

have a place where people can access innocence you should have somebody there or some mechanism in place to guard against a piece of garbage like this guy is alleged to be\nI don't think that's asking too much I really don't whether it be a school or a movie theater or a church or synagogue or mosque or whatever it happens to be there should be a put a protect a protective mechanism in place

door is easily accessible from somebody from the outside who was just dropped off by Hoover and the guys carrying a rifle back\nNow the synagogue how does this guy get in there well Saturday morning we have congregation we have services we there should be a mechanism in place to wear a bad guy can be identified and if not stopped in his tracks at least deterred\nOr a good guy can get there and bring safety and sadly that's where we are\nThe idea of just open doors and everybody's welcome in somebody shoots than you know than they do the or somebody bombs and they do not know it can't be

that Republicans Kevin Brady he's the guy working on tax code words ... playing with President Trump or we talk about the\nThe the bombing suspect being arrested better just happened before we spoke and also about what is this new tax cut plan that we keep hearing about him and I appreciate you how are ya\nHey I'm good thanks for having me on\nWhat what an incredible time we're living in right now want to get into the incredible succession the positivity that came out about that rally on Monday but I'd be remiss to not today\nI'm first asked you about the arrest of is this person that police say the FBI shows was this idiot but sends out a bunch of bombs but what are your thoughts when you see that I personally as a family man is a community member really relieved that we got um what what are you\nFrom yeah that was my first time really a cop that that is good police law enforcement work obviously these guys had a history of a problem uh and then sending in in threatening\nTo blow up folks and so we don't know the intent behind all this but we do you know this is a person that frankly um and I don't know what to greet how much damage would have been done but can you imagine\nYou know had like a lawn right\nLet me pick the lord they didn't they didn't know what I mean forget about it I get it didn't get into the hands of the targets but people at these ... and people at the mail rooms of these different buildings would have been you know really in dire straits here\nYeah and and you know I I took a Ari Fleischer advice early on and he said you know similar stopped talking about blaming politicians and let's do the investigative work and now to this is that's exactly what happened I think that's the right way to go after\nI think so too it's a Kevin Brady of House Ways and Means Committee chair ... one last thing on that\nUm ... is there any changing how the media is doing is they're calling him the demography bomber they're calling you up or how good bomber who people did not call the guy who shut up the baseball practice and and almost killed these college they didn't call him a Sanders shooter or some ... why is there a double standard here\nAnd there is and I will tell you uh do I play baseball I played second base with Steve and I had missed the shooting by only a few minutes in fact the coach after batting practice or after\nSome a swing state do you want to take some ground or as a second I looked out\nThe was take them is now I'm fine and I grabbed my gear and left just about four minutes ahead of the shooting so uh this is a ... yeah the media um there is a double standard here and and and I guess my frustration is while they blame the president and others for what they believe are overheated rhetoric\nThey often hum are silent when you hear Hillary Clinton urged instability or Maxine wandering Cory Booker or encourage harassment and violence and\nThen rock Obama and Eric Holder ... we've got soundbites from all of them that are actually inciting violence and none of us ever said well of violence happens\nThey made it happen I mean we we we'd like to see them tamped down their rhetoric a little bit but what a bad guy shoots up a baseball practice or a bad guy since uh bombs I I'm not going to blame the president nor Hillary Clinton I'm going to leave the guy that did it\nYeah it's the guy yeah that's exactly right and and that's the way it ought to be handled so you know I it is the the year where frankly President Trump or can't even breathe right some people you write criticized for everything but I'll tell you what what he's doing for the country for our economy for our security it's just unbelievable\nI had a conversation with John Hi Bush from the raging a librarian and he's the executive director there and we were comparing and contrasting with this president has accomplished to what Ronald Reagan accomplished in the fact that thirty five forty years later the media looks back on a regular ... lovingly and and they didn't love and back then\nUm and and they're treating from horribly and basically they've got about the same record in fact the Heritage Foundation finds this president is even more conservative\nThan President Reagan was yeah I mean it it it's unfair but but that's why have you on let's talk about the successes\nYeah and so Joe to your point well thank you for saying that because that that's my point look Ronald Reagan perhaps of grace president in modern times you know probably is in my view you know has two legacies\nTax cuts that are ... the economy for decades in in the United prosperity and rebuilding the military exactly what President Trump has done in just a his first year and a half\nReally and then you put on top of that this amazing a record in the courts of a constitutional judges from the Supreme Court on down it really is a remarkable record\nIt's remarkable success you have to\nYou again is never going to give him a chance it's Kevin Brady House Ways and Means Committee chair it'd be the success that we're seeing was fueled by what you came up with ... you worked on this night and day I remember you your Joe I Want to come on but I don't mean to minutes or ... you were like you you're\nYou're breaking pencils him going crazy with ah with 'em all sorts of what\nHow do we make this happen and you did somehow and all of us every American to pay taxes got a break every American who pays taxes has a bigger paycheck many Americans three four five six million either got bonuses or they got raises companies are are no\nManufacturing stuff here again or promising yes to start doing it so the other side Kevin seem all that success as\nWe've got we've got to raise the taxes again we have to hurt corporations again and drive them out of the country how is it a winning strategy for them\nYeah I don't know that it is and and and they but they are doubling down on it so appealing in tax cuts raising the taxes on businesses going back to the old a code where every month we saw another us company moving overseas are manufacturing overseas or jobs overseas and and and and in a period where President Obama\nYou know that was the weakest economic recovery um since World War two right and he never had a year never had a year he broke three percent um uh for the entire year here because of an more good news again this morning in the third quarter that three and a half percent growth beat\nThat's where the Google more than Facebook more than TV and radio reaches twenty percent more millennials

Institute out in California great conversation comparing the media and how he treated Reagan and how he acted back to\nThem with how the current president President Trump is acting toward the media also but he's ... he'll be off the top of the hour yup the former communications director for president Donald Trump\nWhat the hell happened Mary's only on the job for a living days we'll have that for you to write none of the phone lines so let me say hello to welcome to align one each Lisa in California I Lisa\nHi how are you I'm living the dream which I have a ...\nCalling um I actually ties into what the last caller with\nAnd about um with hearing how ... how would you get to that [noise]\nChurches typically forget I mean older a whole nother story in the movie theater and other other churches ugly how would you get to the church [noise] hey I can sort out ... ... ...\nThe bad guys from the gun versus the good guys with guns and I'll tell you I'm a good guy with a guy you know and\nI certainly when I go to church I go to church and I take it that personal responsibility not only protect myself but anybody that might that might come under attack against the bad guy with a gun you know [noise]\nWhen I first and foremost would allow concealed carry a churches but that that's for sure I carry a gun everywhere I'm allowed to ah I live in Texas do allow too many places but at the same time they're also signs up that prohibited from carrying my gun I figured that point if you're going to\nIf you're a church or any facility that can be deemed a soft target\nThe simple answer is that if you're not going to allow me to carry my ...\nAnd you should but if you're not gonna allow me to you better have protection there for my family and for me\nAnd that goes for any facility whether it's a movie theater or school or church or whatever I mean I'm so sick and tired of seeing signs up and say that that prevent you from carrying concealed handgun you want to to get a license for and you've gone through the classes for\nA and then there's no protection whatsoever I mean we can look at the Aurora shooting a gun in Colorado that guy quite literally avoided six southern leaders of the area because they all allowed people to carry guns\nBut wants to be interviewed attack did not allow good guys like you and me to carry guns in their\nTwelve people died so we are I think that you have to work in conjunction synagogue should either allow people to conceal carry and I don't know if they do or don't I'm guessing they don't\nOr they should they should have protections to make sure nobody gets in there with a gun I Would also close it down to one entrance an exit\nThis way anybody getting an are getting out or anybody get a good mood can be an emergency exit on the other side to get out but anybody getting into that facility and and they want to cause harm or you're gonna you're gonna identify them where we can pull the trigger one time\nHere and then I get that they can do it at Disneyland they can certainly do it at our church\nWill they will be due to move in the halls of Congress they do it at the White House so some people that we pay to be our legislators or representatives or a president they are protected one hundred percent I've been to the White House\nYou can't get anywhere near the place until you have a full body scan so why can't they do something to protect the good guys when they're out there a church synagogue school whatever they happened to be doing\n... ... yeah and I don't think it's a bad idea there there are other thing I think that come into play in like ... to the economic I'm a full body scan for example or even a metal detector and you know those are those are those items that it's not just a\nThat have an accent that the people around them and in a church probably qualified people that are\nGoing to be there any way you know that kind of thing but then there's training involved and right now I just feel like it [noise]\nLike I said as much as I don't disagree with you I I certainly think that it would be a great idea I also almost more ... think that it's not a realistic idea at\nMuch well I I I think that you allow concealed carry them almost at a time if you allow concealed carry by guys like you and me congregation members that people know and that we know have have gone through the steps to get the license to be able to carry like but\nAlso you you just have a ... system where you have to be close to the to be led to I've been that ended up itself could save some lives without a

were political reasons for that as well which I described in the book with a you know what I was there to help the president on their loyalty to the president you know I did some a\nMedia this morning I was on CNN and try to spend what I said that I call the president a liar not what I said the president is telling it like\nAnd he's covering the truth is doing it to set your hair on fire run into a finger in your eyeball 'cause he knows it's going to distract you cause you to be like a school monitor all Proctor\nAnd and it works every single time when you go to a CNN or MSNBC when you're walking into stores and look I've done work at CNN headline news on fifty over there I mean how did that when you walk in it still feels good it's a nice organization but then you realize that there is a definitive spin when you walk into that ... did you know you really get you know some some left hook from them\nAnd it's hard to get you to spend the president a certain way\n[noise] pretty much on message I think they were really hitting me that or this morning and I'm trying to sell a book they figured that could kill me with the base but let's find people that know me they know what I'm super loyal to the president to say listen I got fired Fifteen months ago if I wasn't\nLoyal to the President Joe you would have figured it out by now uh I wrote a very colorful very funny book [noise] about my relationship with him he's like it like it as a guy what he's like behind the scenes and by the way that a lot of research on him and his father\nWhen they were like young you know his father's obviously now deceased but I'm going to get back into the seventies\nWhen his dad was working with him and mentoring in\nWhat they were like so this was a real fun book to write a rocket called yesterday\nUh she said that she she went through the book she read it a hundred percent but Bush said\nIt was great it she couldn't wait to show it to her father occurred what at one of his best friend said the same thing you know 'cause I listen I\nI I Love the president I said that from the press box you know I got criticized for saying that I Love the president two or three times when I was given my press briefing last too bad I'm a New Yorker I have to be an Italian I like to use the word love Joe and Joe ... guy we want me to do\nIt and again I'm from New York I'm an Italian ... of course short for pack and we will so why are we we we we enjoy I get where you where you're coming from just like yesterday I got to tell you my mother's from Jamaica, Queens so as the president of these people are fighters\nWho come from Jamaica, Queens and I don't know that that the rest of America and certainly not the elite media in America they don't understand that do they\nKnow they don't understand it they get sent it there's micro aggressions Reagan president is that your doubt that the left wants your brain disconnected from your mouth you know you get up and emotional\nFeeling you could ever politically incorrect things you say you are and they want that totally sanitizing edited and God Forbid you should say something that they're offended by right there was a tiny bit of a micro aggressions they started sending bottle rockets off the president place now like a Stradivarius that he does a ... and\nThat's how people from queens or from my area in your area talk and I don't mean anything by it I'm just asked my personnel\nBy agree it's embodies or move to the blue collar President Bill blue collar president it's out now going up his great book\nLet's go back to the media stuff because again you were there when he did The Apprentice he made tens of millions of dollars for NBC now NBC turned itself on him him almost immediately when he says he's running for president were you surprised I've talked to him seven different times he he was actually not surprised they turned on him but he was surprised by how dirty and how nasty ... were you\nYeah I think he's been blown away I mean I I there was a scene in my book where I'm Talking about us in the oval office and he looks at me so she's you know I had a forty five you're great relationship with the media will do what happened I said there's a combination of things they don't they don't like your\nSome of your policies and you know we we let Steve Bannon declare war on the media you know and that they're trying to take it out on you\nThat I and and it took a second but he realized what was going on so he kept on going out and I think you're right he purposely like look for a cost\nThem out and tries to tell me your fake news ... enemy turn and Acosta eats it up he does it every time you make a fool of themselves when you were dealing with the media and again give him a job for eleven days but uh but again if I thought it was really really good pick up a time I understand what happened but um when you were in the job did you think that the media wouldn't work with you\nDid you think that they wanted to actually get good information from the White House run the price\nI thought I thought we were going to have a rough Roach month I thought that would be some kind of a peace offering me Jonah what a ... and the press I turn the lights and cameras back on that first day Joe you announced era as a press secretary I did the first press conference\nAnd I saw Sarah that would be my last one I was going to focus on strategy and building the communications team and also wanted to put us in a service position if you go you can find it on the net my comments plan\nBut listen

any begging me effectively to do a profile story with him yeah trail me around and I'm like well I'm not the bad and I'm not their self promoting myself when I use of expletives which I obviously regret\nShe loved that got it changed ran over to CNN with it but he waited he wrote this ridiculously\nIn you know exaggerated article and then you really should take you know four or five days later people and I'm like jeeze the taste sounds like to normal guys from queens talking to each other right\nWhy would you do that to the guy and the answer is what we wanted the ambush and see if we can get him out of the White House ... and you know some people thought I Would have been very effective in helping to present so what's\nThe other one I thought it looked if you went back and fight but\nIf you went and checked up a pod cast after your name I thought it was a good pick because I felt like you were a guy who wasn't gonna pony puncture just who's going to be very direct\nYou to be very straight with the information and and you would say look if you want a relationship with a retired minister Asian here's a way it's going to work but you're right I think that you got suckered in a little bit and it doesn't feel good I've had that happened to me but you got you got pulled in because you're actually trust somebody something that guys like do what you want to do we want to trust people\nThe age Joe I made a mistake it's a vicious by first place down the area I didn't anticipate how bad it was a I told my Wall Street present Thirty years on Wall street now let me tell you
