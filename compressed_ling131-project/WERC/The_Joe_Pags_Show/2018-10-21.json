County Georgia in snail mail about twenty five miles north east of Atlanta the officers were responding to a suspicious car near school as they approached shots were fired from inside the vehicle sergeant Jake Smith says police are looking for the suspect\nIt's Lara Trump we love having Ron each at Laura Lee Trump on Twitter right\nThat's correct L. E. A.\nAnd I know I'm just saying I follow you and your husband asked me I'm just going to say I haven't gotten to follow but\nWhen I was perfectly fine it's fine by that okay I appreciate it um you know traditionally you bring up Kavanaugh I've been told him to the cabinet bounds but it happens so early that I feel like things might cool down before the midterms ... dying and Feinstein yesterday like gave us a golden egg\nSomebody asked her if you guys when the Senate if the Democrats win the Senate will you reopen investigations into no justice Kavanaugh Laura she said yes\nYeah well that that should not surprise anyone because we thought how crazy they got during natural confirmation pot that it's it's really terrifying in it and then finally showing their true colors that\nAre they really don't stand for much except trying to be destructive and and do anything they can to go against the president and destroy him and I'll tell you do one of the reasons I think that you eat so much with resistance out there\nIs because this president is actually winning you don't try and stop someone who's down or losing you only try and stop someone who's winning and Donald Trump is winning for this country again\nAnd and they know that he's draining the swamp and they were terrified because the old way of life is over and they knew it before and and it's very\nScary for people who are living the highlights in Washington DC or not go in and and voting on behalf of their constituents\nSo it makes them scared because Donald Trump has nothing to gain from that he's he's doing this because he loves his country to hold him to anyone but the American people and and they never had a president like this before um which is all the more reason that we need all the Republicans support we can and Congress\nThat is a lawyer Trump but really great to talk to your brother in law I asked him ... I asked her husband this I asked the President Bush\nUm when he made the announcement I'm ... I'm guessing the family got at first I'm going to actually do this ... jerk reaction because as you said he didn't need for anything he could be you know playing golf every day in Scotland right now and not worry about all this political stuff but\nHis love for countries said this is my calling was my duty what was your what was your thought process what it looked like your mother in law was really going to take this stuff\nAnd he actually that all of us down and said\nI Want to do this and then two days before the famous athlete or a ... a day during dinner and that you guys need to know that they're going to come after me they're going to come after you they're going to come after all of us they will attack us they'll tell lies about it obviously it would have been hard to predict it will get to this level right um\nBut like I said I was a hundred percent on board and because I knew\nThat my father in law to do this job he's a businessman the is so smart when it comes to negotiating seeing when he's been able to do in in so many different respect what Tara with trade um he's really great at that than I knew back then that he would be great at it um for me it was a hundred percent and\nAgain I don't think anything prepares you for for all of this um it it it's so much bigger than any of us but that's why I think although we all get attacked on the time although the president and get the tax every second of every day\nNone of us for a second one change any of this because we know that it is about the bigger picture and the future of the country and if we have to take a couple of planes and arrows here and there and the president\nOr you know take that every single day more than any of us it's totally worth it because I really think this country is headed in the right direction they get an I always tell him he's going to go down in history as one of the greatest presidents of countries ever had\nA disagree with that it's Laura Trump or her husband his or her father in law is the president's ... back in twenty sixteen or because you just said it was nowhere near I mean you expect to the media would come after the leopard come after you guys but not like this\nAnd I understood it was just completely unexpected he said no I Know that they would want to go hard on me probably go dirty on me but I had a lot of friends in the media you told me I made millions and millions of dollars for NBC on The Apprentice four thirty and forty years the media actually treated me very well and wanted me in the newspaper or on their television or radio show\nSo he didn't know that it would get to this extreme you been in the media for a long time I've been in newsrooms for a long time as well just they lean left but I didn't know was going to be like this\nSo what what was when was the realization for you in the family that this was way worse than we thought it was going to be\nWell I was actually still for a portion of the campaign working at my former job in television and\nI ... it became very frustrating for me to to work there because\nI Would be all different nations but sometimes ours including um the way that they would find things in and say hey that's not what he said you know when he said that um that that was it it it was a very clear wind to me that I don't didn't think that I was going to be able to work there\nFor for forever if you know he became president wrote but um but certainly after they started attacking\nAll of us personally and you know when I was pregnant and they they attacked my unborn child needs to make this talk about it is a it is\nSo crazy but again I think it's because they knew before the ... president that if he got in there there was no turning back that he was all business and he was really going to be looking out for the American people and their old way of life was going to come to an end so\nUm I have to say that it is just another sign that he's doing a great jobs\nYou know I Would agree with you you guys were you have the ... of any family members you to my wife is Lara Trump irritates her husband her father in law of course is the president of the United states we've got we've got senatorial races now that are starting to lean right the midterms are starting to look better in the Senate for Republicans although I can see that it doesn't mean anything unless people don't vote\nIn Texas where I should go Ted Cruz the incumbent who's doing it incredible job in working with your with your brother in law a very well know although it was rough on the campaign trail who's being Jones from a guy by a guy who's basically Obama\nAre saying you know we can work together yeah one one undivided Texas but under the surface those you know he's a former left wing socialist disco ward you look at places like Michigan we're ... been there for three decades and it's time for her to go now and you've got a guy named John James who might actually be able to get\nThat show it to real seat this really used gonna come down to whether we can motivate people who believe in what they see happening now in the country to get off the reruns and go vote for him is really what it is isn't it\nOh absolutely well as I think you right now I'm In Minnesota not traveling estate campaigning I Will be in your neck of the woods in Texas on Monday youthful I Will get onto your day ironically in Michigan um ... it's so so important we we know that\nThe president has done incredible things already and not with a lot of people against and even people on his own party sometimes money and get them ... think about what could happen if he had a cohesive unit of people behind him that voted alongside president and and really pushes agenda forward\nWe can be so much more progress in the country and by the way I Know we talk about socialism if anybody has any question about what social and them look like look in Venezuela right now that could become the United states of America\nIf we let people like or or take over and and put his agenda forward it's really very frightening\nSocialism has never worked in fact that the Democrats are embracing people like that since shock everybody to a degree that you knew not only are going to get out and vote in the midterms but you're going to take everyone in your neighborhood and everyone in your family to go vote\nUm it it's very area and I I Know that it felt like a fight and twenty think came to get Donald Trump elected in ... he certainly was the fight isn't over you and you can't come back we can't relax we can't be complacent me have to get out and got to vote and put people in Congress or we're going to vote with the president\nDid run if anybody ever wants to know about socialism talk to their shoes are delicious whose whose wife who's from Venezuela who tells the stories of how disgusting who's there I mean there are people waiting in line for food and the government officials show up beat them up maybe even kill them in the streets to take care of their families first get as many him in the country could as horrific\nAnd you really do have people in this country\nBecause you've ... you've got people who were actually saying there's got to go live in Florida we are going to go the way of socialism because that's the best way to go\nLower the last question I really appreciate your time and by the way of luxury Minnesota we reached Asians or we were very highly rated in Minneapolis the polling P. T. O. catering you right now um\nWhen you look at the fact that people on the left are saying volition will impeach the president will open the border will abolish ice we will roll back the tax cuts and take more of your money away it will drive jobs out of the country that's what they are running on and the fact is there almost fifty fifty right known almost every poll you see\nWhat is it that we're doing wrong you went to ... done junior the president of the the Fox News Hannity what are we doing wrong but it's still so close this crazy to me\nWell I don't know Joe that it's really that close I mean we thought how accurate the Cold War and ... and a great point but I don't\nReally think that if that is out there I think there are people that are afraid to tell a pollster that call them or approaches them on the street said they want to vote Republican because the media and Hollywood has done such a a number on on people\nBut whenever they come out in support of the president or adding a Republican and make people ...\nHas it that way it works sometimes when they get in the voting\nWhenever no one else walking when they think about the ... where we come in this country in almost two years under President Donald Trump through\nSir Paul McCartney know him and treat them with Joe leaving to talking about his new album Egypt vision and of course some discussion about a little band called the lead off that we were ... when we were playing music I heard a radio present to find this video check it out\nFox News I'm Del Walters turkey vows no cover up it's an ... investigation into the death of Washington Post journalist democracy Yogi Saudi saying he died following a fist fight inside the Saudi consulate and turkey skeptics lining up\nSaudi Arabia is in fact not our ally\nEvidence is overwhelming showing a that not only are their interests not aligned with our national security interest their interests actually undermine our national security interests\nDemocratic congresswoman Tulsi gathered the president campaigning in Nevada continues to stand by the kingdom and just tonight a key us allies saying it's pulling out of the so called ... in the desert economic summit\nNew Zealand saying no one from that country will attend adding it condemns the killing of ... in Georgia they're searching for a cop killer a two year veteran of the county force\nApproaching a suspicious vehicle near a school when he was shot into\nThis is Fox News\nMostly clear skies chili conditions with normally when was bringing in that includes layer and an overnight low around forty one so I'm trying to\nForecast for tomorrow the Sunday afternoon Hi I'm sixty one clear with some batches of Ross possible overnight Sunday night and the lower in the mid thirties to the recording ended up going to be our sci fi six verse alert but at the center I meteorologist friend hunter on your side on news radio one oh pi thought W.

fourth\nNative American so I'm Out in the left media the show now says she's basically like a a turkey queen I mean that's right what am I missing here\nShe has been vindicated I I'm I'm I'm never\nFlabbergasted by the links to which\nThe identity politics left will go to try and unwind\nBlatant life woman advanced her career by manufacturing a a Native American ancestry that it's been debunked over and over and over again and I I really do believe that her staff was convinced\nThat by releasing the results of tests\nThat showed that she possibly had Native American ancestry six to ten generation back yeah that that was based on a proxy Native American blood right and in other words the researcher\nUsed South American genetic markers as some sort of of estimation for whether or not she really at this ancestry come on tell someone who identified as a woman of color right in order to secure position in a in a prestigious Ivy League\nIn a very real way Rachel Dole is all about as black is this woman who's Native American and you're right they're using what my younger as tech they're hoping they're praying that the south American blood somehow has some native blood and there is no proof in other words she's wider than I'll ever be site\nAnd in fact by statistics that were quoted and none other than New York times\nIt turns out that this one thousand one one one thousand twenty fourth fraction of a possible Native American bloodline makes makes her ... less\nThan it did it in other words than the average white American press more Native American ancestry than she does\nA hundred percent you're absolutely right about that in the Boston Globe trying to say that she was one thirty second at the at the most and one one thousand twenty four at the least they even

I'm not familiar with ... years ago Joe what\nAm I looking up you're going to send it to be yourself and you're you're going out and get\nAn outlook at ... ... email it to me\nThat what I Would love to do that joy appreciate your calling it it's an interesting case because you look you've got to make a decision either anybody of African heritage is a person that gets the benefit of the bed or anybody of Hispanic heritage is just this benefit or ...\nOr anybody you know of Asian the heritage because there's been a very bad or we stop with the with the BS benefits for people\nUm on on based on identity politics and maybe just maybe we all frequent opportunity to everybody I Know I Know it's crazy [noise] I\nI Know I was going to throw it out there ... lives in Georgia Jim what's going on\nHey I'm a first time caller and I just want to hear what your audience after listening to shale\nUm I used to work for you and I'm retired now and uh it's about Nineteen Ninety five for Nineteen Ninety four scares me\nA there was a business that open up on my route that's an abortion clinic and I didn't know until I went in but I could feel the evil that in this room and I looked around and I I just wonder why these women couldn't do this but\nThe lady the receptionist or and this was the first time in there and I had a hand truck\nLoad stuff and the lady the reception has told me to take it to the last show on the left and just put it by the window so I you know I went back to the last ... left and they put that by the window and it was the trash can there and I looked into the trash can go in there where there are a little baby parked in their middle fingers are\nAnd I I definitely sick and I guess I could then you know it is and I used the again I've always been against abortion extended a rate you know but that changed my mind right there and then when I went back to have a lady at the reception sign for it\nThey had a a magazine right there and I kind of started selling it and I just ask her what it was and she said that new catalog\nAnd ... it was just like a ... catalog or\nOr or Sears catalog and a half a T park\nAnd uh at prices for ... who says arms fingers\nAnd now it's just something new and she was ... you know a ... you know thank goodness I I didn't have to go back and I told my boss to fire me if I went back in their\n... Jim ... listening to this story use is startling and certainly read that you shared it but I got to be honest with you I'm not buying that there was a JC Penney's type catalog with baby parts on it I mean it had to be something other than a catalog what what is it what you saw what was the Idaho\n[noise] I'm\nI'm always called him in the catalog has a title on the front would it would say\nOh I didn't I didn't even look at it 'cause I always found them through it [noise] and ask her why she would find him for it and I'm a born again Christian I wouldn't lie to you I mean I Know what I saw\nNo you you you you sound like it was really honest guy I just believe there is a catalog\nWith baby in the hearts of Abe's obviously has been exposed through undercover investigation that a lot of these abortion providers are in fact dealing in baby parts and body parts it was disgusting and it makes me sick\nI Would be ... we'd be startled if you saw a JC penny like catalogue with baby parts of listed ... maybe ... you're describing maybe you're describing it incorrectly there wasn't a catalog let you go shopping for close so that's that can be\n... it was it it I looked in there and it had baby parks with prices by him I I notice I Do I I'm not going to like ...\n... what would you um I don't want you to get offended but but I find it extremely hard to believe the other part of your story I find to be very believable and I'm Sorry that you went through the Web or you just say one thing that you could say whatever you want but what I'm saying is if you tell me what the title of a catalog was I mean you're actually tonia some through like a JC penny catalog that makes no sense to\nMe [noise] well what would I just ... I Wish her\nAs horrible as abortion providers are they're not stupid as as as horrible as abortion providers are they're not stupid enough to leave a book like that around for anybody to see\nIt had just come in the mail she had was brand new [noise]\nBut I Want to I Want to [noise]\nIt's just like you know the Kavanaugh hearings and the lady said she was traumatized\nAnd I don't buy it for it because you if you're traumatized you elaborate things that that happened I I mean I tell ya yeah where I was I can tell you I mean they're staying traumatized me and I know what I saw\nI I Believe you think you saw something like that I'm here to tell you I Know I saw a ...

interview with ... disease a Republican\nFormer congressman break state of Florida running for governor of Florida no Rick Scott is running for Senate he was the governor is the governor now\nAnd the ... the Democrat nominee for governor who's a far left wing socialist a run I appreciate your how're you doing good how are you doing\nI'm living the dream in really glad to have your own it would be a it would be bad for me to not start we're the most important story of foreigners happening and that's Panama City in that area I Know that you've been there a lot you've been you've been monitoring what's going on you been talking to the people throw my listeners and viewers in on on what you see there and help things are going\nWell they really I mean we thought I'm born and raised in Florida and we've seen a lot of storms all the young when\nDo you have better Ninety to buy the worst damage I mean in terms of Panama City in terms of Mexico beach in some of those areas so I'm a I'm a self servants rising was totally out um they're starting to get power back\n\nIt's secondary obviously we're talking around to see it as former congressman he's a Republican running for governor ... bill um um this is secondary of course but I've heard reports that I've seen reports I've read reports that\nVoting might be an issue it might be not as easy to vote because a lot of the places that are traditional polling places in that region of the Gulf Coast um or going to be out ... and taking care of who's working on that\nIt is so there's a the governor's working on that some of the local folks I think what you're going to see is they'll probably be extraordinary accommodations or the people that were displaced\nOr just for the people you're still in the county but I think you're looking at this polling location and then I think there's going to be a consideration or if you are displaced or\nYou can vote and other counties and your vocal silk out so I think they're working on that and by that that's something that's doable and I think that they will look I mean you know a lot of these folks um uh you know are not necessarily thinking about voting on the first thing on their mind but at the same time\nThese are resilient people I mean you know the people in Bay county I mean they're so they're very minded so I think a lot of them are even though they got a lot of this\nDebt to deal with it I didn't get one of the cliche of an opportunity to cast a vote\nIs a Republican round as soon as running for governor the race beautiful around you may or may not notice I've got several stations in Florida very highly rated in South Florida which is where I grew up I'm I'm I grew up in South Florida who's there for Twenty one years and I love to go back all the time my mom was there and my sisters are there and I thought I understood the politics of the area\nI clearly don't there's there was a sea change that happened since I moved away that I didn't see coming in and the southern Europe Florida that is very heavily populated is is having a fight whether it's center writer's center left\nBut of a lot of like the school districts and school boards and and a lot of the sheriff's officers do lean left\nOr how much of a challenges it for you to get any any movement in the southern part of the state which is so populated or to understand that your your your conservative guard that believes in traditional American values that and that's a good thing for Florida\nWell look we're getting we're getting contracts and I mean I think if you look at\nSouth Florida and for the Miami Dade County huge energy with Cuban Americans um other Hispanics Venezuelans and the Nicaraguan to understand the dangers of socialism\nThey don't want to see socialism in Florida they know it didn't work in their home countries are we also have a very significant contrast which usually doesn't work this way in Florida politics but you know I'm One of the leading a pro Israel leaders in the country had been in the Congress\nYellow and hostile to Israel I mean he is endorsed by a group that dream defenders which is prominent in the bbs movement against Israel they say Israel's a genocidal apartheid state\nI led the effort to move the embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem I think that was a great day you get one last\nHosted Gillum opposes having our embassy in Jerusalem he opposes recognizing Jerusalem as Israel's\nA tunnel indivisible capital so when you look at some of the voters who that is something that they are concerned about uh we have an opportunity to make some headway in areas that may be a Republican wouldn't 'cause the Democrat\nEven though their party has drifted more and more in the Israel and Florida they usually nominate somebody who's pro Israel but they didn't this time they nominated Andrew Gillum who's really align with the radical left a which\nIs really a very hostile to Israel now\nWell he's ... he's like he's really he's also into our freedom and liberty he's also pro taxation and big government he's also pro abortion me the guy's a socialist he wants Medicare for all we can get into all the problems with him but I think that it's it's even more beneficial to talk about the positives that you bring to the table you know it's interesting to me run in and I live in southern Texas now so\nI grew up around Hispanics I now live in a place where it's a predominantly Hispanic or I've never met a Hispanic person who generally speaking is Catholic or Christian who is some former leftist lewd why is it that the Democrats have always been able to count on that Hispanic vote and would have guys like you and me how to do to let them know that we are on their side\nWhy don't the day that they have always been able to I think that the Hispanic voters not monolithic I mean in Florida\nYou know we have a lot of conservative Hispanics than in South Florida", "year": "2018", "show_name": "The Joe Pags
