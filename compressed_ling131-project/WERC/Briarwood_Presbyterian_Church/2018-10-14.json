accurate so just kind of throw that in there All right let's get to a rich\nWelcome Garry show thank you we have a a\nTheater fence that we put a twelve years ago and when we put it up we painted and now it's at the point where it needs to be a ... Spain locating my only question is does it matter what kind of thing we originally put on a twelve years ago\nBoil versus warm now that I'm\nGoing to guess that's pretty [noise] pretty much a mute point at this point are probably the biggest thing you need to worry about is just ah making sure it's a really clean and that you get the pores of the would kind of opened up\nUm that can be done fairly easily I'm using an oxygen needed bleach and scrubbing that down rich and then use of would break near that\nReally opens up the wood fibers ... no matter what you use use acrylic or whether you use a oil base um it'll get\nIt'll it'll penetrate the the wood deeper which means it's gonna last longer right but uh if you had an oil based on who the only time you know there's always there's always a disclaimer right and the only thing I could think of that would require you not to do that\nThere is some products out there in fact one time would is one of the brand names ... it is neither in oil base Nora water base it's actually a liquid solid in other words for it doesn't dry it cures by the UV rays of the sun\nUm in you know it's like Ninety dollars a gallon that lasts like seven years it's good stuff\nBut if that was on that fence I Would tell you to stick with it uh but if it's just an oil in like a ton moral base or even ... base or or water base at this point I think just get in an oxygen a bleach in would break ground there you'll be absolutely fine\nOkay great one other question how do how do I convinced my grandchildren standing offenses fun\nWill that my friend is is I I don't know but I'm all about that first you gotta know how old are they\nAre they're eleven twelve in that area so they're old\nEnough okay well maybe money [laughter] they ... they had to start operating like us at that point I didn't go and ... thanks guy you've had\nBy by maybe a spray or [noise]\nMaybe it's a prayer would be cheaper than paying the grandkids\nIt'd probably be a little bit better job\nJust saying I don't know you don't know yeah you're hanging with the grandkids right yup All right good man good man All right it's eight hundred eighty two three eight to five

problem which are often with the mode where I found a way you down and sometimes it does come K. and I checked out side with the air that asked how they All right and and for me please help me I Want to try like gee I'd love to All right\nSo um so the flush is not not working I mean it's not removing all the way so usually when the waist does not thoroughly removed it's because the amount of water\nThat is coming from the closet to the bowl is not coming with enough or a velocity right there's not enough of it that's number one the other thing is\nThe the bent pipe set you checked up top actually kind of come into a bowl of the toilet to takes water and air man and sometimes that little vent becomes um calcified ... narrowed opening so you don't\nGet enough air to make it happen so ah let's work on the vacuum first [noise]\nUm and\nAnd you know so we got a fifty fifty shot hear Teri ... a bottle of C L R\nI and I get back here than a bird that's off on the phone I have a bird think

that whole court bottle in the bowl mhm individual let that sit overnight when you wake up in the morning flush away\nOkay yeah I remember that but I couldn't remember I had a little more care that I write everything down and he said the ...\nRight so that that's that's the one chance the other one is the water that's transferred from the closet to the bowl is transferred through little holes underneath the ...\nPlain dog okay [laughter] I Know\nAbout that because they didn't want to have to stay on the big problem and and my cousin told me that firing down here and cleaning mine and but
