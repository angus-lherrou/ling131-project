I mean uh so um my guess is they would take topping compound and a drill was the big mix or on the end of it\nAnd they would [noise]\n... thin out the ... of that topping compound and then probably take a like a wallpaper and brush uh I'm In literally do what you just said kind of drifted or whatever\nThinking yeah yeah I think and and there's real low answer to it Charles I tell people try to imagine how that person put that on get a big piece of cardboard\nAnd try to replicate it you come close you probably won't be perfect but you come close but it sounds like if you're talking about but you know a dripping or\nA a rain type of finish on there I Would use you know the topping compound diluted a in just maybe just a little bit thicker than paint and just kinda I'll use the word slap it on with a wide uh wallpaper and brush\nThat what you're saying chopping compound would that be like using a ... a pre mixing it yeah yeah\nYeah just use a regular um yeah pre mixed a I called topping ... ... and just mix more water and to get more Ramy\n... show okay that sounds like the solution All right\nGood luck tonight thank you take care of all\nRight well we're fixing up all kinds of things if you'd like to join us loved the heavy it's eight hundred eight two three eight to five five earlier in the show today somebody called and said man I loved that middle seat furniture polish one of my favorite products to it cleans and restores\nWoodwork wood furniture in perfect for kitchen cabinets it removes the grime the dirt scratches the old wax from the wood and then restore says by the way it's also great for removing the heat brings in water rings that we get on the kitchen table it's middle sick\nAnd it's ... am I.

that role or to push ups blind in take a snippet of that's flying in and get the next size down there's there's only probably six different sizes\nOf blind if it's snow again you just can't quite get it down you only got to go down to the next you know the next size will will get the job done for you\nWell the one that I've had the most trouble with is um screening closure and it's a it's a flat and it hasn't reached someone once you go into the group\n... there's a slight recession to the to the left side mhm what it's like a ... not\nI'm familiar with the flats blowing too and in fact I just got done some uh this summer I have a big screened in porch and those panels all have the flats blind and um I trying to think how I chose this point I think I hit some at the house\nI'm In the one I head of the first one was to be the other side's fit in just fine I put it in with a roller and I don't know if if if I if I didn't measure so I don't know\nI had one that was too big and I use the next I downloaded it worked fine but I I I get the challenge uh but I think if you can measure that actual opening\nA you address the the issue but I get it on that flight buying that can be a challenge All right thanks so much Don a couple of tips too if you're going to work on that um you know doing the show for it\nThe one year's you kinda forget some of the tips you've passed along in the screening tip this time of year is a great screening tip here's the deal I'm you know the time changes next week right and so it's gonna be\nDarker in the evening and we're going to get in\nA lot of parts of the country more the dreary time of year you would be amazed at how much light is blocked by screens in your windows or if you've got fool screens in your windows I'll bet you is going to block a third of the light just coming into your house may be more [noise]\nAnd if you get a good fall day popping those screens out if you think we're pretty much finished with opening up the windows pop that screen now take a look at the screen screen that fiberglass screen it lifespan of that's ten to twelve years and they kind of gets thread bear [noise]\nAnd now the falls a great time to go ahead and do your re screening get it done on the big flat surface\nReach screen the screens allow more light in the wintertime and then you'll be ready to go in the springtime when they go back in ... and to know which one goes into\nA which is a window\nStart with the one the window closest to the kitchen sink and that's number one you just take a little sharpening put number one right at the top of the frame and then go clockwise around your house or the number\nBut replacing that a a screen now is a great time of year to do just that and the ... line that you're pushing that rubber I used a membrane into the group the whole the screen intact [noise]\nThere's ... tools looks like a big pizza cutter but then there's this line get this ... mind mice no we've got that wrong ... line mouse and it I'm\nJust check it out the hardware store as for what they look at you like you're crazy doesn't look like a pizza cutter ads of about a half circle flat in this blind rolls over to rollers and it's much easier process of pushing that's line into the groove so good time of year to tackle that particular project\nEight hundred eight two three eight to five five Marilyn welcome\nCarrie yeah I never I haven't\nHeard five haven't Eric ... ladder how I'm back here and I read the directions we have our our our\n... get out of having a little bit of problem or anything\nI can get are you finding them around the drain rabbit around my bathroom at Harris okay around that drain also um yeah\nWell one thing is and then we'll tell you about kind of maintenance so we don't have that problem or one of the things the shallow bowl\nA with them a\nLittle water a little apple cider a low apple cider vinegar in a drop of liquid soap and set that up there'll be attracted to that\nAnd I'm that'll attract them to that and they'll meet their demise and that'll help but they like everything else are looking for food\nAnd that's where they're going to get trapped in your little trap that you're creating but what they're living on the sends a little gross or they're living on the bacteria in the scum that in the drains\nAll right so I I say often everything we use anymore is Jill we got Joe ... Joe ... everything's jailed and that sticky\nSo like me I use a gel a shaving cream um shave in Washington dumped going down the drain but that gel even though goes down the drain it starts slowly a coating the top of that trap or the top of the pipe inside portion of the pipe\nAnd that a gel combined with flaky skin some risk yours is a bacteria in these little guys start finding it and they started feeding on that and so there is a product\nUm that is the silliest it's actually a like a culture bacteria that creates enzymes that eats that bacteria\nOkay so we're live lead to a point were cleaning the inside of our pipes\nLocated that particular product it's also used to a ... claw blockages and things like the current pipe and uses a maintenance product gets called drain right at her account for answers and water and I think is a forget whether it's a chord of water but\nWhat I'll do is like in the bathroom vanity\nOr you pull up the plug the the stopper or you put four ounces of dream but when you're a little warm water and there are you let's sit I think it's ten minutes and you release the water in it\nFlushes Dan Coats the inside of those pipes if there's any minor blockages it eliminates that too but that starts eating all that bad bacteria\nAnd so you've taken their food source away\nHow can I get that at the box or am I\nAm I I picked up at a sightseeing do best carries it also uh I don't know if it's in the big box stores or not\nI did take the garbage hair ... really\nGood I forgot to tell you about and so other people listening let's repeat that that little splash guard that rubber ice bladder we put in food it grinds up its spits it all over the back side of that\nAnd it has the best right now you're in a how and\nWhy they're quite radical I now I ...
