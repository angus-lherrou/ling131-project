{"month": "10", "state": "AL", "station": "WERC", "content": "A five hundred dollars ... ... okay and and it's running yes okay\nAnd the other car that you have you oh half on a ... worth half of what you ah what is it worth what are you a\nA word about Eighteen thousand I think we're thirty three\nOkay All right well uh as you've probably heard in the last and there's two rules of thumb I use on getting out of that how much other debt do you have not counting your home\nI'm\nProbably out without the cars probably another ... Seventy thousand most of the student loans\nOkay so Seventy plus about fifty yeah about fifty four actually okay All right um\nWell the rule of thumb I use is is you don't want to own vehicles that are more than half your annual income and if you discover through going through financial base and you make the phone call like you're making is can we be debt free but the house in two years if we keep the cars and your answer is no\n... I mean something's got to give here I don't know what it is but something's got to do and so if you sold a Twenty one thousand dollar car where did you get your values are those private sale values are wholesaler a dealer all for what\nAre those are trading values\nOkay so you could sell them for more than that possibly yes\nHow's your credit oh no you definitely could encourage you sell it for more than ... ... value I mean you saw for price sale amount on Craig's list so um how's your credit\nI'm lying in the tank I went through a divorce couple of years ago\nI heard you owe the money to these these two car loans where the loans\nUm I Believe they are both true Ford Motor credit for\nA show you've not got an easy way to finance the difference\nUh well my wife for credit scores about an eight hundred\nOkay she would just do it all in her name then\nYes uh-huh okay [noise]\nAnd you don't you were going to drive the five hundred dollar cars one driver and then there's other cardio is gonna be your second driver\nYes uh-huh okay\nAnd so if you sold the Twenty one thousand dollar car for twenty ... twenty four\nThat gives you about three to throw at the er the deal and the Eighteenth probably worth more like Twenty one or twenty two shows on white man and the whole if those were trading values um managed to raise your only about six and the whole here\nUm that's yeah that's not the end of the world um I I Would only do that if I moved down into a car that had of value of a hundred ten thousand dollars\nOkay\nAnd when you're the problem with your trading them in is you're not going to get as much for them so that part I'm really not up for I'll tell you what let's don't do that let's uh let's sell the Twenty one thousand dollar car that's worth actually more than Twenty one\nAnd by our bite you try to sell it for ... I'm going to gas and say let's say for instance it would bring twenty twenty four that puts three in your pocket unless spot three thousand dollar car with that\nOK okay and I'm ... then let's get the other car sold for as much as it will sell for and just borrowed the difference from the credit union in your wife's name\nWas her credit check and I get your three dollar car in a hoop D.\nBut she got still got Seventy thousand dollars over here to deal with a student loans but you're making one twenty six so you can do that and within a couple of years easy Eighteen months or so and so then we're going to move up and car once we're out of debt and have your emergency found in place\nSo we're not going to drive these ... but maybe two years is what it sounds like maybe two two and a half years okay\nOkay and that gets you clear but you yeah your car poor you have a car mess on your hands you're right to observe that and um\n\nOh at a minimum I'm getting rid of one of them but I I like your idea of getting rid of both of them if you were to do a trade in with the dealer though\nYou're going to make a lot less on these cars because they're going to give you trade in that's all they do and it's not because they're evil or something they just have to run cell by Carmichael profit they don't they're not in the break even business during the profit business\nAnd so um you know trade in through a dealer probably not going to help you achieve your goals nearly as fast it could throw a difference in five or six thousand bucks in this discussion\nEasy if not more the difference in trade in value and privacy on these two vehicles\nTracy is with us in Orlando, Florida Hi Tracey how are you\nDoing very good um I Am here I did buy your book here so I didn't like the whole program

intermittent or hell has sixty thousand dollars and what we would call her retirement fund and then about six thousand a checking account and\nThat retirement fund has been a rental house that my brother you pay a rental house maybe basically been given her all the rent money even though he covers all the maintenance just kind of extra gift from him\nBut that's become a bit of a problem because he doesn't I owned a small business and that's really not his focus so it go it often goes without a tenant ... that he money coming in\nDobbin wondering you know if you have a recommendation oh maybe a better a consistent investment maybe a admitted in pain or just a mutual fund or want to get your thoughts on that her\nAnd her financial situation is our net monthly is about two fifty and the whole when she gets a Social Security I'm after she pay their rent which includes an independent living with meals so that three hundred two to three hundred a month if we'd been chipping away at or checking account\nOver the past two years now by it's bound to only six thousand ... that's about to start hitting the sixty\nOkay so the sixty is in cash and it's from rental income over the years\nYeah her about the past eight years silk I Know you've got that trash and that's invested in want\nIn my brother's one of my brothers rental property out your mom's money it's not in ...\nHe could liquidate it he can he can give her the cash if if we made it if we decided to go that route but he basically just took the money and paid off his rental house and started giving our all the rental income\nOh I see okay and so her investment that she has made and this rental property is not doing well because there's not being managed well correct okay um and where is the property\nIt then it around Jackson, Tennessee so she lives in Memphis with me and\nIt's it there and my brother it's in his home town but it's still a burden on him and I think it kind of even though he says it's not a problem I think the ban and thought\nIt would be better off I'll sell the house and use the money to invest in something that doesn't require\nEffort correct okay yeah I mean if you just did that and you put the money in a mutual fund um\nThrows off six thousand dollars a year that's five hundred bucks a month that's ten percent right\nAnd that covers or shortfall\nWhat are your thoughts on living in paying five I think that's\nMore than a or a labor no I don't think it's more secure safer because you're not well diversified you're stuck in one or two stocks on the grill and I wouldn't get into that um I Would pick out I'd take a growth in income mutual fund\nAnd a balanced mutual fund put about thirty K n each and try to find something that's got a track record of paying up around ten percent a year eight to ten percent a year a again gross and restrain the growth off of it and they should run in perpetuation and to the tune of about five hundred bucks a month then\nAssuming you're sixty out of the sale of the house but yeah sit down with a good mutual fund advisor to you work with one\nOf my company uses fidelity so they've been\nPutting needle work I was
