from yourself and so there's no reason\nHave the insurance review doesn't serve in the ...\nI wasn't going to have it I was just going to regret can't no matter what you know but I didn't know if there are certain steps now that if I didn't take I Would leave out on getting on the most out of the cash value whatever they're\nNo there's no difference at all all you do is you just call them and get a caller eight hundred number or whatever the name of the company isn't get customer care on the line customer service on the line and you know ask them if there's something they need you to sign or if there's anything we needed extra expedite this but we need you\nQuickly to get me my cash value what's the fastest way I can do that but no you really can't miss it up the only thing that can happen is they may try to slow walk or nor your request and you may have to push on them it's kind of like canceling the credit card you got to argue with them to get it done but no there's not a way you can mess it up you just need to\nBe persistent is all and make sure that they follow through and change your your check\nAnd if you need to ... get them to do that that's fine not a big deal don't cancel any life insurance until you have your new life insurance in place always remember that Denise is with us in Washington DC Hi Denise how are you\nHi Dave I'm great how are you\nBetter than I

really trying to get us data on cars and lost my job at just fine\nI'm Sorry you did the ... the treaty lost her job on the scary I don't want to make it worse by going into that\nIf you're\nMaking your financial situation worse you know is what we got to do so what a master's you're in the middle of a storm we get a button down the hatches and so how much is the tuition\n[noise] I'm coming out and vote total was going to have to pay twenty three by coming out here we have to pay about a thousand\nOkay and do you have eight thousand way do okay\nWell I mean you don't mind if you don't really like you can spare the eight thousand and the kid needs to pull out of school or he needs to get a job and by his eight thousand but I'm not going to tell you to go into debt and make the situation worse\n\nThan you have the money the only question is you're making a decision do you want the safety net more than you want to pay tuition I'm guessing you're probably going to pay the tuition so how much did you use to make\nAbout wanting to fly and what does your are you married yes and what does your husband make about Seventy okay and what did you used to do 'em in software support\nAnd how long have you been laid off on down Saturday Night while not been able and sell them without\nWorth yeah definitely acted ... and I'm\nLike I'm going around something in that period of time in that field\nThat makes two of us working on it working on it\nOkay because I I Know in other words the good news is you're in a an active technology type position that\nOught to be some positions available maybe not Ninety five maybe a hundred and five maybe not a hundred and five maybe Seventy five I don't know but I don't think you're going to be unemployed indefinitely you're not if you're in an active market a metro market and you're in an active space so I'm not going to panic\n\nAnd I'm sure not going to make it worse by borrowing money if you're going to panic till junior to come home for a semester or to get a job and pays eight thousand\nOne of the two but um you guys are paying your basic necessities of life out of your husband's income\nAnd that's what you push through but I'm with but you know this eight thousand is another thing and it depends on how much you have in savings to that you got to work with but no I'm not borrowing the money I don't teach people to borrow money to borrow money should merge and please don't borrow money when things are good and I'm greedy I don't borrow money when things are bad and I'm afraid\nAnd greed and fear are a good way to lose your butt with money for sure\nSo don't let either one of those would be your driving driving force for Christie is with us in Wichita, Kansas Hi Christie how are you\nKind Dan thank you for taking my call sure when my husband and I are brand new ... in August that can kind of northern California and in our new we\nI had a job in coming here as a para educator and kind of a school district has been good not and so our goal with the cash and that we had\nSeen that and and ... and that got into anyway and the anyway ... along with ... eternity we now have four on pay well we could alone against it about four years ago and\nHad eight thousand dollars you're meaning like retire until they're giving him the option of making a payment and a half to get the dollar and the next year to finish paying off a thousand dollar\nHe retired from there\n[noise] [noise] well he left the company all day long anyway after twenty eight years have fifty one answer they lifted him as a retired\nNow that doesn't matter on this you know four one K. loan if not paid within sixty days has to be considered do own fault it's Irish regulations\nThat because they're on I think that getting remainder that he can continue to maintain\nA hundred dollar modeled around with I don't care what they say you need to check with your tax preparer and if you're a tax preparer and found a regulation that aligns with the with what the companies are saying that's fine but I don't think that's so\nMy I don't have anybody that help in Africa well it's called we call it that far when Kay people\nYou know you need to call attacks professional not the company that he worked for because my understanding the regulation is four one K. loan if not paid within sixty days of leaving the job is considered an early withdrawal and your taxed and penalized\nAnd that's my understanding of the real okay so\nHere where I work under the impression that right now and when we left we weren't going to be able to pay it back after that what we thought drawn based on what they call that we weren't going to take that penalty and the taxes on it wow and when we ain't got\nSettled and can they can really taste a letter saying that being said categorized and I retired I don't care because they don't get to decide what IRS tax regulations are and they don't get to make them up and\nSo what their litter says doesn't matter you

we're still nothing on fire were ways away from having to worry about this so you'd have to get a job and they would actually have to file a garnishment at that job and find out you had that job\nBefore you went that far you may end up filing\nOkay in ... it might end up that and I would certainly understand with all the hell you've been through would clean give you a clean slate\nAnd um you get a fresh start and you may end up filing a because it may be unreasonable to try to work your way through these things with your income but today you don't have to make that decision\nOne of the things that happens when someone's been through what you've been through is you feel the tyranny\nThe tyrant in your head from the background and it pushes you to do things a very suddenly very quickly\nAnd out of almost ... out of almost a desperation and emotional desperation I Am I wrong or am I reading your mail\nNow correct\nOkay and so what I'm going to tell you there's a slow down a little bit because of the worst financial decisions you make or when you're desperate because you feel like you're forced or you're trapped and you start slashing flailing around like your drowning or something and you really can do some stupid stuff naturally now how much credit card debt is involved here\n[noise] um it's probably about twenty thousand dollars and ...\nGood and um do you have any other debt student loan debt\nI didn't like that yeah\nThat's probably about ... three thousand guy\nThat is not bankrupt up All right okay and do you have any IRS that\nNo I'm foreclosure on the

it was okay\nIt's possible that they're not going to chase you at all for them\nSo if you just said that's not there and and we start making some money and we wanted to settle with two and three year old credit card debt for twenty cents on the dollar four thousand dollars if that's the case and a lot of fighting on your part you'd have to have your fight back\nA arguing with them you can probably clear twenty thousand dollars worth of old credit card debt for around four thousand dollars\nAnd the student loan that doesn't change if that's all the case and they're not going to end your wages and you just began to work through this\nAnd you could have cleared it for four grand and it would all just gone away without a bankruptcy\nTo see the bankruptcy starts the nightmare the credit nightmare the money nightmare over again\nRight starts at all new\nBut if you can just clear these things up like drop off into the past a whole lot faster and they're not as permanent as a bankruptcy as you may end up being forced into bankruptcy by garnishment\nBut to day I Would not file based on fear of something that might happen that has not yet happened the man is not real you got away from him\nRight you're going to be okay\nIf I Am able to start paying off but that we do the best [noise] hey go far smaller stat largest where\nI Would love to swim smallest the largest and I would call
