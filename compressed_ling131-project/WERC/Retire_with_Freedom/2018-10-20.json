{"month": "10", "state": "AL", "station": "WERC", "content": "Thousand for their medical bell or five thousand for it and other medical bill\nOkay how old is she sixty three\nWhy are you now power of attorney\n[noise] she's starting to forget stuff um she kept getting checked out for the amounts that I see in the process of doing that and she hasn't been paying a staff I put her on a budget and so now I'm taking care of her stuff\nWhat is your income\nUm she makes ... about twenty eight thousand air\nMhm okay and um what is the house you were hired sorry what's the house worth\nUm my sister lives in it now and she's kind of destroyed it I'm soon I'm\nWhere's your mother and I'm an apartment\nYour mother is paying rent an apartment so that your sister can live in the house\nYeah so what's the house worth I'm guessing sixty five\nOkay okay so how fast is are you a throwing your sister out and selling the house\nSide ... [laughter] she's on a date I Can't figure out\n\nAre you on the deed and last night how did she get on the deed [noise] um my sister has um a child with me so my mom wanted to make sure my niece had a place to land so she put my sister on it\nAre you paying that is your mother paying the mortgage\nI'm not any more I was ... yeah I told my sister I Would not anymore yeah everything everything's in my ... all the utilities everything as take 'em out yeah I Can't turn the heat off I Can't tell you Keli Goff 'cause we want to kind of\nYour Susan directs in the ... and her name\n[noise] um he has said that she can't because her deposit through high\nUh-huh\n'cause she doesn't have to pay them so they [noise] they tend to posit too yeah compensate for that\nBut you can see to pay the bill right yeah okay she has to pay the bill\nThat and that's it and she used to pay the mortgage today yeah okay I got rid of fifty eight thousand other debt good and one hundred and one thousand in student loans passes away when your mom passes away yep okay so we don't worry about those quit paying a shaded that quit paying the students that equipment in the student loans so\nNow I got seven thousand dollars in some medical bills\nThat does the rest of it we're just not paying your mom doesn't have any money she broke his apparently got dementia mess twenty eight thousand dollars a year she's sixty three years old\nYou're living in an apartment we have to make sure she's cared for first and that's food shelter clothing transportation and utility she doesn't need transportation did you say there was a car in here does she need to be driving\n[noise] I'd say no you're the power of attorney yeah\nI Know that I've tried to convince her to sell her car and get a thousand dollars a pack of fifty eight hundred dollars is a lot for a car so\nIt's not a lot for a car but it's a lot for a car for somebody that has dementia and I'm not sure they need to be driving right now I Can't remember to pay your bills country remember how to get home I'm scared for her\nThat was one of the time she forgot how did you get home that's what started it\nIs it responsible on your part to let her drive the answer is no\nRight\nShe I Love her you love or you don't want her to be hurt or to hurt someone for God's sakes definitely more she could she could go driving often end up in Tennessee\nFrom Wisconsin\nAnd we'd have one of those silver alert or whatever they call them right yeah yeah no I think we're going to I think we're going to do away with cars period oh okay now we're down to medical bills\nThese are very hard decisions for you right\nBut you have to do your job has the power of attorney and as a loving daughter is do things that are good for your mom regardless of who it upsets\nYour sister is upset your mother's upset I don't care\nYeah it's very hard for you to make those decisions but we're only going to do things that are good for your mom none of this you are doing is out of greed\nFor yourself\nOkay so that all the student loan people they get zip nothing nada okay tell your sister she gets nothing not a zip sell the car\nNow I'm Down to just a few medical bills and I think you can work your way through those with her income or at least get some kind of a payment plan going this very small and ah you can let that attorney's office know that basically she has no money what limit what is the twenty eight thousand dollars coming in from\nUm he has a pension annuity for security\nOkay I'm than what I probably would do with these medical bills is let them know they're probably not going to get paid either except if I have a little extra money here or there after taking care of mom\nHas and the thing I paid fifty on laugh on each one\nAnd it's okay if you won't pay twenty five or something or if if you can work out some kind of lump sum and you know five hundred bucks settles a whole dead or something like that clears up that's fine but here's the thing if they were to sue her\nDo you know what they're going to get nothing because you know what she has nothing all of the income that she has they cannot attach you can attach pension income you can attach Social Security income and you can't attaching annuity\nAnd so that she is what we called judgment proof because she's broke\nAnd so that puts you in a very strong position to talk to Mr or Mrs collections bottom feeder attorney when you do talk to them\nAnd just go here situation she's sixty three she's got dementia she has no assets in her only income his pension and Social Security she's judgment proof tell them I said that from your Comedy Central coach and he said they are judgment proof okay and\nSo what we'll do is we would like to clear this up but we're going to do it for pennies on the dollar so make me a ridiculous offer because that's the only way you're getting any money\nYou're not you're not you're she she's fine\nHey thanks for the call Katie is with us in Maryland Hi Katie welcome to the day Ramsey show\nHi Dave how are you\nBetter than I deserve what's up\nOkay so um I have clients here I'll go through them I I I've been with

may have to do a little traveling or something like that and um you know follows from hurricanes around or something or\nWhatever but you generally can make pretty good money and in that world and I've talked to him that it might twice what you're making now again that sometimes involves trouble when I'm Talking about that but um\nYou know I I think you guys work your way out of debt get as far as that is you can and I'd be looking for a job post taste and if you get a job that you can\nLand in the above what you're making now you might punt ... but the ideal world would be that you would
