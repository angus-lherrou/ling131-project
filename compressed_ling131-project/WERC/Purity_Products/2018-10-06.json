TV show 'em back then so we've been friends for a long time a jelly and I appreciate Joe are you\nI'm wonderful how are you today\nI'm doing great you you know I started out when I answered the phone I submitted was ... year old and you actually very positive we said you know really was no ... rode\nOut for me always as by Kavanaugh said last week some of us wake up on the sunrise side of the mountain right\nI'm sure that great time to be alive to president is doing a fantastic job in keeping us peaceful and prosperous um you can ... you can't argue with the jobs numbers which I think is why the mainstream media refused to cover than they've never seen a positive data point that they have it ignored enough and I guess I'll start they'll start down ever\nCovering this economy Joe if God Forbid it ever starts to go down but even all the numbers you already know the low unemployment numbers among African Americans and Asian Americans in Hispanic Americans in women teenagers and veterans and and the growth rate is out but even today got very little coverage anywhere but\nThere was an accident have one hundred and eighty five thousand new private sector jobs created for the last month and it said it was two hundred and thirty thousand so the wages are up the job availability up people feel mobile they can move around and find a better job closer to home maybe with better health care and retirement benefits and that's what freedom looks like the deregulation agenda\nThat the twenty eight or so judges on the United states circuit court of course justice Gorsuch and\nAnd perhaps soon followed by justice Kavanaugh\nIt's Kellyanne Conway a closer to the president I got to tell you you know and by the way she was also the woman that the president says was really the reason why you want to win the election and I agree with that when we talk about cabinet or they couldn't make anything stick to Rodham early on as he said they couldn't get him on the merits\nNow let's go back and find out who he you know it might have stopped the auto of back when he was fourteen but now the guy drew a piece of advice allegedly somebody at a bar after\nYou'd be forty concert we visited ... was already they really have nothing against the guy we have no way to stop the guy sold as mulatto sitting behind him and you've got a far left wing resist lawyer that's that's helping out you know some of these witnesses mean when you step back just for a second and take a look at it\nThey weren't going to be okay with anybody where they\nAre they're not they're also not going to those who have said that they oppose anybody that Donald Trump nominate joy Supreme Court are certainly not going to find their way to supporting\nJudge Kavanaugh after the FBI investigation they demanded to happen certainly not after the testimony they demanded to happen and so they should just be honest about what they said this is about the strike destroying a man's life because he he\nWas nominated by Donald Trump this is about the laying and keeping that seat open pass in terms of not three twenty twenty and Americans had it\nAmericans are smart and they're watching this process people are disgusted by the process Christine Blasey Ford has Dianne Feinstein a Democrat due to blame that she is now a household\nName recognizable everywhere because they're the ones who smoked out her identity she asked to remain anonymous they did it by sitting on it by dropping it and after the twelfth our had told and but for the Republicans\nBloody Ford may not have ever had a forum\nTo testify under oath it's the Senate Sherry committee and the majority of the other Republicans I gave her that I bet you're right they're talking about ice in the air this week and so that's probably a positive sign we respect the process of folks like Senator flake and others wanted the FBI investigation expand the um\nExpand supplemental investigation here since the FBI has already completed six\nVetting on Brett Kavanaugh including one completed his last July which is on the desk of every senator so we'll see what happens\nBut if you're if you're a few of those red state Democrats ... really nervous today because you're caught between a ... on one hand your Democratic Party drifting so far to the left towards socialism and toward destruction and resistance an obstruction and delay and and and stop sign as a symbol of your party\nAnd you're stuck between that and the will of your own people right because West Virginians\nAnd and and who is yours in Indiana and certainly people in North Dakota now spread they want judge Kavanaugh confirmed and they want their senators to do their jobs advising contending and voting for him\nIt's our tells the president Kellyanne Conway till\nYou do you think that there should be an ethics committee I'm a ... investigation into Feinstein or whoever on her staff leak that out you said on this for two months she could have talked to tell them about a directly when they met privately she could've brought it to the president as soon as you got the letter your rights she sat on her because she hoped that they would be him down on the merits\nThey couldn't the guy is supremely qualified to be in this job these are going to be an investigation should there be\nWell I saw and never say that they weren't going to investigate it I saw Senator Tom cotton last week and say that very thing that they should investigate the leak of the of the letter\nAnd uh the other thing that's happening as Senator Hatch made reference I Believe it was yesterday Joe to the to the odd consequences that could follow to forge lawyers who either\nNeglected to mention to her\nWhich was their their duty they mentioned it to Ford that she had an opportunity to testify under oath privately and in California\nWell it ever having a kind of washing either foreign lied under oath that she didn't know that or her lawyers failed to tell her and it's fair to tell you that there are no cameras and clean lights in private testimony in California there's no Washington based\nIn so many ways this is a real breath\nOf fresh air\nWith the government files mind Bob person [noise]\nBy great to have you on the weekend with Joe packs one at a hundred and five zero one Seventy eighty\nIrish phone calls here before we wrap it up\nUh and again we look forward to this vote is going to happen in the guess forty five minutes or so from now as we do show live and get a lot of you will get the show after the voters happened\nAnd I just wanted to remind you that this radio station that you're listening to the show on will be all over what's happening with ... votes in ... to go to the phone lines lines to and Marie in New York Marie what's going on\nI'm Joe I was visiting a main this week we're packing up to leave to go home they they want and then we had the news on and our room and there was a tape burning across the TV that there was a college\nUh and lay that was a loading a free busloads go down there and a reminder Susan Collins to make sure she was voting no\nTwo harasser I imagine but uh this was a an offer of a credit if you got on the bus [noise]\nSo to me uh this is almost like a spirit of the um I find my grand kids that are going to a local schools you know that uh the pledge of allegiance is optional um if you do the pledge allegiance you get kind of pushed around a little bit over I Believe\nSo uh I'm kind of this heightened at our school systems in this country um [noise]\nWell I'm ... I'm a strong advocate of getting rid of the department of education living mistakes take care of education the way we're supposed to be Jimmy Carter with the department of education employees and to me it's a waste of fifty some odd billion dollars a year as far as giving credit for somebody going in protesting\nI Would I Would love to see where that actually happened and I would love to follow up on that you know what school it was\nA I forgot the name seven years old and I forget to watch anyway\nNo way listening Seventy still young you got plenty of time so do you favor or send me an email at ... dot com and if you remember where that school was I'd love to follow up on it\n[noise] if it's a state sponsored taxpayer subsidized school was no way they should be doing something like that private school they've got different rules but that would be ridiculous to do to give somebody a benefit for protesting on one side of an issue over the other let me go to line three Patricia is in Florida Hi Patricia what's going on\nHi how are you I'm living the dream what's happening out I like\nTo have to think oh I can get on that movie that's coming out you know come up with a few weeks ago I call it they can that crack the gloom and crap from allies nice\nAnd I think that ... pullout dying ... hit me by ed face should apologize Catholic family and for the public\nAnd I think if they don't like it here and they can now get out and shipping port and\nNow having somebody up on an airline so glad you said the ... yeah I have family up like a narrow got Bush comfortable going and that they can crack felt blindsided get like they were kids\nThey don't get the way they go and they're willing to learn a lot of health and like half a get from and how common thing in the kitchen but we\nStill are still coming in and help me clean and that ... that race they made they have gotten away with much again the evil horrible people and in fact by telling them up her\nWhich I appreciate what you're willing to deport him too but but and and don't hold your breath because none of those people are gonna be apologizing in fact a dying Feinstein just friday just yesterday said are you just went down a litany of why Brett Kavanaugh should not be the guy and it had very little to do\n[noise] interestingly very little to do with the allegations that she leads to her office leaked about Christine Blasey Ford very little to do with that [noise]\nHer complaint was that he showed drew interrupting her interrupting other members are news anger you show that he doesn't have the temperament to be on the court that's being able to do with no he doesn't have the temperament to be on the court\nOh by the way members on the left on that committee interrupted Chuck Grassley the Republicans nonstop I guess they have the temperament to be on the Senate Judiciary committee and to be senators but he doesn't know the temperament to be on the court when he was\nHonestly emotionally reacting to people ... family like crap people calling him a gang rapist [noise] he had every right to react the way that he did\nAnd Dianne Feinstein as all of this new she knows that she is let me go back to and say Hi to Dan in Tampa Dan what's going on high\nHey Joel thanks for taking my call but I bet\nThat's all I just want to make a\nComment and that I Want to get a question or if it by you and all I Know\nAll right comments is simple I think we've had it I think it's been years that we've had a beyond that his rule they want to pick your president they want to make the rules people are tired of the mass contradictions convoluted logic\nThe same political correctness the pseudo wives prevention it's all over there and the practice turning and thank God for that and I got a great president was the one\nWho started this and put us on the threshold IRA I'm thankful for that you know um and I and I heard your last call and your great for doing what she did diamond

we\nAlways had this man I mean that great this family is that hey\nNothing but crucifixion Kuwaitis liberal pay back at what they do to that family grateful just by everything that they do is just absolutely disgraceful and you know why it's getting to know where you can throw the kitchen sink at him and for all the power to let them you can grow a refrigerator adamant doesn't matter you know when she\nWas going to end there's still go and write down I don't I don't have much time what's the question\nWhat do you think now we do that house in the car you know you think that what what would the impeachment process be like and what what ground we have or in the school because that's all they talk about\nThe the left will say it's obstruction of justice if they should win the house and they will in fact the way you help him with\nThere was no big deal for the bill claims bill claimed that he tried to do call me to not investigate the women to be more bill so that he tried to obstruct justice to stop calling me know you look you and I agree he didn't do that\nBut those are the grounds they'll say obstruction of justice I think they will in fact impeach him and I think the Senate would would uh would find him not guilty so nothing would happen\nBut that's the whole thing and it's a great\nQuestion because the the voters of his country after ... if you vote for Democrats in November one month from today if you vote for Democrats you're voting for impeachment your motives were open borders you're voting for abolishing nice\nThis is your voting for higher taxes think

a girl said I have absolutely no recollection of that ever happening and I don't think I've ever met Brett Kavanaugh\nAnybody and everybody else but she said was at that party has refuted the claim well Christine Blasey Ford testify in front of his panel the Senate Judiciary committee\n\nAnd leaving their left and right middle everybody's orange incredible credible witness credible which is actually true\nShe's not credible she might be believable that she really is where she really does believe that she's a victim and something really did happen to her but it is incredible that it was Brett Kavanaugh and it's simple to to go down logically as to why\nShe doesn't know when it happened not even a year doesn't know where it happened not even the neighborhood doesn't know whose house it was doesn't know how she got to the party doesn't know how she left the party she's been incorrect about everybody she says was that the party and she was actually given a couple of different numbers as to how many people were at the party\nRed cabin on the other hand has\nEverybody corroborating his story and he's got to a calendar that shows what he was doing every weekend and every weekday basically in Nineteen eighty two or whatever it was\n\nSo as much as she might have been believable that something happened to her and hope to yourself CDs and hope the person who did it is brought to justice but it was not credible her allegations against this guy specifically and that to a point ability Asia and that the the legacy media didn't want to have\nLegacy media didn't want to say well\nShe's credible as somebody who probably had something happened to her but it is not credible what she's saying about Brett Kavanaugh the legacy media didn't do its job and then a report that correctly the second accusation which I'm a woman named Deborah Ramirez who says that at a party\nThey were playing some game that I don't know it was due to spin\nThe bottle or it was a quarter as if they were playing something to where if you lost you had to drink and they were purposely making her drink and got her so drunk or you're gonna remember anything and then uh she's told Brett Kavanaugh put her but his member are pulled pulled it out and put it in near her face\nThat she admittedly doesn't remember it\nAnd when Democrats staffers from the Democrat senators that are on the panel calls are contacted her she spent six days calling old friends asking headed something happened to me\nYou remember anything happened to me and nobody remembers everything\nBut after six days you decided yeah I I guess it did happen I wasn't I wasn't sure but yeah I I Am now he did it I don't remember him doing it but I remember people telling me that he did it to his cabin are set up with no there was anything like that what are you talking about\nThe third one\nIs from slime ball lawyer ... is truly sweat Nick who says that for three years Brett Kavanaugh mark judge worthy organizers of parties\nWhere there would be trains are boys partake in gang rape Kavanaugh and judge she said would spike the punch with grain alcohol\nAnd quail moods\nShe knew this was going on but she was smart enough to not drink the punch then one day and this happened between Nineteen eighty one Nineteen eighty three she said but one day a one party joins ten of them in Nineteen eighty\nTwo she somehow was the victim and was gang raped will continue to go into the parties where there's not a full year and instead of calling the police which she said was just don't drink the punch\nShe changed her story to NBC News at least once\nNBC News instead of saying we can't run this because she's not viable not credible not believable that ran it anyway and then said it's important to note that the stories you're saying today is different or there are differences from the stories you originally told us her story has changed a bunch of times in her history comes out especially somebody that makes you got about allegations all the\nTime so completely not credible\nBut that didn't matter to grow because Booker and that didn't matter to lay he that didn't matter to Feinstein that didn't matter to ... didn't matter to come up with Harris it didn't matter to any of these people\n\nHe was he's guilty Cory Booker grow because you know it causes all Spartacus but he's admitted Grover when he was Fifteen he groped a girl he he admits that he's a senator somehow he actually said at this point it doesn't matter if he was guilty or innocent\nCory Booker said that and he made that\nDoesn't matter if judge Kavanaugh's guilty or innocent at this point well that I Believe galvanized us as a people we said that's not fair\nDue process of this in this country is guaranteed you are innocent until proven guilty and if that's the threshold than it is\nVery he's innocent nothing any of these\nWomen has said or the the the slimy lawyer has said or the far left wing resist lawyer cats who is a lawyer for Ford nothing they've said\nHas proven anything\nAll you have is Deborah bureaus completely uncorroborated in fact refuted by people Julie sweat Nick just seems to be a ... from outer space story she's given\nAnd of course the Ford only vase say something happened everybody else named and the FBI spent five days\nSix days interviewing many more people in Cuba ... didn't come to the ...

to be fast track because he's easily qualified for this job then suddenly somebody in her office or some lawyers somebody leaked the fact that there was a letter and with the woman's name was\nSo no matter what you think of course the love before she was a victim your two of the left politics\nEight hundred and five zero one Seventy eighty let me go to the phone line is where you are on this because we're either a country divided or country galvanized I think this was just\nAn absolute practice in futility for the left and I think that it probably served to motivate those on the right I think you'll see a lot more conservatives and Republicans now\nGo to and even centuries that lean right go to the polls for the midterm whereas they might have said sat at home before I think the Republicans will gain two or three seats in the Senate and we'll keep control of that body it's still going to be very close in the house but it'd be a better chance now because now the bases riled up\nThis was a really bad miscalculation by the left in this country the political let let me go to the phone lines and say hello to uh Roger who's in Spokane Roger what's going on high\nOn and go hey I think clay clay is appropriate name thank you and you know\nWe're in favor of that and\nI'm really disappointed in the ... ... ... ... ... stronger during the early process\nThat I'm even more upset

they wanted to keep decorum they wanted to keep it all up and up and I and I can appreciate that but when the hearings started let's go back to that a month ago as soon as grassy started speaking Kamala Harris interrupted him rudely\nOr you know all this fake outrage about how Kavanaugh interrupted Feinstein and some others because he was fighting for his political and personal life and for his family Kamala Harris purposely\nInterrupted him yeah Cory Booker purposely interrupted him\nI think lower started there were ... ... it was it was set up that you had protesters that there are some pictures out there that suggests they were getting paid to go to the chamber of protest so all this fake outrage about bread cabin on it and his ... and his temperament is that it's all be yes\nBut I agree with you the Republicans the grass or you know I think that in the end they did it the right way but as that was going on hey wait a second elections have\nConsequences we won were in charge of that can be I Will clear there's room if you've given interrupting then it would ... would proper protocol is\nWhen they were breaking it on purpose us they really thought through putting on a show which somehow window for them he turned out it made them look like idiots will be it used to that they are Clyde in Lexington, Kentucky high Clyde what's going on\nIn your bag thank you very much for taking my call really you've got a I think the Democrats are dead so now they're [laughter] they're getting worse every month that just getting worse and worse and they try to take that man down it gets very frustrating\nThing is I Can't understand how anybody could think that Corning a trainer at a man next and guilty\nAnd you got to listen to both sides if that's true but that's why the court case and I just I get off of what they're trying to do to Brett Kavanaugh because the guy obviously has a lot of classic that very well rounded young man I call and young because I'm sixty six I'm over the hill\nBut ice age he he's just a great guy and I hate to think that people think that our justice system is going to come down to just pointing the finger and you're automatically guilty we have due process in this country now and understand that that's what makes this country great everybody gets a fair trial", "show_name": "Purity Products", "year": "2018", "city":
