was a kid he\nRecently wrote an article for National Geographic traveler called turn up the volume's about his experiences visiting libraries with his family on vacation all the way from Australia stewardess holding on the line so let's get right to um\nHello story well he certainly traveled a long way to connect with us today we hope things are going well in Australia\nGoing very well Thanks Robert guy held out and I sat with\nStuart listen a catchy title for your Nat geo article that marriage is referenced turn up the volume's so we understand him passion for books in libraries but you actually have organized a trip or several trips with your family to include libraries tell us about it and what was their initial reaction\nIf we've done like a national now out to a lot of the problem with the international trip ... font and the youngest one\nAnd we traveled around the world from La Grange in Asia\nIn Europe and North America so we've got to travel with young children and a very good thing for how a laundry hiker young children and that will really was a trip of a lot\nSo one of the things that I left that you write about in your article is that yes libraries of course are all about the book the book collection but you also referenced some of the secrets in the actual buildings and down the chicken and the one that you describe I think it was the ... the library of St Paul is that where is that Switzerland\nAnd put it in a really cool I'm In and go in and about an hour from the valley\nAnd what was tell our listeners maybe one little secret or ... that you have discovered in that library besides the bucks\nWon the girl agreed and very clever Logan hidden in San folding Colin ... column ... shows you that they are not the\nCase and the actual books in the last couple of hundred years so much you back on\n... I'm curious how did you begin to choose which libraries around the world you would face at first\nIt was very much for the ... and ... and mummy in the British Museum and we'd go to a ring around that we had a call from the British and that was walking\nThrough the grief library which is a magical clicks and I'm sure a lot of groups like holy land but how long it was relatively easy I'm Single and probably enough\nIn a in the middle of the laws are wonderful book and that was good for us it was really hard look who said like luxury over a lot of callers on the show we'll have to go to the old\nWell I yeah I Love when you just said you know how you all came about this together and how it was a negotiation or any other luminaries diplomatic ... we took ourselves to the library of Congress a few years back I can still\nFrankly vividly suit expressions on their faces in my head just from a cheer grander it was a wonderful place to visit but\nOut of time can you recommend a few must see libraries for travelers from your experience but you think that right now they have to go see inexperienced themselves\nWhat a lot of the Congress is going to have a very good to revamp public library has a wonderful when we were there at the original animals but as far\nAs wonderful children loggers including the children's literature\nWhich has got to go to younger children for jobs and so all of them I Know your tourism and going through the young people your true love was growing\nUp it would be a lot of money you\nKnow there's a lot fairy tale is yeah and I've been in the world we live in today we're we're all library tourism here stored I'd rather that we're talking you know a world where we would take our smartphone or Google there still is something about these buildings the texture of the books it really is an experience or something about the\nHighly last about a year or they're or they're about and it just it just falls apart centigrade\nHuh\nThat's really interesting I'm going to send you somewhere\nBecause I I don't really know the place I can recommend say that's going to take care of the problem I don't really know what they're using but what usually used in that seem isn't a policy resident and you're certainly right it shouldn't fall apart within a year\nSometimes if there's movement in the countertop I could see maybe even though it's doubtful may be breaking off but\nAgain you would have to have a lot of movement to break\nThrough a ... athlete normal whatsoever and ah\nAnd if there is a product out there that I could do myself\nI thought you want to deal with the professional I don't think there's going to be a product that you're going to use but here's the IRS some of the developments that's going on and granted in fact actually hit the guy on the show\nI think it was last Saturday or maybe in the last hour the name of the probably you may hear me talking about green a gold a lot they make a lot of different cleaners and different things like that the people that own granted cold is a three or four generation granite company\nAnd one of the things they're launching and this is what's going to get you the information is if you're buying a new ... granted they offer like a grain of protection plan it's kind of like OK Gerdes for your granted right most of them have any problem you know in the you know they cover it\nAnd he has a network of the top random people in all the city's so obviously you don't have a uh granted protection plan because it wasn't the auto but he has that network\nAnd um I once you go to ... dot com my heavens search the Web site to see if that whole thing is is on there I'm assuming it is\nUm but ah\nAh you should be able to get your answer there is not um emailed me my emails on the website Gary solving online dot com or um the guy that a headset company ... and I don't know which you in contact with him and he'll get you a good granted company that can fix that problem\nYeah I mean it's not a big project that's the big thing\nRight and I understand but also knowing thing I mean you are going on\nNot just water and you are right on the drawers ... have a little tense all a class of ... and the SAT on the on the other one so what causes problems uh\nYeah I Do a little bit quick check to during the break but uh granted cold dot com\nAnd uh I I've

you how much moisture and that would or just get a spirits are bottom spread some water on it and if that water soaks into that would right away it's ready to suck in the stain um the the brand that

the mega millions\nOr was it the power bill one that was nobody won the billion dollar jak but\nNow it's going to be one point six billion come into what the hell is going on one point six billion dollars can you imagine\nThat would be nuts\nThat would be absolutely nuts are let's talk about Elizabeth Warren Elizabeth Warren for decades has been claiming to be a Native American\nOr as I like to say American indian why am I right when it comes to American indian because the individual tribes actually call themselves Indian tribes\nIf it's okay for them it's okay for me\nShe's going to be an American Indian uh Cherokee in fact\nFor admissions to schools for applications to jobs she she has been listed as the first woman of color to be a professor at what Harvard or Yale or something like Harvard\n\nShe's been making this clean but there is no verification there's no proof she's never ever given any bit of evidence\nTo suggest that she is in fact an American Indian so the president like he's apt to do has been name calling her because it sounds so stupid he calls are both gone is I think it's funny as hell\nPeople were offended by it are very smart and don't have a sense of humor you know white Rachel does all who's white\nLike Sean King who's white\nYou know they're both pretend to be black Elizabeth Warren it seems has been pretending to be an American Indian what's your well because my cheekbones proves it no that doesn't prove anything in fact thanks though\nSo president been calling around he said do a DNA test if you could prove to be that you're an Indian uh give a million dollars or your favorite charity so she I guess secretly does a DNA test\nGets the test back\nAnd gives the results of the Boston Globe which is the far left wing left is the outlet\n\nAnd they write those big story that she proved that she's Native American they say there is a there is a likelihood of up to one in thirty to chance or she is one thirty second Native American\nTo as little as one one thousand twenty four ths Native American\nAnd then the Boston Globe out to four hours later updated and corrected and say well the most you could possibly be as one sixty fourth Native American and the least is one one thousand twenty fourth then when you look into\nThe actual test further it turns out there was no comparison of her DNA to DNA of American Indians\nIn fact the only comparing that was done that was even close was was South American native tribes\nAnd maybe she's got South American blood or maybe South American made of blood\nBoth the probability is one in one thousand twenty fourth is this not only didn't prove that she is a Native American disprove that she's not on average the average white American\nHas more Native American blood than than Elizabeth Warren\nThat's affected me making it up its effect\nShe's not America ... an American Indian she's gotten benefits for pretending that she was she just thought she was going to prove the president wrong when in fact she proved yourself it it is she is so not American it'd be a bit of the Cherokee Nation has come out and asked her to just stop now\nOr when they did bad some left wing cable news outlet\nCalled the Cherokee Nation racist or a\n[noise]\nSharing the Cherokee Nation is racist retelling a white woman to stop pretending to be part of their nation\nThat's the world in which we live guy let that sink in that\nAnytime you go through this week's figuring that lives with Warren proved to president wrong that anybody go through this week it was meant to yourselves while she really is Native American\nAnd by the way this is not a story any ... any of us should even care about except for the fact that it's an abuse\nThrough lying to get benefits that

idiots so critically important I mean\nDo as a country we're winning I mean everything about our country is winning right our economy is on fire it's four point two percent GDP Growth three point nine percent unemployment the lowest unemployment in the history of our nation we've got three percent wage growth which is the first time wages have gone up and sixteen years\nYou know we have the largest military spending we have the largest tax cuts in history a manufacturing is coming back to our nation four one K. through the roof of small businesses are paying Fifteen Percent less in taxes than they were\nA year ago which is just created such a you know financial engine um I mean we are doing so incredible and that's before you start talking about you know president for and what you need to be done in the opioid crisis taking on a Supreme Court justices and\nPrescription drugs no one wants to talk about that everything that he's done to lower the cost of prescription drugs you know something that is is is so keen on his mind you I'm ... and no one wants to talk about it but it it it's we're winning we're not getting ripped off by China anymore we're not getting ripped off by Mexico anymore you know we're finally negotiating good trade deals\nYou know the Chinese economy right now is you probably know better than anybody is down you know ... almost twenty five percent right right all while America has the strongest economy that's ever has who's winning this thing right and and that's what he promised the American people he was getting daily promised the American people he was going to come in and he was going to win we're no longer get get used and they've used to the country and\nBut people have to get out there they have to get out and vote\nIt's Eric Trump to sort of a president Donald Trump Jr absolutely right but I watch these races it's very very suspect how the Democrats are running what they're saying use in races across the country you remove all the advertising is saying\nOh well what Trump gave a tax cut to his corporate buddies Ted Cruz give a tax cut to his corporate friends the top one percent of the vast majority of the tax cut everybody else got nothing that's ... that's not true everybody who pays taxes got a tax cut in corporations will employers got a tax cuts are all making more money some people get bonuses so\nHow do you think about the large when you see them flying around without it\nHonestly they are truly some of the most dishonest people in the world I mean I I I've never seen anything like this I've never seen the deception I've never seen the dishonesty of politics again this is this in a world right where business people who are not we don't we don't come out of a ... a political world the people who are truly the most\nDishonest people in the entire world I mean you look at the amount of small businesses in this country right or you know dozens and dozens of millions of small businesses right all across our\nOur nation they're getting they're paying Fifteen Percent or less in taxes you look at the regulations right I mean the way he flashed regulations it's promoting manufacturing coming back and people are getting hired that's why you have three point seven percent unemployment is ... you have the lowest\nHispanic unemployment the lowest African American unemployment in history the lowest female unemployment in the history you know what I mean\nIt's it's unbelievable it's all because of of of that right and you know negotiating trade deals where\n... you know this better name but you have a trade deal with with with China where if you said the product to them they were charging twenty five percent twenty five fifty percent and terrorists right where they can make the same product over there they could send it to you and we were in charge of anything so I mean\nWho do you think's gonna win that battle I I mean it's absolutely unbelievably well we we over tax companies we over regulate it you know companies as soon as that disappeared\nAre that the economy of this country went crazy I mean it it it it's going through the roof are they the\nStock market this morning last time I looked at it was four hundred points I mean we're doing so well as a nation and we're winning but people have to get out there people have to vote you have to realize the lies and deception\nThat some of the other side and and they do you know why because every single time they open up their four one K. you know every time they open up their paycheck or when they go to pay their taxes and they see that they have a lot more money in their pocket and they have jobs and they're they're not working two or three jobs and that they're getting pay increases\nBullied me people read through it and um I I think we're going to see that in the midterms but again people have to go out and vote\nIs Eric Trump to sort of president Donald Trump ulcer drop it a national interesting about what you just said it's all a hundred percent true we've got companies that can afford to give us bonuses three to four million people go bows or give us raises millions more people got ... a small businesses are adding\nEmployees instead of flushing the with Obamacare alone they slashed employees because there was a penalty if you had over fifty employees who your father made promises that he's sticking to it when it comes to the trade stuff\nCanada said no way we're going to do it then maybe the deal Mexico said no way we're going to do with them and made a deal do you use it in a way we're going to do with them and made a deal so your dad being punished and humbled by the media over the leverage that he knew he had when it came to the terrorists and stuff like that it all works and then they don't give them the praising the back and how weird as well\nHow about health care costs I mean the same thing or a or a Obamacare wrote touting Obamacare Obamacare was the greatest disaster in the world has to be able to keep your doctor you're supposed to be able to keep your plane you're supposed to say twenty five hundred dollars healthcare costs you know food through the roof and that's all coming down you see all the new prescription drug um\nLegislation that road has drastically reducing the price of prescription drugs if you look at right to try you
