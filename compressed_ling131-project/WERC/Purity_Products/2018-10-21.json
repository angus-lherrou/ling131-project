thirty and forty seven man and you ever paid for him yesterday to have a payment and the stinking world that we don't feel it fails liberating it fills amazing it feels like we can walk into our if he

my love it well beyond you guys you what do you tell people now the secret to getting out of debt is cause you to house\nUm what's your household income [noise] I'm into Bre\nAnd like I didn't know whether he's got a dead no car payment what ...\nWhat does that kind of how much ... about two hundred and twenty thousand\nEnemy we'd need about fifty thousand dollars a phone to her case the one that we are interested in\nSo you're moving from the two and twenty thousand or as soon as I mean those are oh\nYeah there's not much of a move\nI Know it's not but it does have a lot more upgrade than what our house has now because if we stayed with the we would have to invest money into the house the upgrade um well we could move in that we've got quite ready been accomplished mhm\nOr you could stay and not do the birds\nAnd we can stay in the way not do the courage or we could stand not pick up an insight and save money and\nMove with cash right\nThere's no way I wouldn't go back in ... I mean you've gone out and the first thing you do is go get a house fever\nRight and that's after hearing that ... that that stream that you had on I thought I but I Know they have already\nYou know I mean you knew what you want to do I I couldn't I wouldn't call you stupid I mean you're not out of control you're not being irresponsible it's a tiny little mortgages you said\nBut I I just I just couldn't go back once this hard to get out I mean you you have a two hundred and twenty thousand are paid for home in Roanoke, Virginia that is not a buy a house that's a great house as a matter of fact um [noise]\nWell above average square footage and the United states in a great neighborhood by definition in their own market that's what that houses so I I couldn't do it um if you want to do it you can do it um but I certainly can't tell you to do what I what Sharon and I would do\nWhat we worked our butts off to get out of debt and there's nothing will get us back in there is nothing I Want bad enough to go back in the dead\nAnd there's a lot of stuff I'd like to do a lot of things I'd like to accomplish that only the money to do but I'm not going to death for it even for a minute even for just a second 'cause my life is so good\n[noise] without any payments so you do what you want to do but um I Can't tell you to do that it would it would just make me throw up to think about it\nUm I Can't there's no way so what would I Do I'd say either you know piecemeal out of your income you don't have any payments you save up some money to fix up the Algerian as you said there was some upgrades or if you want to ... you know shape hard for a couple of years\nYou probably save up to a degree in two years without any payments if you watch what you're doing um but it doesn't mean means you don't get the house that you found while you were out in pulsing riding around on a Sunday afternoon solve this particular property while that one's not gonna be there\nOh well there's a house on every corner you do what you want to do I'm not going to be mad at you either way I just couldn't do it there's no way Ariana is with us in Canada ... how are you\nI think if I can call and thank you so much for your ministry thank you how can I help him along the line like by default three months ago I put my town home on the market and my sister who I've my penance by default [laughter]\nUm found her own place currently sitting on the the entire complex and has gone down in value from my unit is very Fifteen thousand dollars less than what I had bought it for five years ago right now I'm terrified that unit of the same style inland as mine and I know the lower\nPrice added like a thousand dollars good\nUh yesterday a Himalayan it came on the market I live in the last thing is that why not get Ninety I asked him\nAnd that in ... to ... because it's sitting empty and when it's coming you know I was thinking of capital my price to one Ninety four and adding an incentive that out over paid six months worth of condo feed\nYou may not bear with me and I would pay five to six thousand dollars out of pocket on the market share discharge and my question is how\nWould you how much would you pay out of pocket to get rid of that thing how long would you go\nHobbies you'd have obviously you'd have to have the money to pay out of pocket that'd be one limiting factor in Ireland on it I don't know what I'm going to do is judge the situation and how quickly are these things dropping\nOverall and you know that's going to give me my urgency um I I don't want to just get emotional about it I Want to judge the future and say these things are going down in value there is already five of them on the market\nI've got to be the lowest one on the market um this is not looking good you know so um I Would I drop it another fifty thousand no I wouldn't know [laughter] you know so you know so in some point you do you laugh right in and that's that's\nSo uh but the but the five thousand out of pocket to be done with this two hundred thousand dollar or a hundred and eighty dollar mortgage yeah yeah I'll be done with that in a heartbeat I'd do that too 'cause 'cause you know waiting two years is not going to help the situation is what I think I'm hearing\n[noise] right yeah exactly and worse sinking counting and when I have not a place to move in wintertime how\nWell but I mean not only I mean this winter but in general this complex is not going to heal and become worth three hundred thousand two years from now exactly yeah\nIt's going the wrong way and so it's something to get out of town you know and uh yeah I'm with you I I think you're right uh I don't think you were panicking what the numbers you're giving me now you started telling me somebody wants to offer you a low ball offering you have to come out of pocket what thirty grand I'm probably gonna wait the winter out you know\nMy political unit and wait on spring and see what happens but there's some point that I'm not willing to be\nThat far below the other properties that are on the market but uh but overall yeah let's get rid of this thing good question I'm sure you're facing this\nPhones a triple eight eight to five five two to five things for joining us Andrea is on Instagram I've never got over a million people on Instagram wow and I'm just now figuring out how to do it myself\nUm the guys at work here to do it and when I actually put a picture up there are people freak out so it doesn't cause I'm not very good at it but um I got pretty good at Twitter but nobody's on Twitter Twitter bad except except a bunch of trolls I mean it's just a bunch of angry\nPeople that um don't have a real identity or whatever so Instagram like nice people by and large not all but\nOn the block and one woman that was being a\nTest pilot from a broom factory though the day but um anyway Instagram Andrea by the end of the month will have four months of expenses safe\nDo we save up for a down payment on a home or we start investing were both at the same time we'd love to buy by the end of next year\nI think it's fine to wait for one year and the starch your baby step for we call that baby step three baby if you postpone your retirement savings for a short period of time to save up a big juicy fat down payment\nAnd if you can do that in a year and I think you can sounds like you've got this thing on the run you're out of debt you've got your emergency fund ding ding you've done this the right way you move into the house the house is going to be a blessing not a curse it's going to be a\nDream

[laughter]\nLove us right way to go you guys yeah that's so cool so what started you're doing this what made you say we can actually pay off her house 'cause most people never bother\nYeah well because the journey happened so long ago the beginning of the journey he had come home from work one day and he just said hey I heard this guy on the radio talking about money I was always reading books about finance and he said chicken look at the sky and see what you think\nSo the next weekend your CDs came the ... the very first set of CDs came from that you had created I listen to those CDs and literally that day my life what from awesome\nThat we had everything we could ever dreamed up our big house in our jet skis and so it was awesome until it was an awesome because we didn't own anything\n... nothing and it was just so\nRude awakening and it was so scary to sit there thinking we don't own any thing and so that started the journey to lots of life happened in between the removed about five times before he finally settled in Cape creek Arizona air got hurt on a construction job he was builder\nUm and when that happened that changed our life because he chose to go to college he said you know we need to go to college and that's what took the income down because I had to work and we cash flow to it you know and then once that was all done\nI printed the amortization scheduled for the house and I brought it to him and I said I think we can pay the house off in two years and I said you're crazy\n[laughter] but\nI really thought we could but this last two years has socked it\nWas hard to to you so you do the three Ninety four really in two years or how much of the three Ninety four was the house was two hundred and forty thousand okay we did that to your ... two years\nYeah whoa that was the ... where we ate the gazelle 'cause we were so tired and rice and beans\nYeah yeah he cleaned up all the jet skis and the other stuff in the previous seven years yeah but then when you look down and go okay game on now we're going to do the house and you leaned into it with wild good that's\nRight 'cause he had graduated from college and got a good job I had my good job we were stable ready to go\nAnd we did it I Love it I Love it [laughter] well done well though he did it so Eric what kind of injury did you have\nI Am community development coordinator for children about him\nI just have to say that living in Alabama we're so fortunate to have a place like children's of Alabama is not every state has a children's hospital that just loves kids\nYes but lately rarely do I'm really they touch all over the state of Alabama and like you said I'm even outside of our state as well um we are lucky to have that right here in our backyard but we know that there are plenty of facts that have to travel a great distance\nTo get here and um and have kind of a special day services that their children ... and that that we are able to provide here\nLast year I'm if I'm reading this right there was over six hundred and Seventy thousand out patient and nearly fourteen thousand inpatient visits to children's from every county in the state of Alabama and from forty one other states too\nYes that is absolutely correct our outpatient clinic star you know clinics from everything from a um maybe a quick dental clinic that that to our hematology oncology clinic where they may have to come and\nThe treatment for several hours or several times a week things like that so I'm a lot of those outpatient visits and then of course are um\nInpatient as it you know from all sorts of um injuries illness um that that that that patient that can make as well\nNow one thing I Do love about children's and having kids that have been to children's before is that not not only do you treat the child but you're also there to help the family as a whole can you tell me a little bit about that process as well\nYes absolutely we definitely strongly believe in the family centered care and rally trading the entire family law out while their hair with that and of course that the patient medical needs will come first that we make it a point\nTo take care of their parents and siblings and and the entire family um there's research that chat says that that the children are discharged narrow in their family is here with and spending time\nAnd all of our in our private Ryan said at the families can stay twenty four seven with that patient\nUm we have a wonderful child by staff who worked very closely with the patients and families to teach them about their treatment are teach them about a procedure and they work on the patient's level and that matter their age\nUm are learning ability they work with them with the author with books and show them in the process and what they well um what will be happening at that either things id for the patient and for the entire family for their parents to say that their child is at ease and\nUm all kinds of distraction tools that on our anything from a simple as a baby who doesn't want to wave mom's arms and\nYou know how life will bless them bottle so are you know show on something fan on an iPad to distract them while they maybe have to\nUm have a procedure or late month on for a minute and so they work closely with the family we have a great um school staff are sentenced school\nThey work directly with the patient teacher said that they are getting the the class work that the patient um I think they're getting at the same time but it's not that the work that working directly with that teacher said that the child welfare medically able\nThey're staying up on their schools that there's no anxiety about going back to school or missing anything they're staying up when they can\nUm and our teachers are there to help him with that help um tutor and offer any assets and and things like that\nThat is great on the phone was Kaylee coming from children's of Alabama one of the things I Love is obviously going in Birmingham Barons games if they're playing at home on friday night they have the fireworks my kids if they can stay up late enough after the game\nTo watch the fireworks and of course children's is right by regions field and so I guess that's another thing I mean the kids getting dressed for bed they got a front row seats these fireworks can you tell me a little bit about your partnership with the parents\nYeah you're right they had a primary the and we have lived um our partnership with the ... and and being in their backyard getting to see the fireworks to patients\nYou've heard all kinds of great stories of um the patient they love his day up and watch the fireworks and we have a great relationship with that they are and where um\nThey will invite a patient um occasionally to come through the first pet friendly can coordinate things like that and say we've had a I have a definitely a wonderful relationship with them and the kids while I'm gathering and some of the the family
