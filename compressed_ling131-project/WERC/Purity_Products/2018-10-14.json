thousand what are you guys do for a living\nSo I'm In a minute but sales for Wells Fargo\nAnd I'm I'm a full time stay at home mom but during that process I was a um health and fitness coach\nOkay very good and what kind of debt was the sixty nine thousand dollars a couple of cars and a little bit of student loan left\nCool did you sell any cars or did you just pay them off no we just pay them off the car got us into the travel okay very cool but nine months ago some kind of a switch lip because men you went all after it you went game own hair this is a pretty serious numbers wild on tell me the story what got you started\nSo probably about six months prior to that we ended up needing a new car needing right um other one's going out and we decided to bang for ... yeah the emergency popped up right yeah and ah we ended up with a car you know we had some strict guidelines we want and probably more than we really needed to pay for it but we did the brand new\nAnd it was then we're just sick of being stuck in kind of paying the bills even though we could pay it no problem that we just we didn't want to any more um we one we're more excited for the future and that was just going to be in the way for the future mhm so we just we won ... intensity near term so ...\nSo how did you end up where in the process to connect with us\nSo it I'm a huge following and podcasts lot of time on the road and always listen to and it's like they'd we can do this you know than us and I we're we've got this no problem so we started doing that at the same time it always been kind of a vision of hours to lead a few at our church ... celebration center and so we uh\nGot that started right about time we started we got everything in line to start a few in January at our church and\nWe did that and so it was kind of who started it and then as we ... we were learning for the first time with some mentors and now we're on a second session and loving it\nWow well thanks for leading the class yeah very cool well there's nothing like leading to make you do it I mean that's ... you can attend and may be kinda slough off right but are not hardly it's a very difficult to do that but it's almost impossible to lead it and not be game on\nExactly and I think that just kind of stems from what drew me to it because I Believe in modeling all the eight years and so if I'm going to model what I wanted my children have in the future I had to model at my house\nYou know my daughter ritual cruise always says that when you're teaching kids more is caught them taught yes the modeling thing is a big deal they're going to do what you do how many times about open my mouth and one of my parents' voice came out I mean oh my goodness you know that's what happened but it's happened on this show and you're much [laughter]\nSo well done you guys very well done so when you have someone in your class and\nTheir show up for financial peace and they're not game on because they're scared and they don't think they can do this the the whole peasant kicked in yet the belief hasn't kicked in yet what do you tell them they need to do\nTo be dead for each one of the things you need to do if you want to pay off sixteen thousand dollars and nine months\nWe did not do it\nYeah and you start your hand start waving and you start telling 'em right what do you tell them\nWell there's a couple of things I think first of all you got to believe you know I mean it's it's it's a program to believe in it works follow the program and you can do it um second all it takes a team it can't be an individual you know we're a family of four\nAnd it can't just be me doing it which is pretty much what we did in the past I was in charge of the money the budget all that it takes the team and as long as to if you can come together and really get on board\nIt can happen you know with with the steps you lay out it's it's not rocket science you know one of\nThe main things that someone needs to do to get out of debt\nAnd budget right there but I mean I think it is amazing how much money just flies in the door that you I don't make enough no it's their you make plenty you spend too much [laughter]\nWell that's true\nBut generally drew okay go ahead I also think that they need to focus on why they're doing it no tipping further out into the future and um and to recognize that my reason why it might not be the exact same reason it his way but at the end goal that that way in front of that is what we're both gravitating toward Mm\nA and to to really kind of set the stage for the beginnings of Arab on a you're a nonprofit that is based there enrichment and caught tell us the genesis the beginning of your organization why it's a surge do exist in what your purpose is all about\nWell we have to

ministry has progressed leading us what we'll talk about a little bit later about the event coming up at Stanford University ... where are you finding most impact right now with your ministry\nWell I found the most impact really look at where the guy I'm part of what happened about\n... years ago but when we started this ministry we off of a church that was a at a location original reviewing it and they could call Churchill that with economically and racially first\nI come from a strong good local Christian background where we could power fiercely we read scriptures and we also gauge and um ministry\nAnd um when we started to bring this church together and started to worshipping together we realized it was harder than a political mission statement on our website uh we never actually had\nOf works at a a worshipping together in a relationship with people who have a different race and culture and then you but also that associate nominate and class difference and that was very hard and very difficult and so when we look at what resources out there that could practically help was um you had\nWay for social theory that was a little ... by by just the fact that it's a social science discipline and then you had what I call ... by\n... by a type of a of the the theology that really wasn't that ... up to do the logically for these past or concern so what we did was we dig into the scriptures I'm\nTrying to see some of the best practices and um and I was at the history of our country and really try to do our best to make a biblical faithful witness practically help with the local church to engage effectively the ministry of reconciliation and so\nThat evolved at the end of things that people are a lot of countries started to ask us or what to do it how to do this is
