but even if you rent for six months or something you know I moved back in this price range or you know it wouldn't if you worry wouldn't make any sense I'm ... and so this move down to half of the house has probably three to five year plan\nCorrect\nOkay All right because you're going to do something to get your income back up a without having to completely sacrifice your soul at work I get that part I'm not asking you to do that\nBut I also there's a there's an equation out there that's floating around in the culture that I'm kind of working against subtly and that is is that in order to be happy you have to make less money\nAnd that's not an equation I'm going to participate in\nAgree because that usually means that you just didn't go do something that God designed you to do because you were afraid\nAnd I don't participate in sphere so um but again I'm not trying to destroy your family or anything like that this was a sizable step back for you all in order to take big steps forward as long as you don't take this sizable step back and settling in and make it your life\nThen I'm cool with that that's kind of where I'm saying so I Hope that helps a good question and a courageous decision on your part to do that James is with us in Rochester, Minnesota how James how are you\nI'm pretty good thank you for taking my call sure what's up I'm ah [noise] well I I got

that's pretty lame no I still have a vote at I I like it just is not as well as hot as my ... she just got to you got one\nKind of that that's how I feel that's probably not how she feels it off okay\nI'm In ... and not because that's not a good way to have a relationship but you should not make decisions together based on who makes the most money has the most which that's not a good plan especially when one of use thirty and the other one's twenty two\nOkay so you got a little more life experience could we agree on that\nThat's right okay good and that's not to say she's in up to twenty two but in this case uh apparently she is so uh in in this particular subject so how are we going to do this you start talking about what we need to do\nWe don't need to go to the mall we don't need to spend so much money we need to get a day you start talking about what after you read my book instead of talking to her about how and why\nYou sit down together and dream and say what if we

million dollars well what's the shortest path to get to that dream\nOf being able to do those things the shortest path is to live like no one else so that later you can live and give like no one else the shortest path is to be dead free and living on a plan in adults devise and plan and follow it children do what feels good\nIt's a sign of maturity to learn to lay pleasure emotional maturity

Utah is my first day in real estate ... I've got to to the house is sold six listings and extending clothing bought into uh the second week of November So\nLook you know what you are I Would have to say as far as like contemporary art is for me\nThe absolutely most well known hugely successful actor from Alabama at least have to say that right well I appreciate that considered every time you know I I was behind Ruben started for so long [laughter]\nYou know ... I cannot unfortunately it's the kind of make that stuff I think first of all thank you so much like we're on I guess sixty seven radio stations here see you're talking to the entire state of Alabama and\nHere which is the greatest thing in the world even though you moved to Los Angeles I think he set off are fortunate fame like in the nineties was Ninety six right after high school I went out yeah did you still live here\nNo none at once I made the jump you know it was a kind of with both feet so I was there until two thousand and ten and just kinda beating the pavement and figuring things out and then once we started having children my wife and I we kind of want to do I I Want to you know she's from Houston but I wanted to give my children kind of that same upbringing that I had so loaded I'm going back to ...\nAnd you're from clay clay you graduated from which high school you trust bill and you have three kids now and live on a farm that is correct correct\nI live on a farm do you really [laughter] I have horses I'll Try to push for that or do you have horses I Do have horses or what kind of horses do you have to quarter and a a Walker oh you did their big hair walkers are really big in Alabama this is something I wasn't ready for like when I moved here I had an apple lose a thoroughbred\nAnd paint and everybody's like yeah let's go for twenty five mile ride\nI have a walking or ... what do you have\nA broken back in his late you're very Alabama when it comes to your choice of horses okay so I'm just going to jump right on and I am so upset that\nYou're no longer on lethal weapon you were my favorite on the show in fact as far as I'm concerned Damon Wayans plays the ... role to me he could have been switched out with about Fifteen or twenty other actors and we never would have known that difference\nBecause his wife is way better in her role trash\nHe ever was he's kind of like white bread or something like a blend in with the what do you call it the wallpaper okay so Damon Wayans is still on the show and the biggest [laughter]\nIs Martin rags the guy playing the Martin rage character they killed off okay how does that make any sense to me I'm a little upset about it as you can tell my favorite show and it's no longer I Can't even watch it anymore it's been ruined for me\nYou know look at it that and I and I feel for the fans 'cause I think so many people enjoyed the show and and then you know the the outpour on social media has been so beautiful you know because I was told every day that I can be replaced with any other white guy\nWith I joined the U.S again it it it is you know but it I think it's all perception and and those guys certainly in and out the day in a way to just wait a minute it's not perception\nAnd if it is so called perception someone needs to get a clue they've spent too long in Hollywood I Know that I can speak for legions of fans when I say that at the beginning of this\nWe may have been a not so sure that we wanted to embrace it because you were messing with lethal weapon and Mel Gibson and it's just a classic however once we started watching the show we fell in love with you\nAnd Martin rags and we were invested in you in every single week we wanted to see your life turned around and good stuff come your way and then all of the sudden you don't have a good thing come your way you end up getting shot\nBy your half brother and if that's not enough then they killed yeah they killed Martin bricks from lethal weapon the perception is they screwed up\nThat the perception out here in real America they fired the wrong guy period\nThere is no other way you can look at this and I am venting to you and I can't believe that I get this opportunity to do so because there are so many fans who would love to tell you the same thing you were the show you are the show and without you they might as well just pull the plug\nYou know for us in my family and and and I and I and I agree you know look again I think that I I pride in our show on being a something that and there's not a lot a lot out there these days where everyone mom dad and the children can all sit around a gathering and yes I'm In or men and women I think it brought a lot of couples together the don't really have a lot in common them and what there was no\nAbsolutely everybody it was something for everybody to get yeah and I mean\nAnd we we we strive for that you know um [noise]\nYou know from my family it it certainly been sad into kind of get catapulted out of the situation but for us you know we were pulled into it\nI certainly didn't fight for this job I felt the same way you did I felt what are those guys are done in the eighties\nOr in the early nineties shouldn't be messed with you know I I think shame black wrote arguably one of the greatest scripts and I'm certainly created one of the greatest relationship\nBuddy cop shows absolutely I ever seen right so I certainly didn't want to mess with that and and I also had no desire to work within the network world which I kind of feel like it's a little bit of sausage factory in the sense that we're just kind of pumping out product\nAnd that's not my style of entertainment by any means so\nThis didn't seem like that at all this will light broke my back\nTrying to make it were that right because I again I Lived in this huge chateau and I certainly didn't want to this to be my last project\nSo again I I was reluctant to go in simply because I didn't want to mess it up and uh and I'd just been working for years on rectify so I was looking also to take a little bit of a break time with my family and this kind of slid\nThis wasn't going to do it\nEnded up seeing my family for ... years ago when I left the house they were going to continue that I was able to take care of their college but outside of it you know try to do\nSo again from what we've learned is that been and I don't want to get into what we all believe in but we know that there's

pulled into this situation\nAnd it allowed us an opportunity to start a foundation\nAnd it allowed me to play a character that I just absolutely love for years and I kind of felt like in a way for forty episodes 'cause we shut Eighteen to twenty two I felt like I had a ... I felt like the character at a nice are granted no one wants to see more than race get killed but I felt as an artist that I had a nice arc so for us\nTo be catapulted into a situation and then it'd be catapulted out\nIt was perfect timing her and I never had any control over it never not anything to him between well let me thank you had a love interest All right we've gotten a came in and out your dad came back\nA he was in prison he tried to kill you play by the amazing ... he was really a few really good and those scenes are pretty powerful between you guys\nLet's say you almost got killed I don't know how many times on the show just in the normal investigation process of what you were doing and then you started before the scene and the graveyard where you're half\nBrother a shot and killed view and I really never thought she would die I thought of course he'd come back before you got there it just me or does it seem like your time on screen in curies ex financially between\nIt seemed like you were never not on the screen\nAnd it felt like I was never not at Warner Brothers [noise] you know it was it certainly um the workload was put on me but I was excited about that because I'm a little bit of a control freak and it allowed me to\nYou know run quality control in a sense for what we were trying to tell and I I you know when you have Thirteen riders fourteen writers in a room\nAnd you have a new director every single week it's difficult to maintain that singular vision through well sure and we didn't have a show runner on set you know uh what is the runner when you run the show oh\n[laughter] that was somebody that likes to get information and ran it back to the studio um\nThat kind of would be more of a that would be a proper or a description of what our show runner did right he he he was just not there um and and and and so again I was there to kind of again it was it was more to kind of ...\nIf the train on the tracks and\nTo have that singular boys are from week to week which again can kind of get lost a network because everyone's working insane hours yeah you just you're so exhausted\nPhoning it in his really sometimes the only option but unfortunately for me I don't know how to do that right I Would love to I could have made a lot more money and you know I could have probably not been as so stressed out throughout the world\nTo me that wasn't what it seemed like from the dark I mean to me it really seem like it was his own little film its own little blockbuster movie every week so I", "show_name": "Purity Products", "year": "2018", "city": "Birmingham", "day": "28"}
