Joe Heck dot com [noise] all the goods there we have redesigning the website Go check\nIt out also the blaze radio network it is the weekend with Joe ... you're always glad to catch up with my former governor the go former governor the great state of Texas Rick Perry he's the energy secretary for the United states of America now and you might wonder well what does that person do\nA lot clearly and a lot of travel as well we talked to about bad we're talking about liquefied natural gas to get into an war as well uh ... appreciate you how are you\nJoe I'm good thank you very much where I'm up in Washington DC for a few days here so you know Texas but it's a it's what I called temporary duty\nAnd you're fighting the fight very well it's interesting as you know I'm connected with several people on your staff and I I can see their travel on Facebook and on Twitter and so on you and your uh uh globetrotters now as it did you know that was going to be part of the job to be over in Africa\nThere'd be over in Europe and be over in Asia and they'd back home base it on your back over Indonesia we did you know that that was good in Tel Aviv is\nUh not necessarily but what's happened is is the energy revolution Reynolds off that occurred in the United states\nIt makes sense in hindsight it would be in all those markets because it's you know we are now selling American a liquefied natural gas into thirty different countries on five caught and that that's great and uh there there's more to be done so I'm being there\nUh I I consider one of my jobs of it obviously being a regulator making sure that we're a you know were regulated at the permit process is mood than as\nA as as transparent as it can be but it's also to be the\nYou know a salesman for American energy whether it's a a liquefied natural gas for the rich are crude whether it's our fossil fuels whether its nuclear energy whether it's a A R renewable technologies all of that is desired around the world and the secretary of energy that\nOught to be their job\nIf the United states secretary of energy Rick Perry so I'm watching the the the terror of talk of the trade talked in the leverage that are that the president has and and he's putting it on the ... you and everybody in the left in this country ... they're all complaining ... putting terrorist is going to ruin trade and in no time flat\nBiggie you stepped up and said we're making a deal we don't want the terrorists we want to have fair trade that in a big part of the deal was liquefied natural gas\nNow are you are you consulted as the president's doing that as you like Rick can we do this Ellen gee thing can we make this happen can we make a part of the deal how does that go down\nThere he he obviously talks of you know [noise] extensively with his cabinet for the cause of you know secretary of treasury my nutrition and secretary of commerce Wilbur Ross day all have a\nA a role to play in that and and so absolutely there's a there's there's good and a correspondent back and forth a\nAnd a ... everybody's on the same team and I want to get back to you know this is what people should expect I mean I Know the left doesn't like him for a lot of reasons that I you know ... and that is what it is right uh but they're not being realistic they're just they're just they don't like him because he's not Hillary\n[laughter] true true but it's true\nAnd and and the point is that what you would expect to see out of a a negotiator\nA person who goes in what they really hard line I mean he he plans on winning I mean his his theory here is that listen if I trade ya and you agree to it you know that's your fault not mine uh and and that's exactly\nWhat he's doing with these trade deals where he comes to a certain really hard stuff I mean you think about with you and then a young and came back in here or after they laid out\nSome really tough or a sanction or not sanctions but tariffs it retro a trade deals with the Europeans and they said you know what we decided we want to buy your allergy and let's let's find a way so to the Chinese ... again you know the heads blew up when they announced the tariffs are originally with China\nAnd then the Chinese came back a few days later\nThe Chinese know that they will lose a\nThey know that we will lose\nA a trade war or or the Chinese or they'll lose a trade war with us so you know\nI don't know because we're the biggest customers they don't want to screw with us that would lead them\nSo we just want you to be fair we want you to be an equitable we want you to be transparent oh and we don't want your stealing our IP either our international uh our our intellectual property\nRights of any good neighbor\nYeah that that's another big part of it it's a energy secretary Rick Perry you're in the state of Texas so efficiently and our economy here still booming under the great guidance of a great guy but now when you get into a position where you know there's so much bureaucratic red tape and there's so much garbage that you've got to go through before you can actually get to the source of the issue when you finally got\nTo see what these trade deals worth especially energy wise with these other countries were you surprised at how uh how completely out of balance they were we got very little they get everything it was very strange\nYeah it it it was really pretty fascinating and\nHere's the other side of it as these things were outdated do you think about the north American free trade agreement that was put in place I think in Ninety two is when it was side that was twenty five years ago and and think about where America was twenty five years ago from an energy standpoint I mean completely a hundred and eighty degree uh we were dependent\nOn a lot of countries that didn't necessarily have our interest in mind who ... a a developing a the energy sources that we were buying\nAnd now I'm you know Mexico and and and and Canada both very different positions than we were twenty five years ago so it makes a button that good sense that the president would say you know what it's time to renegotiate this thing\nAnd we got an email now the uh uh I think it's a ah what do we call it the uh uh U.\nOffer to seven nine six four or five that's ...

that you need for the night time it's not like with the sun goes down every day you suddenly have no more power in stores it like any battery would\nUm and then when the sun does come out again and

Twitter Instagram email the live video feed do [noise]\nThe blaze radio network as well it is the weekend with Joe ...\nAnd I'm Glad to have your long for the ride a there's a lot going on this past week\nI was able to connect with Sarah payload yes that Sarah Palin the former governor of Alaska and also the former Republican nominee for vice president of the United states it was very interesting how it happened and and I sort of tell the story in the interview we were able to connect\nAnd uh and do you hope you're watching as well as listening and if you're not go back to the live stream later and watch it because the scenery behind her is beautiful in Alaska\nBut the ladies and gentlemen boys and girls that Sarah Bailey Sarah how are you\nI'm doing great thank you for having me\nThey were not be mad at me for that whole thing like friday because people know I was actually ... this was unfolding on me or live you're listening but I was telling them what was going on\nAnd and I got a random Facebook message from somebody not named Jew who said Hi Sarah pale in and pick up the kids up and dropping kids often and eliciting just what is it good point and he said man you've got a famous name and cracked me up\nWhat your age your was do you remember what you said you said it's really neat I promise [laughter]\nStick\nGoing back and forth that when I needed\nSomebody to the fact we get pumped a lot in yeah Ali yet I'm Still thank you for doing that and know it's funny I started getting the calls in the tax people up here in Los Angeles any I don't know what I'm trying to verify it me\nWhile I tried to verify the few ways when I got the email back from Sarah appealing dot com I knew that it was somebody connected with you at least um but then I sent you a tweet that you guys couldn't find and then finally I said do you have an iPhone ... face time you'll let's just settled this once and for all and as good as we got to go to the fake you so much for reaching out by the way\nAnd then when they think about that is yeah so I'm grabbing Todd known by that time out of the vehicle and we're all not lead by lying to try to figure out how to say that\nIt worked out 'cause you press the but you took my face time in ... well that's definitely her not Tina Fey that's her that's\n[laughter] I Know you've got a hold of me because you are seeing what was unfolding or in in Washington DC I still to this very sure I have no idea how Lisa Murkowski be became a senator or as a write him really so that's the starting point for me and then she says as a Republican IQ support Brett Kavanaugh\nAnd the reason she says she couldn't support him was that he's not the right guy at the right time\nDo the people of Alaska except that excuse\nNo and go back even further\nWrite in campaign out after he lost the primary up here remember what's her dad Senator Frank Murkowski after having served twenty two years in the U.S Senate he gave his daughter the job\nWhen he was elected governor up here race or one term and and I ran against him into heated him read that at least got and that's how we stayed in essentially 'cause man once you're in and you have these special interest from\nAround the country right up funding you you know you should have to it's tough to hold them accountable and say okay enough is enough time to go but no I'm irrational reasoning that she provided regarding that that\nThat vote against Kavanaugh because as you point out she said he's good man it's not about qualifications and I'm like wait you know about calls like of course it is and whether either good matter\nYes I'm so no it didn't make sense and then her speech on the Senate floor which is kind of talking in circles are very very very disappointed because Joe as even suggested as an outright set on friday\nThe things that she's putting in jeopardy just for the state of Alaska but for his country I mean it come down to the Supreme\nHaving so much with in its graph having to do with our solvency our sovereignty and she was willing to play some games with that\nWell she was willing to play games and the point that I made that I really appreciate that you are you\nAre you why was it up and our circuit court of appeals at all ... opinion of course the former vice presidential nominee for the Republican Party back to two thousand eight and of course the former governor of Alaska and just a great all wrong person or you know this but I wasn't a vote for John McCain is going to write of my mother's name\nUntil you got on the ticket and then I voted for you\nSo and I think a lot of people actually did that the point I made friday was Lisa Murkowski and people like her were actually putting in the hands of the most liberal court in the United states the Ninth Circuit court of appeals the the um\nThe more issues of Alaska and everybody in the west coast in other words if the Supreme Court has eight members and it's tied for the foreign almost everywhere we would be for the for now it goes back to the previous court in the Ninth Circuit court of appeals will decide the first amendment checking Mehmet Fourth Amendment Fifth Amendment Pence Amendment for Alaska what does that make you think\nThat's exactly right and Joe I was impressed because nobody else was talking about that share what her\nAction was was essentially bolstering the Ninth Circuit had she had her her way and that's the Ninth Circuit outta\nFrancisco right he talked about injustice and\nJustice being delayed for Alaskans because that court a million people they are to quote unquote served it's the largest by far\nThe second largest the eleventh and they are only thirty thirty five million right so there is such a backlog of cases and not even talking about the ideology behind that very very partisan very liberal Korea is just a practical reasons why we don't want to give them any more power anymore say over Alaska\nSo for me to be messing around with that uh that was very very dangerous and the other thing is that President Trump President Trump saw the lights and is allowing animal are only decades of the nation understanding what Anwar has",
