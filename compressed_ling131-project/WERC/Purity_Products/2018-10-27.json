Republican Kevin Brady he's the guy working on tax code working on the tax playing with President Trump or we talk about the\nThe the bombing suspect being arrested better just happened before we spoke\nAnd also about what is this new tax cut plan that we keep hearing about him and I appreciate you how are ya\nHey I'm good thanks for having me on\nYou know what what an incredible\nTime we're living in right now I Want to get into the incredible succession the positivity that came out about that rally on Monday but I'd be remiss to not today I'm first asked you about the arrest of is this person that police say the FBI shows was this idiot that\nSends out a bunch of bombs what are your thoughts when you see that I personally as a family man is a community member really relieved that we got um what what are you going yeah\nThat was my first time relieved a cop that that is good police and law enforcement work obviously this guys had a history of uh of problems you have a ... and then sending in in threatening\nTo blow up folks and so we don't know the intent behind all this but we do know this is a person that frankly um and I don't know what to how much damage would have been done but can you imagine you know\nHad like a low on right let me pick the lord they didn't they didn't know what I mean forget about it and again it didn't get into the hands of the targets but people at these ... and people at the mail rooms of these different buildings would have been you know really in dire straits here\nYeah and and you know I I took a A R e ... advice early on and he said you know someone stopped talking about blaming politicians and pundits let's do the investigative work and find out who this is that's exactly what happened I think that's the right way to go after\nI think so too it's a Kevin Brady of House Ways and Means Committee chair ... one last thing on that\nUm is there any changing how the media is doing is they're calling him the demography bomber they're calling you know for our good bomber ... that people did not call the guy who shut up the baseball practice and an almost killed these college they didn't call him a standard shooter or some ... why is there a double standard here\nAnd there is and I'll tell you uh do I play baseball I played second base with Steve and I had to miss the shooting by only\nA few minutes no in fact the coach after batting practice or after I took some a swing state do you want to take some ground or as a second I looked out\nThe was take them now I'm fine and I grabbed my gear and left just about four minutes ahead of the shooting so uh this is a ... yeah the media um there is a double standard here and and and I guess my frustration is\nAll the blame the president and others for what they believe are overheated rhetoric they often hum are silent when you hear\nHillary Clinton you know urge instability or Maxine Waters Cory Booker or encourage harassment and violence and\nThen rock Obama and Eric Holder ... we've got soundbites from all of them that are actually inciting violence and none of us ever said well of violence happens they made it happen I mean we'd like to see them tamped down their rhetoric a little bit but what a bad guy shoots up a baseball practice or a bad guys sends out bombs\nI I'm not going to blame the president nor Hillary Clinton I'm going to leave the guy who did it\nThe guy yeah that's exactly right and that's the way it ought to be handled so it is that the year where frankly President Trump can't even breathe the right people criticized for everything but I'll tell you what what he's doing for the country for our economy for our security it's just unbelievable\nI had a conversation with John Hi Bush from the raging a librarian and he's the executive director there and we were comparing and contrasting\nWhat this president has accomplished to what Ronald Reagan accomplished and the fact that it's thirty five forty years later the media looks back in ... lovingly and and they didn't love and back then um and and they're treating Trump horribly and basically they've got about the same record in fact the Heritage Foundation finds this president is even more conservative\nThan President Reagan was ... it it's unfair but but that's why have you on let's talk about the successes\nYeah and so Joe to your point what thank you for saying that because that that's my point look Ronald Reagan perhaps of grace president in modern times yeah probably is in my view you know has two legacies\nTax cuts that to redo that the economy for decades and and ignited prosperity and rebuilding the military exactly what President Trump has done in just a his first year and a half really and then you put on top of that this amazing\nRecord in the courts of a constitutional judges\nFrom the Supreme Court on down it really is a remarkable record\nIt it's a remarkable success you have to\nYou again is never going to give him a chance it's Kevin Brady House Ways and Means Committee chair\nOr it'd be the success that we're seeing was fueled by what you came up with ... you worked on this night and day I remember you\nYour job when it come on but I don't mean up two minutes and you're like you you're you're breaking pencils him going crazy with ah with 'em all sorts of what how do we make this happen and you did somehow and all of us every American to pay taxes got a break every American to pay taxes has a bigger payouts\nMany Americans three four five six million either got bonuses where they got raises companies are are no manufacturing stuff you're again or promising gift to start doing it so the other side Kevin seem all that success as\nWe got we got to raise the taxes again we have to hurt corporations again and drive them out of the country how was it a winning strategy for them\nYeah I don't know that it is and and and they but they are doubling down on it so appealing in tax cuts raising the taxes on businesses going back to the old a code where every month we saw another us company moving overseas or manufacturing overseas or jobs overseas and and and in in a period where President Obama\nYou know that was the weakest or economic recovery um since World War two right and he never had a year never\nThey started understanding what they had the front of them already saw reading him for his successor\nBut it really did take you know darn near water to more presidency before the press release start a small apartment\nIt's kind of amazing or a last question I appreciate the time John I'm ... how does how does Trump either a repair this relationship where do you see him going forward just doing exactly what worked so far because I mean frankly the media might say that he's a failure he's horrible when he was up in the ... and if something is but the bottom line is\nThese crowds of a hundred thousand people are signing up to go see him in Texas and elsewhere\n... what do you see him doing going forward\nAnd if we use the word repair I don't think that's conceivably possible because I don't think this is something that's necessarily now within his control\nI don't think even if you walk up tomorrow morning and want to you know kissing ... they're not going to happen and that's because it's interesting it's not too tough to imagine that Trump has an individual made a decision\nTo go to war with the media but but now that the media has made the decision to go to war with top yeah\nThat's a very different thing I don't think the media I think they've kind of a ma you know that the ... now and and now they're they're they're in an enemy camp and against him no matter what I don't think there's a truth that's on the horizon they ever and I think that's going to be the case and so ah\nSo Trump like Reagan hops aboard Marie once logical circle around the city\nI I agree with that I think it is absolutely right has been reduced to appreciate John Hi Bush or

still Margot bomber the make America great again bummer\nWhich is disgusting\nReporting that the bomber was going after Trump targets no not the case would you have is a bad guy who did something very bad\nAnd calling him demographer bomber is not only inappropriate it shows that you shouldn't be in the journalism business at all\nThose of us on the political opposite side we're not calling the shooter as a congressional baseball game the senior shooter even though he was a vehement Bernie Sanders supporter that's not what we do that's also not being honest and it's not reporting the news\nAs as it is in reality\nSo we've got more violence today we don't know why other than this person allegedly shouts some sort of hatred and I'm\n\nAn incredible hatred and loading of of people have the Jewish faith we don't have any motive other than that we don't know his name although it's been a reporter to use a white guy with a beard\nAnd it was also was reported that the bombing suspect it was a white guy to that guy list himself as Native American as first name is Caesar or says are so he could be Hispanic as well it all sorted reports that he's a child even fill up you know the media always do quick to say it's a white guy remember George Zimmerman\nThe guy who killed Trayvon Martin because Martin went back and was beating the hell out of them in in self defense he shot and killed him being rewarded him as a white guy for a long time until they had to once his picture was out there admitted that he was a Spanish so then they started calling him a white Hispanic\nSo dumb that is\nThe media always is looking for a spin I'm always going to give it to us raid is again and that's where we have a Pittsburgh I'll give you updates as we go I definitely want your thoughts on this uh this bombing suspect that is a\n... that's under arrest and even more than that I mean it looks like it's a ... job who had\nSome crazy delusion about what his role should be in politics in this country\nI mean just the pictures the van itself if you're looking at a going what there was a guy riding down the street with a van that looked like that and nobody suspected and even here's a guy with a ... a substantial criminal record\nYears and years and years of convictions who by the way was a registered Democrat I've seen reports that he switched to Republican and twenty sixteen\nAnd suddenly Trump made him do it according to the media\nSends out a bunch of alleged bombs I'm not even convinced there were really bombs but he sends out a bunch of alleged bombs to people we put return addresses armies fake addresses on the actual said into an area they were supposed to show up at all these prominent Democrats houses and their offices and never made it there\nBut it's\nFor the media it's not about are the bad guys off the street thank God nobody was hurt it's more about\nTrump did this I guess there were some letter signed by hundreds of journalists about how Trump is somehow inciting violence against journalists that's not true he's done nothing like that in fact it sounds really stupid and an journalistic to even say something like that\nIn fact I can make a good argument that the media is inciting violence against those who support President Trump you if you were a make America great again hat you're a target and that's okay\nIf you go to a Trump rally or you have a Trump bumper sticker you're a racist and Islamophobia has either fall but that's OK the media school with that\nYou're late night talk shows calling the president's mouth a blank holster for\nFor ... that's okay it's perfectly fine fake news incessantly that's just the way it is will correct it later\nAnd there are there is an example of for example ... sample of that\nWith the media again playing the victim in fact Jim Acosta from CNN the other day tweeted out\nThis appointment or engaged over the fact that when President Trump was talking about the bombs that were they were going he didn't mention CNN specifically give it or not\nThis is a guy whose job is supposed to be to go there to report the news and he's not ever supposed to be the story is mad that he wasn't the story\nAnd when the president does call seeing that out then a cost in in in his ilk say he shouldn't be doing that\nHe's putting his endangering denigrating what we do for a living so make you make your mind up either you want to be mentioned by the president or you don't want to be on the president you don't get to tell the president what mentioned he has to make\nFor you so I mean we're living in bizarro world here really are those who perpetrated violence on the left should be arrested and or or killed in the act like the guy with the shooter was in that congressional baseball practice\nThey should be prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law and sent away for as long as we possibly can those who committed violence and they're on the right same thing should apply but this is elected reporting abuse the desired by the media to pretend like one\nSide is inciting violence and the other side is if it's just a crazy person that was unhinged vats irresponsible\nThat's responsible or\nBy the way that the bombing suspect very odd the whole thing's odd claims he's a seminal Indian\nIs family or a family friend or a lawyer or somebody claim that he wasn't at all that he isn't one by one name that he went by different name one name sounded Native American or American indian and the other one sounded battalion first name certainly sounds Hispanic who knows what he is\nWhen we do know is he was some promoter for chip and bills\nAnd some bouncer at at a bar even the night before he was arrested\nSo whatever the the leftist trying to glean from him and put it on Trump easier responsible and stupid\nAnd the media needs to learn it's job again the job is to go there observing and tell us what you saw\nIs not drug or observe and then tell us why Trump caused it that makes no sense so I'll keep you updated on what's happening in Pittsburgh certainly we've got a bunch of interviews coming your way a bunch of interviews I might take

County Arizona he is a right they're separated by an Indian reservation but right there on the border and deals with illegal immigration overtime I Want to know how he's preparing for the caravan heading this way\nAnd and what exactly it is the law enforcement is willing to her has to do as it gets here are shared by appreciates how're you\nDoing great thanks for having me on\nAnd listen always appreciate it really had a good time with you at the fair get together in Washington DC got some great knowledge I have to wear my cowboy boots next time I played a shrimp um six one I Would do for his standing next to you but ah it was a great time and really great knowledge I Love the way you guys there in your sheriff's department\nDo the job and especially you know watching you out there on live TV\nI saw out they're interacting with people in the community and I love the way that you take the job on a lot of people I've seen police officers you know guys like this to who walk around like like you know their stuff doesn't stink I've seen some who I think are sometimes too lenient you seem to really have it down to two\nI'm going to interact with my neighbor here maybe somebody who goes to church with me or my my kids go to school together but at the same time I I Can't let them go too far because then that would make it bad for the community is that kind of how you approach it\nYou know that is these are my neighbors these are people that I'm gonna see at the store and these are people that I'm going to deal with in the future and uh I don't know what is what it is going on in their life to put him to this point uh quite trick or treat everybody with dignity and respect and we tried to go there now they escalated\nI don't have a problem escalated as well but I find that even if you can attract more flies and then you can then Igor ...\nAnd in watching you interact with again the sheriff mark lamb from ... county I've seen that I mean you walk up generally speaking no my ... unless they like get a shot somebody you walk up generally speaking very respectful and and you seem to be giving them the benefit of the doubt now\nHow often do you figure percentage you can put on this where somebody will not get with the program not understand that you might actually be willing to cut them a break and they just don't shut up and they just give you a hard time and it's this whole community versus the police but is there a percentage of people that you think talk their way into jail or into a ticket or something\nOh yeah I don't know what it is for most police officers I mean for me it probably about ten percent of those\nAre just difficult to deal yeah ... that you know I'm I'm a believer in calmness and power if you walk out your common they can steal that they don't feel you're amped up it just it really helps that situation go a lot smoother even if you have to rest\nAnd ended up going to last but there's some people that have just like you said from the word go they're not with the program and that you can tell that immediately\nWhat I've learned from watching your chair of mark lamp and al ... Arizona and from watching other law enforcement officers on on shows like live pd and others um it is that when you walk up\nYou're generally speaking don't want to put somebody in a bind I mean there really is a lot more discretion that I think I ever knew there was a but again if somebody's going to get with the program you'd probably have three or four or five different charges on some cases that you can lay on 'em and but they're also minor enough to where you could still get them home tonight\nThat you know it's kind of it's I didn't know that do you hear from other people like me who say you know I had no clue you guys could deal with it that way\nYeah you know a lot of people don't realize that and it we do have a lot of discretion and that's why I Try to tell people look\nJust relax you know this is going to go a lot more did a lot differently than you think you'd just stay calm was work through it um and it does get us the ability to use some of that discretion but you're right and if we wanted to get stack honest on charges too so it it really just depends on on where they want to take it\nWhat would I get pulled over in ... and you don't know what kind of cars or have but when I get pulled over and it's often a ... a have my hands are tending to I've got the inside light on a window roll down on fake and whoever it is the man or woman just walking up", "show_name": "Purity Products", "year": "2018", "city": "Birmingham", "day": "27"}
