I saved up a little bit of money and I've paid off well paid on like ten credit cards and I thought I was doing a good thing and then the next month came around and I noticed that all of the ... the minimum payments were like ten dollars cheaper than it was the previous month and I said this isn't the way to go\nSo from there I just started the searching around on ways to pay all that and then I actually saw the baby steps and then when I saw it I said\nI don't have time for baby steps I Need to get outta there tomorrow so I just kept looking around and then I saw um\nThe debt snowball and I clicked on the debt snowball and then ... you were talking about the baby steps against what I said I Can't get away from this guy so I didn't just watch it and then started listening to it and I actually went to one ear a smaller conferences and rally oh yeah they're from there I was just I've been on fire ever since then\nVery cool well done well done sir I was a field I have no payments

always talked about selling so many things that kids think their next I don't have any children themselves [laughter] I just started to sell everybody else and stuff so I Would go to yard sales and I would buy cheaper and then sell it for higher and I really have yeah I just kept doing that every weekend just you might have come up and pay more than just to get it done\nSo where did you resell it ... I was on Amazon ... okay jump on Amazon with the use item and works like anybody and it goes out of there so what was the item that you did the best with reselling\n... was actually a board game um things called masterpiece or something like that I think I bought it for two dollars and end up selling it for like a hundred and fifty woe is brand new sauce that I liked is\nAlright yeah I Want to do that again as long as I absolutely well good for you man very very well done what was the hardest part of getting out of debt for you\nKnow the hardest part um ...\nIt wasn't necessarily to process it was more about seeing how that affected the people around me so you know that just affects society in general and I just made me want to get out of the fast and then going to tell other people that you can get out of that and that you don't need to live that way so that was really the hardest part was just\nSeeing how that affected other people in the hopelessness that they felt ... and I'm just let them know that there's another way to do it better plan\nIt was a good words those words telling me you'll never go back now now that this is the good life you know it's not my friend Rob ... let me see him every morning we worked together and he's that free too and uh we just talk about a good life is right now yeah Mm I meant well done show you brought your girlfriend whether you're what's

just kept worked in in you know once you stay on people and say what they want to say but at the end of the day and works and yeah you know I'm ...\nOkay so if you came a\nYou know you'd be at about a five year plan if you were a little under two hundred thousand right thirty six thousand divided into two hundred thousand right well then it would be um six years roughly if you do the full two hundred a little over two hundred but\nSomewhere between one fifty and two hundred you could do it and about five years not counting getting raises and not counting saving even more that's the most I Would want to go\nOh I don't want to wait much more than five years or to buy and I don't want to wait much more than five years out of your retirement system so I mean whatever you're going to do I would try to do it in under that um but then so the point is you're sitting with a paid for property no pain\nIn the world at that point right and you're making really good money and you're thirty something thirty one thirty two years old right and so can you can you become a multi millionaire doing that absolutely you can\nOkay is that what you just pay yourself a house payment from age thirty to age sixty you'd be a multi millionaire\nRight\nGreat so we'll we'll go ahead\nAnd would you recommend it maybe if we did we might be a guy did maybe I tend to retirement and say maybe a little bit less\nIt's up to you if you're going to go longer than five years I'm starting to get pretty nervous about it okay okay if you're going to be under five years and you want to do zero in your case you're still going to be very young and without a house payment when you pay cash for this house\nRight thirty one years old is very young was zero house payment you you got the income for the rest of your life to build wealth with I mean if you will just keep paying attention again by yourself or house payment plus or minus a little you can be a multi millionaire\nOkay great thank you don't my day like create your life\nVery well done good job you're thinking Deborah's whether it's in Tampa, Florida Hi Deborah how are you\nI'm doing well thank you for taking my call I'm\nSure what's up\nWell I'm I Am working on that you know a a financial peace university and I have paid out forty thousand dollars in twelve month good for you and yes and I'm Down to just wind that\nWhich is a bill that we've been paying for many years now mhm I with today's my payments mhm and ah it's been offended collection and we've been looking at our credit report just making sure that all these debts have fallen off\nAnd um it it turns out that hospital bill has fallen off of our credit report\nAnd because of that my husband has been a trying with the idea of just not adding that to the debt now and just continuing that men on payments or even not paying it at all and that scares me to death but I wanted to know from you what are the implications of doing something like that\nWhere there's two problems whether one is you actually owed them money so you should pay it\nYeah that's one problem with the second problem is is that it's gonna come back to haunt you just because they're not reporting it today doesn't mean they're not going to take an active outstanding account and report is that any time and so right what happened what's happened\nIs is the collection agency that you're dealing with the collections company that you're dealing with is just not downloaded their files to credit bureau but they could do that at any time and then you've got a bad mark not just a mark but a bad mark 'cause this is a defaulted this is a bad deal\nIt's not a current bill because they didn't offer you payments at the start they only offered you payments because you couldn't pay them\nRight and you owe them the money and so uh how much is the bill\nI it's less than seven thousand at this point\nOkay what I Would do is continue to pay them I Would continue to\nPay them the minimum wage and I would build up a you know a lump sum of three or four thousand and offer them that a settlement and let's get it settled in full and get it in writing\nOkay but in writing settled in the fall and I I Would do that because it's already a bad mark on your credit and there's no telling how much they've added to it in collections fees and late fees anyway\nAnd so I you know I I Want to I Want to discount it a little for those reasons in those situations but just to ignore it because it's currently not showing up on your credit bureau is on was because it will end up showing up again\nAnd on top of that you owe the bill so clear the bill move on with your life it's worth it it's worth the trouble to address a good question thanks for calling in Tanya is in Lexington Hi Tania welcome to the Dave Ramsey show\nHello thank you for taking my phone call sure what I have I have a question [laughter] I Am Seventy years old and I'm getting ready to think about taking the payment options for my tax shelter anybody [noise]\nUh and I wanted to know what would be something like the best option and I went I took a annuity out my thinking was to take a lifetime monthly benefit and so then when I went to I ask about it they gave me a several other options [noise]\nUm because of the other options for to take a fixed\nAnnuity monthly income which should be lower but it would include a long term care policy no I neither one way to take another fixed and the lady with a nursing care home policy no\nOr another option but to take a tenure certain with which would be lower premiums and on your lap and then it went race could be a higher premium\nNo okay let's go with a F none of the above um uh\nSo uh [laughter] the anytime you started weaving in these other policies with it that's going to entail extra fees and garages notice I didn't even ask what I'm not I didn't even ask what the numbers are when that's on the insurance world we call that his bundling\nAnd there's only one time it was only one time bundling works to the consumers advantage and that's when you put your car insurance or homeowners were friends together\nThat often works to your benefit but the rest of this stuff is gimmicky gotcha garbage and so that I smelled harassed and you have a good you have a good nose on your kiddo [noise]\nSo what I Would tell you there's I Would tell you the check with an investment advisor like one of the smart vest her prose and talk about just rolling this into some a very low risk low volatility mutual funds and then just pulling an income off of that\nI think you'll end up with more money alive and dead doing that then you will\nMessing with this annuity because the other thing that you can be sure of with an insurance company or an investment firm anytime they give you a guarantee that means they're giving you less than you could have made if you didn't have a guarantee\nOkay oh and so I you know it's like with your home you didn't get a guarantee when you bought your home no guarantee it's going to go up\nIn value we're down in value either one no no insurance huh backing your home no no FDIC insurance on the value of your home and yet you felt really comfortable taking that quote unquote risk\nWhy because well we can look at their track record of homes and be very comfortable with them and if I could find a mutual fund that I was just comfortable with\nIts track record it's volatility as I was with your home at Seventy years old or something like a growth in income ponder balance fund that kind of a thing\nThat's probably where I'm putting my money if I'm you at Seventy um and it wouldn't be anywhere near an insurance company so I'll be rolling this whole thing over into something else\nChecked

it's not as volatile and you don't come in and you know run or something you know vacation runners haven't torn up your stuff or spilled want on your carpet or whatever\nAnd I know the names will deposit and I know this stuff gets fixed but I also know people are living in their sleep and in your\nBed and you just have to think about that you know and\nKnow it's just it's a way it is an even a nice home and even nice people like the Ramsey staying in your home we weren't we didn't tear up stuff or not\nIt wasn't a frat party in there it was you know babies and grandma ... and that kind of

for Sharron Ramsey to walk into the place where she wants to go on her second home as a vacation and someone else to have been in there and some of the stuff is out of place or broken or dirty it would kind of take a lot of the joy out of it for vacating there for her\nAnd so you have to think about that yeah that's a price you pay the rent it out\nDid they were going to talk with Down syndrome Alabama see collie welcome to the point Alabama banking Angie it's great to be here today\nWell first of all we want to talk about a little bit more I gave a brief synopsis of Down syndrome that if you could define Down syndrome for us Down syndrome begins at conception it happens in all races and it happens swimming all ages but it is on the twenty first\nChromosomes that there are three markers instead of two so anti you and I have forty six chromosomes and a person with Down syndrome has forty seven so they have something extra\nAnd would that something extra water some of the health issues or cognitive issues that someone with Down syndrome would experience\nIt changes how child develops both physically and mentally and so with help from early intervention I'm great health care I'm with a inclusion in schools as well as in the community and employment people with Down syndrome are selling\nAnd let's talk about that community let's start out with kids who are young who have Down syndrome are you finding that I find so often that we're looking at social media more and more nowadays of course many of us constantly we get our news from that we gain all kinds of information especially entertainment from that\nAnd I do find that we often see\nSeveral instances that one might not have seen when I was younger in school\nWhen I was younger in school with a child had a developmental disability they usually were stuck in a classroom with other kids who were like them doing their own little projects and their own little world and us so called normal kids were doing our thing\nBut nowadays you're seeing wonderful moments like for example football games where a child with a developmental disability is cheered not only by his own teammates but those from the other team while he or she runs the football to make the touchdown it it's extremely touching and extremely moving and I'm I'm just wondering\nAre you finding that the younger people that you work with those in in school um that the attitudes\nAre changing especially now that we have new laws where the kids are mixing with other kids you know they're being just like everybody else young people are more accepting of kids that might be a little different\nIt has improved a lot like I went to high school with twelve hundred people in my graduating class of knowing how to disability because of exclusion or segregation um thankfully our our government laws and our educational um policies have\nWrought inclusion um two people with disabilities and specifically Down syndrome am in our case more accepted yes but they're still so much more room for improvement\nThe magic happens when you're in a classroom with children who are students some with a disability someone out of his disability but their first scene as child\nAs student an ass friend\nAnd that's where inclusion really happens we have all these exciting things happening like you know the Gerber babies has Down syndrome um we had Jake proud who ran the great football was went viral um we have people who are having um clothing lines and have spoken before\nA United Nations or that those are all wonderful things\nThe important part is to see that every person even those who are non verbal or have their disability is um\n[noise] more um maybe prejudice against 'em and so if you think you'd you see somebody who has who can't speak you think that they don't know very much\nPresume competence instead of this ability and so we we try to focus on the word ability and we really focus on the were competence and my favorite word is limitless\nFor those in classrooms are with kids who are special who have special needs who are are limitless how is it best for a parent to teach their child about someone who may look a little bit different may react\nTo things a little bit differently what are some good points that parents can convey to their children in order for everyone to feel included in class look\nFirst so be aware be aware that this person's there that there are a person and that they're in your community your classroom you're workplace your neighborhood\nThe second part is to accept and so that is sometimes means asking questions and not being afraid to ask questions it's like why does he talk differently um why does he have hearing aids why does she um have\nTo have an eight in my classroom why does she go to a different baseball team than I Do um can't she come on my baseball team well of course she could you know so that I think questions are great and to encourage parents to see what's more alike\nThan what's different and so and asking questions is really good staring or shining or um ... is not good asking questions learning more is great and that's what we call advocacy let's talk a little bit about\nOlder kids the those who are well I guess I always call when kids 'cause I'm of a certain age and they're going to say what [laughter]\nBut do those those kids who are getting out of high school and would like to go on to college we've seen numerous programs uh first thing that comes to mind University of Alabama has a summer internship program\nA word that the kids with developmental disabilities can come to the campus they can live the campus lifestyle in the dormitory\nDidn't take part in classes and then possibly a move on to a job so I'd love to talk a little bit more about what is available for those who are say Eighteen and over who are dealing with Down syndrome\nWe're really excited about what is happening more preparation needs to be made in school ages from fourth and fifth grade up through both through parents have been fined students interests and activities and their talents\nUm because if you feed those interests and activities and talents um that starts identifying what a person with a disability might like to do post high school and then our transitional services in high school again\nLooking at not generalization but specific identification of what this person um we'd like to do 'cause nobody wants to do a job\nThat's just kind of just given to them but doesn't meet their talents or their interests on that they want to do so because that's happening there their students are more prepared for both volunteerism\nThey're prepared for um jobs they're put prepared for more secondary um post high school secondary um education opportunities so over and has a new program Clemson has a program Alabama has program you would be has a program Jacksonville state has program there's many many more looking into having those programs\nThey are really expensive 'cause they're not covered under any kind of on government supplemental um\nWell for for um tuition the way our a child without a disability um tuition will be covered so there are things like the enable act allow parents to save for those programs and\nWe were looking at secondary progress but also looking at entrepreneur is and there's a lot of entrepreneurs out there with 'em Down syndrome who have come up with really creative ways to uh have their interests and their abilities and their towns use both for their income on but also for the community\nToday we're talking with sue tally she's with Down syndrome Alabama and we're talking about those with Down syndrome and the many things that are available for them as far as programs go and what we're seeing with those with Down syndrome that they are more capable than not\nUm I'd love to talk about ... workforce inclusion we were talking about some of the programs just a moment ago in colleges were gets with Down syndrome are learning more and able to get out into the working world and we are finding more businesses are hiring those with Down syndrome or sue what can an employer expect from someone with Down syndrome as far as work ethic\nThey are dedicated they're loyal I Know people who wake up in the morning one woman and is especially it's like she knows her schedule she has everything organized she wants to go to work she will give up or many other opportunities to go to work and I would I mean ask any employer who would not want an employee like that\nUm they want to be there they're friendly to the other um their co workers and it makes work really meaningful and I think there's some um employers out there\nWho are beginning to share their stories unemployed people with disabilities and Down syndrome and what a remarkable experience it is\nIt's great for the person with Down syndrome or a cognitive disability but it's also great for the workers and for the employers and the customers\nSo it's it's a win win for all and so and the only thing is is we need more money more opportunities we need more employers and not to discount volunteerism too there's so many volunteer opportunities that people with dancing\nOr I'm a disability could do at my local public for example I have a couple of kids I'm there with downs that are working there and they are the best\nAt their smile brightened my day and you know that's what it's all about you know I'm looking for good customer service and I get that I'd like to move on now and talk about some October events are we just celebrated Down syndrome Alabama awareness day\nOn October the first we got step up for Down syndrome walk\nSunday October seventh so some of you may be listening on friday some of you may be listening on Saturday to our viewpoint Alabama and some are listening on the seventh day of the event tell them all about it to\nOur walk used to be called the buddy walk but at one point we wanted to really describe what our mission was and that is that we're calling all people to step up for individuals with Down syndrome to celebrate them their lives to be inclusive in our communities and also to to see their abilities\nBut also to say what we can offer and programming so we start with pre birth so we we meet with parents who are carrying a child
