says that it cost fifty three cents a mile last time I checked to send a vehicle to your home just in gas and wear and tear\nAfter that there is the technicians wages the chemicals and check the ordinary cost of doing business so we're talking about a loss on this first appointment coming out and doing it for free okay\nWhy would we do that well here's what we get out of the deal\nWe federals I Can't tell you how many times it's happened were customers have become huge cheerleaders even before we're done\nThe running around telling their neighbors making calls to family members and saying you've got to try these guys out that enthusiasm is why the average radio customer provides us with three to seven referrals folks'\nBusiness people out there what's referral or a new customer worth to you\nIf your furnace or your air conditioner goes out and you call a friend or relative and you say hey I got this furniture air conditioner problem who do you use your air conditioner and they say you got a call freedom heating and cooling they did the best maintenance we had ever had\nAt that point are you going to go play Google roulette of course not you're going to take the advice of your friend or your neighbor or your church buddy or your relatives because the company they're recommending served them well\nThat's the power of doing things right for people that's the power of doing a good job customers seeing it appreciating it and then spreading the good worried about your business\nNow look I'm going to get this two hundred and fifty two dollar total system rejuvenation away for

right now but you can get on the line\nBe the very first person to go to clean my AC dot com fill up the radio discount requests form click submit and will reserve one of these just for you but you got to be the first person okay that's clean my AC dot com\nNow here's the deal folks here's what you're going to experience when I send one of these guys out first off he's going to park his truck in the street\nNow while our fleet is meticulously maintained this is just a precautionary measure that's going to keep future leaks where they belong away from your driveway okay\nWhen he comes up to your front door he's going to knock on the front door and when you invite him and he's going to reach down and put on the floor savers or shoot covers over his shoes or boots\nThat's because we're going to be working with some water and stuff cleaning your outdoor air conditioning unit or heat pump and it does tend to get a little murky okay\nHe's going to start his own voice and then he's going to ask you to see the thermostat he's going to ask if he can quickly click it on and when he does he's going to make sure that the system is actually working\nAfter returns it on he'll then ask you to show him to the outdoor air conditioning unit and then the indoor heating unit and once he's seen those he'll go get to work\nNow his very first task is to remove the top off of the outdoor air conditioning system after that he's going to get the leaves and sticks and mark and debris out of the bottom of the system because all of that stuff holds water when it rains\nIt's going to rush the bottom of your system out prematurely okay so we're going to get all of that junk out of there\nThat alone is going to extend the life of your outdoor unit the next step in my opinion is the best okay we're going to use a semi high pressure nozzle to spray down your out door coils from the inside out\nNow that's going to force all the leaves and grass clippings in dust and whatnot that has been sucked into it over the last six months back out of the coils\nIt's almost like lifting a sweater off of your air conditioning system now imagine you are I listeners jogging on a hot summer's day with a sweater on and is drawn your mouth your body can't release the heat right so you get really really hot\nI Hope the same thing happens to your outdoor air conditioning unit and your indoor unit if it's dirty it's going to overheat you're going to have a compressor failure you're going to have motors fail sometimes we even have to use the booming cleanser to get all that stuff out\nYou're looking at a good forty five minutes just up to this point so can you see now why I say that the other maintenance as our drive by maintenance as if they're there and gone in forty five minutes\nNext we're going to test all the electrical components in your system to make sure that you're not getting ready to have any electrical failures or electrical fires\nYou might have a pending compressor failure because you've got this little starter that's about to go bad you might have a pending motor failure because you've got to filter that's all plugged up and you're not paying attention to it All right so\nWe're gonna check all of those little miniscule components that don't cost that much at all to repair or replace\nNext we're going to check your indoor heating system or your furnace\nWe'll check the burners your pressure switches make sure that the exhaust is venting properly all of your hoses your drains a flame sensor even run a little own test they call it on your ignite or because if that little baby goes bad\nIt's gonna get cold in your house in a hurry\nMost importantly we're going to check the heat exchange or that's the part that is known to crack and to leak carbon monoxide\nHere it is do you have your telephone I'm going to go slow for those people who don't\nTo zero five\nSeven to five six zero one one seven to five\nSix zero one one seven to five

minutes or so and I'm going to help you save money on the greatest consumer of gas and electricity in your house this is your home for tips and advice on how to keep your furnace and air conditioner or eat bump\nRunning like a top and the show was brought to you by freedom\nHeating and cooling\nAll right let's talk about your indoor blower wheel the squirrels cage the hamster wheel the blower we'll whatever you want to call it that's the part that's responsible for pushing the warm or cold air out of the vents in your home\nNow all the year in your home from floor to ceiling from one into your house or the other it goes through your furnace and air conditioning system over one hundred times a day\nAnd because most people don't have really good filtration systems those blower wheels they tend to get a little bit of build up on them and a lot of times we see a good eighth of an inch of build up on them\nThat's about as thick as two quarters stacked right on top of one another\nThat when that happens your system just can't move the appropriate amount of air\nNow just one thirty second of an inch will reduce your air speed by ... percent if that blow and we'll get kinda nasty if it gets just a little bit of build up on it\nThat will show the whole life right out of your heating and cooling system and if you're lucky you'll be forced to spend twenty five hundred dollars on a new heat exchange or or compressor\nIf you're not so lucky you could never wake up again\nDid you know that cracked heat exchanges leak carbon monoxide into your ear stream\nDid you noted according to the CDC someone dies from carbon monoxide poisoning every day in the United states\nDid you know that over fifty percent of the people that survive a one time carbon monoxide poisoning event will suffer long term side effects for the rest of their lives heart problems\nNeurological problems nervous system damage mental illness personality and behavioral changes loss of muscle function and loss of bladder control I mean\nThe list is truly scary\nWhat if that was you are one of your family members\nYou probably didn't realize that you're blow her for you and your furniture air conditioner getting dirty could kill you did you\nSay look if that blower wheels dirty my technicians will pull it out and they'll show it to you and they'll say look we've got to get this cleaned up and taken all apart and that's above and beyond what you'd normally do\nIn a total system rejuvenation that's restoration work but when we get it put back together\nYou can get more air flow it's going to ... better you're going to have cleaner fresher air you're gonna have a lower energy bills I mean that's what it's all about folks\nHey you want another reason to get your heating and air conditioning system tuned up\nHave you ever heard of Louisiana State university\nWell they did a study that compared electrical usage of a dirty heating and air conditioning system\nTo clean heating and air conditioning equipment and what they found was that the average customer with a clean system just one system in their house clean one saved thirty two dollars and Seventy cents a month on their energy bills\nThirty two dollars and Seventy cents a month\nThat serious no look and about one or two minutes I'm going to open up these phone lines and if you couldn't get through when I give you the telephone number I'm going to do your entire system both the heating and cooling side not for the two hundred and fifty two dollars we normally charge\nBut for free that's right F.
