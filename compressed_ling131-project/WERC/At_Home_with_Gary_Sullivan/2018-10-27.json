I don't know how ... oh he scans to stay in school\nThat was the light pink and the other thing was and you got your product there you go and then there's a Taylor's perfection that was out there that had a real pretty um light pink bloom on it and then there's a lot of other ones that are have bugs on and so it's not going to be long lot of these things are just going to be exploding\nWhile the Army Corps areas are in full bloom right now from one end of the other so uh I don't\nThink those things have stopped blooming this year it doesn't seem like it at least\nIt's it's weird curious because you know we we they go out and they come and go out and they come in and their own different time schedules and then you know the ones that are already at the garden center so it\nIt seems like you know a variety of blaming all the time a lot of cases that are coming out of south Alabama and stuff like that so there on the little bit different time schedule than the ones that we have at the garden center all the time\nAnd are working in and out so like I might have\nYou know seven or eight royalty out there that don't have a blame on them then I might have six that are just vote in full bloom you know so they're on a little different time scheduled to get acclimated and then they all blame you know\nIt I'm go but a kind of neat how how you know the weather um and the climate\nWhether these plants are kind of dictates where it said that it's just like if you leave from here and you go to Chattanooga you probably already see some fall color where here it's very

rated votes or something that is I don't know either go vote folks are um world travel dot com\nRudy ah where where do you want to start with withdrawal as\nWell um I have some advice for Disneyland it's enough to step aside because plans are underway to build a theme park near Columbus ohio not far from Cincinnati\nOr it's going to be four times the size of the Disney park in Southern California I mean I Can't comprehend that he'll be planted a wasted so Ohio planet oasis Ohio do those two billion dollars and the parks president says it's located in Ohio because it's the quote unquote center of the universe\nNow listen I was born in Cleveland didn't spend a lot on there but I graduated from Ohio University but even I Would be hard to argue the Columbus is Columbus is the center of Ohio will give you that\nBut I'm not sure Ohio is the center of the world let alone the universe enemy ground has broken this week parts of the park it'd be open as early as a year from now four times the size of December\nI maintain imagine the none of them do the job in Disneyland I have taken that landed on\nWell I went out here in the New York area I think I think is next year it might be early twenty twenty I I have to verify that but they're building a huge lego land about sixty miles north of New York city in Goshen New York which is an area that I was raised in a\nSo that's got a lot of theme parks moving into the northern part of the country interesting versus the warm weather parts\nOf the of course kosher and that was centered universe rubber well know Columbus ohio it and I just

leader actually ah in this movement this week Delta Airlines joined the mission to eliminate single use plastic such as stores rappers utensils straws on board the aircraft as well as in all of their delta sky clubs\nAnd what struck me was purportedly their efforts are expected to eliminate nearly three hundred thousand pounds in plastic waste annually and ... you know that's tough to get around that number right 'cause what does it mean well to give you a visual on it uh it translates into the weight of more than two bowling seven fifty seven aircraft\n[noise] wow well good for delta
