I Can't tell you how many times it's happened were customers have become huge cheerleaders even before we're done\nThere running around telling their neighbors making calls to family members and say

you got to be the first person okay that's clean my AC dot com\nNow here's the deal folks here's what you're going to experience when I send one of these guys out first off\nHe's going to park his truck in the street now while our fleet is meticulously maintained this is just a precautionary measure that's going to keep future leaks where they belong away from your driveway okay\nWhen he comes up to your front door he's going to knock on the front door and when you invite him and he's going to reach down and put on the floor savers or shoot covers over his shoes or booths\nThat's because we're going to be working with some water and stuff cleaning your outdoor air conditioning unit or heat pump and it does tend to get a little muggy okay\nHe's going to start his own voice and then he's going to ask you to see the thermostat he's going to ask if he can quickly click it on and when he does he's going to make sure that the system is actually working\nAfter returns it on he'll then ask you to show him to the outdoor air conditioning unit and then the indoor heating unit and once he's seen those he'll go get to work\nNow his very first task is to remove the top off of the outdoor air conditioning system after that he's going to get the leaves and sticks and mark and debris out of the bottom of the system because all of that stuff holds water when it rains\nIt's going to rush the bottom of your system out prematurely okay so we're going to get all of that junk out of there\nThat alone is going to extend the life of your outdoor unit\nThe next step in my opinion is the best okay we're going to use a semi high pressure nozzle to spray down your out door coils from the inside out\nNow that's going to force all the leaves and grass clippings in dust and whatnot there's been sucked into it over the last six months back out of the coils it's almost like lifting a sweater\nOff of your air conditioning system\nNow imagine you were I listeners jogging on a hot summer's day with a sweater on and is drawn your house\nYour body can't release the heat right so you get really really hot I Hope the same thing happens to your outdoor air conditioning unit and your indoor unit if it's dirty it's going to overheat you're going to have a compressor failure you're going to have motors fail\nSometimes we even have to use the booming cleanser to get all that stuff out you're looking at a good forty five minutes just up to this point so can you see now why I say that the other maintenance as our drive by maintenance as if they're there and gone and forty five minutes\nNext we're going to test all the electrical components in your system to make sure that you're not getting ready to have any electrical failures or electrical fires\nYou might have a pending compressor failure because you've got this little starter that's about to go bad\nYou might have a pending motor failure because you've got to filter that's all plugged up and you're not paying attention to it All right so we're gonna check all of those little miniscule components that don't cost that much at all to repair or replace next\nWe're going to check your indoor heating system or your furnace we'll check the burners your pressures which is make sure that the exhaust is venting properly\nAll of your hoses your drains a flame sensor even run a little own test they call it on your ignite or because if that little baby goes bad it's going to get cold in your house in a hurry\nMost importantly we're going to check the heat exchange or that's the part that is known to crack and to leak carbon monoxide\nLook we all know that carbon monoxide can kill you write but did you know that a majority of the people that survive a one time carbon monoxide poisoning event have life long side effects\nSeven twenty five\nSix zero one one Seventy five six zero one one that should do it\nThere if you weren't fast enough or you couldn't get through on the telephones I've got one of those on

next twenty five minutes or so and I'm going to help you\nSave money on the greatest consumer of gas and electricity in your house this is your home for tips and advice on how to keep your furnace and air conditioner or eat bump running like a top and the show was brought to you by freedom heating and cooling\nAll right let's talk about your indoor blower wheel the squirrels cage the hamster wheel the blower we'll whatever you want to call it that's the part that's responsible for pushing the warm or cold air out of the vents in your home\nNow all the year in your home from floor to ceiling from one into your house to the other it goes through your furnace and air conditioning system over one hundred times a day\nAnd because most people don't have really good filtration systems those blower wheels they tend to get a little bit of build up on them and a lot of times we see a good eighth of an inch of build up on them\nThat's about as thick as two quarters stacked right on top of one another\nThat when that happens your system just can't move the appropriate amount of air\nNow just one thirty second of an inch will reduce your air speed by twenty percent if that blower we'll get kinda nasty if it gets just a little bit of built upon it\nThat will show the whole life right out of your heating and cooling system and if you're lucky you'll be forced to spend twenty five hundred dollars on a new heat exchange or or compress are if you're not so lucky you could never wake up again\nDid you know that cracked heat exchange yours leak carbon monoxide into your ear stream did you know that according to the CDC someone dies from carbon monoxide poisoning every day in the United states\nDid you know that over fifty percent of the people that survive a one time carbon monoxide poisoning event will suffer long term side effects for the rest of their lives\nHeart problems neurological problems nervous system damage mental illness personality and behavioral changes loss of muscle function and loss of bladder control I mean the list is truly scary\nWhat is that what you are one of your family members\nYou probably didn't realize that you're blow her for you and your furniture air conditioner getting dirty could kill you did you\nSay look if that blower wheels dirty my technicians will pull it out and they'll show it to you and they'll say look we've got to get this cleaned up and taken all apart and that's above and beyond what you'd normally do in a total system rejuvenation that's restoration work\nBut when we get it put back together you're kind of get more air flow it's going to ... better you're going to have cleaner fresher air you're gonna have a lower energy bills I mean that's what it's all about folks\nHey you want another reason to get your heating and air conditioning system tuned up\nHave you ever heard of Louisiana State university\nWell they did a study that compared electrical usage of a dirty heating and air conditioning system to clean heating and air conditioning equipment and what they found was that the average customer with a clean system just once\nIt's dumb in their house clean one saved thirty two dollars and Seventy cents a month on their energy bills\nThirty two dollars and Seventy cents a month that serious\nNo look and about one or two minutes I'm going to open up these phone lines and if you can get through when I give you the telephone number I'm going to do your entire system both the heating and cooling side not for the two hundred and fifty two dollars we normally charge\nBut for free that's
