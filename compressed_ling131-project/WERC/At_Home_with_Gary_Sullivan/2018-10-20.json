polls and catch votes and as we move right along Mary where do you want to start off with some travelling\nAll right well I think it's always a good thing when large companies get back to various philanthropic projects and on that note carnival corporation announced a series of community projects that will support children education at emergency preparedness in the Caribbean carnival of course has a huge cuisine presents and it is the world's most popular area for Cruz vacations\nSeveral of the carnival brands have been working with both local and international non government organizations including UNICEF and United Way in Miami Dade and Puerto Rico\nAnd they are partnering with several of the island's hit\nThe hardest and the twenty Seventeen hurricane season and some of the projects include rebuilding damaged schools and bringing back children's playgrounds yeah I could tell you that at\nLeast they're putting a they're putting their money back out there in the communities that are participating in a nobody likes to talk a lot about super and this week they receive proposals from Wall street banks valuing the ride hailing company around a hundred and twenty billion\nAs they prepare for their appeal and early twenty Nineteen\nThat valuation Mary ... bigger than General Motors Ford and Chrysler combined to no avail but what also grab my attention they're competitor Lyft is launching monthly subscription service\nAvailable across its user networking which users pay a flat fee of two hundred and Ninety nine dollars they'll get thirty riots per month essentially lift subscribers I can take up to thirty rides at a value of up to Fifteen dollars\nBut if they go over that number they're going to pay some more uh over that thirty minute window I and then an additional rise beyond the thirty will come out of five percent discount interesting\nI write well Jet Blue is in the news this week by the end of twenty Twenty one\nJet Blue said that it will retrofit a hundred and thirty eight Airbus a three twenty aircraft with vortex generators what's a vortex generator well apparently it reduces noise on landings and believe it or not the entire retrofit will cost less than one million dollars\nSo that's a good thing since twenty Fifteen Jet Blue has been taking new deliveries if Airbus ... and a three twenty once with for tax generators\nAll right so now we know we all know what a vortex jak now what that is now too quick item landing too quick items from a a an United Airlines first this week they boosted their profit outlook for the year as the U.S economy continues to home right along\nA and they're seeing big jumps and passenger traffic at the Chicago Denver and Houston hubs plus more business travelers are paying higher fees for those premiums seats\nBut they also make clear flyers who buy their cheap basic economy fares on United that they're going to continue to pay the carry on their backs despite moves by American delta who have relax their policy and then this last one from Mary Elizabeth I applaud for its honesty but perhaps not for a liability\nDid you see this week that Nebraska tourism debuted new tagline for its new tourism campaign that says Nebraska honestly it's not for everyone [laughter]\nI mean I'm not making the same I say there's obviously you know they're attracting outdoor enthusiast to the state as they have so much natural beauty there and their new slogan is going to replace the one that dates back to twenty Fifteen the brass can nice\nBut we really need to watch this because the purpose of the tourism department and they don't need me to tell them this but maybe they do if the cast is why didn't that as possible and attract as many visitors as possible so I'm not real sure about the success of Nebraska honestly it's not for everyone\nWill Nebraska nice it's how well when was the Nebraska the fifteenth so that clearly that wasn't working if that's the only three years old and they're ... they're getting All right I see well you know they have that ... the honesty\nWill say our thoughts before we pause for a brief sponsor break and get ready for really shrine and Christine cars to or
