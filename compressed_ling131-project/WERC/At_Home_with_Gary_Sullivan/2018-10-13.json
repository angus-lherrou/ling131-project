think that this has given us a perspective outside of our country that we could never have gotten otherwise look back at America and in a different way but it's also um for those out there that think they might want to do this spending twenty four hours a day with your spouse or their parents are managed\nTo add\nTo that is actually my question for you a perfect segue Robert and I are obviously

because I think that's different than what it does for you individually\nI I totally agree and we're celebrating our fortieth anniversary on Sunday ...\nThank you thank you we've been kind of focusing on our on our marriage you know I think that I've learned so much about personal dynamics and just the fact that we are so flexible with each other now which makes a difference in my car and talks
