doing business so we're talking about a loss of his first appointment coming out and doing it for free okay\nWhy would we do that well here's what we get out of the deal\nWe federals I Can't tell you how many times it's happened where customers have become huge cheerleaders even before we're done the running around telling their neighbors making calls to family members and say you've got to try these guys out\nThat enthusiasm\nIs why the average radio customer provides us with three to seven referrals folks'\nBusiness people out there what's referral or a new customer worst too you\nKnow if your furnace or your air conditioner goes out and you call a friend or relative and you say hey I got this furniture air conditioner problem who do you use your air conditioner and they say you got a

you got to be the first person okay that's clean my AC\nDot com\nNow here's the deal folks here's what you're going to experience when I send one of these guys out\nFirst off he's going to park his truck in the street now while our fleet is meticulously maintained this is just a precautionary measure that's going to keep you drew leaks where they belong away from your driveway okay\nWhen he comes up to your front door he's going to knock on the front door and when you invite him and he's going to reach down and put on the floor savers or shoot covers over his shoes or booths\nThat's because we're going to be working with some water and stuff cleaning your outdoor air conditioning unit or heat pump and it does tend to get a little murky okay\nHe's going to start his own voice and then he's going to ask you to see the thermostat he's going to ask if he can quickly click it on and when he does he's going to make sure that the system is actually working\nAfter he turns it on he'll then ask you to show him to the outdoor air conditioning unit and then the indoor heating unit and once he's seen those he'll go get to work\nNow his very first task is to remove the top off of the outdoor air conditioning system after that he's going to get the leaves and sticks and mark and debris out of the bottom of the system because all of that stuff holds water when it rains\nIt's going to rush the bottom of your system out prematurely okay so we're going to get all of that junk out of there\nThat alone is going to extend the life of your outdoor unit\nThe next step in my opinion is the best okay we're going to use a semi high pressure nozzle to spray down your out door coils from the inside out\nNow that's going to force all the leaves and grass clippings and dust and whatnot that has been sucked into it over the last six months back out of the coils it's almost like lifting a sweater\nOff of your air conditioning system\nNow imagine you are I listeners jogging on a hot summer's day with a sweater on industry on your house\nYour body can't release the heat right so you get really really hot\nWell the same thing happens to your outdoor air conditioning unit and your indoor unit if it's dirty it's going to overheat you're going to have a compressor failure you're going to have motors fail sometimes we even have to use the booming cleanser to get all that stuff out\nYou're looking at a good forty five minutes just up to this point so can you see now why I say that the other maintenance is our drive by maintenance as if they're there and gone in forty five minutes\nNext we're going to test all the electrical components in your system to make sure that you're not getting ready to have any electrical failures or electrical fires\nYou might have a pending compressor failure because you've got this little starter that's about to go bad you might have a pending motor failure because you've got to filter that's all plugged up and you're not paying attention to it All right so\nWe're gonna check all of those little miniscule components that don't cost that much at all to repair or replace\nNext we're going to check your indoor heating system or your furnace we'll check the burners your pressures which is make sure that the exhaust is venting properly\nAll of your hoses your drains a flame sensor even run a little own test they call it on your ignite or because if that little baby goes bad it's going to get cold\nYour house in a hurry most importantly\nWe're going to check the heat exchange or that's the part that is known to crack into leak carbon monoxide\nLike the company you'd like cleaning up your ... in the air conditioner or heat pump get in on the best offer we have right now we only do this on the radio so grab your phone and dial quickly remember they go fast are you ready\nHere it is do you have your telephone I'm going to go slow for those people who don't\nTo zero five\nSeven to five or six zero one one

your host over for the next twenty five minutes or so and I'm going to help you save money on the greatest consumer of gas and electricity in your house this is your home for tips and advice on how to keep your furnace and air conditioner or eat bump\nRunning like a top and the show was brought to you by freedom heating and cooling\nAll right let's talk about your indoor blower wheel the squirrels cage by hamster wheel the blower we'll whatever you want to call it that's the part that's responsible for pushing the warm or cold air out of the vents in your home\nNow all the year in your home from floor to ceiling from one into your house or the other it goes through your furnace and air conditioning system over one hundred times a day\nAnd because most people don't have really good filtration systems those blower wheels they tend to get a little bit of build up on them and a lot of times we see a good eighth of an inch of build up on them\nThat's about as thick as two quarters stacked right on top of one another now when that happens your system just can't move the appropriate amount they're\nNow just one thirty second of an inch will reduce your air speed by ... percent if that blower wheel gets kinda nasty if it gets just a little bit of build upon it\nThat will show the whole life right out of your heating and cooling system and if you're lucky you'll be forced to spend twenty five hundred dollars on a new heat exchange or or compress or\nIf you're not so lucky you\nCould never wake up again did you know that cracked heat exchange yours leak carbon monoxide into your ear stream\nDid you know that according to the CDC someone dies from carbon monoxide poisoning every day in the United states did you know that over fifty percent of the people that survive a one time carbon monoxide poisoning event will suffer long term side effects for the rest of their lives\nHeart problems there were a logical problems nervous system damage mental illness personality and behavioral changes loss of muscle function and loss of bladder control I mean the list is truly scary\nWonder if that was you are one of your family members you probably didn't realize that your book for you and your furniture air conditioner getting dirty could kill you did you\nLook if that blower we'll dirty my technicians will pull it out and they'll show it to you and they'll say look we've got to get this cleaned up and taken all apart and that's above and beyond what you'd normally do in a total system rejuvenation\nThat's restoration work but when we get it put back together you're kind of get more air flow it's going to ... Mel better you're going to have cleaner fresher air you're gonna have a lower energy bills I mean that's what it's all about folks\nHey you want another reason to get your eating an air conditioning system tuned up have you ever heard of Louisiana State university\nWell they did a study that compared electrical usage of a dirty heating and air conditioning system\nTo clean heating and air conditioning equipment and what they found was that the average customer with a clean system just one system in their house a clean one saved thirty two dollars and Seventy cents a month on their energy bills thirty\nTwo dollars and Seventy cents a month that's serious\nNo look and about one or two minutes I'm going to open up these phone lines and if you can get through when I give you the telephone number\nGoing to do your entire system both the heating and cooling side not for the two hundred and fifty two dollars we normally charge\nBut for free that's right F.
