R. E. E. free\nNow I only do this on the radio and I'll tell you why because I Can't send a minimum wage worker to your house for free and make any money at all\nFrankly the U.S government the IRS says that it costs fifty three cents a mile last time I checked to send a vehicle to your home just in gas and wear and tear\nAfter that there's the technicians wages the chemicals and pack the ordinary cost of doing business so we're talking about a loss of his first appointment coming out and doing it for free okay\nWhy would we do that\nWell here's what we get out of the\nDeal ... federals I Can't tell you how many times it's happened were customers have become huge cheerleaders even before we're done the running around telling their neighbors making calls to family members and say you've got to try these guys out\nThat enthusiasm\nIs why the average radio customer provides us with three to seven referrals folks'\nBusiness people out there what's referral or a new customer worth to you\nIf your furnace or your air conditioner goes out and you call a friend or relative and you say hey I've got this burners are air conditioner problem who do you use your air conditioner and they say you got a call freedom heating and cooling they did the best maintenance we had ever had\nAt that point or you can go play Google roulette\nOf course not you're going to take the advice of your friend or your neighbor or your church buddy or your relatives because the company they're recommending served them well\nThat's the power of doing things right for people that's the power of doing a good job customers seeing appreciating it and then spreading the good worried about your business\nNow look I'm going to get this two hundred and fifty two dollar total system rejuvenation away for free right now to the first five callers freedom heating and cooling is going to pay for it all we ask is that if we do a good job for you\nThat you considered becoming a regular client and you tell other\nPeople about us that's fair right\nOkay you have to be one of the first five dollars so grab your telephone so that you can get the number and I'm going to give the first five away right now the next five callers are going to get this to not for free\nHere the numbers are you ready dial quickly because they go fast\nReady to zero five seven to five six zero one one seven to five six zero one one seven to five six zero one one that's two zero five\nSeven to five six zero one one we've got our first one nope two callers at two o five\nSeven to five six zero one one three left now at two zero five Seventy five six zero one one Seventy five six zero one one seven to five six zero one one one left last one get it to five\nSeven to five six zero one one\nLook if you can't get to a phone right now but you can get on the line\nBe the very first person to go to clean my AC dot com fill up the radio discount requests form click submit and will reserve one of these just for you but you got to be the first person okay that's clean my AC dot com\nNow here's the deal folks here's what you're going to experience when I send one of these guys out\nFirst off he's going to park his truck in the street\nNow while our fleet is meticulously maintained this is just ate precautionary measure that's going to keep future leaks where they belong away from your driveway okay\nWhen he comes up to your front door he's going to knock on the front door and when you invite him and he's going to reach down and put on floor savers or shoot covers over his shoes or boots\nThat's because we're going to be working with some water and stuff cleaning your outdoor air conditioning unit or heat pump and it does tend to get a little murky okay\nHe's going to start his own voice and then he's going to ask you to see the thermostat he's going to ask if he can quickly click it on and when he does he's going to make sure that the system is actually working\nAfter he turns it on he'll then ask you to show him to the outdoor air conditioning unit and then the indoor heating unit and once you've seen those he'll go to work\nNow his very first task is to remove the top off of the outdoor air conditioning system after that he's going to get the leaves and sticks and mark and debris out of the bottom of the system because all of that stuff holds water when it rains\nIt's going to rush the bottom of your system out prematurely okay so we're going to get all of that junk out of there\nThat alone is going to extend the life of your outdoor unit\nThe next step in my opinion is the best okay we're going to use a semi high pressure nozzle to spray down your out door coils from the inside out\nNow that's going to force all the leaves and grass clippings in dust and whatnot there's been sucked into it over the last six months back out of the coils it's almost like lifting a sweater\nOff of your air conditioning system now imagine you are I listeners jogging on a hot summer's day with a sweater on industry on your house your body can't release the heat right so you get really really hot\nI Hope the same thing happens to your outdoor air conditioning unit and your indoor unit if it's dirty it's going to overheat you're going to have a compressor failure you're going to have motors fail sometimes we even have to use a booming cleanser to get all that stuff out\nYou're looking at a good forty five minutes just up to this point so can you see now why I say that the other maintenance is our drive by maintenance as if they're there and gone in forty five minutes\nNext we're going to test all the electrical components in your system to make sure that you're not getting ready to have any electrical failures or electrical fires\nYou might have a pending compressor failure because you've got this little starter that's about to go bad\nYou might have a pending motor failure because you've got to filter that's all plugged up and you're not paying attention to it All right so we're gonna check all of those little miniscule components that don't cost that much at all to repair or replace next\nWe're going to check your indoor heating system or your furnace\nWe'll check the burners your pressure switches make sure that the exhaust is venting properly all of your hoses your drains a flame sensor even run a little own test they call it on your ignite or because if that little baby goes bad\nIt's gonna get cold in your house in a hurry\nMost importantly we're going to check the heat exchange or that's the part that is known to crack and to leak carbon monoxide\nLook we all know that carbon monoxide can kill you write but did you know that a majority of the people\nThat survive a one time carbon monoxide poisoning event\nHere it is do you have your telephone I'm going to go slow for those people who don't to zero\nFive seven to five six zero one one seven to five six zero one one seven to five six zero one one one to we've got three left to zero five\nSeven to five six zero on one Seventy five six zero one one seven to five six zero one one one left get it get a quick two oh five\nSeven twenty five six zero one one Seventy five six zero one\nOne that should do it there\nIf you weren't fast enough or you couldn't get through on the telephones I've got one of those on the website to give away\nAt clean my AC dot com go quickly clean my AC dot com you got to be the first person to click submit okay\n\nIf you're just tuning in I'm Jean and I'm your host over for the next twenty five minutes or so and I'm going to help you save money on the greatest consumer of gas and electricity in your house this is your home for tips in advice on how to keep your furnace an air conditioner or eat bump\nRunning like a top and the show was brought to you by freedom heating and cooling\nAll right let's talk about your indoor blower wheel the squirrels cage by hamster wheel the blower we'll whatever you want to call it that's the part that's responsible for pushing the warm or cold air out of the vents in your home\nNow all the air and you're home from floor to ceiling from one into your house or the other it goes through your furnace and air conditioning system over one hundred times a day\nAnd because most people don't have really good filtration systems those blower wheels they tend to get a little bit of build up on them and a lot of times we see a good eighth of an inch of build up on them\nThat's about as thick as two quarters stacked right on top of one another\nNow when that happens your system just can't move the appropriate amount of their\nNow just one thirty second of an inch will reduce your air speed by ... percent if that blower we'll get kinda nasty if it gets just a little bit of build up on it that will show the whole life\nRight out of your heating and cooling system and if you're lucky you'll be forced to spend twenty five hundred dollars on a new heated exchange or\nOr compressor if you're not so lucky you could never wake up again did you know that cracked heat exchanges leak carbon monoxide into your ear stream\nDid you know that according to the CDC someone dies from carbon monoxide poisoning every day in the United states\nDid you know that over fifty percent of the people that survive a one time carbon monoxide poisoning event will suffer long term side effects for the rest of their lives heart problems neurological problems nervous system damage mental illness personality and behavioral changes loss of muscle function\nAnd loss of bladder control I mean the list is truly scary\nWhat if that was you are one of your family members you probably didn't realize that you're blow her for you and your furniture air conditioner getting dirty could kill you did you\nLook if that blower wheels dirty my technicians will pull it out and they'll show it to you and they'll say look we've got to get this cleaned up and taken all apart and that's above and beyond what you'd normally do in a total system rejuvenation that's restoration work\nBut when we get it put back together you're kind of get more air flow it's going to ... better you're going to have cleaner fresher air you're gonna have a lower energy bills I mean that's what it's all about folks\nHey you want another reason to get your heating and air conditioning system to end up\nHave you ever heard of Louisiana State university\nWell they did a study that compared electrical usage of a dirty heating and air conditioning system to clean heating and air conditioning equipment and what they found was that the average customer with a clean system\nJust one system in their house a clean one saved thirty two dollars and Seventy cents a month on their energy bills\nThirty two dollars and Seventy cents a month that's serious\nNo look at about one or two minutes I'm going to open up these phone lines and if you can get through when I give you the telephone number I'm going to do your entire system both the heating and cooling side not\nFor the two hundred and fifty two dollars we normally charge but for free that's right F.
