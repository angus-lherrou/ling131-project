was so close to a to an answer was so close you know it was we could almost see it on the horizon so every year was um [noise] well not this year but next year you know and so on and David waited patiently as well\nAnd so you know\nIt um it didn't happen in the way we had trade and down the rain we had help but\nUm everybody gay that one hundred percent one hundred and twenty percent of effort to try and find the answer for David in the meantime to make David well and and make David home so that he would be normal\nPsychologically physically when he was able to come out of the problem\nIt was such an amazing lives and I'm very proud to share David story in fact the last Fifteen Years Dr Sharon I we were a team um we would be asked of ... different organizations usually medical um organization\nTo speak about David and Dr sheer did it beautiful job of explaining the medical aspects that David allies but David blight and then I Would talk about the human interest cited David slide like his personality like his likes um\nSo you know it was um it gave a whole picture and I'm David and I'm the last time we did that and I think it's about two years ago um\nHe was not well but he struggles you know he he had a lot of courage and a lot of pride in he was very dedicated to to his work very dedicated to making\nLife better for those that suffer from compromised immune systems\nAnd um and the other thing that sticks in my mind and and I like to reflect on these last couple of days was within a few days or David passing even though his heart was breaking and Dr ... at the time in Nineteen eighty four when David patch\nUm he was physician and cheese\nTo honor David memory and continued David legacy they came up with the idea to create they gave it center we're all children born with compromised immune to our faulty immune systems whether genetic or acquired could go be treated\nAnd you know so that No Child would ever have to go into a bubble again and that's exactly what happened\nAnd I'm In the woodland where where I live now I'm at Texas children's hospital there the David clean it which is an extension of the day the center\nAnd the David elementary school raising there's thousands of dollars each year in support of the ... century navigates clinic by a David dream run the community where I live ... father still rich and the same home

his family an honor him and so does Texas children's hospital by creating the David center\nA David doctors share you know just had a very special relationship um\nOne thing and something else that comes to mind I'm David had control over his mother his nurses ... dietitian and she would pretty much tell us what he wanted done and we were just scurry round to do it\nBut not with Dr sheer [laughter] you know doctors year was very for with David lovingly but I'm David knew he couldn't get away with anything with Dr share and I I didn't realize it at the time but\nIn reflecting I just appreciate it that that's exactly the kind of relationship with David ... we eventually you know his\nHis mother and his nurses in his dietitian and everybody else involved into it and drive\nA we eventually realized that where the delta and he's the child and that's how it has to be a but um anyway it down\nYou know it's a ... if I may want to make one correction that movie that you mentioned are going to pass this novel I never considered it David story um we didn't have any knowledge of that movie\nWe didn't consent to it ah and you know the main character was a teenager or young adult David Was you know four or five years old when that movie came out I never considered\nA David story but to a wonderful things happen because of that movie number one it brought status to David disease and it brought awareness and number two\nAnd within a short period of time NASA decided to make his face thanks for David so I think that movie did more good for us harm to a search you David\nI had one um [noise] one request a instructions actually at the hospital that at that ... movie ever came on TV again that David what's not to see it [noise] you know David we control we didn't have remote\nAt the time again you know this is the um early mid seventies\nSo we could control what David watched on TV and control what David bread and um uh so I said I Do it David ever see that movie if it comes on and to my knowledge of they abided by my my request\nSo back to the doctor share um I Know his heart\nBroke when we last David I Know he tried um\nMr mom when you hold just one second yeah\nWill post the rest of this conversation as long as she wants to talk to Michael [noise] [noise]\n\n\n\nCommon especially when you consider software updates helped to override existing

brown live in Miami\nTo do when confronted with abject ignorance like this how do you fight abject ignorance and prejudice and so forth [noise] and you don't you defeat it\nYou don't try to reason with it because it's impossible you defeat it I've got a chart here doesn't go well on the radio but it demonstrates that since Nineteen hundred\nYou can find with all the charted hurricanes since Nineteen hundred you can find no significant trend in either the frequency or the intensity of major hurricanes striking Florida there simply is no evidence\nThat climate change manmade even exist and there's certainly is no evidence that it has anything to do with hurricanes either the number of them are the intensity but that doesn't matter because the New York times and the rest of the dry buys are offered to running cause they are hell bent\n\nOn getting people to Rio and takes it why what is the purpose because this promotes big government it promotes the notion of gigantic autocratic\nTyrannical government control over everything once you are the American citizen are blamed and can be blamed for everything that's wrong then you can be controlled to make sure that you\nStart doing things right and don't keep doing things wrong that's what they want\nThis but in the process they don't even know what they're talking about this guy does know hurricanes from thunder storms\n[noise] he doesn't know cloud tops ... temperatures and it doesn't matter\n\nI Want to thank Mr survey for being so sensitive in so concerned about it but I Wonder was surely you that these kinds of things no longer\n[noise] bother me other than the I I I Do get concerned that there's so much genuine ignorance\nExisting now in positions that influence the thinking of other\nPeople I mean feminist studies at universities I firmly believe\nHas destroyed the futures of way too many women\nIt has just distorted the life it's distorted gender differences it has distorted the concept of happiness victim ... it has distorted the whole concept of America the greatest place to live and grow up and seek opportunity in the world [noise]\nAnd it's to edit feminism is just one of many elements\nOf liberalism that is doing the same thing too it's other constituency groups for example\nLet me ask a generic question we had Eric Holder out there\nWho is campaigning for somebody to be governor of Georgia holders supposedly going to run for president himself and twenty funny or Eric Holder the attorney general for ... same\nAll involved in many scandals himself\nAnd I'm seeing a lot of people on our side and these so called conservative intelligentsia shocked that Eric Holder would say what he said you know the show my bell Obama's out there saying no no my motto is when they go low we go high and holder said screw that when they go low meeting Republicans when they go low we get them\n\nSo peoples of my God these out their inciting violence and he said no no no no I didn't mean it literally I was saying\nThat we can't take it anymore we after Scott being the nice guys and stopped taking it and he didn't mean it\nObama method when he said they bring a knife we bring a gun Obama met at soldiers Maxine Waters when they're both encouraging people to get in our faces they mean it\nThey are already inciting violence they inciting violence inside Capitol Hill buildings and elevators they're engaging in bullying tactics my question is why\nWhy are the Democrats doing all this why are they inciting violence or let's look at the things\nThat they think\nAre supposedly on their side things that are helpful to them we start with the fact that they are convinced that they're going to win control of the house\nIt's already done the blue wave it's just a matter of the day is on the calendar passing by until we get to a ... day where we can confirm that the Democrats already won that remember we had a poet from CNN or some by John King a couple of weeks ago\nHe resigned or the whole indicated the house races or over their poll said the Democrats are likely winners of the house of representatives over in their minds they won the house\nIn their minds they most won the Senate\nThey have the Mueller report and the mother report is going to link Trump to Russia right\nThey know that Mueller's got the goods all they can taste it fall fall because they can scratch their bags with it they just can't is aid and all that Mueller has secretly collected the goods they know that Mueller is going to issue a report and it's going to tie Trump and Russia and it's going to\nProve the trumps stolen the election from Hillary Hillary shouldn't be president that should make them happy right\nWhy all the desperation CNN\nEngaging in full fledged one thousand percent racism and directed at Kanye West\nIt was for sale loving perhaps we want to show off some of our favorite color\nOr at least in the oil or five Seventy overseas then ... then I'll buy 'em of

... if if you [noise] [noise] [noise] I'll be glad to\nTell you what I Know about this and it is it is somewhat there's somewhat fascinates name was ... that the president of the United states involved in this now Trump is being openly asked about it and it has to\nDo in many ways with with our new found relationship with Saudi Arabia based on the fact we no longer depend on them for oil now ... is Saudi\nI don't know if he's related they add ... not common ... is is a as a Saudi or Arab name and then your show he was a famous arms runner made famous as a celebrity by a\n... a lifestyles of the rich and famous but the guy was an arms merchant he was an arms dealer and that the source of his wealth it would just made it look like a jet setting party animal by Robin Leach so whether whether ... related to him and I couldn't even find outages habit Jamal ... is a critic\nOf Mohammed bin selmont ... Mohammed bin some on as the crown prince\nIn Saudi Arabia his father is the kings king sol ...\nHe is the brother of the late deceased king king of double their father grandfather uh started the house of Saud they are the royal family\n[noise] the crown prince the each of these guys have many sons there are constant battle for power with in the royal family the crown prince is the chosen son is the air\nNow Mohammed bin Salman is not the oldest son of king Solomon but he has been designated the crown prince meaning he will be the next ... as such Mohammed bin ... mom has been trying [noise]\nTheoretically to reform the soul of the the Saudi economy and to take it away from being strictly petrol and a oil focused\nBecause the world is expanding in ways that the Saudis are not involved in one of the things that Mohammed bin Salman has been doing has been traveling the world and making friends in the United states you spend a lot of time in Silicon Valley he's gotten to know is wind and dying the Google guys he's winding dined Facebook guys spend a lotta time an apple\nHe wants to build a brand new city out of nothing in Saudi Arabia and make it a tech center he's thirty two\nIf he takes off the Arab garb he looks just like your average run to the middle guy a very attractive short little stocky but he represents\nIf he is being truthful major reforms he is the guy who has opened up driving to Saudi women he\nIs the guy who wants to relax [noise]\nAll kinds of cultural rules on on Saudi women and open up speech to them all but not being able to drive a go places on their own without male a company but this made him quite controversial he also last summer not this past them last night and it was this past summer\nHe arrested the elite of the week up Saudi wealth some of them even among the royal family and took over\nThe Ritz Carlton hotel in Riyadh and that became a giant jail and he put all these guys in jail demanding a certain percentage of their wealth [noise] on the basis they had stolen it\nDo the corruption and connections and soon as he made a lot of enemies well Jamal ... has as a journalist doesn't buy any of this and has been running around openly criticizing Mohammed bin ...\n\nEven running stories suggesting that Mohammed bin ... father the king has grown so upset with his son the crown prince that he's taking toys and power away from it this reportedly has not set well with the crown prince Mohammed bin selmont\nDespite the reforms in Saudi Arabia you still don't get to run around and criticizing the government and keep your head [noise] you don't get to run around and criticize the government and keep your knees\nFor example\n... wanted to get married [noise] he had to get a wedding like a marriage license he was in Turkey\nIn order to do that by the end it before the he had supposedly had been targeted by the crown prince and and others in the Saudi royal family because of his open criticism of these reforms that other things so he goes into the Saudi consulate or embassy in Istanbul\nAnd hasn't been seen since\nYou know frontier airlines had to\nPoint out the people that we do not allow rodents on our airplanes\nAnd a squirrel I Know they look cute but a squirrel is nothing but a tree rats at all it is it a little cute her face as a bushy tail out there it's a tree rats are rodent and frontier airlines doesn't allow them on their airplanes\nAnd people that were just so mean she need tens deployed squirrel\nAnd I just wouldn't it be great if this is one of these they lost her mind in Washington over the cabinet and stuff and then there was this\nHudson Valley New York guy arrested after allegedly planning to blow himself up on the Washington Mall around election day because he's upset about that country's direction\nNow do you think this guy's going to vote for guys obviously going to vote for the nearest democratic and find that this is how they're being inspired and further evidence that the Democrats are not about ideas and not about inspiring people to vote for them because of the great improvements it'll happen in their lives Nancy Pelosi [noise]\nRight here\nNancy Pelosi Trump's tax returns a top priority if Democrats win the house now how is that going to benefit your average Democrat voter\nWell I'll tell you how the Democrats have so poison their voters democratic voters want revenge not a job not raise non a bonus they want room ... hey Trump\nAnd so anything that Democrats can do to harm Trump why the Democrats will vote for who ever will promised to make Trump suffer [noise] you think that's a majority of people you think that's the kind of stuff that creates a blue wave I don't [noise]\nI don't believe that the country is that ... ... but the Democrats are counting on the fact they think it is\nOkay to the phones ban in Fresno Europe first today great to have you with us or hide\nThey rash thanks for having me on Yes sir I\nSo I was there I was in the for the three days of the nonsense last week I saw the the them screaming and yelling and attacking us and and the folks and and so what I felt was\nThis is all they have the reason that they continue the reason that John Lennon saying the nonsense she said on CNN the reason that they just continue with this game plan isn't the only game plan they have\nAnd they're hoping that the American people are dumb enough to still buy it but I Believe that the American people even in California where I'm at the American people are seeing this crap and they're like this is an old game we don't find any more\nAnd and and they have nothing else to play there's nothing else for them to but they just keep doing the same market and the book in our eyes it was like they know they're losing they know that we're not buying it anymore but they've got nothing else to say\nNow that's a whole lot you know that's an interesting point because if they do have the maturity of the presence of mind they do have to realize they're losing Trump one Trump is getting elements of agenda his agenda a pastor implemented\nKavanaugh was confirmed\nEverything they've done to stop Trump\nEverything from the judges to the court's travel but not much has worked and so I think you're right they do realize they're losing\nAnd you think they're in a fit of desperation that they've got nothing else to do that's why they're not proposing any ideas to counter Trump's that's why they're not proposing any new policies to counter Trump's because they don't have any\nAbsolutely they let loose when there are\nThe right lose it when we're silent and they it for so long they've expected us to just shut up and go away it\nWell that that's true too I I think they have become accustomed to Republicans caving and Republican voters will certainly conservative media a well some conservative caving as well I think they've they've gotten accustomed to bullying working the rats lying\nYup threats lying all of that and and and they're hoping that it's going to work together and the only way it works\nIs that we don't go up that's why that's why you see the polling data still showing them winning that's why it showed Hillary was going to win in a landslide because they know that if they can to sway does that they can discouraging us enough to make us not show up that's the only way they win but if Republicans conservative stand up\nWhen every single time we just have to show up we have to convince other people to show up you convince them\nTo convince other people to show up you say you're in Washington for three days what did you actually see what kind of activities where they engage like you saw I was\nI was right in the middle of it I Would live streaming the whole time um I went right up to Linda so sour in and told I look at their out there saying that um they they are out there saying you know believe women and stop or the assault on women and my question to lend it was what Enron do to win it\nWhat is how does how does Islam you're you're out here in ... and\n... and you get no answer because you're not supposed to ask it limits our story is the Palestine

husband and the president are teaming up [noise]\nThey have an objective\nAnd I will explain it when we get back\nI used to the people with Todd pyro\nTaught high really tired of the people here in Erie, Pennsylvania talking to the voters about what they think about the job President Trump is doing\nI think the president's doing an awesome job I Love the guy economies is is that that has been in my lifetime I think I I\nI don't I don't know where the criticism come from\nHis language rhetoric that easy to divide the country\nTone down their rhetoric a little bit but policy all thumbs up doing a good job than an unconventional way\nWell his ability as first thing on my mind so I mean to me it's very obvious with his flip flops on opinions of people some things he says just\nIs out of advocate for being the president of the United states\nUsually presidents I buy them up and he's not the ... some people upset Trump has closed everyone's mind [noise] and I would like to impeach\nHim this has been taught pirate with pie wrote to the people\nHe was radio nine sixty tell you we are ... head on line nine sixty you we are C. dot com\nI harsh radio see he's new [noise]\nThe president's two cents\nOn Wall street how many sobriety Fox News he's been critical of the central bank before President Trump is criticizing the fed again is too aggressive after yesterday's sell off planes mainly on rising interest\nRate I think the fed is for too stringent and they're making a mistake and is that right [noise] ed it's despite that we're doing very well but it's not necessary in my opinion and I think I Know about it better than they do\nHis administration who he does not like echoing remarks from his wife the bully millennia Trump about it doesn't say that but you know they wanted to write it [noise]\nDuring a lion phone interview Thursday morning with facts and friends the president said it was more true in the past when he was first setting himself up and washing them that he just trust and members of his team\nHe cited Nikki Haley who announced her resignation as weak as an example of the great people who now feel his administration he said he's going to do away with people who doesn't like are there are so am I Am not in love with yes we're going to weed them out slowly well she said that ... that this is not coincidence\n[noise] this is not happenstance so ... and Trump both are putting staff in the west wing on notice\n[noise] [noise] [noise]\nAh Trump also said we'll get to it we'll get to and I don't want to jumping up and it's going to the audio soundbite starting with number seven teams sorry\nSorry sorry uh Thirteen [noise]\nThis is Trump calling in to Fox and friends that I was talking to Steve do see a do she said you took some heat yesterday Mr President for going ahead with that rally in Pennsylvania despite the hurricane\nThat really had very little eat other than the natural haters of which there are obviously some we had thousands of people lined up by the time I had to make a decision so my decision was do I want to tell people that were waiting ten and twelve hours are already\nThat I'm not coming and uh I just thought it would be and we're talking about thousands of people you know when they get there that early and who you know that area obviously has not affected by it and we ended up in a great control I don't think really\nThe hot relative to other things I think it was very minor\nSo president essentially saying look these people that are lined up they've expected me to show up I follow through I Do what I say I'm going to do\nThe hurricane was going to do when it dead and there's nothing I could have done about it last night when I was in this rally my people are down there working on it we got it covered [noise]\n[noise] I can do both and I'm following through on the commitment [noise]\n[noise] [noise] [noise] so the next question in from the do somebody who probably is not going to vote\nFor you Eric Holder [noise] former attorney general said they go low we kick them [noise] and the whole room Mr\nPresident started clapping and cheering when he said that what does that say to you about the tenor of politics\nTo be careful what he's wishing for that I can tell you better be careful what he's with us to discuss things safe for them to make you a very dangerous stay put older [noise] what is held in contempt by Congress older when after Christians he went after our\nGreat evangelicals he went after the Tea Party people you know that they just settled the IRS just settle that case a holder is they've got some problems\nNot used to be talking to like this\nIn the old days Eric Holder can say whatever you send them to Republicans ... whimper away or not even acknowledge or are they would say so\nWe are strongest term ... we'd denounce rhetoric go out and buy a attorney general holder or it and it was about ... but much although totally totally uncalled for and we we were kingly unilaterally condemn it\n[noise] [laughter] Trump says [laughter]\nYou better be careful what he's wishing for [laughter] that I can tell you that I get you better be careful\nWhat he's wishing now the stock market's been kinda see song it's been a roller coaster ring\nAnd Trump is suspicious as he can be up and let me just tell you something folks there are a number of wealthy\nDemocrat Wall Street types investors people that run hedge funds who I Am convinced\nI Would [noise] willingly take a bit of a financial hit [noise] to their wealth and businesses are primarily their businesses not their wealth but they would they would David in person pain if it meant [noise]\nLowering economic activity on enough to hurt Trump [noise] I have no doubt that there aren't enough looney tunes on the left who willingly do this [noise]\nI think they're that desperate as a previous caller said and of course [noise]\nIt it flies in the face of the Democrats in the media tried to say when it was a new age ah yeah the economy's doing well but the president's not going to get any credit for that people don't even leave it liberal even look at our polling data people obviously that's not true I think they're terribly worried that\nThis great economy is going to be greatly beneficial not just to ... but the Republicans in the midterms and so there's some monkey and going on with the interest rates is the point it's calling are causing the stock market the roller coaster and here is Trump was as you pointed out to him yesterday was not a good day for investors\nThe Federal Reserve is getting a little bit too cute that so when I took over in this economy this economy was ready to crash we were at one percent GDP now or a four point two percent [noise]\nIt was ready to crash it was the worst if you look from the great depression [laughter] it was the worst recovery and the history of our country and Obama tremendous money at it [laughter]\nForget Obama was playing with zero money so he was playing with funny money he was it was very easy [noise] I'm paying interest at a high rate because of our fed and I'd like are fed not to be so aggressive because I think that making a big mistake\nTranslation he is worried maybe accusing\nThe Federal Reserve of raising interest rates because the economy's going along so well that traditional inside the beltway Washington gets very worried\nWhen the economy's going great [noise] [noise] [noise] my whole life I've noticed this and my whole life I have been perplexed by this I've asked myself why\nAnd let's look at the fed here as the establishment in this story\n[noise] why ...\nIs a great performing em growing economies so for rent name\n[noise] two official Washington and it is because every time the economy starts talking what does the fed and do they leak [noise] they leak\nAre thinking of raising rates in what does that do\nThat kills activity in equities markets [noise]\nIf these people think the feds are going to start raising rates people start selling rather than buying and investing [noise] what Trump is saying that he thinks this is being done purposefully just slow down the economy [noise] at the time and totally unnecessary for it right before the election and he's calling them out [noise]\nHe's caught it's another thing previous Republican presidents would not do he's calling out the fed Mr Limbaugh doesn't drop run to know you may appoint the Federal Reserve chairman but know day to day no way [noise]\n\nAnd the Federal Reserve chairman the odds are that the number of the board of governors are going to be much at\nComic leftists as they are many financial institutions and I've got a pretty strictly crazy about Trump despite how much wealth they are earning the cause of drunk\n[noise] so Trump calling them out on it they said there's no reason to start raising rates right now [noise] right before the election soybeans down so they react to it\nAnd and this rollercoaster stock market day actually ended up being only a one day roller coaster I\nThink there's positive action today I Will I Will check it's ah let's see one more thing here we have yeah a ... [noise]\nYour wife recently had an interview she said there are people in the White House she doesn't trust people you don't trust that you have to watch your back is that true and if that is the case why are these people you don't trust still in the administration\nWe have great people right now are working are there are some that I Am not in love with yes and what we've done out slowly but surely\nThere have been some other embarrassing leaks are you any closer to figure out who these people are\nWell let me get my legs I think a lot of the lake so not lakes that made up by the newspapers and media is very very dishonest beyond anything that anybody can understand\nNow even a letter to the times that there is a chance there is a very good chance that that was written by the times I wouldn't be surprised because at times is totally corrupt and dishonest [noise]\nWhere did you first hear that [noise] [noise] right here\nLaugh beyond news radio nine sixty W we are seeing

you right now but I Will accept the results of the election I'm not going to do that until the election comes at a we've counted the votes\nThey want it\nI think what was the objective was to be able to create a soundbite Trump acknowledges he thinks he will lose elections that's what they were hoping for\nThe trouble with knowledge that you'll accept the results of the election of course I'm a great American ... that go to at that time everybody thought that Hillary was going to win in a landslide then they the soundbite would be the headline we trumpet knowledge is likely defeat in

rejected the election results and guess what the plan was [laughter] the plan was if Trump Williams to steal the election away from it\n\nIn October two thousand sixteens senior staff and the Obama

hypothetical premise\nThe Obama White house plan according to interviews with Ben Rhodes and Jen Psaki Obama's communications director called for congressional Republicans former president and former

ex presidents\nAnd they were going to get them to validate the election result\nIn addition to the official count state by state in addition to the U.S Congress certifying the election that apparently it wasn't going to be enough they had to go get Colin Powell and cause delays or rice [noise]\nIn the event the Trump tried to disputed Clinton victory but it would have been resolved as well as the conclusions arranged by the U.S intelligence community that Russian interference in the election sought to favor Trump so we're now learning\nNot\nWe're not learning anything we're having our suspicions confirmed they hatch this Russia plot way before the election even took place and no matter what happened no matter what the outcome was they're going to use it\nTrump last they were still going to use it to say that even though Trump last he tried to steal the selection of Hillary and it was that was going to validate her election even more\nThat was going to make her an even bigger
