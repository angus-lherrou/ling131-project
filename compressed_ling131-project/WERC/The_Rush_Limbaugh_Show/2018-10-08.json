side making this point because it's a point that's been true for as long as I have been doing this program in the longer we say constantly to the left uses the courts\n\nTo act as insurance policies against losing elections that left cannot\n\nSucceed in implementing his agenda nationwide except to be the courts\nAnd that's why the courts are so important and that's why the courts a liberal Democrat presidents have stacked as many of the federal courts federal appellate courts as they can with leftist activist judges not just\nPlain old simple judges a rule of law and there is a dirty little secret behind this folks\n\nThe Democrats simply do not have\nThe numbers in the country to pass their agenda in Congress they do not\nThe numbers to implement and pass their agenda legislatively other words they cannot get their beliefs their ideas past as laws\nIn America they have to rely on activists jobs just to do it now you\nMight be ... or Russia or Jews or before nothing new there well there's nothing new about it but particularly its its relevance its power\nAnd it's important has been magnified in this current Kevin off light and explains in one reason why why this is so important to them they are in their minds on the verge of losing the highest court in the land\nThere on the verge of losing the ability to have the highest court in the land rubber stamp their policies if you go down and look at leftist issue by leftist issue\nThat these issues that have royals our culture turned our culture upside down you won't find any of them that have been passed into law by the elected representatives of the people except for\nObamacare abortion\nThe American people haven't decided that that was forced on the American people by a leftist activists judge and a majority on the Supreme Court\nAnd any other number of cultural issues which are designed to strike out at this white power structure that the left so despise isn't so hates that they cannot beat they cannot win they cannot do this legislatively\nThey need activist judges dominating courts in order for what they want to be forced on every ... this is the\nPoint what they believe in\nThe idea is they have must be forced on the rest of the bus if they are to happen\n\nThey cannot withstand legislative tests it's\nThe same reason why every Democrat president up to and including Obama never tells the truth about their agenda they would not win the presidency if they were honest about that which they intend to do\n\nObama had been honest about the way Obama Care it was going to end up and how much it was going to cost you and how much you deserve to pay for it because you've been getting a free ride all these years\nYou buy him a had been anywhere near honest about that or what climate change was going to cost you running ... he would have never been elected\nAnd no Democrat ever wouldn't be\nThey routinely soft sell what they really believe they do not come out an advocate

put her on a national ticket somewhere and she kills\nWe have not lost this country and we have not lost that which can be traced directly back to our founding\nBut the left once everybody to believe that that founding and everything traceable back to it is unjust unfair that it is also racist and sexist and besides you they're sticking all these other things that are despicable we must do away

has put some ... on the spinal Republicans\nA ... true true but maybe I'm maybe I'm silly for trying to force in this issue but let me just ask you point blank right since\nYou have talked to was willing to address the issue do you think that this insurgency as you've described it which is this behavior but just that we've seen the last two weeks do you think that kind of behavior\nWhich was widely publicized Democrats loved it the media loved it they tried to make heros out of these people they didn't try to hold them back\nWhere they want to disrupt the Senate vote they disrupted the Senate vote when they wanted to get in the halls of the Senate Russell office building they did so they got an elevators they shouted these people now the Democrats have not once called out that activity that never once told outside their side to stand down\nDo you think the American public watching that is going to be turned off by it and want to vote against it or do you think the American public doesn't care one way or the other and doesn't even really notice it\nI think it's largely going to be turned off but like you said they they've completely changed their base now they've given up on the working blue collar class and they're now they're now trying their hand and see if they can somehow\nUm increase the numbers with women on these types of issues but I think largely the that the American people are going to be turned off\nAnd I I think it's all going to come down to who who was able to get out get out the vote\nBut that had\nWell see my point twenty twenty let me okay this is my I don't think given what we've seen the last two weeks among people in the public who watched it I don't think the Republicans need to do when he got out the vote this one is that\nIn my thing and just world the Democrats are just exceeded in getting Republican turnout larger than it's ever been for a mid term I Know I'm probably wrong about that but that's how I look at it that's how it ought to be and I'm a king book titled the way things ought to be an automated people were outraged by this\nIt ought to be that people can't wait to punish this much ... for the way they have treated this country the past two weeks alone the Republicans are not have to spend the time getting out the vote based on this but I Know that's not the reality kinda frustrating to me but that's the case\nDemocrats think they're going to have turned out here that dwarfs anything the Republicans have to show up on election Democrats think the whole country of except they really\nDon't they know they don't have enough Americans to win legislative battles but they think that they're going to be able to put together enough people to dwarf whatever Republican turnout there is and they've got new stories predicting that very thing so people are going to be reading it people going to be reading Republicans don't have a chance\n\nYou may replied no I I agree and um I think they energy I think they energize the base and they did exactly what needed to be done and I think this is the issue that you were speaking of a month or so ago\nThat the event had happened and what twenty nine days let
