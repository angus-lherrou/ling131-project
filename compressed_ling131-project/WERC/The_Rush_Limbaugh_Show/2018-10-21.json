{"month": "10", "state": "AL", "station": "WERC", "content": "For the financial safari news network I'm Steve said oh [noise]\nI kind of getting that I Will number two don't take advantage of I didn't move [laughter] I did\nHave a a a coup driver once and he would he turns out he was a prison guard fulltime at butler were butter Isabel Island Railroad and he basically new Bernie Madoff sure already was a hero inside the prison because you know parties the financial guide all the guys go hit for it\nBut it never learn sometimes do you know they don't read the new ... road [laughter]\nMean do you have to be careful about these pop and dumps to right oh yeah let's talk about a couple of where buckets I Want to make sure that the bucket of strategy folks as it's just the way\nIt's not an end all be all but it's a way for you to divide mentally to begin with but then physically hopefully your money into three different places one is for immediate emergencies we call that the yellow bucket nuts for emergencies or money you need within six to twelve months\nThe next one we call we yell and read so it can be mixed it could be orange or can be read all the way it is your is your financial goals bucket or maybe your dream bucket and the timeframe for this book it should be at least one year that's yellow part\nAnd could be two five ten or Twenty years that's a red part okay and I said I'll tell you why because basically anything that you're saving\nFor that can't pay out the normal cash flow in other words you have to have that money in at least a one year time rising because a lot of money goes tied to the market that's why they call it the red they can go up and down so you want to leave that money alone\nBecause that's why we have the buck another one so if you need the money you don't want to take money out of your your ... your bucket to if the market is down because you're walking in your losses so having those two accounts those two buckets yellow and the red one together makes sense but then\nYou say well gosh there's got to be a better way to save and not worry about the money long term\nAnd so that's a bucket number three which we called the green bucket and this is your retirement bucket and this is the most important bucket and it's one that a lot of people that are listening now he said gosh we don't have a great buck if we could all around the airport with Kate we've been told that's our retirement yeah we don't have a safe options in there's really not that that's a red bucket not agree bucket\nBut there are ways of your fifty nine and older you can roll out some of your money for one can't get into your own personal lives green bucket or if you left a job or two and you still have those world one case where you have to raise\nThese could be transferred into green buckets to your retirement bucket\nAnd any funds that usa specifically\nTo provide income when you retire when of course you need to be at least fifty nine and a half and the green bucket before you take money out because if you're under that yeah the ten percent federal penalty of an IRA\nAnd this money would fall into the green bucket and what a lot of the accounts we see a nice the green book at our traditional Ross step simple erase board when case both reduce the SPs they all are vehicles that could be in the green bucket\nRight again because think about it why do we save and all those accounts I just mentioned we saved there to have retirement but then we put the money into account where we could lose the money mhm and so you know with Murphy is always says Steve ... if it's going to happen it happens bad or whatever it's like Kelly Brown got along well if you have all your money at risk\nAnd you're counting that money to be your retirement money and then when retirement comes a day you reach retirement gosh it's happened to people today reach retirement the market decides to take a forty percent point what happens to be type ouch now you're going to do forty percent west things probably sixty percent less things because now you're worried and retirement and wanted to do you're basically going to sit home and ...\nOn the couch and watch Jerry Springer all day no that's entertaining for me for one hour but I couldn't imagine doing that eight hours a day for seven days a week I lost about twenty minutes yeah and so it's not as much as you can take so again that this is why we call it a bucket ballots you have to balance your buckets properly\nAnd no one's going to tell you about this if you're in the four one K. it's all when the risk bucket there is no say well the safe option gives you one percent interest or something that's not safe that's losing money safely need to be keeping up with inflation at least three percent growth every single year or you're losing money safely\nI Know it's that the bank gets into CD and you're all happy because you say it's safe but if each and every year we have inflation growing by three percent and you're only already one percent you're buying power shrinking revenue financial evaporation and we can't have\nAnd the successful retirement plan that should last to be designed we designed our plans to last stage one hundred and Twenty one and beyond\nWe can go further but no I haven't seen anybody won Twenty one yet but plants will go forever and then when you pass away whatever's left goes on in your next to Kim that's how the troop land is that the truth but who Sherry plan and it has all three buckets to read the green yellow buckets one two three balance your buckets folks balance your buckets if you're not sure about this\nCall right now we'll put together you're very young customized\nBus getting strategy that can give you that total confidence as you approach retirement folks keep in mind a proper bucking strategy has these three items and these three out of the most important items at any financial or retirement plan gross\nMaking sure the potential growth three years you have the money they're protection protecting your money from taxes protecting get as much as you can from taxes protecting get from risk these commissions\nVery important protection just like a quarterback has a ... office of wine around your portfolio and then income for the rest of your life with no questions consist of persistent reliable income\nWhen you decide to take it for the rest of your life no questions asked and hopefully that you have a couple of other green buckets one two or three you'll have increasingly come all the way through retirement we can set that up where you are with the next ten ... two hundred dollars a day will be no cost her obligation and you'll get that financial education and personalize bucket strategy that you deserve Steve tell him how to do that\nThe first step truly is to meet with financial coach if something that we're talking about here on the show resonates with you and you feel the need to get that second opinion or if you want to make sure that your retirement plan really is aligned with your goals and\nThat is very important risk tolerance that we talked about maybe you don't have a plan at all and you need to get one place you can meet with former Auburn football player and now the founder and CEO of Jefferson Matthews\nWall solutions that is AJ rough and he served all of central Alabama and the number to connect with him and his team so you can sit down with him personally and begin to get this plan in place\nEight hundred five one five Fifteen Ninety six\nTo eight hundred five one five one five nine six when you come in AJ and his team will translate that complex financial world into very clear instructions this is a great chance to get a true\nPractical retirement review like we talk about here on the show so once again to get that road map to get you where you need to be not only up to retirement the all the way through\nThe financial red zone all the way to and through retirement folks that number eight hundred five one five Fifteen Ninety six eight hundred five one five one five nine six\nFor states at all met him Michael's ... gate and this was coach paint we'll

Warren using only in the ... so he felt the need doing expanded to include South America when other reason there isn't much in\nThe DNA is because they are very very wary of this the Indians

apparatus was in this country the Mormon church out in Salt Lake City has one of the most advanced respected\nDocumented genial logical praise organizations that you'll find\nI have I've seen their work and it is [laughter] it's amazing\nAnd that the story I get that many Native Americans have been very leery of granting DNA because they're leery of how it's going to be used\nThey already feel like they were discriminated bunch of people but I'm the same token there are some benefits that have been extended to them as a result of this and they just don't want to upset the apple cart so they don't even realize or utilize DNA if any of this but\nThe the media of course has a role here because everything they've reported about this turns out to be an abject lie except for this inclusion by the Boston Globe that there wasn't any Native American DNA\nAnd by the way this is not what Trump that her anyway Trump that her that she would have to take a test from a little kept wandering around you can you can do a very rudimentary DNA test\nAnd he wanted to present her ... take the kids take the take the test of this kid's using it in a debate a future debate and that's what he\nMeant that she wouldn't do and he ... that she wouldn't show up at the Indian if she did do it\nBut you talk about talk about a meltdown and its Trump that is causing this\nTrump is literally causing these people lose their cookies compass causing them to go in the same and I think it's happening\nThroughout the Democratic party and threw out the American left and I have I have developed an even greater reason for it and it all in all relies on things that I have previously\nKnown and told you about ... and most of it is related to my curiosity here and my suspicion and my my dubious a nature when it comes to this blue wave business\n\nWe've been hearing for the past how many months that there's going to be a blue wave\nThere's no question about it\nThere has been no question about it the Democratic party is poised to retake everything they can in this next election why well the media tells us the American people are fed up after two years of Donald Trump they realize the mistake they made they wish they could do it to go do it over\nMaybe take back their vote for Trump and this is gonna be the first chance they've had to actually do that until the Democrats are going to retake the house and a massive landslide and at one point that we are going to take the Senate but then if you look at\nThe reality of voting\nPatterns just in the past eight years let's say ten there's nothing in the world using common sense that orders for a Democrat sweep or blue wave\nThe trend in the past ten years is Democrats losing elections left and right\nAnd it all started with Iraq Hussein all ... two thousand ten do you remember how many times I reminded you that during the first six years of Obama do you go through the two thousand four team in terms\nOf the Democratic party who lost over twelve hundred seats nationwide seats in the U.S house seats in the U.S Senate state houses governorships a\nYou even go to a local often like mayor or town councilman if you if you factor all of those races nationwide the Democrats after six years of Obama had lost\nWell over a hundred seats they were losing everything after the two thousand sixteen election\nThey continue to lose even more and the and the dead set lock to women in a landslide Hillary Clinton got beep in and near electoral landslide electoral college landslide\nAnother election where they were going to sweep big never going to wipe\nOut the Republican Party once and for all Hillary Clinton was going to be this winter they had they couldn't they had it any better this guy Trump won the Republican nomination somebody did know when he was doing a gigantic buffoon a walking set of gaps they thought this guy would be easily swept away they believed older polling data\nAnd we know what happened they continue to lose to the point that after the two thousand six need elections\nThe Democratic party had the least amount of power\nIn terms of elected office is held in Washington DC since the Nineteen twenties now the two thousand sixteen the election was only two years ago\nSo from two thousand tend the first chance people had to vote after having stomach two years of the Obama administration which you want to talk about people wanting to get their votes back you want to talk about people wishing they could do it over you want to talk about people wishing they haven't voted the way they had go take a look at the two thousand ten midterms\nIraq Obama singlehandedly my friends has destroyed the electoral prowess of the Democratic party\nNobody knows it because of the things I just told you are never reported instead what people hear every day is this coming blue wave this gigantic Democrat landslide on what evidence is this going to happen what is it that have stopped the trend\nThe people in this country have been voting against Democrats in ways unprecedented I mean to have with the fewest number of electoral seats since the Nineteen twenties is pretty astounding it means a lot of people have been voting against you so what is it that's happened\nThat is going to cause this gigantic one hundred eighty degree shift make people stop voting against Democrats and vote for them why it's none other than Donald Trump so says the media so says the Democrat Party\nWell on the basis of what if you take a look at Trump's agenda and the economy and policies and so forth is no reason to vote against it [noise] in common sense there is no return peasant done anything to worsen anybody's lives\nQuite the contrary and in fact\nThere's a story from CNBC today but you're not gonna see widely reported\nLet's see if the [noise] probably put CNBC ... survey soaring economic optimism points to no blue wave in two thousand eight team is this the CNBC polar survey\nAmerica is experiencing a

single time they target somebody for destruction [noise] whenever they want to take a Republican out they are guaranteed a Ninety percent chance of success [noise]\nBecause they have the drive by media working right alongside with them and if they set their their crosshairs on somebody there as good as gone or damaged beyond repair they haven't lay the glove on Donald Trump [noise]\nThey're running out of weapons and then the process of running out of weapons they're losing their minds they're losing their rational\nSanity I Believe [noise]\nAnd this latest debacle over cabin on\nI don't doubt for a minute this thing was orchestrated and planned from the get go\nAs a late breaking [noise] use only if necessary event they didn't lead with this because they knew it was flimsy\nThey didn't lead with it because they knew they couldn't prove it they didn't leave with it it was it a central part of a Kavanaugh hearings because they knew there wasn't any evidence for it and they knew that ball Z foreign could not pull this off under pressure [noise]\n[noise] [noise] [noise] I'm Still shocked that balls he showed up to testify I I\nThink that took everything they had to persuade her to get there 'cause I don't think she ever intend to do and I don't think when they pitched her on this whole thing was every part of the plan that she what\nEver actually have to testify and does anybody believe\nThat uh fifty one every year old woman literally talks as she talks that way in her classroom teaching students\nIf she does [noise]\nI mean that just ...\nAnd I guess it's possible I guess she does but I I I don't believe that either I don't believe that's how you talk to the balls before and you run into rather beach Santa Cruz that's not how she's going to talk to you you're running around the beach out there uh and she is not going to be talking to you like he's in perpetual fear of being hit or damaged or harmed her yelled at or whatever\nAh anyway the point is none of it has worked and by work I mean do two things the\nThe real objective from the get go from all of this the cleanest way for this to happen and would have been able to turn the American people particularly Trump voters against him\nIf they have been able to do that get Trump's approval numbers ... to the thirties and into the twenties then they could get rid of him they failed at that all they did with cement Trump's supporters to him even more firmly\nAnd then the process Kavanaugh saying they actually turns of people who were sympathetic to them and the Trump supporters because people in the same portion of this country simply do not feel comfortable with watching\nThe most powerful apparatus of government unified at a line and for the purpose of destroying a human being and a life when there isn't\nAny evidence [noise] that would warrant such a thing but the Democrats typical care that there wasn't any evidence because they never have any they always relied on the seriousness of the charge working with the media\nTo create a daily image that whoever the Democrats are targeting is worse\nThan poison and\nMust be dealt with as though he or she is poison well none of it has worked and even in their own post Trump's approval numbers hover in the mid forties Rasmussen Trump's at fifty one\nThey see the\nApproval numbers for Trump of the African American community

I'm not apologizing for anything you don't like it live with it\nAnd the president I didn't want to do the story in the first place I didn't want to post or the pictures the editor says you did I mean this guy has no empathy or feeling for anybody\nHe doesn't [noise]\nIt's just it's ... it's it's perfect if the kind of personality you would have to be if your job is destroying the\nNo conscience

smarter than tricked into not publishing one day because she can't confirm the pita file story while the other paper puts it on the cover of having confirmed it\nBecause the editor at the other ... doesn't care whether it's true or not whether he calls the guy to beat up I'll just get it up there and get it on the newsstands whereas the female editor didn't have the guts\nTo run it until the paper doesn't rot and I'm thinking they obviously you're not worried about the me too movement here [noise] ever put this thing together so the name of this press I have no idea it's it's I think it it just completed airing\n'cause I've got all six of them so I just competed completed it's um it's run cycle in the u._k. which means it's going to be on Netflix\nAmazon Prime wherever I don't know
