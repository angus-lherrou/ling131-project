Congress began and it went all through the year Democrat advantage in the generic ballot was twelve five seven and the Republicans pulled even in a couple of them are Democrats once again broke away\nAnd all during it I your host have been doing this a long time and it doesn't matter\nIt doesn't mean anything\nWe remind you of a motivation technique utilized by the coach of the New England

finish line makes the point it didn't matter at any point in this race when I stopped in the ... there\nIs no way anybody could have known at the first term at the halfway point or at the final turn who is going to win yet look what you want to do what you were making bad humor and guessing somebody you're probably were certain the bottom line is\nFinish you're never know\nBefore it's over who's

NATO\nAnd so now here we are on October second CNN is panicking\nRacist or type thing in the house this wasn't supposed to happen why they had all their pre election polls they had the generic

and there could be a blue wave in the Senate\nBut wave red wave and the Republicans could come out of nowhere at about fine old her in and take over\nWell\nWe don't know if the Republicans were ever really far behind we don't want anything because there wasn't a vote back in December or January or July or August\nWe don't know anything and we don't know anything now and we won't know anything until\nThe day after election day or maybe later that night now one of the brief observation here once again do you notice Mr engines knock it in there\n\nI think you know there's a lot of talk Brett Kavanaugh this whole confirmation mess that in fact might hurt Republicans it doesn't seem to be so\nLadies and gentlemen high and the reason he saying this and everybody else because of my viral prediction of last week that if the Republicans don't confirm Kavanaugh\nAs the Democrats are going to win everything that predicted to mind when ... drive by is loved it they love it when the leader

Kavanaugh what the Republican is actually going to help them how can that they live on just said they were going to notice\nThey are totally totally confused and as I said\nYesterday what what what is the sense in saying that we have to do was in order to win you know people that will lead Kevin I'll go down that are really find them up\nWill fire buddy up no the way you get on the bandwagon the

Rachel Mitchell ask her some questions which now turned out to be brilliant but at the time we were all kind of curious what what's the purpose was um all\nTrump is still is reminding everybody\nWhat she said she doesn't know she doesn't know the people she says we're there say they weren't there this is not mocking her and this is a sign of what really is wrong in this country and accuser comes forward and you can poke holes in\nObvious places you can't point out obvious discrepancies you cannot reference or make mention of the\nDifferences in her story from depending on the day she's telling it\nWhatever it is is it is not mocking\nChristie balls the Ford\nNow Trump has a lot of people saying this is crazy rush because last week Trump was saying that she was credible and her testimony was compelling I have explained this before and I'm going to explain it again Trump all ways eventually will tell you what he really thinks about anything\nAnd he may not do that out of the batter's box\nI have a name for this I call it pacing\nTrump woman necessarily go out with a general opinion like on gun control after a shooting or the dreamers are in this case Dr ... he'll color credible\nTestimony compelling and he'll even go so far to say that yeah if if she's telling the truth yeah they're my nomination might be in trouble yeah I'll agree with that\n\nThat gives him credibility it makes people kind of caught their head they don't think Trump can be that's fair I'm Talking about the meeting on the left Democrats they don't think Trump can be that that a reasonable\nBut he does it to them every time it gives them the credibility later\nTo be critical and the step away he said yeah I found her credible I've founder compelling then as we learn more and then as events play out Trump is able to parlay his original statements into what he really thinks based on\nWhat is not a knee jerk reaction if Trump were to heaven sent initially what he said last night at the rally why there would have been held up pay but now he can back it up now there's all kinds of evidence that her timeline doesn't make any sense\nWe've got an ex boyfriend claiming she is a polygraph expert has taught people how to beat them\nWe have people challenging her account we didn't have that last week it is perfectly fine for Trump to do what he did\nIt gives him a credibility later to be critical step away it's a common technique you use as he does it on everything\nIt's why I've always told you don't take his first draft statement or his first tweet as a sign that he's caving or flipping you people you I'm sure you remember there haven't been many instances in fact I may have fallen for one myself that's how I learned\n\nThat Trump will tweet something or say something it'll make you look like he's about late ... before he pulled out of a ... the Paris climate accord\nWhat did he say climate change very serious thing and we have to look at it than we are looking at it than will do the right\nTo oh he's on record as being open about then later on when he's learned when he needs to learn comes out tells you what do you think's\nReally thinks it's a pattern it's a technique is a trumped developed I don't even open developed or it's just how he does it naturally and instinctively\nBut I call it pacing now Republicans\nHave not built up this reputation Senate Republicans haven't ... as Trump has a stab wished that after he makes it an initial statement on something that he can make fun of things and what really irritates ... he gets away with it I cannot\nTell you how ... irritates them to he shouldn't have survived the Access Hollywood video he shouldn't have survived anything they've thrown at him the fact that he has an just continue to prosper and triumph I cannot tell you how the lions Lee insane it has made the with rage\nOther Republicans have not developed ... adds to do this\nAnd pull it off Trump\nHas been attacked so much we're now if you go back to two thousand Fifteen when this campaign started this is two thousand eighty three years\n\nIn fact it's if it's three years in three months Trump gets in in June of two thousand Fifteen Trump has been attacked so much he doesn't care anymore\nIt doesn't bother him anymore is my point he's not willing to take the arrows he's willing to take the hits for everybody else that's why he is needed folks he is willing to do what he did last night I Know\nMurkowski and Collins or shuttering cowering in the corner with the vapors\nOh my God it was horrible it was so horrible everything he said is true\nIt was not mocking hurt the actress\nVideo audio we played mocked mostly for\nTrump didn't\nHe just simply probably she she can't backup she cannot cooperate there isn't any crop ration for what she said why is that not relevant\nWhy does that not matter\nWhy have we gotten to a point where any woman can come forward and accused any man of anything and it's gospel\nAnd then be joined by a so called movement called me to wear all women can joined the can you imagine if there was something going on they can you imagine of men organized for the express\nPurpose of destroying women you can't even imagine it can you\nYou can't even imagine the organized movement the male version of me too\nWell\nRoche ... million women or nor do their way to do\nWell yeah that does happen but that's not the point this is not about even Bannon set it this is not just about sexual abuse this is about Raul power this is about female rage\nBecause of things that have happened to them the leftist women\nAnd they have organized all of these disorders into a giant political movement I'm just asking you to think can you ever can you envision\nA movement of
