it's just a little minor correction I get them confused occasionally here is that just another sample from last night Trump and Leslie stall\nYou know general mad at the tails the reason for NATO and the reason for all these are lying for instance prevent World War three no it's not true but frankly I like General Mattis I think I Know more about it than he does and I know more about it from the

pay their way I'm fully in favor of NATO but I don't want to be taken advantage of oil\nGeneral manager so I think I Know more about it than he does I Know more about it from the standpoint of fairness that I can\nTell you he's talking about the fairness of do is the fairness of all the NATO members paying their own way he's also talking about people like Angela Merkel making a side deal with Russia and potent for natural gas shipments\nExplosively into Germany ignoring other NATO allies and you'll notice a sixty minutes isn't going to Angela Merkel and asking her why she is undermining NATO [noise]\nTrump already called her out on it [noise] for doing this the Trump supposedly in the pockets of the\nOf the Russians but Trump knows what sixty minutes or less money still trying to do here that's what they don't get\nThey can sneak up on people anymore particularly Trump he knows\nHe in fact you know one thing he says I don't know if we've got on the roster coming up probably do a he said something to her that is as as honest and true is anything he's ever said because I Know Donald Trump I've known him a long time I played golf and I've known him a long time before he ran for office\nAnd he would ask me about various Democrats asked me about Obama and I can tell that sometimes when I told him what I think he didn't agree especially when discussions in the media came up\nHe thought I was maybe just a little bit over the top exaggerating and some of the things I Would tell us about my opinions with\nThe media he said to her I had no idea and I'm being really serious with you Leslie I had no idea how dishonest the media is until I ran for president [noise] I had no idea I being really serious with you he said [noise] and I\nI think that's probably true as a New Yorker and immersed in New York media where he was a star [noise]\nWhen he wasn't running for office it was a local New York's by you know he made fun of him and they laugh but but he was a big get he appeared everywhere\nAnd they loved him and he was great front cover back cover of the tabloids the daily news and the post when he ran for president that's when all of the good vibes about trauma there were some bad things too I mean he didn't get universally loved praised coverage but it all vanished when he ran [noise]\nAnd he was surprised in a way kind of like McCain was\n[noise] [noise] [noise]\nSo when he said to her last night I had no idea I really telling you Leslie I'm really shocked that was really surprised by this honest\nThat's the word he uses instead of biased [noise]\nAnd I can tell you that that's true now what else has he learned that he didn't know but he knew before he ran for office and I think\nA lot about the left a lot about\nDemocrats

say if you have one drop of blood was black\nYou're black or this was this was a grotesque cruel her her percentage is so small\nThey don't have to excuse me a second hasn't that rural been adopted by civil rights activists now that that that if if you have one drop your going to be called black\nWhat that's exactly right intersection holiday requires quantification yeah and so when we need to know how much of a percentage of press or you are versus oppressed\nThis ... this this rule is is grotesque widely discredited used by the KKK in the thirties used in Nazi Germany it against the Jews\nHere she comes again this is actually a dog whistle to her base it's not meant for Republicans it's not meant for conservatives is not only in about her future run she needs to tell her base\nI'm On board

host I remember that no one little thinking and asking when they listen to a caller savings\nI agree with that look a intersection outed comes straight out of Marxism Marx said that at every one is either on oppressor or oppressed they're either bourgeois or ...\nAt its later is now being adopted to the idea of being able to declare percentages of what you are how the press them how much of an approach where you are\nIt's called intersection nowadays because instead of just being one camp or the other it spread across race gender sexual preference and other variables\nYes okay that's it the intersection out all the foreign me\nGreat on washed you're you're talking or you're you're\nSpeaking in language of ah people formerly educated on Marxism many people aren't that's why it's so successful\nUm yes any intersection out on the next and it's basically something that has been constructed by these marches\nJust saying that all of these different leftist organizations meet somewhere they all intersect with each other the feminist having this strain about them that that that I'm\nA cohabitation with that with militant I'm a Islamic feasts that then with illegal immigrants and their activist and we're all of these people intersect is where they unified\nWell yes but it also applies to the individual because of these let's say five different dimensions you you are on a different scale and all of those\nAnd they intersect into a single number quantifiable says that this is how much of an oppressor or oppressed you are this is where you're on the scale\nOf course this is the root of all this recent white privilege stuff pops up some absolutely\nSo now Elizabeth Warren because she wants to uh justify her cultural appropriation of a Harvard professor ... has to claim a particular percentage of intersection now with the oppression\nTo speak their language so she is saying that she is an old press she's arrested him anyway she's a woman therefore sees
