transformative uh he couldn't define what that meant [noise] ah\nThere would have been a revolt that he wouldn't have been elected to have you been honest about what transforming America man\nSo what he claimed that man was taking on issues like climate change\nAnd health care for everybody and all this transform America but what they really want to do was transfer America away from [noise]\nAre unique founding converted to a socialist democracy\nSome of the radicals even want to go further and and and have this country become totally communist back look and there's a poll out here today this

believe this but the facts on the ground to just what you see even though it may be anecdotal evidence indicates that a lot of them have fallen for this millennial men were far more likely to identify as some kind of socialist\nThan women a total of forty percent responding affirmative late to the question now how would they held can that\nBe 'cause there's one thing or something just doesn't

say they're reading it or try to become conversant and it\nJust the nature of things and so they're being highly highly successful\nAnd targeting America and its founding not just targeting capitalism it's targeting the concepts of individual liberty and freedom and targeting the concept\nThat government is the institution that needs to be limited most in a representative republic that the emphasis of government the getting government out of people's lives just the exact opposite with communist socialist so I have an evidence\nBase here\nNot just slapping my gums there's a New Yorker story by

McClain who you were just speaking of the person they contacted 'em as Kaiser on and trying to get her to possibly change your testimony yeah uh she she used the same person that the boyfriend or Dr Ford mentioned in the letter he sent him talking about how\nA heaping and there was coaching going on but Dr Ford on trying to get somebody to handle a polygraph\nProbably yeah that's another story by the way the boyfriends letter has yet to be reported in\nMainstream media nor has the story of Monica McLean pressuring we wouldn't Kaiser to change your test of those two stories have not been reported ABC CBS NBC Washington Post New York times Associated Press people have not heard either of that\nAnd there's other things like for example a Dr Ford mentioned in her Senate and the testimony

balls the Ford wrote the letter that's where she was she was a ... a Delaware with my client yet so\nHere's my question there's there's an emerging picture that there might be a lot going on but beyond that behind the scenes here that hasn't come out yet I I'm Wondering is not as the Democrats oddly enough we're not better off holding this vote now before more of this comes out [noise]\n...\nGoing to go through at the last minute change one of the people are saying they're going to vote changes it was certainly it goes down and a quarter and then because all of this is about

you're must be you must have something to hide there and he writes I urge you once again now for the third time in writing to turn over to therapy knowledge the polygraph materials and communications with the Washington Post Dr Ford has relied upon as evidence\nIn addition to the evidence I requested in October second letter in light of recently uncovered information please turn over records\nAnd

Democrats\nLike this is my fifth to be tied now I think I have something that might relate to it I got\nAn email last night from Salinas veto who has made a name for herself\nBy traveling through all of these blue states during the election campaign season of two thousand sixteen she went to all of these places in blue states that were going to vote for Trump and she learned anything about these people she could\nShe took them seriously she went and met them and talk to them learn about them nobody else in the drive by media has done anything like this\nBut she wanted to find out who they are she lives in Pittsburgh she had a sense that something was happening out there\nThat the Washington establishment didn't see and rather than gas she actually wanted to find out who these people are she went to a lot of small towns medium sized town spent serious time they're getting to know these people she has stayed in touch with them ever since the election she has written a book about it\nIf the Democrats in the media wanted to know who that voted for Donald Trump all they'd have to do is go get her book they haven't they don't read it they don't care to know who the Trump voters are\nThey're not interested in appealing to them they're trying to find out ways to make Trump voters irrelevant or keep them away from the polls they want to separate Trump and his voters from themselves but they're not interested in finding out who they are so as to maybe convert them\nTo what never Trump or is there an anti Trump or is it's an amazing display of arrogance and by the way the same can be set of Republican political consultants they don't care who the Trump voters are all that matters is that they are left at impugn didn't made fun of\nSo I get a note from her last night\nAnd she is explaining to me what the Kavanaugh hearings have meant\nAnd what has happened\nOut there in these areas she has studied and she made essentially two points\n\nOne that something has needed to happen after the two thousand sixteen election to keep the coalition that voted for Trump together\nNow a lot of us of assumed that if people voted for Trump in two thousand six day that they did sell for very specific reasons among them Trump is alone in fighting the Washington establishment that Trump is alone in in in pushing back\nAgainst Democrats and the so called Washington conventional wisdom and then the assumption is that if people knew that in two thousand six game that they would not forget that and if they would realize the need to continue\nTo vote in ways that would continue to support and unable Trump to be successful\nAnd she makes the point that it doesn't work that way sadly that after\nA single election with the known result something needs to happen besides just another election of party members or Trump is not on the ballot something needs to happen to make those people as eager to vote two years later as they did in two thousand six team\nAnd that\nIs the Kavanaugh circumstance in her mind the conservative populists coalition\nThat elected Trump needed something outside of Trump to coalesce around in the midterms in other words in her

your fight back\nA arguing with them you can probably clear twenty thousand dollars worth of old credit card debt for around four thousand dollars and the student loan that doesn't change if that's all the case and they're not going to end your wages and you just began to work through this\nAnd you could have cleared it for four grand and it would all just gone away without a bankruptcy\nTo see the bankruptcy starts the nightmare the credit nightmare the money nightmare over again\nRight starts at all knew\nBut if you can just clear these things up they drop off into the past a whole lot
