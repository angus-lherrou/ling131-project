that\nOne time I figured it was just you know a graphic car ride and graphic to represent what they were doing at that time but every time I looked up at the TV over the next three hours I saw that that that manner [noise] it didn't matter what else was being discussed\nIt didn't matter who the guests were then I saw the Washington Post thing and so I checked the New York times and there it is spreading fear telling lies\n[noise] a head of election [noise]\nCaravan thing you know [laughter] I continue to study this and try to pick it apart bill analyze it and and make sense of it from a political standpoint and I still can't find\nAnywhere in the media or any concern about it I Can't find anybody concerned are worrying or thinking that it's anything abnormal about is\nThat what you find in the drive by immediate isn't tired total miss characterizations these are desperately poor people wonderful people fleeing poverty in their homeland and that's not at all what they are\nThey are part of an organized mob there is no question about is it is an organized mob and like everything else in the left is behind some point in the future we're going to learn exactly how this thing was pulled off we're going to learn who did it we're going to learn who paid for it we're going to learn who scripted it\nJust like we've learned how they did the cabin off thing with Dr balls the Ford how that was structured how that was planned how it was kept in reserve\nPart is that nothing that appears spontaneous or organic where it benefits the left is spontaneous\nOr organic in his all structured it's all planned it's all scripted it's all paid for its all focus grouped it's poll tested from their\nPerspective and the the obvious you know there there there's no ... you look at this you look at this caravan and it is\nYou don't want to scare everybody is exactly the threat this country has faced for years we now have a focused concentrated microcosm of with seven thousand\nPeople that maybe a thousand or ten thousand if they get here by election day there's still a thousand miles away yet vowing to get here by election day at the drive by claiming they're walking there not walking they can't they'll never cover a thousand miles in two weeks if they're walking it physically not possible\nSo when the cameras aren't there some of these people have to be\nBeing driven\nBut it is all orchestrated none of this is organic none of it\nIs real from the standpoint that individuals totaling eight thousand people decided on the same day or in the same week or even in the same month to start walking\nFrom Honduras to the United states that just didn't happen it doesn't happen somebody is making this happened somebody set this up\nObviously is a bunch of leftist set this up and when you look at that and examine it from that standpoint you've you've got to wonder what it is\nThat makes them think they are going to win massive elections and it is clear to me not only examining the caravan the mob see there I go I even got caught up calling it what it is it's not a caravan it's a mob it's uh bought and paid for and structured scripted mob\n\nThe Democrats clearly believe and they have believed since the two thousand sixteen election\nThat the way to win back their power is to stoke and create Trump hatred that they think organically natural really exists in either a majority of Americans or close to it and that's what they're trying to capitalize on is massive\nTrump hatred massive Trump resentment\nThey're not doing it by talking about issues in our own individual campaigns you'll hear Democrats promise to repeal the tax cuts and roll back things that have led to economic prosperity but in terms of the national message from the Democratic party you're not getting one you're getting\nTrump fear Trump hatred promoting it [noise] they exacerbated or what have you and it's\nIt's silly it's not the way you build a movement now\nLet me share with you a couple of uh stories today on the polling leading up to the mid term because it is all over the place and it is contradictory as it can be\nFive thirty eight as soon as the adored do and the indispensable and the eagerly anticipated Nate Silver who has now said the Democrats have an eighty five percent chance of winning control of the house of representatives\nThe Republicans have only a fourteen and a half percent chance of keeping the house\nThis is almost identical to five thirty it's\nForecasting two weeks before the presidential election in two thousand sixty in where Hillary Clinton had anywhere from an eighty eight percent or Ninety two percent chance of winning the presidency and Trump had\nWhat twelve percent to ... percent chance of winning which was effectively zero and even on election day throughout the day and that is how five thirty eight and the New York times reported and we all know what happened Charlie Cook considered the dean of political analysts\nAnd this company\nAnalyzes races individual house races and Senate races and reports on which way they're going to go the cook Political Report today has shifted eight house racist toward Democrats and two in favor of Republicans were fourteen days to go before the midterm elections\nThe non partisan election forecast there is no such thing\nAnd Charlie Cook is not nonpartisan Charlie Cook cares about the outcome of this stuff Charlie Cook is not nonpartisan but that's how this stuff gets reported in\nThe non partisan election forecaster Charlie Cook Political Report rejected Democrats will have an edge in key swing districts following the party's massive\nFund raising hall in the third quarter of this year\nSo those are the two stories but then\nIf you turn to NBC News and the wall Street Journal bloom wave collapsing early voting shows geo pie out pacing Democrats in key states\n\nIn this story is even is even prepared in a written as another sign that this so called blue wave eagerly anticipated blue wave could end up disappointing people next month if it arrives at all NBC News\nHas looked at early voting David provided by a company called target smart in eight states\nAnd found that GOP affiliated voters are out pacing democratic voters in seven of those including North Carolina GOP affiliated voters have surpassed Democrat voters in early voting in Arizona Florida Georgia Indiana Montana Tennessee Texas also North Carolina\nOnly in Nevada have\nDemocrat affiliated voters exceeded Republican affiliated voters so far in the early voting the latest data is from NBC suggest robust in a fool's Yaz among girl eight Republican voters that couldn't put a dent in Democrat hopes for a blue wave\nRepublicans typically dominate early voting by absentee ballots while Democrats tend to have the advantage when in person early voting\nSo for example the entire early voting picture in Florida which is you have to begin in person voting is in a complete\n\nThat that's somewhat of a important point there because it's it's not just that the Republicans are doing better than Democrats in the states\nIt is that early voting almost always favors Democrats the usual pattern for all this stuff is there for Democrats are drawn up in the early Italy and\nBecause of early voting and the Republicans have to then make up for about on election day itself but that's not what we're seeing here and they get Mrs NBC News\nSo the question here ... hard to apply this to actual election outcomes too much we don't know but one thing we do know this is not this is not according to a convention was a conventional wisdom is\nWhat is more likely that Trump could loaded with putting the influence the presidential election two thousand sixteen\nOr Democrats colluded

all he said it was only a few thousand people\nAnd then I take my lunch break and they have another NPR a personality saying that it's such a humanitarian disaster now that they're standing by the\nVoters John's into ... making his eyes water so they use the mob they don't want to say mom they use what whenever it is to them it is to them they don't want to say mom they want to say it's only a few thousand people well that's good for them but when it's not when they want to use the humanitarian side it's such a disaster\nThat there's you know thousands of people on the line went on he couldn't even see the end of it the way they can go to the bathroom\nRight so uh your conclusion from all this is\nThat oh NPR's at great did you want to listen to NPR you want to know what the enemies doing or what they're up to that for that day listen to NPR and they're trying to use the situation for whenever it means for them and that meant it they can\nDo that for we've got a bad we got a a a a bad a connection here uh\nAbout the only time I'm interested in NPR is when they run pieces to translate what I've said uh for the audience and and that happens when I get the soundbites on that\nMaybe once every two or three weeks a ... of course NPR's not going to call it a mob NPR is supportive of whatever this group of people is doing and what is this group of people do it who are these people we're\nBeing led to believe that these are average ordinary Hondurans Guatemalans El Salvador and fleeing poverty [noise]\nWar\nTorn poverty and ah [noise] ... or whatever\nAnd they just organically happen you know these people is amazingly on the same day this item to leave and they\nJust they just they just they just because they're human beings they're it's a way a decent life you know in in in in and they're coming to the United states\n[noise] [noise]\nAnd of course Trump and the Republicans are a bunch of mean spirited extremist cold hearted SOB zoo want these people that keep suffering\nThat's the picture that's the picture being painted one of these people really doing [noise]\nWe've got reporters embedded in there now we know we hear what they're saying they're talking about Trump being you know an S. obey screwed Trump Trump simpler Trump's a Nazi this there's no doubt this was a political movement it has an orchestrated an designed them as being paid for by somebody\nAnd it has one express purpose it has as its purpose to flood the American the southern border and to demand to be let in\nSomebody thinks or some group of people think somehow that this is helpful to the Democrat cause\n\nOther ways this could be helpful to Democrats causes if some damn of violence occurs to them or if I'm a they're able to show that Trump and his supporters are so mean spirited and cold hearted that they don't care about the suffering of deny the entry in this kind of thing\nBut but for the media to act like this is a a normal news event like any other normal news event it just happened to we're going to cover it and we're going to report it but that there's no political objective attached to this is absurd\n\nI mean I I saw a um I saw a video tape of

like the kind of people you want to run in to [noise] you know on the street I mean they they just anyway he's standing there and these people are walking past him he's not looking at 'em they're behind him and then they walk past him on his left shoulder\nAnd he's managing for he's telling everybody who they are\nAnd what they want and why we must let them in and that they're decent people and all they want is a better life and that we as Americans we owe it to these people and let them in all they want is what we want we all\nHave these various humanitarian objectives in common and I ask myself how in the world can this guy vouch for whatever it is now eight thousand people but there he was down there vouch in trying to tell everybody watching him\nThat these are ... these are the prince and princesses in Central America these people are beyond reproach\nAnd he doesn't know them he has no idea who except I think he does I think he knows what the political objective is here and I think he supports it and doing everything he can to advocate for this bunch which intends to be disruptive and destructive\nBut to sit there and to try to vouch for eight thousand people have to tell his audience who they\nAnd these guys say Trump sees a twofold advantage it's a way to argue his opponents have turned a blind eye of the problem [noise] although\nDemocrats remain strongly favored to win back the house overhead TV pictures of thousands marching north have the Democrats booked asked of the timing worry them and national Democrats strategist ed in the Senate yeah\n[noise]

polls to vote Democrat [noise]\nOn Monday Trump unleashed an explosion of immigration focus statements warning on Twitter that he made the point the military to the border and threatening to cut off aid to Guatemala Honduras and El Salvador what she has doubled down on by the way\nSo this is a story tried to tell brain dead people read political why Trump is talking nonstop about the care of him\nBecause it's going to help him with immigration [noise] well [noise]\n[noise] [noise] who did they think is behind this [noise]\nOf the stuff in the media is literally mind boggling that that the the attempt here to be on attached to it or disengaged from it\nWhen when you get down to brass tacks\nMost people in the media would be supportive of the people is caravan being allowed the lead in the country because they are everyday anyway whether people show up in a group of two or five or ten or in a Bob up seven thousand the left as in favor of letting them in [noise] and that are worried that this is going to be a boon to Trump [noise]\nRight before the midterm elections which it is\n[noise] [noise] [noise]\nBut when you stop and think the Democrats are behind this has to be democratic donor money behind this and the reason I say this [noise]\nIt may make no sense that because this report is right this is helping Trump's allied with the Democrats do this book they're not rational right now\nThis group of people throughout the media\nThe Democratic party itself and and all of their social media base voters I'm telling you are so\nPoisoned\nWith hatred and resentment all of these emotions they have felt following election night two thousand sixteen and all of the times in the past two years they thought that Trump was gone you gotta put\nYourselves in their shoes

administration as a reason for the Democrats to win back the house [noise] [noise]\n[noise] they have they have lost all grounding here in in rationality\n[noise]\nAnd they're perplexed because none of what they have done his work in a white has worked its it's if it's getting back to the same old thing they can't persuade you to abandon Donald Trump they can't persuade you to stop going to Trump
