mother report is just\nWorking there there isn't anything really in it in fact we now know probably have a sure bet that there's nothing dynamite in it\nBecause of an audio soundbite I have coming up uh never Trump or anti Trump is Phil Mudd ... former intelligence official US government now CNN commentator\nBut who who is it that would think if you're on the left to think this massive caravan arriving in the United states at our border close to the election who thinks this is going to help Democrats how what it helped Democrats [noise]\n\nIt's not just Trump separating it was Trump not letting them in I go there has to be what it is these people actually are figuring that a massive ... they don't understand that this\nKind of thing is why Donald Trump was elected Donald Trump was elected to stop this kind of thing to stop this invasion and that's what this is this was an organized bought and paid for invasion\nAnd it's growing so obviously the plan is for this group of people including the children to arrive here are\nVery close to the election and for Trump just sick ice on them and the border patrol on them and to deny them injury or to separate the children from the adult [noise]\nSo that's a drive by media can then kicked into high gear with stories that are already ...\nThat are all ready taped interviews with people on the caravan all ready in the can where these people will say they're shocked they\nCame to America to save their lives were their children and do improve their latest days of all what the man is unlike anything they ever heard about\nThe cuts of pictures of Trump smiling as people are denied entry\nThe Democrats think this\nYou know I I Would think that if somebody politically did this it'd be a\nConservative group might do this\nTo promote Republican turnout [noise]\nWe don't have anybody on our side who thinks that way but it makes more sense that way\nOr am I missing something\nSomehow a massive group of four thousand people it's growing including kids marching toward the United states with no attempt just making patently obvious what it is\nBecause you're not people fleeing anything these are not people fleeing the Saudi Government they're not fleeing torture not fleeing will they be playing poverty but that happens every day for thousands of illnesses aren't just read it it's planned this morning paper somehow this is supposed to end up making the United states look bad\n[noise]\nUh I'm not sure that that ... that's the way these people are figuring it going to play out now we have the mother report\nThat\nWill not be released before the election but we're being told that it is nearing completion and that it is ready to go I went through yesterday what the what the hope here is\nUh the hope here is to revive the Trump colluded with Russia narrative and to make people think that we're just days or weeks away from proof\nBeing released whether we can't do it before the election because of regulations and isn't it somewhere we're not going to influence the outcome of elections but\nMuller is ready to go at once in a while I've been doing well Mueller has been looking for evidence of Trump colluded with Russia so if mothers ready to go ... found the but this was what they want everybody to think\n\nAbout the fact of the matter is it's probably the exact opposite uh let me find the to to to find lease soundbite here [noise]\nThat puts this in perspective hang on one look at this [noise] yeah most take long hair folks I as I say I'm having a compressed everything here it is not pretend audio soundbite number ten and this is\nThis is deep state ranking member Phil Mudd he is a former intelligence official now works as a commentator on CNN last night Wolf Blitzer show the situation room\nHe's a counterterrorism center special is what he is and Blitzer said do you think that Muller is preparing new indictments\nThe really interesting part of this is a potential report a draft report a narrative if you will\nFrom other going over Rosenstein let me play this out Washington Rosenstein gets the narrative that says not only this is what we found that my violate the law this is my picture of what happened during the investigation there's going to be some dirt and there are so in addition to the indictments I really want to see what's in that narrative report\nOkay so this\nIs where this is going to Mueller report is going to be full of supposedly horrible stuff\nTrump is none none of which is probably going to be invaluable none of which is going to be impeachable although the Democrats win the house they're gonna make moves in that direction anyway um but he says the important point of the smaller report will be the dirt\nDirt nothing which\nThere's nothing for it less they make it up there never has been any Trump collusion and they're never has been the evidence or less they make it up\n[noise] so the smart money is that it's going to be filled with things that are accusatory that blamed Trump's incompetence ineptitude essentially blame Trump for being so in over his head\nThat it looked like the Russians haven't worked with him to steal the election despite the fact that there is any hard evidence it's hard to refute the idea\nOf going to make it look like Trump is in over his head doesn't know what he's doing threatens the country with his presidency because of his incompetence that's what it's going to be but let's take a look at an alternative view from Sydney Powell\nWhose work we have referenced many times on this program she has written a book chronicling they deception and the abuse of power but corruption in the department of justice traced all the way back\nTo the Enron task force many of the same lawyers here we're

fact Muller hasn't found anything\nThe mother which ... is effectively over writes ms Powell not become smaller and not plan to drag this out until they could contact the crime against Trump for a member of his family but rather because the ... up\nHave you noticed how long it's been since anybody even suggested that the president sit down with the special counsel for an interview\nMueller's reason for existing was the outrageous purposefully propagandize per verification of the Trump campaign and even Trump himself colluded with Russia to rig the twenty sixteen presidential election against Hillary Clinton\nThe Democrats who perpetrated this fraud or not only masters of projection and deception they took their play book a personal destruction to a whole new level\n\nTalked about this whole thing with the with handled the in the interview with the ... the genuine outrageous and this that this is the ... the literal criminal acts committed by Hillary Clinton and all of the

you know what I've been hearing is that people all over the country are afraid to put yard signs out because literally afraid of leftist knobs\nComing to their homes and not just ripping the signs out but doing damage to their houses and so people who are tending to vote Republican are not putting yard signs that remember we had a\nCall here I just maybe three weeks ago now from a caller who said Russia I'm worried I'm not seeing in the yard signs we saw Trump the yard signs everywhere in two thousand six you know I'm not seeing any yard signs at all\n[noise] I said well back camp that camp

...\nOn up the Democrat Party elite\n[noise] sad to say we're never these radical left now I'm going back ... Clinton [noise] the Democrat Party moderate elite has been overtaken by the left wing radicals [noise]\nAnd that's why some are scratching their heads anyway from two thousand one or two thousand Eighteen to share a Democrat voters who describe themselves as liberal has grown from thirty to fifty percent yeah well you don't want to know something else the percentage of Americans that call themselves liberal is shrinking now into the high mid thirties [noise]\nThirty five percent tops the American people identify themselves as liberal [noise]\nHe doesn't say that [noise] I'm adding that

percent\nThat here we go now this is a long piece but this next Grapel is just money crafts\nReady [noise] well educated whites especially white women [noise] are pushing the Democrat Party just simply leftward according to Gallup the\nShare of white Democrats calling themselves liberal on social issues has grown since two thousand and one from thirty nine sixty one percent of because of this growth white liberals are now roughly forty percent of all democratic voters\nWhile a substantial percentage of Democrats minorities identify as liberal those percentages have not been growing and anywhere near the rate they have for white Democrats [noise] wait a minute\nInto thousands of Lebanon white working class was totally go to hell\nNow all of a sudden the white women are the majority of the party and the the percentage of the Democrats represented by [noise]\nMinorities [noise] is not growing [noise]\nYou mean [noise]\nI guess that's why Trump's approval number amongst Hispanics Latinos and African Americans is at a record high [noise] for Republican candidates [noise] [noise] [noise] while a substantial percentage Democrat minorities identify as liberal those percentages have not been growing anywhere near\nThe rates if they had been for white Democrat so blacks and Hispanics have not contributed significantly to the rising percentage of self identified Democrats liberals [noise]\nIn fact says Mr Thomas Bee ends all white liberals are well to the left of the black electorate on some social issues take the issue of discrimination as a factor holding back African American advancement white liberals are to the left of black Democrats\n[noise]\nPlacing a much stronger emphasis them African Americans [noise]\n[noise] now wait because earlier this week we
