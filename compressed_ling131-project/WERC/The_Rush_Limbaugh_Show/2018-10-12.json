risking their lives\nDoes University of St Thomas engineering school in Minnesota thermal and fluids sciences professor Dr John Abraham\nHe's a professor actually believe the Florida Panhandle residents deserve to get hit by a catastrophic hurricane because they elected climate deniers here's the headline\nAnd an article written by this guy was published in the guardian not some obscure

reaping what we so\n\nPeople just like this are teaching your kids\nAnd they're being paid a lot of money to do it this is the wild chicken the reasoning that he is teaching these engineering school the guy is still reigns this is this is hyper political partisanship disguised as science\nHe thinks that voting for Republicans causes hurricanes to hit red states and the people in red states\nWho voted Republicans deserved to get wiped out by hurricanes for voting for Republicans\nAnd his name is Dr John Abraham a University of St Thomas engineering school in Minnesota\nDespite the lack of science to support his case Dr Abraham blames Michael's intensity on manmade global warming there isn't any evidence for it it's not the most intense hurricanes ever hit the panhandle [noise]\nYet he blames the intensity or manmade global warming are needing to his subsequent claimed that southern voters brought this upon\nThemselves by voting Republicans into office ...\nInto one or the other states like Florida which will get pummeled by Michael couldn't vote for somebody that denies climate change this doctor wrote\nPointing to governor Rick Scott andme to Senator Marco Rubio on the his

like this professor\nA professor of engineering literally tells people\nThat if you want to stop hurricanes from blowing up where you live vote Democrat it's because you're voting Republican and and denying climate change that these hurricanes are coming after you know do you remember after Hurricane Katrina you people might have thought that I was joking there were people\nIn the leftist medium\nWho literally we're trying to tell people in New Orleans that George Bush wanted that hurricane to strike Louisiana he wanted it specifically the strike\nNew Orleans this is why there weren't any warnings it wanted it to strike New Orleans because Bush knew that residents of New Orleans would have to abandon the city\nAnd go to Texas\nWhere as Democrats they would be absorbed and wouldn't affect any political outcomes but in Louisiana you can turn the state Republican if they get rid of a bunch of New Orleans Democrats and sort of people out there saying that Bush actually wanted the hurricane to wipe out New Orleans so that residents will have to leave\nI Would have to go to Houston ...\nThere were some even saying that Bush was doing what he couldn't just steer the hurricane that Bush was responsible for it because Bush told the weather service\nTo downplay the warnings [noise] [noise] well I didn't want to mention it but I'll go ahead mentioned there were some that now these were not mainstream media people but they did repeat this there were people out there talking maybe it won't it takes on the Internet Hoover claiming that Bush was steering the hurricane\nRemember that\nThat Bush was steering that hurricane Bush himself the president was nearing the hurry and and what this guy is professor at the University of St Thomas's no different\nBy claiming that simply the way people vote determines where a hurricane goes how stronger hurricanes going to be and whether or not the hurricanes gonna wipe you out and he doesn't know yeah it's the

degrees\nOr you have large swaths of Canada Russia China that are you know on a tell all turn into a better agricultural areas and we ended up a feeding more people a case in point\nA a mayor ten

trying to scare everybody into signing onto this because it's it's classic if you sign on to agreeing on the whole premise of climate change your dream to a lot you're agreeing you are to
