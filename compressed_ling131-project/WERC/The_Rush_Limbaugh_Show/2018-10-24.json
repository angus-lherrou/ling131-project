let's get some of the election analysis the midterms are Thirteen Days away two weeks ago from yesterday\nTom ... who was cofounded real clear politics and it is a it's a website that many political scientists political operatives a political experts cite constantly what what real clear politics does among many other things is average\nAll of the so called response civil polls out there into something called a real clear politics average of polls\nAnd political experts from across the aisle site\nReal clear politics and trusted as an unassailable source so combat and cofounder of this place\nWas on a C Fox Business network today he said that if there was a blue wave that it would be cresting at this point\nMimi it'd be building we'd be we'd be seeing the top of it here\nAnd Tom Bevan sat in all the polling data that they have it real clear politics and analyzing it's not\nThere is no crafting there is no blue wave if a wave was coming it would be building he says and it isn't\n\nBut on the other hand the generic ballot is holding\nMeaning the Democrats are not running away with it they still have a ... depending on three to five point lead in the generic ballot but they're not expanding it there's no growth there is no Democrats pulling away as what happened with a blue wave Trump's job approval is rising\nDemocrats are in the advantage that ... says but they're not building on anything there's no way that's got to wash everything away and leave only Democrats standing he says the house races are really tight they are race by race\nReal battles hand to hand combat is how he described it\nHe forecast that Democrats might win the house\nThat they do have an advantage right now because they have a range of seven day competitive races and the range of pick up as they look at polling data now is anywhere from Democrats picking up ten to forty one seats they're projecting a democratic pickup\nOf twenty five and a half seats which given the slightest bit Democrats need to pick up twenty three that's the magic number anything above that Democrats have an advantage in the house\nThe range of the pickup according to the polling data real clear politics takes a look Savage anywhere from ten to forty one seats they project a pick up a twenty five seats twenty of of that sort of two and a half seats more than they need\nBut with even a tiny shift in just a couple of races there GOP can hold the house\nSo all of this synthesized and stripped away and they went to bear essence there isn't a blue wave there isn't this blue wave that's going to sweep every Republican away and leave only Democrats standing\nThe generic ballot is not moving in Democrats' favor Trump's approval numbers are rising\nOver on the Senate side ... and real clear politics project the Republicans are going to gain two seats two weeks ago they were predicting no change Republicans wouldn't gain or lose any\nTwo weeks before that the Democrats were going to pick up seats in the Senate so in the past month we've gone from Democrats picking up a couple two Republicans gaining a couple and that's the momentum and that's the trend\nAnd he made the point that it's a whole

this if they care about the elections none whatsoever but flip\nThat [noise] flip that around ... would it make a lot of sense for a democratic operative or Democrat in cocaine and a lunatic to do it

you do with your memory\nOh yeah and I think I'm responsible for that because of a joke I used to tell about Hillary\nYeah and so Michele milk and you know put that to bed as far as it was you know it was a plant\nWill tell people what it was ... tell me because I stepped on it tell people what it is\nOh sure sure so back in two thousand and eight or in order to garner sympathy and empathy for the ...\nUm there was a gentleman or series of gentleman that were walking around the Hillary camp for president campaign of two thousand and eight with signs saying iron my shirts iron my shirts of

and ... story\nUm we paid for my bachelors I'm a school like mom it's totally paid for and\nWe got shorter cosmetology school and we passed what her car and we were sitting there with about thirty five thousand dollars in savings good I'm twenty four and she's calling them and go I was planning on going in graduate school you're in state mhm once I finish my bachelor's mhm\nAnd I was going to

okay well I well here's what I Would do I would not shocked I Would not cash out those Ross unless I have to but you can take the money out of the raw to talk to your tax people and be sure but I'm pretty sure you can take the money out of there off the portion you put in without\nAny taxes or penalties on it\nOkay that's where it was on there yeah\nI don't want you to do that today I'd rather

I had ten years ago and I left the money in the air I miss about twenty seven thousand dollars and ants um growing in ancient trade off a fabulous an annual and I was going to leave it there and to the average time if I can retire\nAt sixty two which is I can I'm Seventeen years [laughter] but I did the math and it's only gonna be sixty three thousand dollars out of the time I turn takes me to\nTake that money out and um [noise] I I'd be a part of the house the two Seventy five when an ... loan so the model a note on that if I Eighteen hundred should I take that money out and refinance talking on a lower mortgage and then saying them different from the mortgage when now I'm no\nNo I Would roll it to an IRA and pick out some good growth stocks mutual funds that have long track records of ten years or more you should be able to make twice what you're making all this money\nOkay like north of ten percent most of my mutual funds of averaged over twelve percent and you can pick mutual funds that have done that by getting with a good investment advisor that teaches you you have\nGet some more with the heart of a teacher you don't just do something because they should do it or because somebody in the shoots and do it\nBut you sit down with them you learn how that works and you put it in good mutual funds and do what I are a roll over from that money the way to find somebody to help you do that I'm not in that business but we have a group of people we recommend you can click on smart investor\nAt Dave Ramsey dot com and you put in your information that drops down a list of the ... the people that we recommend in your area and then you can select from among them\nAnd I'm a shutdown with one of them and they'll talk to you and teach you and take your time learn about this\nGet comfortable with the idea but I think you can make a lot more on this money than you're making on it now and if you just pull it out you're going to get hammered on taxes\nAnd penalties for that matter [noise] Emily is with us in Detroit Hi Emily welcome to the day Ramsey show\nHang day thanks so much for taking my call sure how can I help\nSo I have a question not as much right now but for my parents my husband and I were introduced to Pierre and\nAbsolutely love that and we are just because they can to and we have a longer plan with a whole bunch of student loans that were just trying to ... and it's how they going to take a few years and\nI guess he my parents thinking in that horrible kind of despair\nAnd being completely broke and overwhelmed and jets or thing or how that felt as though I just calling for advice on how how I can influence them because they really like and fight for their kids and even in my thirties now it doesn't matter it's like I'm Still okay\nIt's called the powder ... syndrome once someone has powder dry but they don't really want your opinion\nAbout right about money or sex okay and so the only time that reverses when they get really really really old and at that point an adult yeah yeah but um that you generally doesn't happen and so it you know it's like a friend that's being obstinate\nBecause you're both grown people you're grown your parents are grown\nAnd they're being obstinate about something and you just have to watch somebody that you love do self destructive stupid things like I've got a friend is an alcoholic and he's going to kill himself if he doesn't go drinking\nI mean I and and I've talked to him and people will talk to him people dumped on him we love him all that but I Can't make him want to stop drinking he has to decide that right\nAnd it's really painful to watch people you love do stupid stuff to kill themselves you know I mean money wise or anything else so the only thing that I've had any success doing\nIs to possible approaches one is ask yourself if there's anyone that they look up to\nOn the subject of business or money it does he have a brother that he thinks is brilliant or is do they have a friend or a pasture that they think is they trust their judgment and then try to get that person who does have credibility with them to speak into their life\nThat's a possibility the other possibility that probably will be more likely is for you not to say a word about their habits or their financial situation but every time you're around them tell your story\nMhm mom we were ... mom we
