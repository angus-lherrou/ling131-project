money that's still exposed to risk there you go to Amy down there isn't getting manage manage risk and doing that strategic look at your money making sure that you do the calculated risk exposure level on the money that's at risk so based on their risk you're taking how much could you lose the market with the wrong way\nAnd then how much in company needs so let's take some of that money out of the risk account let's get an income plan that will build our money where our money give us income that we know what the income will be at a certain age and our life for the rest of our life and the rest of our spouse's life\nKnowing that if we pass away too soon that money will go on to our next again so it doesn't lose\nYou can't lose the money yeah sure it's either there for us or is there for somebody else and back in the old days if you if you got a personal pension like that and you passed away the money was gone\nSo [laughter] but now the the world has changed for the better for us if you get with a fiduciary plan or they'll put together a plan that makes sense to you that will give you that lifetime income it'll give you the growth of the market on one side it'll give you the income on the other side it's income planning and it's ... it's what changes every a financial plan into\nA retirement plan it Cinderella is carriage that never turns into a punk and think about that there you go yeah you know that that's about twelve o'clock at night and into a buck and yeah and that will never turned above and if you do it right so you never worried about having to get home to see the uh step mom again\nThere you've got what we always you know we always hope for the best and I was talking to you or the other day in the hallway about this coach about uh we're putting some video content together I think for one of the videos that we do on financial ... dot com and I saw a video clip those from a news outlet and it was done and I think Nineteen Ninety nine two thousand and it was showing the projections of the stock market for the next Twenty years if you don't\nKnow that oh eight is going to happen you don't know the oh and one is getting what they call the projections for me [laughter] just like Hillary was projected ... let me ask you [laughter] [laughter] but let me ask you this\nDo you think a lot of people because you obviously meet with folks on a daily basis you and the team upstairs right do you find that most people have these optimistic projections and that when you actually run the numbers and they see what actually could happen there is a little bit of a blinds open\nYeah and one of the parts is and that's just one of the faces of retirement planning is looking at what you're going to have yeah the other phases especially when we get like a one year away from retirement especially we need to look at what are expenses are going to being retired OK yeah and so we make sure that our income has gone to exceed or outcome\nOr I'll go try as we want more money coming in and you've heard me talk about it before when\nWhen you have a true income plans set up inside your financial plan it turns into retirement plan but an income plan is when the mailman brings you money each year he puts that green flag on the mailbox\nAnd you walk out every every couple of weeks and put red flags on to send your bills out so you want you want a bigger green flag yeah then all the red flags that it together and therefore you have more income than than money going out and that's a successful retirement that's one that you have\nA peace of mind and you don't have ulcers and you're not worried about turned the TV running home to turn the TV ought to see if your retirement a gal still there because of what happened in marketing and I believe it or not I know we laugh about it but but I Know a lot of people listening or looking at each other right now saying do we really have\nA retirement plan yeah yeah coach feet of course we establish why I'm coach Pete the original ... says that it's a financial plan is only a financial plan until you have income built into it now it is a true retirement plan and that income has to have to have growth\nIt has to have protection and it has to have income guarantees for the rest of your life that is a true\nIncome plan it's none of these phony baloney plastic banana kind of reached that we hear about silver and gold all these fly by night promissory notes all these get rich quick schemes it's a real regulated retirement plan there you go and most people don't have that Thomas I think everybody out there needs to review\nThere's three things that happened when we do a review\nNumber one we tell you you're doing great everything's fine I Would not change a thing when the great to get that sample of improvements right yes or it's hey you just need a couple of weeks but you can get right back on the track\nMaybe you're on that train track in and you took the wrong turn and now you just have to reverse a little bit and get back on the real trick on a bad thing or number three either don't have a plan or the plan or you have had\nHas been misleading you thinking you did ... and then we can do a total rebuild redesign for you in three steps we do twenty two steps behind the scenes it's called our total retirement plan\nIt's a nine hundred and Ninety nine dollar value probably more than that when you look at all\nIn ours but we've all the price of the nine Ninety nine you can buy it off the shelf if you want or you can come in as a radio listener we ... it includes

God this day after the deadly sin a God massacre that claimed eleven lives yesterday morning\nAnd [noise] here's what I have found today [noise] CNN is spending almost eighty percent of their time on the show [noise]\n\nEighty percent may have even if it's sixty percent of their time on your show again they're not focusing on the care of him [noise] vet tells me that if the caravan wore a Democrat idea designed to embarrass Trump that they would be covering it [noise]\nAnd building it up and with people down there interviewing these people creating sob stories it'd be there'd be mantle is treated abuse what a mean guy Trump is are they just want to come to America and that may yet happen down the road but the un is is not wall to wall but they are predominantly [noise]\nFocusing on the show Gabe and of course whatever CNN does just to try to damage Trump let's let ... wife CNN is so ticked off because Trump's approval numbers are higher than they've ever been now and there are higher than Obama's war at this stage in the ah in his mid terms with the same point\nPresidency after two years there just beside themselves none of this is happening the way it was supposed to happen now there's more and more stories about how the blue wave may not happen can't pin it never was going to happen I don't think anybody's ever known whether it's going to be a blue wave they've been relying on polling data but nobody knows for sure [noise] that was that the media narrative\nIt was a meeting that was not born of any evidence there could be any evidence for a blue wave or a red wave the electric hasn't happened yet\nNobody wants to rely on polling data to suggest that it's going to happen but the polling data hasn't been accurate either starting in two thousand six dean of the presidential race\n\nSo we've got this caravan chugging north and I think you know put some things in perspective on this\nAgain the way to look at it is is as a a microcosm\nOf what's happening every day and our border every day this is what's happening\nNot seven thousand a day but but but every day this is what's been going on for decades and it needs to stop\nAnd Donald Trump is the only person that's ever talked about working to make it stop now the Democrats\nIf there are behind this one of the strategic ... besides getting somebody hurt\nAnd blaming that on Trump maybe what they're hoping is a Trump actually won't do anything about it\nMaybe they're hoping that Trump will be all helping to puff talk about sending the military down they're talking about setting a National Guard down but not actually doing anything they might be rolling the dice that Trump isn't going to do anything because they think they've rattled prompt\nWith their stories earlier this year about how he separated\nFamilies the board and how Trump didn't like that where they didn't want it but last so he did what he could change it I\nI Do know this despite everything that you think you wouldn't know the common sense there are still Republicans elected Republicans look at this caravan and their solution is to let them in\n\nAs like the ... they are ... you're about peace yesterday they are so scared of this issue they are so scared\nThat when ever the subject of illegal immigration comes up Democrats automatically when Republicans think they've got their show they're not cold hearted mean spirited and all that let them if they're not publicly saying this but I Know that they're they're\nMaybe the Democrat gambling is too is is is a wild guess at Trump's actually not\nGoing to do anything after huffing and puffing and I'll tell ya if Trump doesn't do anything\nIf this caravans allowed to get to the border and come into the country what do you think that wouldn't do the Trump there's one issue that could separate Trump from his voters or at least make his belt voters began to\nI don't no doubt is the right where they would be mightily disappointing particularly after Trump has said over and over again that this caravan is not going to get it if if if if some\nRepublicans are behind this than that it's obvious uh but I just somebody has to be\nSomebody has to be making this happen folks we're talking with we we've got how many two thousand\nMiles stop and think of this from Honduras to the southern\nBorder of the United states assistance Arizona is around two thousand miles\nSeven thousand people one day\nJust decided to start walking to the United states two thousand miles\nI also think if you're looking for people behind this you have to look at the drug cartels\nAnd if you want to start trying to analyze will what their politics in this movie that opens up a whole new can of worms but I don't doubt that they are playing a major role in transportation\nBut there has to be political involvement here too because the money has to be available there has to be money being spent on this\nSo you've got seven thousand people who all of a sudden and decide all of a sudden because nobody saw this coming and there was no advance word of it seven thousand people to sign to start walking\nTo a thousand miles\nWe don't see pictures of of of where they're using the bathroom\nWe don't see pictures of them gathering or getting food and eating it\nI mean look at random video you might you might see some people really think we don't see how this is being handled we don't see the port a potties we don't see in or they just urinating and rivers and streams what would the environmental was wackos thinking about that if that's happening\n\nWell I guess you you may have a point welcome to San Francisco they could already be accustomed to it especially the deaf occasions in the street and they get maps in San Francisco for tourists couldn't blame the piles of human DC\n\nSo how long would it take to walk two thousand miles along with a ...\nRemember they're vowing altogether I just hit the southern border of Mexico they're vowing to get here by mid term election\nDay so I don't walk enough to know how many miles\nA day you could walk if you just start walking and you take a periodic break and after twelve or Eighteen or whatever you stop or slow down and rest for the next\nDay that people tell me that\nThey would have to be walking something like twenty miles a day\nFor one hundred days I mean if that makes sense to a thousand miles twenty miles a day for a hundred days without any rest\n\nA hundred days for those every unreal Linda that's over for three months\nAnd the objective is to show up\nRight as the polls open on mid term election day so if they have been walking for what two and a half months\nHave we seen video of the walk and it's beginning\nRemember the caravan was originally thirty five hundred or four thousand people now it's swollen just seven thousand and the word is it may become ten thousand [noise]\nAnd then of course ah ladies and gentlemen the caravan now has been joined by a second the caravan\nThat we are just hearing about Fox News and the a P report that a second the caravan of illegal immigrants has formed in Honduras\nAnd has already crossed into

city over the weekend said we're concerned that these migrants may be victimized by human smugglers are others who what exploit them are also deeply concerned with the violence\nProvoked by some members of the group as well as the apparent political motivation of some organizers of the care of it by the way the [noise] the details on that story are from the uh [noise]\nOh here's one from NBC and they are literally outraged over what Tom pales saying secretary of state Pompeo raised the stakes last night as thousands of Central American migrants [noise]\nInvaders [noise]\nHeaded for the United states as they marched into may go claiming they were inciting violence palm pay also they're inciting violence under the influence of politically motivated the leaders\n[noise] how is it raising the stakes\nAre deployed out what is happening what is the secretary of state Pompeo raised the stakes Sunday night how was it raising mistakes to point out what's happening [noise]\nEspecially when [noise]\nWe have a party a political party that believes in open borders a media and the party that believes in open borders they will never report anything negative about these invaders [noise]\nRight mind would want this [noise] who in their\nRight mind wouldn't want any of this illegal immigration who in their right mind would promote this didn't want this who wouldn't want a mob an invasion of seven thousand now eight thousand people to storm the border in the world would want that and why [noise]\nIt makes no commonsense under the umbrella of what's good for America [noise]\nWhat ever the motivation for the people who want this to happen it's not for the good of America it's got to be for something else so Pompeo goes down and promptly identifies what's happening here NBC says raising mistake what's cakes\n[noise] [noise] [noise]\nWe have somebody finally pushing back on this because remember the Republican Party up until Trump never didn't push back on this they they came up with their own reasons for wanting [noise]\nAmnesty for illegals and for you know having a fall push on securing the border on Sunday night ... who met with the Mexican president\nWent on the offensive alleging at a statement that many of the migrants were criminals themselves by definition they are if they intend to cross the border illegally they're all criminals [noise]\nOne of the world is so damn hard to understand about this [noise] [noise] [noise] I think it's a classic\nIllustration of how soft discovery is getting in one of the reasons this country is getting soft just because the elderly or senior generations are turning over everything to the young who haven't lived\nLong enough to know what's best [noise] are being driven stolen by a motion to govern slowly by a motion\nNot any ... any kind of common sense and because there's some odd quirk\nThat's happened [noise] in our sociology\nAdults today seem unwilling to teach young people were right and wrong or to help them benefits from the wisdom that comes from having lived a bunch of life and having a may I ask a bunch of experiences\nThere is no way under the sun this makes any sense what so ever\nWe may as well not have a border if this is something that people want to advocate for permitting and allowing males will just erase the border and said to the world come on in\nBecause that's in essence the impact of this if it's not stopped if it's not dealt with\nThe people of the world do not have an entitlement to the United states taxpayers back pocket but the Democratic party assumes or seems to think that they do\nThe Democratic party is calculating that there are more people who want to get in to the American taxpayers back pocket than there are American taxpayers\n\nAnd saw the Democrat Party is siding with\nThe people around the world who have nothing who thinks it because the United states has a lot they should just be able to come in and get whatever they want\nAlmost as an entitlement we have a political party pushing this we have a political party promoting this this political party ought to be no where near winning any thing\nIn the next elections\nThere is not a single reason to vote for these people under any rubric of common sense\n\nTake a look at the things they advocate take a look at the people they try to destroy take a look at the things they are promoting\nIt defies common sense to support this\nAnd frankly I don't think they have as much support as the media narratives would indicate\nI don't want somebody to tell you right now I don't believe and I haven't believe for a long time that there has been this slam dunk blue wave what we're being told right now is that six months ago nine months ago all the way back to December when the first generic ballots were taken a generic polls\nWhat do you think what happened to the Democrats in the media and he was there was a red wave midterm analysis and reaction you think they sell this drawn use radio one o\nW we are the [noise]\nI'm going to get to that CNN [noise] CNN\nPlaying an impartial ... by the media to make it look like I was trying to make the case that can show you deserve to get killed because he was an ally of Osama bin Laden I never said any such thing I said the fact the exact opposite so yeah\nYeah a lot of people worked up about that here on the other side of the glass I'm going to get to it in due course same thing on this transgender business the Trump Administration is attempting to eliminate the whole classification and I'm going to tell you why I agree with that but all of that coming up here's the final Louie Gohmert bite again bill hammer\nOr we're concerned these migrants may be victimized by human smugglers are others who would exploit them were also concerned or is this ... saying this we're concerned about violence promote by some members of this group\nAll of these people trying to force their way and it's called\nAn invasion and thank God we have a president that will stand up to an invasion of like this but I don't know our constitution that Governor thing call out military troops to stop an invasion and I've heard of people on TV so called experts say where you can use the military because of the positive comments out of ...\nThat normally prevents military from being used against its own citizens it has nothing to do with using the military to stop an invasion from another country so\nThere was nothing unconstitutional illegal about the president doing what we do a Wilson did put tens of thousands of people on the border and make sure nobody forces there way\nIt's a no brainer folks get is a number of the president can do that and has committed to it [noise]\n... he may not send the military and I may call as a as a congressman Gohmert says there but there is no law says he can't\nThis is an ... what is what is seven thousand Russians were about to force their way into the okay\nWhat a seven thousand Russians are about to force their wife or the southern border\nTo try to affect the mid term elections or what if we can make that case what do you think the people would eat demanding Trump do stand aside and left to seven thousand Russians in so they can hack our computers and make sure the Republicans win them in terms of it's a joke folks at the joke you never know who's listening\nI'm just asking you what if it's seven thousand Russian communists thank God I was trying to get in [noise]\nIt's an invasion either way you look at here is Mike in Youngstown, Ohio getting a call in here in the first hour welcome sir how are you\nGood good Russian I Hope you and your family's all of it on good\nListen I say this has all the makings of a bad set up for Trump\nBecause of the optics are I don't care if you're militarized is the border if they bomb rushed the border like ... down in the southern side of Mexico where they tried to stop what started military supposed to break out the times or water hoses or a\nTear gas that's just going to look so bad that Trump is going to take the brunt of it but he needs that there was a [noise]\nA house and the Senate back into the emergency session and doing national address and put everybody on the line not just try to deal with this themselves\nAre so bring them back in for a special session or their wife passed legislation specifically saying that this mob is seven thousand can't come in\nSomething though that sort\nI mean do you think Trump needs to share the burden of providing the optical that if Trump sends a military down and he started cracking the heads and it looks bad for Trump exactly so you think that's what the actual intention here is whether people planned this thing\nExactly and that's where it can try to deal with this on his own she leaves to put everybody else or but on the line and get them on tape on film or whatever what should we do what what do you like to do if they come across\nActually like that in a way I like making Schumer\nAnd Pelosi a stand up for letting these people it [noise]\nAnyway it's a good point it's a it's it's it's a it's a dangerous situation

people up it divides is horrible\nYeah oh it's just it's very very dangerous it's very bad out there Trump spreading lies stoking fear every election there's Jeff Flake out who himself has been

yesterday the real reason they hate Trump\nAnd let me give you some pull quotes from this piece every big us elections interesting but the coming midterms are fascinating for a reason most commentators forget to mention the Democrats have no issues\nThe economy is booming America's international position is strong in foreign affairs the U.S has remembered in the Nick of time what Machiavellian biased\nPrince says five centuries ago don't seem to be loved to seek to be feared\nIn contrast with the Obama years it must be painful for any on us leftist for future generations the capital of fight will stand as a marker of the Democratic party's intellectual bankruptcy the flashing red light on the dashboard that says empty\nThe left is beaten\nAnd this is so right on the money they're not have to resort to these charades and and and really devastating tricks like this caravan\nThe whole cabinet episode was was intellectually bankrupt it was morally bankrupt it was politically bankrupt and yet they persistent with it\nEven to the point of carrying not that they were destroying and American Life and American family in American career ended American future they couldn't have cared less\nThis is the bankruptcy of decency and the Democrat Party has non left\nAs this ... says this has happened before in the eighties in the nineties in the early to thousands but then the financial crisis arrive to stave liberalism from certain destruction\nToday left just pray that Robert Mueller will put on his Superman outfit and save them again for now though the left only issue is we hate Trump [noise]\nThis is an instructive hatred because what the left hates about Donald Trump is precisely what hates about America the implications here are important and they're painful [noise]\nThis is instructive hatred because what the left hates about Donald Trump is precisely what if you hate about America\nAnd hate America does\nFolks\nNot that every leftist hates America but the leftist I Know\nRight to go work at ...\nThey do hate Trump they hate Trump's vulgarity they have his unwillingness to walk away from a fight they hate his blood as they hate his certainty that America is exceptional\nThey hate his mistrust of intellectual they hate his love of simple ideas that work they have\nHis refusal to believe that men and women are inter changeable\nAnd worst of all\nHe doesn't have any ... except getting the job done his goals are to do the task before him not be pushed around it otherwise enjoying life in short Donald Trump is a typical American except exaggerated because he has no constraints to cramp his style except\nThe ones he himself in vans and uses\nI'll tell you folks and this\nIs a heck of a paragraph in his instructive itself they hate Trump's vulgarity and yet they are the kings of vulgarity Democrat Party the American laughter synonymous with vulgarity day but they sit there and hypocritical claimed to despise Trump's\nThey hate that he won't walk away from a fight they hate that he is blond they hate\nHe is certainty that America is decent than exceptional they hate certainty that's what I have found over the years that\nPeople that have have serious problems with me I was able to boil it down they hated the fact I was so certain that I didn't have any doubts about what I Believe I've\nHad so many people it's just not right and everybody is that you you just don't wait to nobody can be that kind of an open I Am I Know your full of it I Know you're wrong and I know you haven't even thought halfway about this or you'd be doing the right thing they can't\nStand that they love it quid vacation they love people see both sides of the things they he reaching\nOut with the heart they hate certainty especially when the conflict with their own\nNow back to Trump he lacks constraints that the left hates him or because he's filthy rich always has been and unlike other rich man he rebels and well he doesn't feel any need to apologize for it ever he never learned to keep his real opinions to himself because he's never had to\nHe never learned to be embarrassed that he's male with ordinary mail proclivities\nGuy like swimming doesn't see the need to apologize for sometimes\nHe's treated women disgraceful a for which Americans left in writer shamed of him as they are of JFK and Bill Clinton but Gartner says my job as a voter is choose the candidate who will do best for America\nI'm Sorry about the ... of ... constrained the average American that Mr Trump conveys that course and this is unprecedented makes us look bad in other nations but on the other hand\nMany of Trump's opponents\nToo much about what other people think I Would love the steam of France and Germany and Japan but I don't find myself losing sleep over it\nThe difference between citizens who hate Mr Trump and those who can live with him whether they love are merely tolerating it comes down to their views of the typical American the farmer\nThe factory ham the auto mechanic machinist teamster shop owner clerk software engineer infantry men truck driver housewife\nLeftist intellectuals I Know say they just like such people in so far as they tend to be conservative Republicans that's true and that's a large group of people to hate that's a large group of people to dislike\nAnd oh All

[noise] the American the southern border [noise] and to demand to be let in\n[noise] [noise] [noise]\nSomebody thinks or some group of people think somehow that this is helpful to the ... Democrats cause [noise] other ways this could be helpful\nTo Democrats causes if some damn violence occurs to them or if I'm a they're able to show that Trump and his supporters are so mean spirited cold hearted that they don't care about the suffering of denied entry in this kind of thing\nBut but for the media to act like this is a a normal news event like any other normal news event it just happened that we're going to cover it and we're going to report it but there's no political objective attached to this is absurd [noise]\n[noise]\nI mean I I saw a um [noise] I saw a video tape of what's this guy's Jorge\n... Ramos or whatever is it what did he tell among do ... what what what is a tele tell them no but what is it [noise] ... right and he's standing there as as a bunch of these people are walking past it I don't know where he was ... somewhere in the midst of the mob\nWhere packs of three and four or walking by and by the way\nFolks [laughter] they don't look like the kind of people you'd want to run in to [noise] you know on the street I mean they they just anyway he's standing there and these people are walking past him he's not looking at I'm behind him and then they walk past him on his left shoulder\nAnd he's bouncing for [noise] he's telling everybody who they are [noise]\nAnd what they want and why we must let them in and that they're decent people and all they want is a better life and we as Americans we owe it to these people don't let them in [noise] ... all they want is what we want we all have these\nVarious humanitarian objectives in common and I asked myself how would the world can this guy vouch\nFor whatever it is now eight thousand people but there he was down there vouch in trying to tell everybody watching him that these are ... these are the prince and print is in Central America these people are beyond reproach\nAnd he doesn't know them he has no idea who except I think he does I think he knows what the political objective is here and I think he supports it and is doing everything he can to advocate for this bunch which intends to be disruptive and destructive [noise]\nIn these guys say Trump sees a twofold advantage it's a way to argue his opponents have turned a blind eye to the problem [noise]\nAlthough Democrats remain strongly favored to win back the house overhead TV pictures of thousands marching north have the Democrats spoke asked about the timing worry them and national Democrats strategist ed in the Senate yeah\n[noise] what [noise]\nSo in the house it's a good deal in the Senate it's not a good deal they're Democrats are admitting that they're spooked over this even before\nThe caravan most congressional Democrats immigration as a loser for them\n[noise] a memo circulated among Democrats congressional offices in recent weeks\nSaid it is very difficult to win on that ... with a vulnerable voters in states Trump carried in two thousand sixteen even the most direct Kony and the Republican policies like family separation and deporting dreamers\nPersuaded relatively few of those polls to vote Democrat on Monday Trump on the leash to the explosion of immigration focus statements warning on Twitter that he made the point the military to the border and threatening to cut off aid to Guatemala Honduras and El Salvador which he has doubled down on by the way\nSo this is a story trying to tell brain dead people read political why Trump is talking nonstop about the care of him because it's going to help him with immigration\nWell [noise] [noise] [noise] who did they think is behind this [noise] some of the stuff\nIn the media is literally mind boggling that that the the attempt here to be on attached to it or disengaged Robert [noise]\nWhen when you get down to brass tacks most people in the media would be supportive of the people is caravan being allowed the lead in the country because they are everyday anyway whether people show up and groups to tour five or ten or in a Bob up seven thousand the left as in favor of letting them in\nAnd that are worried that this is going to be a boon to Trump [noise] [noise] right before the midterm elections which it is [noise]\n[noise] [noise] [noise]\nBut when you stop and think the Democrats are behind this has to be democratic donor money behind this and the reason I say this\nIt may make no sense that makes it would cause this report is right this is helping Trump's allied with the Democrats do this book they're not rational right now\nThis group of people throughout the media\nThe Democratic party itself and and all of their social media base voters I'm telling you are so\nPoisoned\nWith hatred and resentment all of these emotions they felt following election night two thousand sixteen and all of the times in the past two years they fought that Trump was gone\nYou gotta\nPut yourselves in their shoes everyday they've gotten up for two years and they've read in the New York times I'll Trump is toast\nThey've read it's only a moment of time before a matter of time before proof that he's ... loaded with ... is going to be revealed they believe these two years that Mahler has been goods so they get up everyday believing that Trump is history sooner rather than later and nothing happens\n... just keeps getting his rallies get bigger they get happier they get more raucous\nThe Democrats get more panic everything they do to try to take Trump out or to stop Trump in his tracks like the capital thing is backfiring on them and they got ... out there promising subpoena power\nSaying yeah we're going to investigate Trump we're going to investigate everybody in his administration as the reason for the Democrats to win back the house\nThey have they have lost all grounding here in in rationality\n\nAnd their perplexed because none of what they have done has worked in a white has worked its it's if it's getting back to the same old thing they can't persuade you to abandon Donald Trump they can't persuade you to stop going to Trump rallies they can't convince you to look at Trump and see him the way they do\nAnd they're just [noise] to be tied [noise] over there at their which candidate right now so they're

two weeks ago from yesterday Tom ... who was cofounded real clear politics and it is a it's a website that many political scientists political operatives\nA political experts cite constantly\nWhat what real clear politics does among many other things is average all of the so called response civil polls out there\nInto something called a real clear politics average of polls and political experts from across the aisle site real clear politics and trusted as an unassailable source so Tom ... cofounder of this place was on a C Fox\nBusiness Network today\nHe said that if there was a blue wave that it would be cresting at this point meaning it'd be building ... we'd be seeing the top\nOf it here and Tom Bevan sat in all the polling data that they have it real clear politics and analyzing\nIt's not there is no crafting there is no blue wave if a wave was coming it would be building he says and it isn't\nBut on the other hand the generic ballot is holding meaning the Democrats are not running away with it they still have a ... depending on three to five point lead in the generic ballot but they're not expanding it there's no growth there is no Democrats pulling away as what happened with a blue wave Trump's job approval is rising\nDemocrats are in the advantage that ... says but they're not building on anything there's no way that's gonna wash everything away and leave only Democrats standing\nHe says the house races are really tight they are race by race real battles hand to hand combat is how he described it\nHe forecast that Democrats might win the house that they do have an advantage right now because they have a range of seven day competitive races and the range of pick up as they look at polling data now\nIs anywhere from Democrats picking up ten to forty one seats they're projecting a democratic pickup of twenty five and a half seats which given the slightest bit Democrats need to pick up twenty three that's the magic number anything above that Democrats have an advantage in the house\nThe range of the pick up according to the polling data real clear politics takes it looks added anywhere from ten to forty one seats they project a pick up a
