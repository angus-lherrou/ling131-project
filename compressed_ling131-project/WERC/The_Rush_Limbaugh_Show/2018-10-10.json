I'm looking at a creating an automatic twenty five year sentence for anyone accused for anyone convicted of a sex crime there was a\nDeal where you took it out of the hands of the court to get out of the hands of the jury sentencing would already be pre determined by statute it'd be twenty five years minimum\nYou said I Need somebody I Need a Democrat who's against is\nAn old Riley was going to pound the table and talk about how tough he was on sex crimes that is what he was prepared to do I so often just somebody\n... you need to understand that statue is poorly written written\nAnd I'm conservative should not be for this libertarians certainly should not civil libertarians absolutely should not it's a poorly written it's basically a campaign statute is what it is it's designed to make someone look tough on sex crimes\nAnd he said you're against the law said yeah it's a terrible law because this was not written by a lawyer it was written by businessmen who was looking to run for another statewide office it's a terrible terrible\nLaw or it will not hold up it will not hold up under appeal\nAnd it should it's badly written sort of like some of our drug laws sent people to prison for life for possession of a amounts of marijuana that assumed they were dealing when in fact they were just big users\nAnd he said would you come on air with Bill and do absolutely so I did and he started he interrupted me and he started into pounding the table and somehow I was defending sexual criminals because that was the whole point is he just needed somebody to yell at that is what O'Reilly did\nAnd it really told me a lot about our discussion of things like this in\nThis case said that this story had happened about a week after a case in Vermont where a guy had raped about ten eleven twelve year old girl and he'd been sentenced he'd been given probation so everyone was angry so\nI had a lot of conversations about this after I went on a rally showing people would say well how do you account for what happened in Vermont where a jury gave the guy probation for raping a twelve year old\nI said juries are comprised of peers Vermont ers are more liberal they don't view sex crimes in the way we would in Texas in Texas that guy would have been given a stiff penalty just how how different we are in our sentencing\nAre representation in our criminal justice system should reflect\nOur values and the values in California Oregon or Vermont or simply different than they are in Texas Alabama or Louisiana and that's okay that's the way the system is supposed to work\nSo he said so\nWould email me is I Can't believe you you're you're you know you love pedophiles you and I said you know it's so easy for you to make such a stupid statement like that and I would write to people you know your son is going to be Seventeen going to have a fourteen year old daughter a fourteen year old girlfriend\nAnd she's going to be a week away from her fifteenth birthday they're going to have consensual sex and later he's going to be arrested for statutory rape and\nHe's going to be tagged in the same way that a fifty year old man that but ... and four year old boy is because we've taken that the desire to create these criminal sentences that don't allow a jury or a bench to consider the facts\nBecause in every case the facts are different and as human beings we trust a system that allows Cubans to look at um [noise] well we don't always liked the way humans decide cases the OJ Simpson case for instance but the answer to that\nIs not to say well I don't like what happened to the O.J Simpson case so from now on when someone's accused of murder we're just going to say you did it and we're going to put you to death within ten minutes 'cause it's easier\nIt's easier than grappling with the difficulties of the human foibles inherent in a system administered by humans\nBut if you think you can put every situation you can you can shoe horned that into a set of statues that's what people want they want laws that are self and forcing okay\nIf you're driving over sixty five on the road if you're driving sixty six will automatically say that you were speeding and you

I'm finding a lot of evidence in security for example I have a story here what is this is in the hill dot com and it's a column by somebody named Brent Butowsky\nWho sounds like the captain of a

popular in a respected Democrats with America's such as Michelle my bell Obama to lead the charge for all hands on deck at a critical moment for America and democracy [noise]\nIn my view writes Butowsky there is at twenty five percent chance of Democrats and the mid term as well the nightmare scenario what twenty five percent chance of a nightmare wife what you guys had it all locked up I thought you're pretty much had\nThe house already done although she's already talking about being speaker you guys are already planning to impeach investigate cabin on and Trump or first myself\n[noise] now there's a twenty five percent chance\nThat Democrats and the midterms in a nightmare scenario that's that's not quite the same as a Ninety three percent chance Hillary wins the presidency at five pm on election night ...\n... ... why are these people panicking [noise]\nMr Butowsky says this is not a moment for complacency or easy talk of blue waves it's a moment from Boulder maximum action and turnout based on a powerful urgent sense of opportunity in danger [noise]\nSays it's possible that Democrats when the house by a significant number of seats how ever it is also possible of Democrats again only\nWhen the seats falling short of winning control that would leave the Republicans nominate\nWith a smaller but even more right wing majority of the leading loser is in the house midterms are comparatively moderate GOP house members\nDemocrats could lose one or two Senate seats continuing a Republican Senate there's even further to the right and even more partisan than the GOP majority that day\nBooed ... says it's a ... in this nightmare scenario for Democrats and America if it unfolds a vindictive and triumphant Trump having won a victory for the politics of hatred and fear and don't you love [noise]\nMy point is again\nDo not fall for any of this hype that it is over\nAnd that the Republicans have no prayer and then there's going to be this gigantic blue wave because not even the Democrats in their private selves when they talk to each other in private and not even they really believe that\nThey want you to think they do they want you to be this theory of hand or depressed\nThey are very alarmed [noise] in fact that the latest polls that show the cabinet effect on the Republican side is ... up turnout ... up interest and they're really flux and ticked off\nAt a bunch of polling data there is an NPR poll out there there was a Fox News poll a couple of others but show some bourbon Republican women\nAre saying in polling data that they have a renewed interest and increased energy and intense desire to go vote this is not\nWhat we're supposed to happen that's why all these attacks lately in leftist media ripping into white conservative suburban\nWomen and do we need them or not and we don't\nThey say so this is not as we sit here today this is not developing as they want you to think it is [noise]\n\nBack in two thousand six then as you remember any pieces before the presidential race\nAnywhere in democratic media warning people hey hey you know what there is a nightmare scenario here were drunk and when you got to dial it back we've got to be very careful you remember\nAny of that there was none they were ... they were definitely of of ah convinced that they weren't going to win every Hillary was going to win and the biggest landslide [noise]\nI mean they had Trump's chances three percent seven percent ten percent\nBut nobody gave Trump a chance in fact some of the news even said Trump never thought he was gonna win Trump never even wanted to win Trump\nWas the most surprised guy intellectually in the world when he won he didn't want to win and they were all depressed that Trump quarters that's what they wanted you to believe [noise]\n\nNow they've started out saying the same thing has no power is a birthright that every American realizes that Democrats have to be put back in power every American realizes the mistaken voted for Trump every Trump voter can't wait to apologize every\nTrump voter realizes embarrassed wants to fix the mistake can't wait to vote for the next Democrat on their ballot\nNow all of a sudden it's not just Butowsky by the way either there are others who are\nRaising red flags out there that this might not be developing as they wish\nAlso from Fox News the homeland security secretary Kirstjen Nielsen said yesterday that the ... are engaged in an unprecedented influence campaign leading up to the terms\nThis is the Trump administration's latest warning that the check comes or attempting to sway American opinion I handled the elections\nOf ... wants a whim [noise]\n... what the Democrats to win right why do you think that is why why would a bunch of

Nashville I'm originally from Kansas so okay well welcome think in your ear to do that for ... yes I Am love it I'm not sure we paid off I paid off sixty thousand good and how long did this take it took me about three years okay and your range of income during that time\nI started out at fifty thousand and then on in the mid seventies I picked up a second job towards the end up my baby sat to sell what do you do for a living I'm an accountant I'm a CPA go watch the second job so I kind of just at a part time thing at the YMCA didn't earn a lot but it kept me out of trouble it kept me out of the story\nOf rubble target to get a little trouble yeah target gets me in trouble for that kind of draw balls or what kind of that was the sixty thousand with all student loans or what's your degree in\nAccounting I got my undergrad and master's degree in accounting\nDegree which obviously such a recent ... yes okay excellent excellent excellent so what happened three years ago is that when you got out of school\nYet so I graduated and and you know when you graduate they require that you do exit counseling with your financial aid and as terrible as it sounds I didn't really know what that number was going to be so I was kind of just doing my exit counseling\nHoping for the best and I saw how much I owed and it was terrifying\nBecause I knew what my starting salary was going to be and I owed more than my one year salary and so I saw that and I sold my monthly payments and then I saw all these different payment plans and you know I'm an accounting\nSo I knew the interest was going to add up quickly now and yeah it was just it was very scary but I knew about the baby steps so I just decided that's the route I was going to take poker show where did you know about the baby steps for him\nSo I actually listen to the ... when I was like in junior high and high school age\nAnd your financial outlook\nDoes and then my dad is a farmer in Kansas and in the summertime I Would drive tractor and combine and all you have out in the field is the radio and I didn't even have a cell phone back then yeah and so um you know I Would listen to FM radio and you learn quickly that they play the same songs over and over again\nSo then I learned about a man and I could switch to a and listen to talk radio and so on you know I listen to us and in the morning and then I switched to the day Ramsey show from one to for a nice little three hour break and listening to talk radio and then switch back to that and so it was just\nA nice nice little break in the day I have a strange new vision that shows you combine yes that's not how your tuning in the radio as you're out here uh get getting some uh we got a picture of it I don't know what was that we yes\nMy dad to wheat farmer do yeah we would drive combine and cut the wheat and you know after that we'd have to work the field\nThat was the youngest ever do that combined by yourself\nI probably say like twelve or Thirteen or something like that yeah I have two older sisters and they did the same thing so yeah\nYou learn how to work do you have to grow up on a formula or not or yes and you learn how to drive or like yeah [laughter] very cool All right so you this was drilled in your head you come out of accounting you get the degree you look up go Oh yes oh maybe step so I got her boards that guy from the radio then what happened\nAnd well I just jumped right into it I\nSo I went to Kansas State university I moved to Kansas City so it took me a couple of months to get established but then\nI jumped right in and I started paying off my debt and then I kind of hit a little bit of a bump in the road about a year into the process I was in a motorcycle accident and so I had to hit pause on the baby steps for about six to eight months and I just paid the minimum wage and and and then I picked it back up and was able to pay everything off but\nYou know I'm so thankful that I was working here plan because I mean I probably wouldn't have had an emergency funding place and not was\nSo important that I had that it was so helpful to me and made the terrible situation that I was in a so much more manageable so I'm just so grateful that I followed the plan and had that set aside you know it's very important\nSo many vehicles in the store go too much likely good for you yeah so how does it feel now that you did this\nIt feels amazing it's it's the best feeling in the world told her you I'm twenty eight\nTwenty another one of these rockstar millennials on all the time very well done very cool so um you talk to your dad and your mom you were doing all this stuff\nYes I did I talked about the plan constantly I was probably annoying throughout the process just talking about Dave Ramsey [laughter] but yeah five everyone kind of been in on the loop or who is your biggest cheerleader um [noise]\nProbably my sisters I have two older sisters and they are also working the plan and they're working on paying off their student loans right now so now I'm like they see me pay them off and you know there'll be next so you know we kind of treat each other on throughout the process perfect yes
