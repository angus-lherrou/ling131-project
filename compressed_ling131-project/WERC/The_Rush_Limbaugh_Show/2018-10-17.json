remember the stories that emerged [noise] at the schools of kids that would take their lunch and throw it in the trash ... and they were going hungry or middle school teachers pleading administrators pleading you don't understand the kids will eat the food\nWas horrible horrible [noise] so what was better\nThat they ate food with more calories than Michelle wanted or that they were calorie starved and yet refused to eat what was being offered [noise]\nYou know people don't always make the decisions that we would like them to make [noise] the question will be ... will we allow them to make the best decision for them [noise] we'll we'll allow them to decide\nWhat they'll put into their body [noise] ... simple or\nWill we allow parents to raise their children will will allow adults to make decisions for themselves or do we know better than them [noise] the the trick is to talk people into handing over power\nOver their lives so what do you have to do you have to first convince them their victims they're weak they're pathetic put upon their\nIn capable of taking control of their own lives\nAnd therefore they need to give it to you because you're Superman your great you'll\nSolve all their problems you'll lay all their fears\nThat's the message is not a healthy message it's not a message that will leave you long term a better person it's a message that calls on your weakest

all its really going to do at best is take from you the direction of your life\nAnd take from you that which you build that what you earn that which you accumulate that would you invent that would you create\n\nIf you ever reach a point where you seek excellence it won't be allowed because any government powerful enough to pull up everybody at the bottom rung are too will necessarily have to chop off\nThose at the top and that's one of socialism has never been intended for the best what kind of people if you stop and think about\nWhat kinds of people are drawn to the message of socialism the

want her to have that message they're always telling black people\nThat you're weak you need welfare you need special\nAccommodations you need special things you need extra stuff because those people are better than you you'll always be weaker never be stronger\nBut what if you are stronger what if you're black and you're bold and you're successful and your excellent when we want to put a mark on

saying that there were probably going to get proof of his interrogation and murder\nBecause it does apple watching here you'll come blowing up the whole thing pointing out how it's technologically not possible [noise]\nYou blow it up and you didn't even know it did I said well no because I wasn't aware of they were using the watch as that Central Asia at elements proving their case but then when ... said this to me I have the pause I had to constantly and then I have to consider he has a point\nBut it was one of the things I wasn't contemplating or calculating at the time I just I Know it's impossible there is no way that ... watch could have recorded anything can happen to him and there's no way it could have [noise]\nTransmitted or transferred it\nTo his iPhone which was in the

have a watch don't even know there watch will work on why most people think they got to have the phone right next to watch in Ninety nine percent of the time it right\nBut if you're a watch learns a

and they didn't even have it on the major news you couldn't find it anywhere in the economy is doing probably better than it's ever done in history and they don't even talk about it and that's because they have their opinion and they'd like to keep their opinion going the way they have it they do not treat us fairly and therefore we do the news they owe me on the news so I can talk about on myself\nAnd what about the your tweets and so for these people that say we don't want any more tweets anybody ever tried to tell you stopped waiting\nOh and I don't think that would be talking to you if I did that that's a way of getting out the message look we're fake news everyone's sake and I'm not saying you and some of the people on Fox not all of\nWhat some of them but there's so much mass information being put out [noise] that's my only form of communicating really other than having a press conference every hour of [noise] I don't go to eat and I thought social media would definitely getting the word I we have the greatest autonomy and the history of our country and it's not being reported\nOr you go it's that simple he's the only way to get his message out he's not gonna stop he loves it and the fact that they're getting frustrated them and just CNN media media whatever\nGuys they didn't do much talking residents just didn't feel much media there's too much he's gotta he's gotta stop promoting the country and so they're so frustrated they can't stop it [noise]\nMost of the cleaner corporate money far from her phone from one of my ...\nSeven from foreign votes out on my

to get [noise]\nSpecial counsel Robert Mueller is expected to issue findings encore aspects of this Russia probe soon after the November midterm elections as he faces intensify and pressure\nTo produce more indictments or shut down his investigation according to chew as usual anonymous unnamed but we don't even know if they're alive U.S officials\n[noise] [noise]\nAnd I can imagine the pressure from Democrats to produce something anything it has got to be in tents\nEverything has blown up autumn folks Kavanaugh has blown up on them focus on us in her latest blew up on them Hillary blow up on 'em Stormy Daniels blow up on them\nEvery attempt in October surprise this year alone previous October's is blown up and now you know they've thought all along the mother is going to get the good on how\nTrump's Foley election by shooting in colluding with the Russians\nAnd when this story broke that Muller is not going to deliver your key findings adult after the election you man Jimmy anger and the frustration not so much with the like the Democrats 'cause they know the they know the games you but they're they're looking to take\nThe reins psychologically screwed up base [noise]\nIs probably beside itself because this is really ball game for this is what they have been counting on they have been they've bought it they drank the Kool Aid that Mueller has the goods that Trump jaded with Russia mother has got it he's going to announce it trumps finished\nAfter them in terms wait a minute why\nNow there are two things about this books [noise]\nThe rules of this game which are going to be a baby here [noise] include that air report such as this from a special counsel will not be released [noise]\nWithin this close proximity to mid term elections it's an unstated rural it is a it it's an establishment or deep state rural and frankly I'm I'm surprised that it survived [noise]\nI Would not have been surprise surprise I mean it's it's a it's one of these unwritten rules of gentlemanly Washington procedure [noise]\nThat a bombshell report if any nature will be held until after the elections I thought that would blow up I thought that they would somehow find a way to release this thing wrong if not that leak it if it's got things in it that they like which the ladder is still possible [noise]\n[noise] [noise]\nSo Mueller and his buddies and the drive by media [noise] rather than\nBreak the rules and released a report prior to the election they're going to do the next best thing they're going to start talking about it all the time such as this story Muller ready to deliver key findings in his Trump probe\nSources say\nSo each day we're going to get references to the fact that ...\nDon rollers wrapped it up my mother is gonna be releasing at any\nMoment I got to be talking about before\nThe midterms in hopes in the hopes this was what they're hoping they're hoping that the acknowledgement that Mueller's report is done\nWe'll be perceived by voters as the proof that Trump's do the election is imminent that\nIs what they're hoping they're hoping that you and well I don't think they think you're going to fall for it but they were hoping that the great on washed out there [noise] the ill educated under educated on educated miss educated are going to believe [noise]\nThat it's only a matter of time\nBefore this report is made public proving that Trump colluded with Russia [noise] and that will then influenced the way they vote that means they will vote Democrat that's what the effort here is\nThey will create this cloud of suspicion this cloud of\nDanger\nThat port handles disaster for Trump they'll reference this each day leading up to the mid term elections\n[noise]\nAnd you'll hear people in the media speculate oh it could be trouble be removed after the midterms wouldn't blow it releases this report it could well be Trump's going to have to be removed to report my all of this is going to happen to one degree\nOr another to second thing [noise]\nThis tells me is that Mueller himself is waving to see who will be running Congress before he decides to really in\nThis [noise] because his report goes to Rosenstein who was technically his bosses at the department of ...\nThing we can think of was that I blow it out with the energy level here of the content of the program ... booted it were up and running now\nSo the downtime was minimal\nSorry for that if it affected you here's Tom in Morris county New Jersey and we have to the phones readings are great to have you here\nThanks rash thanks for doing everything that you do Russia I have two quick points uh one I'm a a lifelong Democrat I was a teacher I just retired and I have been the biggest Trump supporter out there\nFor for ... when does your support for Trump again\nDuring the campaign OK okay or the campaign and one of the reasons that I think\nDuring the primaries are during the day after he won the nomination\nPrimary primary okay against a seven anyway he um [noise] I became a Trump supporter one of the reasons was because she's got to be so good for the country and he is and I'm ashamed that Democrat my whole life that these people are happy to see the country doing well\nThat's what amazes me the most I mean I was always brought up the Democrats for fair and my dad was a Democrat my mom and that they sort of the country\nWhat you thought the Democrats for for the little guy looking out for the little guy and try to help the little guy make it economically and overcome obstacles Republicans wasn't away\nExactly and so so I'm very proud to be a Trump supporter but I'm about to pack it in I'm going to tell you why frustration is so high right now for not only my shelf people in the neighborhood because you said it before it was you were born and\nUm he said the Trump ... and he says she's the only reason the only way I can get my message out well\nHis tweets are good but not that many people really hear it and I can understand why he does not address the nation I don't understand ...\nWait a minute when you say when you say packing it and you mean you're about to abandon from\nThat advantage Trump but I'm really losing a lot of energy and frustration I really am because so many people don't know the good things that are happening they're not gonna learn preaching to the choir which ... most of the time and the press conference fish they skew anyway\nSo if he addresses the nation and he should it should be proud of what he's done the greatest time economically that I can never remember it I'm sixty six I can never remember anything like this\nIt is amazing in it but you know you said something here very by I Want to I Want to circle back to something you said\nAn observation you've made of the modern day Democratic Party that they don't seem to be happy right now the country's doing well they don't they don't seem to be encouraged or want to be included in it they don't want to even try to get some of the credit\nFor the country doing well in that shocks you write\nIt you know not anymore it's a ... year and a half ago but I'm starting to realize they don't care but the country\nThey really don't care about social issues they care about taking this guy down who I think the strongest guy since Reagan I've ever seen how we can take the bullets day after day I mean he's ... guy\nYour frustration is noted and I think it's shared by a lot of people what you're you're really\nYou you made it sound like your frustration is with Trump because he won't do a national address and try to reach people that his tweets don't read your audience that he that he doesn't rage but your real frustration in the U.S\nIs with a news media and many people are in the same boat who are doing their best to hide all of that and make sure people don't know it's\nIt's a joke amazed the frustration I've never been so frustrated in my life I Can't ... it ... me that was me out of the country so it was so well and so many people going to go out and vote and they have no idea your newscast and they\nWhy do you think you are a well why do you think you're one of the few people that let realize how great the country's doing if you think about why why do you think more people have\nListened to you reach\nThe but the economy you you said you've never seen anything like this in your life you don't need me to tell you the economy's doing well you see this on your own\nThree point seven unemployment are you kidding me with all the jobs and all of them are wages going up or might never seen anything my\nPoint is I think you can be a little confidence that you're not alone in seeing all of this\nAnd that more people are aware of it then you may know and of course you could be a it'd be understandable if you fear people don't know because the media is doing everything they can hide it or even worse lie about it\nAnd you are of the impression that most people get their knowledge and information from the media but\nI think what happened with a lizard with Warren here they could not carry this October surprise they could not cover for the fact that she's bogus they used to be able to do that they're not able to there's a reason for that and I think it's also helping get the truth out about Trump's achievements\nWe take a break for that has to have much to say Russia's probably by being met for here Dave Ramsey live this afternoon and one on news radio nine sixty ... we are see\nAll right to all of our listeners out there who are aged Seventy five are older and only one hundred thousand dollar life insurance both were larger I Want you to get a pen and I want you to write this information down\nIf your age Seventy five year old and

[noise]\nAnd I catch myself my mouth is wide open it's agape a couple of times watching\nThis thing at how brave in early on is this is one of the the editor the head honcho of the of the tabloid paper is one of the most is fixable human beings I've ever seen portrayed\nWho is not set up as a criminal who's not establish he's he's just two years and he is totally on affected by life\nTo him every body is a bad guy you just have to find out why his favorite his philosophy in life and\nThe way he guides us journalist is the world has no solutions I'll stop what what if that were your world view of the world has no solutions\nAnd he's telling you it's not your job to fix things it's not your job to feel bad about who you destroy it's not your job to try to solve problems because\nThe world is not about solutions it's your job to sell this paper it's your job he one episode\nWent to great lengths to show how this this Lees editor\nWho has some kind of a secret relationship with the prime minister the u._k. no no no no not sexual just up there that they have some kind of a relationship they not between like each other but they owe each other from way back before the series began\nAnd the editor\nRanges a cover story about a pita file and then puts a picture of the prime minister on the cover with his his picture only an inch away from the word ...\n\nYet the story is not about the prime minister being Pete if I was about somebody else for the prime minister is limited and outrage calls the guy in and the editor says you don't run me you don't control me and it was a mistake I I'm Sorry well then you wish you would have ... I'm not apologizing for anything you don't like and live with it\nAnd the president I didn't want to do the story in the first place I didn't want to post or the pictures the editor says you did I mean this guy has no empathy or feeling for anybody\nHe doesn't it just it's ... it's it's perfect it's the kind of personality you wouldn't have to be if your job is destroying people\nNo conscience the belief\nThat everybody is flawed that everybody's a dirt bag that everybody is a rapper ... and at some point their time to be called out is going to happen\n\nNobody's decent nobody's white [laughter] it's amazing how this in the eyes\nOf a journalist an editor now I imagine\nReal journalists are going to look at this thing some of them are going to marvel at it and think it's wonderful others are going to have it because it's\nIt exposes too much uh\nPeople have never had encounters with reporters have never been targets I don't know how they're going to react to it other than the entertained by it it it starts kind of slow but it picks up speed\nOr\nMany of the primary characters are women\nThe competing editor of the clean paper the above board and paper is a woman who gets out smarter than tricked into not publishing one day because she can't confirm the ... story\nWhile the other paper puts it on the cover of having confirmed it because the editor at the other members dug don't care whether it's true or not wondering calls that got as a beat up I'll just get it up there and get it on the news stands whereas the female editor didn't have the guts to run it and sell the paper doesn't rot and I'm thinking\nThey obviously you're not worried about the me too movement here\nEver put this thing together so the name of this press\nI have no idea it's it's I think it it just completed airline\n'cause I've got all six of them so I just competed completed it's um it's run cycle in the u._k. which means it's going to be on Netflix Amazon Prime wherever I don't know where it's going to be but it won't be long and if you remember me talking about it here\nAnd if you watch these kinds of things it's it's fascinating 'cause it's not about politics not about current but it's not about Trump it's not about conservatives liberals any of that\n[noise] if it's it gets hit everybody everybody is a rubber made including the people at the papers\nThe reporters uh [noise]\nI I have to admit I was so [noise] anyway here's non Brazil now I ... I did not lose my place Usama bill hammered a day and they're talking about the blue wave where she thinks we're headed\nAnd remember now this is a woman that used to be one of the head honcho so the

these women to when they're wearing says I'm confident but not over confident\nYou asked me today well but I Do differently in terms of Democrats would target Latinos our talk of millennials\nOkay so what would she do differently she's saying here that Democrats are dropping the ball with Latinos why is she saying that well because she has the freedom to say it she's not ... at the moment in the\nAnd it's it's it wouldn't be I don't think nearly as effective as something as personal but I think you have to you have to look at the history of these October surprises they've tried October surprise\nIn October they've tried them in September they've thrown everything they've got at Trump including during the campaign the Access Hollywood video\nAnd that didn't work [noise]\nNow he's out there are calling the porn star who by the way is a back stabbing black mailing\nDouble crossing a porn star is that they're calling her horse race\nAnd there are shutters and the drive by maybe a few

innocent ordinary everyday woman the Trump decided to call it a name she is a woman who attempted to him [noise]\n[noise] [noise] but for these liberal Democrats these people in the media to act like people don't talk to sweat presidents don't come on people talk\nThis way this is what ... what I resent about this the idea that they are cleaning pure as the driven snow and they don't think this way they don't talk this way what an absolute crock simply look after the things they say about us during the course of your average political day\nFrom\nYour Hitler through your Nazis to Europe this or that they make fun of people's appearances they make fun of\nPeople and their their comedy has become literally hate [noise]\nAnd then they act like one of the greatest social ... question your history of humanity has occurred when Donald Trump uses the term or\nSpace or when he did not mark balls the Ford but simply ... feet in [noise]\nThe truth about her allegations [noise]\nI just I just find it to just a little\nBit hollow\nAs low take your pick pick it take your pick any left wing or on media [noise]\nGriping about Trump's using the word horse race and ask yourself if that media reporter\nNever talk that way and the answer but Russia these people are president and he is and this has been nice the ... the presidency\n[noise] well I Know they look at it and think of it that way my point is\nThey can try all day long that's not going to separate Trump from his voters that some of his voters like she sent it back that\nThere's so much good going on here focusing and don't don't need to distract every body with that stuff\nBut you do\nThere are also going to they're not going to give up trying to link Donald Trump to the murder\nOf the uh [noise] of the journalist was
