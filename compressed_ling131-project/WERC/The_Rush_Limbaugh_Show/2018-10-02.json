Missouri Nevada\nTennessee Florida the list goes on and on and on we have all these close races which means we have a better estimate about what might happen in the Senate come November but it really could be a democratic wave or could be a Republican wave at the polls rough on what the Republican wave in the Senate in out in the ... not in the house\nRepublican wave in the Senate all know that means no impeachment of Trump that means that impeachment of the Democrats get the house don't think so but if they do it would die in the Senate unless there's a bunch of Jeff Flake clones in there\nBecause they would never vote to ah to convict if the Republicans hold the Senate or even swelled ranks so the panicked host Jim surely couldn't believe when he heard their blue wave red white and\nShe's just\nThere was discussion of a blue wave big generic battled advantage for Democrats you'll notice the tightening their as we get closer to the election\nI Will say the generic ballot does seem to be tightening a little bit which is good news for Republicans I think that you know there's a lot of talk all with Brett Kavanaugh on this whole confirmation met that in fact that might hurt Republican but it doesn't actually seem to be so far we're actually seeing some tightening in the Senate races and more than that we're seeing tightening of the house races\nI'm going to get a little ... observation about this but what did I tell ya eastern very ballots way back last December that's when they first\nHarping on this and back then you know nine months ago the Democrats had a twelve point advantage and that's when all the talk of a blue wave but yeah\nAnd that's when all the talk of the Democrats winning back Congress began and it went all through the year Democrat advantage in the generic ballot was twelve five seven and the Republicans pulled even in a couple of them the Democrats once again broke away and all during it I your host have been doing this a long time and it doesn't matter\nIt doesn't mean anything me remind you of a motivation technique utilized by the coach of the New England patriots won bill that will check\nPrior to one of the super bowl the patriots were empty might do it frequently I but I Know one time he gathered the players for a team meeting and so we're going to fund we're going to watch a horse race you had videotape of a horse race that\nNobody had seen it was not a big race they don't allow the players to make friendly that's why you Drew's on who was going to win\nSo the players made their bets and Donald ... starts to tape of the race and stops at at the first term it's OK\nLayer beds somebody who's gonna win players go nuts making their choices tape resumes that much ... stops at at the halfway point anybody want to change their bed anybody want to double down players go into gear making their beds\nHave the final turn ballot checked stops the tape of the horse race again asks the players if they want to make an additional beds or get out of ones they've made\nLayers do what they do that much check resumes taped to the finish line makes the point it didn't matter at any point in this race when I stopped the tape there is no way\nAnybody could have known after first turn at the halfway point or at the final attorney who is gonna win yet look what you want to do what you were making beds you've earned guessing somebody you're probably were certain the bottom line is Spanish\nYou never know before it's over who's going to win no matter what any kind of expert tells you it was a motivational\nTechnique designed to get the players to realize first quarter halftime of third quarter\nAnd do your job same thing here polls in January in front of a November election doesn't mean anything polls in June July don't mean anything\nInteresting for the media which is trying to shape public opinion with these polls but at the polls do not give any indication the final outcome\nAppalled in July or August would not contained any of the Kavanaugh news so how relevant could've been answered none zilch zero not up [noise]\nAnd so now here we are on October second CNN is panicking\nRacist or type thing in the house this wasn't supposed to happen why they had all their pre election polls they had the generic ballot\nThey've had this in in in the in the camp has been in the bank since last December in their minds it's been over it's just a matter of letting the cabinet of lay out now all of a sudden house races are tightening and there could be a blue wave in the Senate\nBut wave red wave and the Republicans could come out I didn't know where ... fine or current and take over\nWell\nWe don't know if the Republicans were ever really far behind we don't want anything because there wasn't a vote back in December or January or July or August we don't want anything\nAnd we don't know anything now and we won't know until the day after election day or maybe

E. R. C.\n[noise] news radio nine sixty U. E. R. C.\n[noise]\nWelcome back Fox Rush Limbaugh executing assigned host donated flawlessly as is the case [noise] each and every busy broadcast day [noise]\nOkay for those of you watching on the digital\nCamera I Want to show you something for those of you not watching on the digital camera going to post what I'm going to show there's no camera at Rush Limbaugh dot com you'll be able to see it there\nAre but first before I assure you that there's two cartoons I Want to show you Scott grabbed the cartoon of the firemen carrying the baby and put it into sweater let's let's use that when it first go ahead and take that live\nUp this cartoon ladies and gentlemen was drawn shortly after the Oklahoma City bombing\nAfter President Clinton a set of angry voices on the right speaking out against ... there was only one voice on the right in Nineteen Ninety two I was at a local talk shows but\nCNN's they only cable out there is no Fox knows there's no blogosphere theres no new alternative media uh aren't really conservative websites or start everything's starting to to to to block it at that point but but this program nationally but still it for years after our founding\nAnd Clinton have blamed angry voices on the right [noise] for Timothy McVeigh blowing up the uh building in Oklahoma City federal building and of course uh\nI I was living there was not going to accept that would challenge the White House on and they issued a correction claiming oh we were talking about the Michigan Militia shortwave radio\n[noise] Michigan Militia short wave radio Timothy McVeigh was listening to the Michigan Militia shortwave radio\n[noise] this is the by the way there's more evidence of of why you should have no doubt I Know what I'm Talking about here I haven't been subjected to this\nLiberal machine and the way it operates a number of times I Know them I Know I Know how they lie and make things up and strategize I Know there are the techniques their strategies and any better than they do [noise]\nSo a cartoonist by the name of Chris Brett [noise]\nWhat's his name [noise]\nDrew up a cartoon\nOf a fireman or carrying a dead baby there was actually a cover\nOf time magazine this picture of a fireman\nCarrying a dead baby from the rubble was a cover on time magazine artist did his cartoonish interpretation of it and the fireman is thinking as he is carrying the dead baby damn right wing radio\nWhile one of the local hosts at the time John Carlson on the radio in Seattle got hold of that fireman had him on the air\nWanted to know if that's what he was thinking as he was performing rescue duties at the Oklahoma City bombing the fireman said no no no no we all love Rush Limbaugh we listen to Rush Limbaugh in the firehouse\n[noise] well that cartoonist is back\nYou remember during the hearings Brett Kavanaugh said that his ten year old daughter was praying suggested the family pray for the woman meaning Dr Ford\nAnd judge Kevin I'm starting to break down and tear up at that point talking about the wisdom of the ten year old daughter\nSame cartoonist is back [noise] some public and the Illinois southern Illinois journal or some such thing but the cartoons now gone viral all over the Web but of course\nOn Twitter in parts of Facebook they love it switched that show this to the people watching on the digital camera this is the cartoon it has Kevin O's daughter praying at her bedside\nThe description the upper left hand corner Kavanaugh's daughter says another prayer\nAnd in the speech bubble in the cartoon Kevin ... daughter says dear God forgive my angry lying alcoholic father for sexually assaulting Dr forward\n[noise]\nNow as I say if you're not watching the program on the digital camera which you can do as a member at Rush Limbaugh dot com will have the cartoon eventually at Rush Limbaugh dot com or if you don't have to remember you'll be able to see if I'm not doing this was like come on for membership I'm I'm just we have the ability to show these things rather than to describe them\nSame cartoonist Nineteen Ninety two two today it's just a vial\nIt's filthy it's dirty it's disgusting it's despicable and it's sick\nAnd of course it has accomplished it's subjective it's gone viral and people would say that people are reacting to it and I weigh whether or not to give it the attention that anything talked about by me ultimately gets and I decided to go ahead and do it\nIn my never ending quest to have people understand who liberals are how thick and given men didn't it\nThey are\nThis is what passes for humor on the left this is what passes for comedy this is the kind of stuff that makes them laugh cabinet his daughter says another prayer dear God forgive my angry\nLying alcoholic father for sexually assaulting Dr Ford\n[noise] [noise] not a single element of that speech bubble has been established as anywhere near true [noise]\nAnd it's just it flies in the face of decency or you know you run out of descriptive adjectives\n\nWhen trying to describe this kind of thing which is why I have settled on the fact that we're really dealing with a bunch of people who at some point in their lives have suffered psychological into the events that have led the psychological disorders and they found themselves now as the mainstream of the Democratic party\nPeople at these rallies will be urging Trump to drop Kavanaugh for the sake of the party and the second Trump presidents that was the exact opposite so don't dumped me on this on to these people in the media have so much invested in their power\n\nIn their self esteem related to their power that when they see evidence that people are ignoring what they say it hurt some to the quick it disturbs them\nAny time you can demonstrate to them that what they're trying to make you think isn't working you will succeed in upsetting them and you might even get lucky enough to hear him talk about as high just did on CNN NBC News\nDesperately trying to convict Kevin all at the same time they've been trying to convince Trump colluding with Russia\nNBC News has had to admit that they are unable to independently corroborate the claims of Julie sweat [noise]\n\nUnable to independently corroborate sweating its claims and has not spoken with anybody who says they saw sweat Nick at parties with capital they can't find anybody can place or there\nBut she says she was at ten parties where Kevin on his buddies running rape trains gang rape drinks they can't find anybody who saw what's what make was a college student when Kevin on his buddies were high school students everybody's asking what's a college student female hanging around with a high school a party and\nI keep going back to gang rapes if that's what's happening to these parties or lawyers center that\n[noise] [noise] or lawyers said that she was doing research [noise] yeah Julie sweating\nIt kept going to these gang rape parties\nTo gather evidence to do research but NBC and believe me there look NBC can't find anybody\nWho says they saw sweat Nick at parties with capital Capitol Hill said he doesn't know sweat Nick and his call her claims a farce\n\nEx boyfriend says what next threatened to kill his unborn baby was exaggerating everything look Julie swipe Nick is incredible just like Christine foreigners incredible I mean when told me about a year but [noise]\nBeen through a thousand times for nobody she says was there says they were she doesn't know where when she doesn't know what she said afterwards or how she got home she doesn't know anything\nOther than that but I'll do no credibility a neighbor to sweat like\nSweating isn't credible Ford is a leader Feinstein is not credible the Democratic party is not credible the media is not credible there is no credibility on the allegations side of this entire Kavanaugh story\n\nLast night on Laura Ingraham show on Fox News [noise] Julie is what next ex boyfriend or Richard

Kavanaugh continues boxes John decker is live at the White House\nI okay that's cool\nI got an issue with that uh my point is it's still a I don't think that's going to change the equation\nOr a ... if I'm In your shoes I Want you to not just accept carte blanche that there's one way or not not I mean not medically one way but pricing structure and approach to this\nPaying for it there's only one way to do this is the twenty thousand dollar while you're on TALK to friends and that's what they all say it's all twenty thousand dollars because they don't want the same doctor and it's all twenty thousand dollars to do I want to learn about Seventy five hundred dollar idea and\nTry that a couple of times I'll I'll gamble a little bit with the medical profession if I'm In your shoes in other words and that helps me if I'm In your shoes go\nHey we're going to take a couple of months off and we're going to take ten thousand dollars in and then we're going to go back at it again on the debt while we see how that works out and then if we need to stop again and go at ten thousand dollars and then go back out the dad again that'd be fine\nYeah okay but I Will be very happy to hear that yeah I mean I Would do that but but don't just except\nThe one guy as the only way to attempt this okay in terms of ... not in terms of medical procedure I'm not talking about that I don't know anything about that but in terms of the pricing structure and it has to do with you know the\nThe the weather\nThey guarantee you know multiple tries to ... you know you buy a package of five or whatever all that kind of stuff I've heard all kinds of ways of getting at is and it's kind of weird to talk about it that way but but that's really what's going on and so just learn a little bit more push back get some other opinions from other pricing structures and then based on that yes\nYou know if you want to take a month or two off of the baby step to and you know I have the cash to do whatever you're doing and then go back out the baby step to again and then if you have to stop again and try another time that that's fine I don't have any issue with that but um\nDo we just say oh no it's thirty five thousand dollars like discussion the other day which is absurd and we're just going to stop everything and go do that 'cause we've completely lost our minds and uh because this was an emotional subject and it's very very important to have babies and I'm completely with you might be the best things on the planet I mean it's awesome I Love it\nSo I you know that that's what I Would do if I were in your shoes that's what I Would do is just learn more about it and then based on that structure you're starting and stopping of your\nOf your baby step to thanks for calling him open phones at
