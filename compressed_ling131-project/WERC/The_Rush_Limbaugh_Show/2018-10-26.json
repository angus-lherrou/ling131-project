New Jersey senator and the former director of national\nIntelligence James Clapper worthy recipients that I also saw Fox News is reporting that law enforcement is telling them\nThat some of these bombs none of them have gone off but some of them have been detonated because they were judged to be so unstable that they couldn't even transport them to a Quantico, Virginia FBI lab to study them they had to go ahead and detonate of a\nBlow 'em up because they might have blown up in transit although none of them have gone off none of them if they were ever intended to then there's still a lot that isn't known here and a lot of people are rushing in trying to fill in blanks\nAnd this is typical during events like this is everybody becomes a journalist and everybody wants to have the first news on every everybody wants to be the first to learn something the first to pass it on\nAnd on to law enforcement says what they're going to say about this at all is a speculation our law enforcement so I'm definitely going to be leaking\nBetween now and two thirty do various members of the media but they like trust or what have you so there's going to be a daily use of information of what happens during these periods is that the first thing people here is what they ended up tending to believe\nThe first thing they hear the first thing they see is that it makes the first impression\nAnd that is why\nDuring this whole week some of the some people have been concerned that the media without waiting just went ahead and assigned this guy as a pro Trump anti Democrat guy\nIdentifying the the people as Trump targets they make America Again a great again bomb or the ... bomber\nBecause it creates first impressions it it's created this worldwide\nPresumption that the bomber was an angry Trump supporter set up at the people Trump is that this is this is\nThe uh the narrative if you will drive buys attempted to establish before anybody knew anything because everybody knows first impressions\nAre what are matters of same thing is happening\nToday with the economic news we ever GDP report today that growth was three and a half percent but that's below what was expected [noise]\nAnd so the drive by reporting that economic activity has slowed down it's not nearly what people thought it would be trying to create that first impression among the people in their audiences that there's something wrong with the economy\n[noise] there's nothing wrong with three point five percent growth the reason why the economic growth is\nDidn't come in at the at the British ... three point eight to four percent is guess what the tech\nStock sector is taking a bath\nSpecifically Google also all those alphabet\nAnd Amazon have reported earnings and every and they're they're stunningly disappointing and it's causing sell off it's causing a big problem on the NASDAQ which is where many of the tech stocks report where they listed in\nAnd saw the same thing is happening now and with intensity because we are now at a period of time or less than two weeks before the midterm elections\nAnd what better time for the drive by us to report that the economy is slowing down even though it's shocking to ride along jobs are still being created everything's my three and a half percent growth nobody ever saw that in the last eight years of Iraq Obama\nWe didn't see that much before Obama wait and see it very often this economy still chugging right along with the drive laws are reporting the day that it has slowed down there could be\nOn the horizon and then

and the evidence inside those on below the powder and the pipes and all the pieces that were used in assemble those devices\nAnd they had the post marks and presumably a lot of video surveillance footage and what I'm told is this individual was in fact known to law enforcement had prior arrests for a terroristic threat of former New Yorker who now is living in Florida\nThe FBI is also taking

stuff\nJust happened to happen right as the program is beginning I have a lot of data you know is a highly influential a major media figure I have all kinds of people trying to influence me with what I'm saying flooding lose on with things\nThey want me to repeat a now say I guess the Philippine name the guy's family seems to have come from the Philippines but they're calling him Native American [noise] [noise]\nI and again flooding the zone here with the with the information for you that as as I receive but [noise] um and whether or not any of this stuff is true keep in mind that what's

listen to it a little bit of ourselves he's got a big powwow heading up there and ...\nFor the media thank you very much I thought I'd do that and uh we feel very strongly a again congratulations to all law enforcement who have the best in the world and they just showed it thank you very much\nLeaders of the White House [noise]\nNow to the subject at hand\nTo be with so many brilliant and that's what you are brittian courageous married yet again proud of them are\nMuch money out of this because he is now getting onto the ... the the real meeting a reason to the meeting there which is unprecedented by the way it's a leadership committee of hundreds of young black leaders are in America that are gathering at the White House has been a lot of ... about this I guess the president made and acknowledgement\nTo law enforcement for their great work and tracking down the bomber and\nBringing that story to a to a conclusion and we were rolling on it and whatever he said that was relevant we will pass that I don't say I Want to grab the phones get started berets open line friday and I know you want to weigh in on this\nAh so are we going to start a just as if we have the ability you don't have the ability to give them\nOkay Jimmy in Omaha Nebraska we're experimenting with a bunch of things here today folks bear with us Jimmy and Omaha great to have you how you doing sir\nThanks for having me on rush 'em I Want to run my theory value um and I'm going to say in advance I had this thought process in my mind even two years ago I'd have to look in the mirror and say what's wrong with you but I've become so cynical\nTowards the media and the radical left in this country that I'm just thinking this way nowadays okay\nBut this this whole thing with a package bombs to me reeks of each state and I truly believe you've been talking about how you don't think there's going to be a red wave or flu wave I'm Sorry ...\nAnd I think I think these folks know that there's no red I think they know they're in trouble with these elections I honestly beginning to think that the Republicans are going to gain seats in the house or or you are not nearly going to lose as many as people are thinking they are and I think it's all goes back to what like Jordan saying about that ...\nYou know and this and this whole cover up but if they don't we take that house\nOnce the elections are over I think the real investigation is going to move forward on that slice of document and that ... and I think these people are terrified the deep state I mean they cannot let that happen and I think the the I think these package bombs are means of disrupting these elections to the point where they can then say\nBetween ... between these crazy right these these national strike group planting bombs and the Russians conspiring we cannot legitimize the win in the selection for the for the Republicans and I think they're going to try to throw the whole thing into turmoil I really do\nI so you think that as we sit here today the deep state thinks they're going to lose their not an American to win the house back Democrats than the deep state thing not going to win the house back not going to win the Senate back\nSo all of this is designed to create so much chaos that whatever the result is of Democrats in the deep state loses they can say the election invalid too much was going on we can't we get our democracy can't function this way\nYou ... and you really think that the the deep state here set this guy up or even he's part of a flag operation\nDesigned to make it look like a Trump supporters gone nuts here and hates the left when in fact they orchestrated you think that\nThe breakthrough in ... and how your brain and actually improve memory the secret is an ingredient

sixty thousand dollars and what we would call her retirement fund and then about six thousand at a checking account and\nRetirement fund has been a rental house that my brother used to pay off a little house and he's basically been given or all the rent money even though you\nIt covers all the maintenance just kind of extra gift from him but that kind of a bit of a problem because he doesn't he owns a small business and that's really not his focus so it go it often goes without a tenant mom doesn't get that money coming in\nThe oven and wondering you know if you have a recommendation now and maybe a better um consider an investment maybe a admitted in pain dog or just the mutual fund or want to get your thoughts on that her\nAnd her financial um situation is her net monthly is about two fifty and the whole when she gets a Social Security I'm after she pay their rent which includes an independent living with meal that three hundred two to three hundred a month and we've been chipping away at or checking account\nOver the past two years and that's why it's bound to only six thousand ... that's about to start hitting the sixty\nOkay so the sixty is in cash and it's from rental income over the years\nYeah what about the past eight years you know\nI Know you've got that ... and that's invested in want\nIn my brother's one of my brothers rental property\nHow would you want and moms money it's not in life\nAnd you could liquidate it he can he can give her the cash if if we made it if we decided to go that route but he basically just took the money and paid off his rental house and started giving her all the rental income\nOh I see okay and so her investment\nThat she has made in this rental property is not doing well because there's not being managed well\nCorrect okay I'm In where is the property\n[noise] um it then it around Jackson, Tennessee so she lives in Memphis with me and you know is it near my brother is in his home town but you know there's still a burden on him and I think it's kind of even though he says it's not a problem I think the ban inside\nIt'd be better off I'll sell the house and use the money to invest in something that doesn't require\nEffort correct okay\nYeah I mean if you just did that and you put the money in a mutual fund um if it throws off six thousand dollars a year that's five hundred bucks a month that's ten percent right\nAnd that covers shortfall\nWhat are your thoughts on living in paying five to think that\nMore than a favor no I don't think it's more secure safer because you're not well diversified you're stuck in one or two stocks on the grill and I wouldn't get into that um I Would like to I'd take a growth in income mutual fund\nAnd a balanced mutual fund put about thirty K in each and try to find something that's got a track record of paying up around ten percent a year eight to ten percent a year a again gross and just during the growth off of it and they should run in perpetuation in to the tune of about five hundred bucks a month then\nAssuming you're sixty out of the sale of the house but you know sit down with a good mutual fund advisor to you work with one\nOf my company uses fidelity so they'd been\nPutting you know you don't work I was a financial advisor then your company is or you're talking about your right one K. and stuff okay All right yeah not just grab one of the smart Mr pros off our website people when we indoors and sit down with them\nUm have your mom Saddam to even if she's are just so she kinda knows what's going on and we're going to shut the money in something that's going to generate a low income doesn't have to generate lodges a couple of hundred bucks shorter months mhm and if that's sixty just generates six thousand dollars a year that's five hundred bucks a month maybe does half that you're still okay\nSo what we're saying is is that you know that there's this house is really poorly managed\nDon't hardly anything [noise]\nYeah if it comes and goes there's been a couple of years where it was about seven hundred a month in LA but the last year I think that any\nKind of women if she's getting seven hundred a month office housewives and covering her three hundred dollar shortfall\nIt was and it was building um her checking account but there's been other factors I wanted to keep it simple they drained are
