{"month": "10", "state": "AL", "station": "WERC", "content": "And I have to apologize for the financial industry for this is that many advisors are compensated by keeping you at risk ... ... if you're going to a doctor and he was describing your prescription that had nothing to do with what you needed it made it may be made you to press instead of happy\nAnd you went to the doctor and say why were you were describing this for years to me and he said well compensated by the drug companies to keep you on drugs I wouldn't be surprised well that's about it what we're talking about here if someone's got you in the wrong place financially and it's not helping you a matter of fact it's hurting you 'cause you're not building an income plan why they're doing it\nWell it reminds me how we really do have to take that initiative on our own ... really search out and find folks who are you mentioned fiduciary in the past how important is to find someone who is a fiduciary and it's not just claiming to be working in your best interests 'cause that's really the heart of the conversation isn't it\nGo to the advisor who specializes in risk and ask them how to have a safe income when and here's what you hear\n[noise] and that's unfortunate because if we are fifty two older then I started before it was it 'cause I'm In this financial arena and I want\nTo make sure to build myself retirement plans I was called back of the day when they the ... channel did a biography about me his beard on about our show when everything oh well they called me the Mikey the financial world because I Try everything before I recommended ... okay and so maybe the life several commercial now may I add so if\nI'm like a human guinea pig here golden test rabbit rabbit right so what are what I'll do though was not talked about\nAnd on the air unless I really believe in it and we unfortunately in this financial world when we're talking about retirement planning many people are ignoring that\nAnd they're hoping that everything will just work out fine they've got a lump sum again lump sum great sure but until you can translate what that lump sum really means for not income for next year or ten years but for a lifetime but not only you but for your spouse and if you pass away to sue which anytime you best ways to sue\nWe wanted we call it taking the limousine to heaven right that's right but when that happens you want to make sure that whatever money you have put aside doesn't disappear it go onto the next to Ken doesn't disappear and go into someone else's pocket yeah and that's called planning\nAnd it's not just financial sales putting in the best investments for today that's crazy by the way it is it is putting you into a plan and once we have that plan bill then we can take the leftover money money that you don't need for income and you can you can basically take risk with it if you want yeah but what you know what people usually tell me after we build the perfect plan for retirement was that 'cause I Want to put boring [laughter]\nI don't want to put this money exposed right yeah but I Do have a lot of people I recommend keep maybe fifty thousand to discuss trade account or something like that okay and buy and sell some stocks on her own or whatever just keeps your mind sharp yea yea yea and it keeps them you know happy and researching and all that but it's even if they lost all that money\nThey still have okay they still have the more they're young they're important the rock as they are they're retirement rock is there is going to be there it's going to give them income for the rest of their life\nAnd this is very important to me it really is and that's the way too many people have seen in my years in twenty five years I see people who thought they were fine until the market rip the carpet out from under him\nAnd then they had to rebuild all over again sort of like an an ant hill over there you know in an air come back and rebuild but all the time that could have been building a palace precisely it however that you're having to start over again and that's what happens starting over again is not any fun now\nAnd especially if you're already we're to the point where you don't need to take any risk because you already have the income you need for retired and we already have the money that could get to the committee to retirement but your current plan or hadn't told you about ... so if you're one of the next twenty call was the lead for the week here keeping my folks if you get a busy signal keep trying Thomas is going to give you the number out in a minute\nBut if you're one of the next twenty people who call we're going to do for you a one page financial review and this review will indicate if you're in need of a full blown financial a retirement plan and this is a very important review and it's about a nine hundred million dollar value when you when you factor in all the time\nWe're going to get this way you get into the next twenty people no obligation or fees\nAnd it's ...\nIf you want the next twenty people who have at least two hundred thousand dollars save for retirement\nNow what this will consist of is taking the mystery out of the retirement planning process by mapping out for you\nWhere you are right now we're also going to run the report folks and this was in lightening it's not it doesn't make you happy sometimes but will help you on tangle with working with your current planner advisor is truly costing you\nAnd to see if I simply protecting your retirement investment you could experience what we call dramatic growth potential\nYou know who hates us the analysis who's at your current advisor many home though 'cause we expose things that the financial termites in show you what you have financial evaporation and your portfolio that doesn't need to be happening we're also going to perform attacks analysis that also could reveal how you could possibly reduce your tax is very important because it the more money we can save you the more money you have for retirement for yourself\nWe're gonna also run the most important part as a customizing complained that utilizes the proven marketing strategy and strength other strategies and techniques which could turbo charged retirement income\nIf you do that folks you take the worry out of living in retirement and short will help you take the guesswork as a financial and retirement planning process for the next twenty callers that is a comprehensive plan to review going to give away it's nine hundred dollar value no obligation again for the next twenty dollars\nThe first step truly is to meet with financial coach is something that we're talking about here on the show resonates with you\nAnd you feel the need to get that second opinion or if you want to make sure that your retirement plan really is aligned with your goals and\nThat's very important risk tolerance that we talk about maybe you don't have a plan at all and you need to get one in place you can meet with former Auburn football player now the founder and CEO of Jefferson Matthews\nWall solutions that is AJ rough and he served all a central Alabama and

harassing Republicans in public in restaurants and even in their homes\nAnd forcing them out because they're white racist white supremacist is totally totally justified so there's a part of me that knows that Democrats are promoting this there's another part I think some Democrats do not think that this dirt range psychological upset\nIs tied to them\n... let me put it this way if we had people on our side behaving like this it would worry me to death it would worry me to death that voters are going to think that conservatism is made up of their range lunatics like this the Democrats don't seem to be concerned about that at all some of them like Nate Silver here don't even think\nThat that behavior is assumed by voters to be the behavior of mainstream Democrats\nAnd I I Wonder if that's true and if it is true how can they be so up to ... if it isn't true and if they are aware of it and are proud of it and are encouraging it\nThen the question becomes this when you get into turn out for the November elections in the midterms by the you know what people are now saying Mr certainly just arrested that\nThe Democrats some of the people on TV are saying well I I don't think that we know yet what issues are going to determine the vote in the ... [laughter]\nI Wonder where they heard that [noise] wonder where they heard that idea\nOf what we don't know yet of the issues are actually going to determine turn out and vote of happened yet they're still among the oh ... minutes during the election\nIt is a interesting question though will any of the passion\nFade away on either or\nBoth sides of this and that's I'm a Democrat side it's not going to fade away and I think everybody needs to know this\nOn the Democratic side this deranged lunacy has become the defining characteristic of today's Democratic Party in the American left you have to remember these people have been off their rocker since November of two thousand sixteen\nThey have been mad in saying crazy percolating compounding come pressing all of this ever since they haven't been loaded for bear ever since election day and the day after a two thousand sixteen\nAnd this ... situation comes up and I don't think on the Democrats' side they can\nGet any more hysterical and I don't think they can get any more motivated than they are I think they're at their peak right now\nI mean they're still talking about investigating Kevin off for under ... he wants to see\nThe F. B. I. documents released she wants a full fledged\nInvestigation of Kevin all the Democrats are fucking you're talking about Jerrold Nadler of a house Judiciary Committee ranking member of the Democrats promising if the Democrats win the house and that they're going to impeach cabinet they're going to investigate him getting thrown off the court\nThey're not they're not going to let this side this cabinet thing is not over and they're going to continue to rile their side\nUp and motivate them and encourage them to continue engaging in what you and I would call this massive civil disobedience although it's more than that it is it is genuine child like I don't even try like ... ... we're just we're dealing with a complete emotional breakdown\nAnd a group of people I don't care whether they're paid or not folks that I've that I don't I don't want to fall back on that suggested this anger they feel is not legitimate is legitimate whether they're being paid or not I don't think that means that the real enthusiasm a Democrat voters is less than what we think it is\n\nJust because some people have announced that they accept the money to go do this stuff I don't I don't think that they would sit around and do nothing in twiddling their thumbs all weekend long if they weren't being paid I think the demographic rages real and it's been real since election night\nTwo thousand sixteen they thought they were going to win that aren't they going to land so they haven't been able to come to grips with that even now the capital of the thing is just further evidence that the electorate and consequences they censor themselves losing control and losing and losing and they can't deal with it\nThey simply cannot deal with it and rather than do what's necessary to put themselves back together and become a winning enterprise they continue with their primary strategy of trying to tear down and destroy the opposition and eliminate it\nRather than do what's necessary to reach a broad swath of the majority of the American people which they cannot do in their current makeup which is why I ask\nOver and over if the Democrats at large elected Democrats really are unaware of the impression these people are creating about them I\nMean when these are mad the insane this dusting Democrats protesters they are identified with the Democratic party and I don't know if some elected Democrats really get that I can be all wet they could totally get it and they could be promoting it and which is probably closer\nTo the to the truth than not [noise] but for those that don't get it it amazes me that it is possible that these\nProfessional Democrats are like Nate Silver do not consider these protesters to be members of their party and representative of\nThe ah the

weeks a majority of Americans Thirteen percent wants to Democrats to start taking over Congress the house representatives\n[noise] now I Know what drives a lot of that is the formula\nThe first midterm elections after a new president is sworn in the president's party takes it on the Jim this is standard operating procedure it's been proven in Ninety percent of all the elections there are exceptions to it I think Nineteen Ninety\nSix was an election certainly to the exception two thousand two as well but I don't I don't look at what's going on here the last two weeks especially\nI and even the last four I don't see where there's this massive realization that the Democrats are the answer to what ails America\nNow the dry buys want everybody to see it that way so they reported that way in their generic polled the Democrats have their back to a plus Thirteen\nMargin advantage but then you look at individual races and they're nowhere near a Democrat Thirteen points up [noise] and then elsewhere in their poll Trump's approval rating has gone up since the Kavanaugh confirmation fight came to a conclusion\nWith independents disapproving of the Democrats' handling of the capital nomination by twenty eight point margin\nEven though the Democrats on the surface would seem to have public opinion on their son ... says the Washington Examiner just thirty six percent approved of how they handle the nomination compared to fifty six percent who disapproved\nOf further breakdown finds that fifty eight percent of independence disapproved of the way Democrats handled everything compared to thirty percent who approved other\n\nIndependence also disapproved of Republicans handling of the matter but by and narrower fifty three of the thirty two percent [noise] so what does that mean independence disapproved of everybody did it\nYou know big ... [noise] I\nCan't prove anything all I have to go on\nA experience guided by intelligence and intelligence guided by experience an instinct I'd just like\nEverybody believes this blue wave it doesn't matter where you go every story that drudge for example\nLinks links to on his page\nIs a story of the Democrats with a massive landslide retaking the house of representatives and there are stories\nWhere Republicans supposedly thinking the same thing is going to happen certainly you you've talked to swamp blowers you I mean you do hear from a lot of Republicans who think their toast big argued do you think they're toast big margin toast in the house of representatives\nWell what I\nI Know what what what what [noise] well yeah I'd like to\nGet an individual Paul's visual nine percent of the nine seed advantage even after the worst happens of all that that's getting into the into the minutia I'm I'm just talking about over all the national\nAttitude um and I look I'll be honest I'm always having to dial myself back um I\nI'm One of these people you probably are too I'm On these people are thinking everybody agreed with me we would have the best country in the history of countries if everybody looked at life the way I Do and looked at other people a way I Do it looked at issues of everybody looked at America the way I Do nobody would ever stop\nAnd I'm sure you feel that way now and then but we have to temper that with reality this is a lot of loony tunes out they're incapable of seeing the country the\nWay we do\nFor a host of reasons heavier heard ladies and gentleman that the Clintons are going to start a massive stadium tour\nBill and Hillary won again in want to get in on all of this Trump action now I I'm I've been wondering how long it was going to be until somebody in the Democratic party cried this Trump's rallies dating back to the two thousand sixteen campaign\nAnd do not doubt me on this either the Democrats in the media\nPublicly\nActed on concerned on interest in and would always say a variation of you\nCan't judge voter interest on the basis of rallies you can't predict how people are going to vote simply because of the size of crowds at political rallies\nThese Trump rallies they're not telling us that it doesn't mean anything he's heard just a rabbit people upset with their lives and they think Trump is going to kick all of people out of the country they don't like it's not that it's not anywhere near representative\nOf the population this is what they all said that every Trump rally privately do not doubt me privately they were jealous if they could be and they were the thing\nBecause there's not a one of them on the Democrats' side who could come anywhere close to ... that kind of excitement that kind of loyalty and knows sized crowds\nObama couldn't do it not in two thousand sixteen Hillary couldn't do it ever\nBut certainly not in two thousand she couldn't she couldn't she couldn't withdraw flies there her book signing\nCeremony Hillary Clinton who couldn't draw a crowd anywhere good people knew she might not be able to stand up for a full twenty five minutes without some aid coming out the proper up by the albums but seriously I guarantee you they were looking\nAt those crowds they were looking at those Trump rallies and they would never say so publicly but they were scared to death by him they would never say so publicly that would never admit it publicly they would say just the opposite\nBut they're human beings in any kind any any time anybody in politics has that kind of popularity and that kind of loyalty that equals jealousy envy and anger and all things that attached to jealousy and that'd be\nThey have the Trump to begin with and the fact that Trump was turning everything they believed in upside down the fact that Trump was being able to accomplish things they couldn't\nJust in terms of average Americans being interested in the campaign interested in the Kansas City and those rallies twenty thousand Fifteen twenty five thousand as many people lined up outside who couldn't get in wanted to get in\n... with his airplane perfectly placed\nSo the Trump in giant letters in the fuselage was behind him at every stop when he made his speech except for those events that took place inside actual arenas so I I've been wondering\nHow long it's going to be before somebody on the Democrats' side tries to get in on this action and I always thought you know who I thought it would be that would make\nThe first Abbott trying it Joe Biden I really thought that Joe Biden would be the first guy that try to replicate this\nThen I thought maybe Michelle my bell Obama but then I thought no they've got too much to lose if it\nDoesn't work\nMaybe Kamala Harris maybe some of these ... somebody's going to do this somebody's got to try if they've got\nTo be able to show the Democrats thinking they've got to show that there's as much excitement as much loyalty as much attention\nAs Trump can draw up till now nobody on the Democratic side has even given it a prayer until the Clintons\nThe daily wire has the story Washington Power couple bill and Hillary Clinton announced yesterday that they are embarking on a nationwide stadium\nTour taking the Clinton stage show to Thirteen cities this ball it's going to be called an evening with President Bill Clinton and

again why in Nineteen sixty five Ted Kennedy and the Democrats re opened the floodgates to immigration I Need to remind everybody again\nFrom about Nineteen Twenty one and Nineteen twenty three through Nineteen sixty five we shut down immigration I not to zero\nBut we put very strict limits on and the reason\nWas to be able to assimilate all of the immigrants that come into the country the late Eighteen hundreds through the Nineteen early twenties assimilation was key to American immigration policy arriving immigrants all wanted to be citizens\nBy the way and there were things they had to do to become citizens they had to learn a language and they had to learn the history of America they had to be able to pass questions about the history of America\nOn a test and they had to swear
