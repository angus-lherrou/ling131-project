believe her and most believe Kavanaugh if the FBI finds no corroboration of the charges sixty percent believe Kevin all should be confirmed according to a weekend harbored a Harris Poll of thousand three hundred and thirty registered\nVoters sixty six percent of Americans support the decision to have the FBI investigate that includes eighty percent Democrats sixty nine percent independence with only forty five percent\nRepublicans who are the smart ones are\nHuge numbers in the weekend poll reported seeing parts of it or reading about forty percent thought she alone was credible\nTwenty three percent fought\nKavanaugh was twenty seven percent said both ... if you combine all that the poll findings indicate sixty seven percent found her credible in fifty percent found him to be\n[noise]\nBut the credibility of their testimony doesn't appear to be the decisive factor instead the question comes down to collaboration is the standard for tipping public opinion on whether Kavanaugh should assemble the high court in terms of the overall needle after the testimony was heard\n\nThirty seven percent say confirmed the nomination forty four percent St rejected Eighteen percent remain undecided Democrats going one way Republicans the other but but but but but the hang\nOn no get depressed once the borders are told that the named witnesses deny any knowledge of the allegation it ships from forty four percent of fifty seven percent in favor confirmation meaning meaning the people\nIn this poll do not know did not know many of them did not know that the people she places in the room have denied being there and when the pollsters told them that in fact the numbers of\nPeople who thought he should be confirmed jumped from forty to fifty seven percent and then up to sixty percent in a hypothetical question if the FBI\nAfter a week agrees there is no cooperation for her story\nAnd they've already done that but now we've got combing entering the picture\nNow we've got to call me urging the FBI they keep digging the same FBI that's been running a silent coups FBI leaders trying to get rid of Trump\n\nI Want to grab a phone call because this guy has a great point and I want to add something to it this was a ... Jason Muskegon, Michigan Jason thank you so much for waiting I appreciate it how're you doing\nSaying no problem and thanks for letting me be part of the excellent\nWell I appreciate that you are you are here as part of the excellence by association\n[laughter] yeah I was thinking um that uh there's no better way to um motivate a group by attacking them in by attacking Kevin uh they're basically essentially attacking the entire Republican base we\nShowed up and sixteen and voted Trump and I'm part of that reason was for the Supreme Court nomination and here we are Democrats are going to make the midterms about\nA Supreme Court vacancy and they think that they can last year twenty twenty so they're not really pressing issue as hard as what Republicans could and knowing that if we want to get our guy in there you know we're going to have to show up in midterms are going to\nGoing to have an adverse effect that they keep the ...\nI've heard people say this I uh uh he he he Jason here thinks that all of this is going to backfire on the Democrats and motivate Republicans do show up and vote not just now two thousand Eighteen but again\nFor Trump and twenty twenty or let's go to the audio soundbites on this Jason thank you much we're going to start here this is a boxing friends weekend on Saturday morning Rachel Campos Duffy was one of the hosts\nIs talking to ... am political corresponded David Brody\nAbout all this\nAnd she says well we know the Democrats all ready man really energized about the midterms I don't know how much more energized naked get but I'm sensing that Republicans have become very energized this week this hearing has really fired and the Republicans\nUp or my reporting and from that deplorable evangelical base I can tell you they say the Democrats dirty tricks have riled them up like never before and I know Rush Limbaugh has talked about how if Kavanaugh is not confirmed it's gonna be real tough for the Republicans actually if Kavanaugh is not confirmed\nThat would even rile up that deplorable evangelical base in the jail the base I Believe even more at least the people that I'm hearing from and so I think that that's a big part of what's going on here\nNow like you you can't blame David Brody for being fifty percent informed because\nI I pulled back that original production after it had gone viral all over the\nDrive by media that's why it's still prominent in people's minds and my retraction of that production has barely received a whimper because it doesn't serve the drive by is any good when the drive by here me predicting Republican\nThey can't help themselves they got to put an all over the world in the media Rush Limbaugh those Republicans guaranteed loans house of capital not confirmed that prediction was based at a specific point in time on if the Republicans caved\nIf Republicans didn't fight for Kavanaugh if Republicans just went bird out I predicted that what happened but\nOn this began to unfold [noise] I retracted that predicts you didn't set it could end up being the opposite here\nBut of course that prediction didn't go viral and I want to Jason in Muskegon I Want to thank you for bringing it up so that I could make the case here is one more\nA bite on this as a CSPAN Washington Journal Saturday morning Jess Holland is talking to a correspondent at the Weekly Standard\nAnd Andrew Edgar about me\nThere's been several conservative including Rush Limbaugh who warned that Republicans could lose their majority if they don't get Kavanaugh confirmed to the Supreme Court is that something that Republicans in Congress are really thinking about mid term consequences\nArgument like the one that Limbaugh makes our little convenient on whether or not have it I got through I think the whole situation is really fired up Republican voters\nSo once again somebody else you can't blame 'em parks don't get mad at him because my original production was everywhere I literally all over the world it was an Saudi\nTV was on the BBC\nIt was on Russian television I think even the north Korea is the little pot belly dictator mentioned in his Saturday Night message to the people it was everywhere\nWhen Rush Limbaugh says Republicans are going to take it in a short everybody in the media covers it and I again I made that production at a at a time where it looked like they were

Fox is running it as a source they've got [noise]\nThere's nothing to find the FBI has looked at Kavanaugh this'll be the seven time folks Christine Blasey Ford does not have any evidence for them to

didn't talk to his client it didn't smart the robots I'm telling you no matter how this if the FBI exonerate Kevin all whenever they do it do you really think the Democrats because okay fine like we we we we got what we wanted now we're prepared to go about do you think that's going to be the result it will not but [noise]\nNow folks [laughter] one of the thing here\n[noise] we just had a caller

run with it and it shouldn't be calm\nThe daily identifier of the Republican Party they should have been throwing back firing back right at the Democrats in their faces every hour of every day exactly what Graham did make that the ongoing about put them on the defensive\nMake the media repeat these charges ... Graham laid out but instead it was a standalone\n... said it it was great it was impassioned\nAnd that was the end of it\nIt was never to be heard again out of the mouth of any Republican\nAnd salt

went along with with like\nYou can't do these things as one offs\nIf you're going to tell people who the Democrats are if you're going to try to inform the country what's really going on here you have

of this year several times you mentioned that uh an incident or an occurrence has yet to happen that will affect or seriously affect the term\nI was curious to hear if you think this Kavanaugh's nomination that's gone sour is that incident well\nCould be I mean the but the point was uh I didn't have anything specific in mind it's just that we got a poll in June or a poll and mayor even July and it tells us what the\nPublic is thinking of doing and the November elections and my point was this is silly this poll doesn't mean anything there's anybody remember the pole in July of two thousand sixteen or in August that doesn't mean anything because it's not won the election is\nAnd I said the ... the events are going to shape the midterms haven't happened yet I said that on July August September\nA and this is exactly the kind of thing I had in mind but there's going to be something beyond this oh dear this is going to get resolved one way or the other depending on how it's resolved yeah it's going to affect turnout is going to affect votes if the Democrats lose this\nUh if Kavanaugh gets confirmed a\nThan what a democratic voters going to do that get us going to be really in a rage didn't show up and vote are they going to be mad depressed and sit at home who knows what this thing is going to get rid of if this if this is not resolved before the election and it's a defeat anyway because all the Democrats won a year's delayed delayed delayed\nBy my only point was that those polls in the summer are largely irrelevant because there are things are going to happen much closer to the election nobody can predict that are going to have a great impact on it this is one of those things yes but I don't know if it's\nSomebody has to have much to say rush
