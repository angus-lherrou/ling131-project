{"month": "10", "state": "AL", "station": "WERC", "content": "[noise]\nNah man although this afternoon is my grandmother's funeral [noise] and I was not prepared to say anything\nUh\nOn friday I guess it was in the morning after she passed and I wasn't sure if I Would say something today or\nTomorrow because I'm not very good with those things and I start bowling um\nBut I Will just say this um there is in every person something that we can take from their life\nUm\nTheir greatest assets that I think all of us can be better from\nAnd I'm\nRuth berry who I referred to as grandma bury 'em my dad's mother had many many of those traits in fact I'm much like my father\nProbably the most St like human being I've ever met in my life I Know everybody's grandmother is special to him [noise] ah I Know everybody's grandmother has something that you remember fondly\nBut actually I don't remember a grandma bury her famous dishes or or things like that what I remember most about her was a person of fierce independence\nAnd drink and dignity she was widowed um\nShe was widowed when my grandfather died in a car wreck or coming back from Louisiana and I think it was a lot harder back then there were fewer programs there were fewer things to lean upon so she went to work as a cafeteria workers\nIn the west orange start school district\nWhere\nProbably started there in her mid thirties maybe even her late thirties\nIt's hard for a woman who's not been in the workforce to enter the workforce\nWithout any degrees without any experience without a resume without any references I'm so she became a lunch lady cafeteria lady\nAnd she was everything that you would want in the cafeteria lady she Puerto heart and soul in that she took great pride in it\nUm [noise] and she ended up getting a full retirement from there I Am a pet she worked\nI'll bet you she worked thirty five years as a cafeteria worker and she started later the most\nBut somewhere along the way she never remarried somewhere along the way she picked up an evening job as well she went to work at hallmark she worked there were two hallmarks but it's still Marshall\nYou don't see 'em any more but she worked at the hallmark and orange and then she worked at the hallmark a rich city and I will tell you that I don't think I'm certain that there was never a graduation birthday\nUnit everybody in our for you knew that everybody else might forget to get your\nCar but the grandma Barry cards were very important and there was never an occasion when that was missed and even when my boys came along it was just like clockwork inch shoot she was in her nineties by then it's not easy to go get a card when you're in your nineties\nBut what I admire about her was her absolute strength here was a woman\nWho had raised her children the youngest where I think probably finishing high school when my dad was second to the oldest um there was a good Jean the my dad Norman\nAnd then I don't know the order after that Sylvia Sheila and Sandra [noise] so I'm\nIn any case she had raise these children she was a housewife that was um that was a point of great pride to her and her husband does she has to go to work\nAnd never asked a person for a soul live very simply saved provided for her own health care when she was older or something to be said for that as something to be said for\nThe strength of independence especially for a woman at a time like that when there were not a lot of economic opportunities but her house was always the the gathering place for our entire family\nUm [noise]\nAnd I just you know when I when you think about who you are as a person I don't know how much of who we are\nAs we're developing we choose to be and how much of who we are we are\nBecause we see things in other people that we want to replicate or that becomes the norm that becomes you know what you expect a woman is supposed to be that becomes what you expect the man is supposed to be that's what you expect a father or grandmother\nOr whatever else\nIn any case she had a good life in a long life she lived to be Ninety eight in January she would have been Ninety nine I was really really hoping she could live to be\nAny kind of ... the first instinct of the drive by media has [noise]\nAnd not what I say drive by media may as well be selling it saying a Democrat part of the first thing I think they have is to try to find a way\nTo link who ever committed the bad deed to the Republican Party or\nA lease on call conservative movement\nAnd of course now it's blamed Trump everything everything at all what ever it is blame Donald Trump blame me blame you blame anybody that's supported Donald Trump\nAnd frankly I'm worn out with this reaction I have had it I Am fed up with it's been this way for years there were showed up during the Obama administration there were mass murders and at no time did the drive by me the ever try to link any of it to Obama\nAnd yet [noise] people have forgotten wasn't inflammatory\nTo say that Republicans were going to be responsible for millions of deaths if Obamacare was not passing it along with anybody remember that because I sure as hell do because that was set up one is that\nWe're trying to oppose a government takeover of one of the great industries in America better than anywhere else in the world we're trying to take them to prevent a bunch of incompetence a bunch of government bureaucrats in the left wing politicians from taking over the American health\nCare system meanwhile Obama is lying to everybody about it claiming that if they like their doctor keep their plan they get get get to and that their premiums are going to be reduced by twenty five hundred dollars a year or lie after lie after lie not called out not reported\nAnd then the Republicans come along and try to impose it on subs to the ground and the Democrats and the media start running around talking about how the Republicans are going to be responsible for the deaths of millions of people you want to tell me that's inflammatory or not\nHow many years have average ordinary Americans had to listen to this like you and I have\nWhere every time something happens that Democrats politicize literally everything and that's why none of this stuff ever gets that\nIs why none of this stuff is ever going to get resolved until this politicization of everything stopped in other words you have some guy who's been mentally ill for ten Fifteen Years\n[noise] excuse me\nThen decides to take action and all of a sudden it's ... it's the fault of a political party or it's the fault of a president's and and so predictable 'cause they hate the president will do and then they can to get rid of him they spent two years trying to get rid of him they fail to get rid of him they're fit to be tied over their failure they're ratcheting up this\nThis anger and if it were getting so far away from the notion that whoever did it is the person that\nWe're getting to the point where in this country because we politicize everything nobody's responsible for what they do whatever anybody does it's because of the politics of the Republican Party or the conservative movement [noise]\nAs far as the drive by meeting is concerned it's not think of somebody is mentally ill disturbed who knows what's been going on in their lives the media doesn't care about\nThat except to the extent they can link the Trump [noise] well I I for one am am fed up with it I'm sick of this reaction to every freaking event even\nThough whether we can even get away from it from the women are extreme weather happens it's our fault it's the problem of the Republicans or Trump because we don't sign on to this asinine manmade global warming theory so we ended up being responsible for deaths in print Domenico\n[noise]\nAnd then when we stand up and defend ourselves against then all of a sudden we're attacked in we're assaulted for being anti woman anti anti black anti minority what have you\nBecause they politicized literally everything [noise] and you know what\nIf I have gotten to the point I Can't tune it out it is my your men to pay attention to it it is my man to come here and pay attention to tell you what I think about how many people do you think are fed up with this by now you would think this is going to affect the midterm elections Democrats and maybe\nI got I got a clue for ya neither of these events that you are hyping are going to ... change significantly in the mid term elections as much as you would like them to and as much as you're trying to make them change the mid term elections you must be worried how the midterms are going to pretend the rats at least two things up\n[noise] to try to get people to somehow vote against Donald Trump ... you must not believe like Nate Silver says eighty five percent chance that you're going to take the house\n[noise]\nNo you have to take these too sad unfortunate events in and build them up and just somehow they are Donald Trump's fault and this is why you should vote against Republicans in the midterms [noise]\nI can tell you right now I mean a ... do not know it from a exact hands on knowledge I'm just telling my gut is that there are millions of Americans wants this stuff starts they tune it out they're fed up with being blamed they're fed up with the people they love and support being blamed\nThey're fed up with their country being blamed and so they just they just tune it out [noise]\nThey think about all of the mass shootings have cops\nBack during the Obama those and those were supported\nYou had the support stalls you have the support black lives matter they weren't condemn there weren't any consequences for the protesters could roll into Ferguson, Missouri and and literally tear up a town on why they create a lie about the shooter in that in that ...\nThe Mike Brown good what is the first name was [noise] who held up a convenience store and so whatever they just totally make it up turn it inside out\nAll for the express purpose of blaming nominal Trump now [noise] it it it it gets it gets to the point that if if the media wonders why they're in such ill distribute right now because of this\n[noise] nobody believes what you say nobody\nTrusts what you're saying it's so obviously politically charged it so obviously you're you're passionate about\nThis is what you can do with this politically [noise]\n\nThe guy that shot up the synagogue in Pittsburgh squirrel hill section of ... I Know this place well I Lived there not squirrel hill but I Know where it is [noise]\nThe guy that shot this place up Hey David\nTrump Donald Trump was too big and Jewish supporter his daughter converted to Judaism\nFuture growth projects for our community CEOs you should know I hardly the or the Michael berry show\nWhere you could always think to try to make people thought this afternoon at five something to think about my news radio ...

happened to those when the when it happened but it becomes real and we got to destroy somebody's life we have to destroy somebody's career we've got and Kevin ... is supposed to sit\nBack and just take it he's just see those are the old rules in Washington [noise]\nPeople under assault take it\nThe best way to deal with it they are advised to non make waves sit there and take it and that's how responsible reasonable Republicans always acted well that's not a Donald Trump is it wasn't elected to act that way\nYou ask me the wrong people being told to tone it down\nThe left needs to tone down it's organized violence the left needs to tone down all of these political stunts\n\nThat are in many ways designed to provoke a reaction from people\nBecause they\nUtilize abuses of power and character assassination\n[noise] and the the character being assassinated just supposed to sit there just supposed to take it\nThat's how you get ahead in Washington if you're under the gun you take it you just sit there and you take it\nAnd you realize it's just politics don't take it personally judge Kavanaugh don't take it personally it's just politics because everybody hates Trump we can't let you on the Supreme Court and you're gonna have to sit there and that's the price you're gonna have to pay for this guy being elected and he's supposed to sit there and take [noise]\nHe wasn't supposed to be angry [noise]\nWhile he was weird and while his family was threatened in his life and future we're in the process of being destroyed he wasn't supposed to say anything [noise]\n\nJust to sit there and take it that's the rules that's the way it works in Washington [noise]\nNot personal just this is just politics and then a couple of years afterwards everybody forgets it everybody likes Kevin except Kevin O's life was ruined and he's never supposed to want to get even he's never supposed to fight for him\nSo Trump ditto not supposed to stand up to this not but that's who Trump is they're not used to it they thought they would have sent Trump packing a year and a half ago they thought they'd be rid of Donald Trump\n\nAnd they still aren't let's go to the phones we have Steve in Pittsburgh with us You're up for us today Steve thank you for calling hello\nHey rushed pleasure to speak with you thank you sir\nI can tell you the last week in front of the Pittsburgh School board they had a proposal to arm the school police and it was voted down eight to one\nAbout this thing happened to the school but you know similar situation where President Trump came out and said if they had an armed guard this could've been prevented and then you have a mayor who's very anti Trump very liberal come out and say that an armed guard would not stop it's what we need is more gun control\nI mean how many more things have to happen before they realized that more gun control law cancer not putting someone with a gun that can stop this\nWell look I hate to be the ones who tells you but uh there's no amount of death there's no amount of shooting\nWhatever get your mayor to change his mind about what he believes\nBecause you say it's really not about guns he thinks it is and it's important but it's not really about guns it's about\nSomething much larger than that it's about being able to tell people what they can and can't have it's about it's about telling people that they have freedom of speech except\nYou can't say this you can't say that you can't but other than that you got oh freedom of speech with us leftists [noise] ah yeah and you want to have gotten you're going to have a gun except in east or because of it but but but but what we're all for freedom as we define that he mentioned this let's\nGo to the audio soundbites I Want to start here with um [noise] Trump himself that says this is this is an example\nYou [laughter] well I I'm sure some people were shocked\nA on Saturday when this was Trump's reaction speaking with reporters he was a joint base Andrews it used to be Andrews Air force base case you're wondering what does this joint based business\nWell it used to be Andrews Air force base and then there was another military base close by another branch close by to unify them all the cotton joint base where multiple services are on the same place\nAnd so that's that's where air force one is parked at Fort Trump takes the helicopter to get on board Airforce one way is going to travel a reporter said\nMr President do you think you need to revisit\nSee sowing guy goes nuts in a synagogue and spoil hill [noise] and the first\nQuestion a drive by Mr President do you think you would need to revisit gun laws\n[noise] by the way I Need to tell you something I've observed this is the last time the drive by some cared about the guns [noise]\nThis guy had an arsenal and the drive buys have dropped focused on it because they think there is a bigger target [noise] and that is Trump being responsible for this and that in all the other things an anti Semitism\nThey think oh there's a lot of racism so they're not really focus on this guy's guns as much as they would otherwise\nAnd on and tells you this guy's got even loaded with guns why here's a drive by not really focusing on that when they always do because it's a political calculation that there's more fertile ground here and that would be Trump is an anti Semite or a big it or as a racist anyway\nThe worst\nPart is that the rightful owners of those names never had a clue who he was they never had a clue they were being ripped off until retailer started calling

got my dad was an air force that there was never politics never came current events dead but not politics\nLet me ask you this was a thing like ... or in your opinion and you said you've got some experience with the Hollywood types in Europe here in the opinion Kim liberal Druze be anti Semitic when it comes to when it comes to Israel\nThey when they did they probably wouldn't say that they were but they they they yeah I mean a lot of them\nOh I Know they wouldn't say they were but couldn't couldn't he said that they were I mean because what I\nSay that yes because a lot of uh\nIt is a lot of them also and tell you that they don't even believe in God or racially Jewish but they don't they're not religiously Jewish which I also think as a load of well you know [laughter]\nI Know there's all kinds of young people justify their existence and all kinds of ways ...\nThird willing they're willing to claim the victim had nothing else [noise] [laughter]\nWell there was one of the reason I ask you that specific question was because many people do not understand\nHow a liberal\nJew is like the New York times ownership and editorial board can be so anti Israel when Israel is\nThis it it it it's it's the Jewish state and yet there's there's so much anti Israeli\nSentiment among Jewish people in America that are predominantly liberal that people scratch their heads and don't quite understand it\n'cause it's a ... because it's anti that religion it's not anti the race they still need the race in order to have racial politics\nBut it's if the religion in time the religion\nYeah because you can't separate the Jewish state from religion I don't think you can and that you know any any time you're Jewish\nAnd you're in a you know you're in a liberal you're in a conversation with liberal and Israel comes that no way that I think that this flame or I'm Jewish but I totally disagree with everything Israel feeling that it yeah that comes up and it's it's really sad\nBut isn't that more disagreeing with the politics is associated with with Israel is a ... because if they're inside the religion\nThat's big I mean the the Jewish religion I mean you've got the reform and orthodox and and the other branches hung on many\nDifferent flavor [laughter] um yeah but\nI I don't I used to I used to feel that way I feel like it but yeah with a push toward atheism I Need the the they're anti Christian Tito um I don't see\nThem as necessarily being seeing Islam but I you know but I think it's the it's a it's a ... I got\nThis ... that's exactly right and this is where this is all headed this is all headed towards atheism an anti God that's exactly what is a unifying the people on the left whatever they claim their religious views are\nThe trend is towards atheism and no God or at least agnostic ... because that removes any judgmental ism right it removes any limits on behavioral morality or anything else that there is no ultimate\nPower that can meet out approve or disapprove of one's accidental one is totally free correct\nAbsolutely\nWell I I just I'm so\nYou have this of this event in Pittsburgh given everything else that you say that you are\nAll the liberalism creep into Judaism and a rising anti Semitism you're right it's it's anti Semitism is rising in Germany and nobody's talking about it it's rising throughout Europe and there aren't very many people talking about it so\nThis event in Pittsburgh than it does it add to any of the uh discomfort or on ease you're having about things in general\n[noise] ah I I I don't I don't feel like that there's a million people out there targeting\nA Jews in a way that they would want to go she got the thing that I think that that these are

anywhere else\nAnd I I mean I don't I don't feel unsafe\nAs a person who is Jewish walking down the street because I'm Jewish I and I and I obviously don't think Trump has anything to do with it at

thousand dollars\nA hour eight thousand was my car and a hundred and Seventy two thousand with our wonderful student loans from a private Christian university\nWe were expensive spouses to each other oh\nOkay so this is you drop some coin yeah All right and um then six and a half years that's a long time to pay off the student loans I was thinking maybe it was the house when he told me six years so there has to be a good story tell me your story\nUm I got a really funny story actually hum when we went through financial piece at our church of the time\nI'm One of the things that you mentioned in your video was a take cash with you when you when we were we were newlyweds when we first went through and you said take cash would you when you go to a furniture store to buy a car and and and flush the cashing in and talk to them that way so\nWe were at a furniture store and I'm a very not confrontational kind of guy kind of a free spirit and she told me hey let's do this let's put this to practice so\nWe took passion and I'm Talking to the sales guy about a bad that we're trying to buy for our apartment at the time and\nI'm flashing the cash and say hey I'm I'm going to walk as if we can make this happen right now and he's like I'm I'm Sorry that that's just the price\nAnd uh so I just went out in the car and set down because I couldn't swallow my pride and buy it but then my wife ended up by the\nUs I don't know that that that is just to show that\nThere was a lot of negotiations in the beginning we were really um when we were dating and engaged at the time we were sitting there with their finances and we were actually writing out the numbers and it was just this\nPet feeling in her stomach those were just indebted to these loan companies and we're going to be in our fifties before we pay 'em off and\nUm so and so we started the class we now down to budget and did the envelope system we were really um persistent and faithful with envelopes us down and just really got serious about it on\nAnd I think the big part and for us for as far as deciding to really try to work on maybe step too as we paid by car off a relatively quickly and then he had gotten his first\nPretty big bonus them from work and so we were like okay we haven't really gotten to travel before kids let's take a really great trip to Europe with this money we deserve it\nAnd we were sitting there one time were like oh we're we just their budget you know a few months ago and said that was the first step we use that bonus money instead of a trip to Europe which who knows if we'll be able to take that ever and that's okay but we uh\nWhy wouldn't they make a hundred and sixty thousand dollars in debt in our first to know we have two kids so yeah it just makes it a a lot of kids on your\nOwn country\nSo yeah that that was the big you know turning point for us when we put that big lump sum of money and our first a student loan payment and there was an awful feeling that hurting but a good feeling\nTo show how much of the six years did you move closer to Seventy five and how much closer to one sixty pretty much the whole six years a product of the last year last year the incomes doubled down right ... and so that's a relatively new figure correct then and so really you know basically you paid off for about thirty thousand bucks a year\nFor six years while making about Seventy five right they'll say you really have been doing this ... okay and then the last year a kicked in about the time you saw the light at the end but Donald income comes up ... yeah yeah what what was the hardest part of this for you all cause six and a half\nAnd a good\nUm I think for me the hardest part was\nI'm starting it and just seeing the light at the end of the tunnel 'cause when you see that a hundred and Seventy thousand dollars on a piece of paper or to undergraduate degrees and master's degree it's just like is this worth it and um so I think when we paid off our first student loan", "show_name": "The Rush Limbaugh Show", "year": "2018", "city": "Birmingham", "day": "29"}
