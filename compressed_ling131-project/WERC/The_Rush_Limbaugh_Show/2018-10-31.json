somebody ... certainly a great way to close is that the president of the United states come in my hand\nHospitals staffing personnel gave the president first lady a standing ovation have you heard about this no oh you're hearing about is the protesters outside wherever the president goes you're hearing about forty four thousand people assigned some petitions saying we don't want you here\nMr President we don't want you we don't want your wife we don't want your Jewish pretend daughter we don't want your joints done and all we don't want any of you here go away but\nTrump goes to the hospital where the professionals treated the wounded and gets a very very warm welcome you don't see that report it\nOr\nContinue to try to lay the blame on Trump for this\nAnd it just wears you out I Know people are telling me it just wears you out every day you got to the same thing different degrees of intensity different details in this story but it's the same thing\nAnd people say Russia is going to win the mentors folks there is a thaw out there who knows who's going to win the terms there isn't a single person out there who has the slightest idea I don't care what Paul you look at I don't care what professionally or talk to I don't care\nWhat grade really an analyst there is there isn't anybody who knows\nWho's going to win the midterms you have all kinds of people who want to impress you and how smart they are and how analytical they are but it's like anything else in the future nobody knows and that's because there are so many races according to the polling data can break either way\nThere are so many that are so close but then when you say that okay do we trust the polling day though the polling data versus two thousand sixteen not all that ... nobody knows a lot of blood [noise]\n\nNate Silver or given exam Nate Silver is considered a good word you know why\nI think it was was it two thousand fourteen two thousand twelve was\nOne of those two elections were Nate Silver lucked into calling every state\nOn the money and that seat\nWon the election I go in the past when I was gave him this reputation that he is intolerable since that one election where he was an infallible he hasn't come close\nDoesn't matter because he came closer was dead on the money when Democrats were victorious he's become a guru he's become a shrink he's become a psychiatrist or psychologist Democrats tuned to Nate Silver to stay sane\nWhen the information they're hearing doesn't go the way they want it to go [noise] heard pat ... silver guy nice guy but he's never run a campaign he's never taken a single poll all he does his analyze them [noise]\nHe's never participated in a ... even though the polling company he's never run a campaign and it's a ... point was you need to temper all these so called experts with some reality\nTo the guy hits it on one election that happened to be exactly what the Democrats wanted to hear turned out to be true and so it becomes a girl wrote and the media continues to cite this is like Nate Silver is out there saying eighty six percent now chances Democrats when the house nobody knows [noise]\nSo you can't you can't succumb\nTo the temptation here to go blob play and become flap one\nAnd it's hard I I look I Will admit it's hard as I say the human emotional reservoir can only hold so much\nAnd at some point it's going to get depleted and maintaining fever pitch energy becomes a challenging thing to do precisely when the news every day is Ninety eight percent slanted Ninety\nTwo percent slanted against you and what you believe in and what you want to happen [noise]\n\nThe Trump threatened to end the or the birthright citizenship today the Dems are still mad about it\nAll kinds of experts being trotted out it's unconstitutional no it's totally constitution no it isn't then you've got Republican leaders that we don't want to go down this road is a silly we're all in favor of his many people getting in the countries that can't Democrats saying the same thing but it's out there it's a conversation starter\nNothing is going to happen anytime soon the leftist saying yeah conversation started as all of this Trump doesn't really mean it is trying to rile up the base that's where you're wrong Trump does made it\n[noise] it is about time this was changed we have a crisis brewing we have a crisis growing\nIn terms of what kind of country we're going to be what kind of culture is going to dominate in this country and we are under assault by people who don't like the United states of America the way it was founded\nThere's no complicated mystery that this is just what it is that's who the opponents are hell bent [noise]\nAnd they're not going to stop until they until they went another Mahler investigate looking at all of us in the lower investigation trying to come\nBack to life [noise] remember had told yesterday how many leftist were convinced that Muller by now was going to have issued a report proving trumping colluded with Russia [noise]\nYou know how many people on the left believed that\nAnd how many have been thinking all this time that Mahler was timing this release for right before the election was going to happen and if it didn't happen to that would be a leak or did they will be some kind of education and yet zilch zero not at the latest from Muller is it somebody is running a scam on him a sex scandal of some time\nThat they so boring to me I haven't even delved into the details but Muller is saying that people are trying to run a sex scam on him up some kind\nOr tried to or what have you all all I Know that that's the last thing that the left was counting on Robert Mueller having to say\nIn the days and weeks leading up the election is a big deal psychologically until you these people really thought you you wouldn't be amazed at how many people\nThat drive by media the American leftist propagandize significant portion this population they have believed from the first day that Trump the first day they herded the Trump stole the election they have believed mother has found they believe Mahler was going to find it and didn't find it in his holding it and it's going to release it in the most opportune time [noise]\nSpite the factor in any evidence more there never has been any evidence for because it didn't happen it did happen between Hillary the Democrats but it didn't happen with Trump there isn't a shred there will not be a shred of evidence and yet\nThey're still holding out hope [noise] Mueller and his people trying to remain relevant\nRising from the dead looking like Trump may answer some questions after the election remember the news stories about that\nHow many months maybe over a year now have there been stories about Trump will or won't submit the questioning by Mahler lawyers thinking should lawyers making sure the Trump wants to set the story is but his lawyers say no way [noise]\nMeanwhile the conversations never happen Trump never met with mother never answered written questions they weren't submitted a total non story that both sides you're participating in\nThe news now is the Trump might speak with smaller after the election might answer some questions after the election [noise]\nThe takeaway is that the primary weapon the Democrats thought they had to get rid of Trump and when the house and Senate has fizzled\nIt's not there so they're turning they always do to other things we also have the usual parade of celebrities\n[noise] brain dead idiots celebrities\nVomiting their opinions throwing away their money we have proven that we really are not motivated to do anything celebrities advised [noise]\nIt has been a long established the celebrities do not move public opinion when nobody is worried about celebrities think or do in that sense because they don't and yet\nThey persist\nWe now have the Oprah we're told the old ... is going to go into Georgia and campaign for the Democratic governor for Georgia Stacey what is your name ... what is the last time the Oprah was a factor in an election can anybody tell me\n[noise] you think Obama's first victory was was was it was time to to to the Oprah [noise] you\nThink she was helpful why but\nI Will admit that she didn't hurt me you think if Oprah hadn't been out there doing what the offer was doing it Obama would not have won okay Obama would have still won despite what the Oprah was hounded Barbra Streisand Barbra Streisand's out there she's trying to gin up\nAnti Republican vote by promising people to move to Canada if the Republicans hold the house\nThe anybody cares about that\nOther than the people say go get move it's going to motivate me to vote Republican\nAnd how many people on the Democrat oh my God we can't lose bathrooms oh no we can't have or move to Canada we got to vote Denver how many people think that that's going to be the way people take their vote\nAnd yet it makes the news it's a big deal that Barbara Streisand who nobody cares about might move to Canada how many Democrats over the years have threatened to leave the United states\nFrom a Birmingham business and talk with them about our

the mid term elections White House spokeswoman Sarah Sanders says it's\nSad and Mazie and the amount of time and energy that he has to stand by helping push for Republicans over the line and I think you're going to see that fruitful particularly when it comes to the Senate\nShe was on Fox and friends to the top military commander for North American says five thousand troops are expected at the southern border by the end of this weekend but more to come\nAir force general parents are showing us he says Eighteen hundred active duty troops are in Texas right now so far none of the troops then

couple of days for this to reach the mainstream [noise] [laughter]\nNah ... lemon says it on Monday Night on CNN and its noticed today and again he's talking the freight Cuomo\nAbout all the recent shootings in mailed pipe bombs and afraid though says there was another have filled criminal just last week and can turkey another white man in custody for shooting and killing two African Americans in a grocery store we barely had time to cover it\nWe have to stop demonizing people and realize the biggest terror threat in this country is white men most of them radicalized to the right and we have to start doing something about them there is no travel ban on them you know they have the Muslim ban there is no white guy ban\nNow Don Lemon ah what what is your reaction to this I mean this folks I'm telling you this is not a one\nOff this is I mean the specifics of a white guy ban them that that may be something that he\nIndividually holes with the idea that the opposition as far as the left is concerned is white men predominantly white Christian man that's that's got on the money that's right exactly wherever they are aimed in the perverted view of the American left is white men who created this racist and bigoted\nUnfair unjust immoral country do not consider me to be exaggerating here\nThat is what we are up against and this all of this from the from the uh Lenski days all the way up through the Obama administration and a real objective has been [noise]\nTo transform America away from\nThe traditions and institutions of the founding based on the fact that it's all racist and it's all bigoted and it's all unjust an unfair\nThey continue to point to slavery as the primary [noise] evidence the primary example or exhibits of their claim that America is unjust or unfair of course pay no attention to the\nSteps America took to end racism that gets no credit gets mentioned whatsoever as far as they're concerned racism and slavery still exist in prisons on the caravan immigration policy you name it [noise]\nAnd so this is what's animated and this is certainly what has energized and filled of women all over this country with rage leftist women it's being utilized\nTo what to great effect but that's the single organizing purpose is racial\nOr I was gonna say racist but it's racial in uh in its origins\nNow it covers much more grounded in terms of its objective but that's their target that's what they're using and had been for a while to energize everybody who is not a white man they're using a victim of allergy and victimhood in to a tea [noise]\nThey are making people think that they have no chance in America as long as white men continue to run it and be at white men or continue to be the majority and they just continually enraged people they ratchet up the anger there has to be an outlet for it [noise]\n\nI think they are if you if you want to start attaching if you want to start attaching media responsibility to the actions of people you notice how quickly they want to\nDo that notice how quickly on the left the people who commit crimes are not really responsible for them they're always the result of environmental things\nAnd so on the left telling us that these guys are being motivated by Trump they either love Trump or they hate Trump but whatever Trump is making them do these things\nI think it's day if you're gonna if we're going to go down that road and if we're going to start attaching blame the people who don't really have any responsibility for making the bombs or pulling the trigger on the guns who like I say you cannot turn on the news today and find a single thing positive about anything [noise]\nYou can't you you cannot find any reinforcement\nAnywhere in public media for the good innocent decency of America it's quite the exact opposite [noise]\n\nAnd since these people are the vast majority immediate you know they exempt themselves from having any role in all of this while they are eager to try to find anybody else in the media who might be to blame for this\n[noise]\nDon Lemon said a Monday Night also that he doesn't see Democrats killing people over politics [noise]\nYou mean Don like the followers of black lives matter [noise]\nAren't Republicans in that group [noise] look at the number of police officer been murdered Mr lemon by black lives matter supporters and look at how many of those cops murders have been defended [noise]\nAnd explained away\nBy people like you [noise]\nIn the sense well they're cops and they mistreat and they are racist they deserve it\nBut don't try to tell me that Democrats are killing people yeah how about the guy that shut up the Republican baseball practice I think he was intending to wound people Steve ... is almost did die it's amazing these people the way they talk in the things they conveniently forget or don't even register maybe in the first place\n[noise] five cops in Dallas two thousand sixteen

yes in me that was\nGreat long to hear it again someday but I just wonder are your thoughts on why we haven't seen or heard of any reporting on this airline that went down\nTwo days ago and I recall that last plane went down in Malaysia CNN was all over for about a month and a half a non stop the and we haven't seen anything about this this brand new plane that went that\nYeah where did it go down\nIn ... Taiwan there about a hundred and eighty nine people died it was a brand new I Believe is going I'm not exactly sure\nWell there's no way to link it to Trump that good point\nThere is no way to link it to the mid term elections there's no way to use that\nCrash to gin up anti Republican anti Trump no I'm not joking the hell\nNot I'm not joking and they don't care about it because it has no impact and has no usage they can see in affecting the outcome they wanting to mid term elections don't worry they'll get to it when it's time to attack a corporation\nLike bowling or whoever made the plane they'll get to it after they've done what they can do on the midterms\nMuch appreciate it\nYou do you do you do do do doubt me on this personally no but uh I just don't ever remember seeing them go when wall to wall on that last plane that went down\nWell of course because that's CNN CNN and they were there were there was they were sucking hot the uh they were in last place out there\nAnd this was that was pre Trump and the belief in media is that airline airplane crashes airliner crashed as a lot of passengers is white glow eyeballs are below the TV so they believe and then he had a mystery\nWhere it is a damn thing where is it Don Lemon even ask the former director of National Transportation Safety Board could it have been swallowed by a black hole\nRemembered that you remember that\n... percent we remember that nothing surprising well okay so ... ... but they\nThey had a mystery on their hands and and they you're right they went wall to wall with it and it became a standing joke you know that the the best way to make anything you're doing it success is to lose it and and have CNN try to find it for you\nI just haven't seen it on any media outlet whether it's Yahoo\nGoogle CNN NBC none of the nightly news show one picture from what a what a wait a minute how do you know about it then\nWell I saw a headline\nNews maybe where Monday morning Monday morning the headline news\nHeadline news they just announced they're getting out of the news headline news just announced they're going to go eighty percent uh uh uh advertising or something like what do you ever forget what you call that program but\nI just wanted to kill your that that was not one little usually anytime the plane goes to show him that many people especially it was a brand new planning that outlet\nWhen are you such a brand new playing what kind of playing was he says about what you remember the model number\nBut since it's brand new has got to be one of the dumb you know somewhat but uh and that's what made me think even more that we would see news Stewart Brand new plan going down his unusual and uh we were out\nOf the sea sucked into it\nI'll tell you what it was a bowling seven thirty seven max which is the latest uh upgraded to seven ... seven thirty seven is a debate wide body\nAnd not\nAs widely courses a jumbo jet white buddy but it's stuffy and they have a mix of the damn thing to try to make a whole more passengers went down\nBut it didn't go down in America a Donald Trump had nothing to do with it going down that they could they make a case uh they they could not say that the pilot was angry at Trump and decided to take everybody out in his ... ...\n... no way to link this I'm not I'm not joking [noise] [noise] [noise] [noise]\nI Wish I was there is

President Trump kicks off eleven rallies in eight states later today outside Fort Myers Florida we're Fox has that been brown is live at the heart arena [noise]\nEli said the president comes here tonight to rally support for his political allies in Florida and there's already thousands waiting in line to see him Sandy Shaw wants to hear him speak on one particular issue\nConsumers that any other business out there any other retail business\nI think the news business as people that know the least about their customers and consumers and I don't know of a business out there that that has contempt for their customers and consumers like the news media does\nI don't know if one [noise] I don't know of a business [noise]\nWho who who rejects half if not more of their consumers are customers like the news business does but the news media has a habit and that is is assuming\nAnd then operating on the assumption that whatever they think and wherever they care about is what everybody thinks or everybody cares about\nWell I'm not so sure that all that momentum got interrupted if that momentum was interrupted if that energy level decline that wire Trump's rallies still so over the he's got one in Fort Myers like at Fort Myers\nAfford my thousands of people already wind up Trump's got six rallies\nPlan between now and election day you've got all the way up to the night before the election [noise]\nAnd he's pumping a series of themes and one of the themes is how great these past two years have been for the U.S economy reviving moribund industry is bringing back employment\nBringing back wage increases bringing it back or economic confidence consumer confidence in the economy uh he's talking about how\nAll of the things he wants to do to slow down the illegal immigration buddy is having to deal with obstacles put on his way by both parties know was messages [noise]\nAnd he remains is upbeat and optimistic has anybody ever has in circumstances like this [noise]\nSo whatever is out there in the daily news media's not affecting Trump doesn't affect his mood doesn't affect his uh [noise]\nAttitude or anything of the sorts I think a lot of it as wishful thinking I got a lot of this idea that all of this momentum that the Republicans had has been kinda stopped because the pipe bomb and the synagogue shooting [noise]\nThis is you know I I circle back to I really don't know what's gonna happen on election day and I don't believe anybody else does because we don't have fortune tellers\nAnd all we have is polling data and they get that's toss up you want to believe in the ... not want to believe it is it is it accurate is showing these close races really close but we don't know we never know until the aftermath\nHere's Trump tweeting out at Paul Ryan Portland should be focusing on holding the majority rather than giving his opinions on birthright citizenship something you know nothing about our new Republican majority will work on this closing the immigration loopholes\nThis is about this is this a classic Trump comes out gets a conversation started on eliminating birthright citizenship and Paul Ryan is one of the first opponents to speak up\nCriticizing Trump saying why you can't do that that's unconstitutional but\nIt's ... I'll tell you what's frustrating to me there is all kinds of great news in this country economic news all kinds of a rebirth than there's evidence of it everywhere and the Republican Party itself is not even getting that message out\nI don't know about individual candidate to individual races but the national Republican Party apparatus if it weren't for Trump\nAnd his tweets\nAnd his his rallies the American people wouldn't have anywhere near the idea of the decent good things going on out there because Trump's own party is not joining the PR parade on this [noise]\nThat's one of the reasons I'm never going to join this crowd of people thinks Trump should stop tweeting and Trump should stop all these ah incendiary things he says why let me ask you\nSome people it's horrible what Trump said about Paul Ryan why isn't why answer that I Want to use it at a problem the\nPaul Ryan took the first chance he had to disagree with his own president about this and by the way all this this is a conversation starter right now [noise]\n\nIt's it's mandatory it's necessary that we have a conversation as we don't get a handle on this immigration problem you can say goodbye to America is you know it [noise]\nWhich is the design that's one of the reasons why the supporters are what they are Mollie Hemingway it was a great piece today [noise] speaking of cabin on it's just right on the money and let me ask you a question [noise] during the Kavanaugh hearings\nRemember all the Democrats question and Kevin I remember all of the allegations we had balls the Ford with her allegations of whatever capital I did that led to the fact that Kevin all the spiking punk with drugs to set women up for serial rape we had all of these women that were dragging forward\nClaiming they had evidence of it [noise] none of them ever present at any [noise] but the media and the Democratic\nParty were hell bent on convincing everybody that Kevin was such a rotten guy that his life and career deserve to be destroyed [noise]\nSo [noise]\nAfter Kavanaugh was named to the Supreme Court he is he passes it gets ... ... the confirmation vote and isn't sworn in\nWhy did the media drop it [noise]\nIf Kavanaugh was such a rotten S. O. B. Y. has the media stopped its investigation [noise]\nRemember all the Democrats are yeah yeah I would've Kavanaugh's confirmed we're going to a piece you were going to throw out of there we're going to get one of those guys are reverberate serial rapists where is all it just it's gone is it not [noise]\nMollie Hemingway if the media and other Democrat leaders wanted to have any credibility of all that the post hearing release of multiple allegations was not a pure political none\nFor which they were willing to destroy a man why they continue to fight for justice everyday wouldn't they they'd still be out there trying to nail Kevin all if all of that was legit [noise]\nIf if everything capital was accused of being was actually cruise they would not have stopped at him being confirmed on the Supreme Court they would still be out there right because the justice [noise]\nThey would be out there asking every democratic candidate whether he believes Ford and supported impeaching Kevin why are they doing that\nThere's a big campaign going Kevin always will be rallying point Kevin always a reason to deny the Republicans continued leadership in the house\nSo why isn't the media asking every Democrat candidate running for office [noise] their opinion of Kevin ... did you believe balls the Ford and if you did do you still support impeaching capital where are these questions\nThe reason those questions aren't being asked are the reason why the media isn't doing is just because it was all trumped up it was manufactured none of it was true it was a classic Democrat operation like every day I'm One of these is [noise]\nNone of what they were saying about Kevin always true it was manufactured they didn't bring balls the Ford up until the very end as a Hail Mary if Woolsey Ford were actually telling the truth she would have been one of the first witnesses\nShe would have been one of the primary ways the Democrats ought to get rid of capital but they had this little requests from her not Jimmy made ... laying eyes terrify the here and so they had a built in excuse not to use it that was convenient\nThis whole thing was manufactured\nThe whole thing was made up [noise] you Republicans running for office have you ever debates left you need to start asking the Democrat opponents they still oppose Kevin all don't let them get away with dying they ask you\nAsk them if they still support Kevin ... are opposed Kevin I asked them if they are going to demand that he'd be impeached if they win\nReelection or election [noise]\nIf this Kevin all thing is going to work it's going to have to be turned back on the Democrats the Republicans running for office are going to have to keep bringing this up either in campaign ads we've got a week it's not to wait to include this in any ad campaign if if it's been decided to leave it out\nNot too late to cut some new ads and re inserted [noise] people need to be reminded\nLet's pretend that some of the momentum was lost all of okay we've got plenty of time\nWe got the E R B network got all kinds of ways to remind people what happened to Brett Kavanaugh who did it what its purpose was and the proof that it was a series of lies and made up charges as evidenced by the fact that now there's not a single story about it [noise]\nBecause the media lost the Democrats lost [noise]\nIn their effort to destroy Kevin ... they lost in their attempt to use Kavanaugh they're hurting Democrat hurt Republicans in the in the mid term elections\n[noise] here's another one if Kavanaugh confirmations circus we're about justice for his alleged victims the women\nInstead of about killing his nomination by any means we'd still be getting updates on the story wouldn't we I mean if it was really the purpose [noise] about getting\nFox News I'm Chris foster President Trump tweets about house Speaker Paul Ryan he should be focusing on holding the majority rather than\nGiving his opinion on birthright citizenship

to my call I was a twelfth grade American history teacher for Twenty years and I finally had to\nLeave because the recession and ... he was becoming mine and I can handle I started writing my class cause courses because I couldn't handle how they had ... sized American history but the reason I called was the topic on immigration\nImmigration if it's in the book probably gets about one paragraph\nBut most people don't understand is one needs and millions of people came over to Ellis Island we didn't just open our honors and say come on in the way the Democrats want to get him now these people were given a thorough examination by it the ship\nEspecially looking after I take a device him like open up\nThe upper I live and if you had a disease called trek karma you were automatically let go they made you walk up and down steps to make sure that you are strong and we're not when that\nNow once the ship Dr performed has examination you were put on a ship and you were sent to Ellis Island where they gave you a second examination\nDoing the Tacoma exam once again\nWalking up and down the steps\nAnd if you didn't make it you were sent back about two percent of the people were sent back and the reason why it was so low is because the ship doctor really did a thorough exam\nIf you were sent back that ship had to pay for your passage back to Europe so they wanted to make sure we did not want any one quick not work\nWas not healthy and what's not strong you\nRealize that the what you're describing is factually correct there are people listening to you today who think my God America was cruel back then\nWhere am I that's what people are thinking listening to you and tell the story\nI'm sure they probably are because they've never heard it and we were compassionate to those who couldn't work um there was a saying that said I heard in America they had streets\nThen I heard the streets were paved with gold and then I found out I was going to be the one have you on the streets but we did not want people would be on welfare we did not want those people\nWe want it only strong healthy people\nThat's been totally left out of history books and I can't tell you how much it frustrates me\nTo listen to these Democrats talk about how wonderful it we will hold a lot of everybody not true\nI have a nine year old grandson and I just shut it to think

All right Chris is with us in Kansas City we were trying to rush through and when it just decide not to do that which is a good idea to Chris in your range of income and business in marketing a career or ... your worst fear and your best year\nOh I never really made a whole lot of money on I don't feel like a river really put my degree to work um I Would say my best year this is my wife and I's combined gross income was probably eighty thousand mhm I'm currently currently we make a between the\nTwo of us that grows a sixty thousand so we don't make a whole lot of money so well in your worst year when you started out probably\nOh just you know when I was Twenty one I'm making two Ninety an hour I think I've made twenty thousand a year\nAnd say okay and your degree is in what\nA sin business of marketing um I worked at a at a grocery store for thirty seven years or worked my way up\nAnd it was a butcher actually and ah I was forced out about three years ago because they said I was too expensive and at that point in time I kinda\nThought I had enough money to retire but I didn't wanna pay health insurance so I just am a courier now and uh I don't make a whole lot of money I make fourteen dollars an hour mhm but so I make enough to cover our living expenses as our retirement money is just sit and then throw it so I'm just kind of hold back\nOkay so you never mind over eighty but you're sitting on a one point eight million dollar net worth a tell me oh you did that once the key to that\nUh the key is the uh one thing I did it was kind of neat the first car I bought I did take a loan out\nFor a um a ever since I paid that first car I just kept money going into the bank so I every car after that I just paid cash for ... and my live within my means I'm\nWorking at the grocery store I used to see people that would come in and they would buy peanut butter and Dale bread and that's what they would try to live on the and I did not want to see myself doing that so\nI never uh I've never I Do I Do carry a credit card and I know that's against your teachings I pay off the balance every month they in a never paid any credit card fees at my entire life\nOkay so how do you end up at one point four or five million a mutual funds\nUm when I did work a this grocery chain every time I got a raise I put it into retirement um I think before I was forced out I was put twenty two percent of my check into my four oh one K. every every week did\nYou guys go on vacation and enjoy your lives as you were living in minor\nVacation so vacation usually the traveling to
