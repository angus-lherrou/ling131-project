who the reporter was at the CNN another matter they interviewed about the caravan and America and how to deal with I just I just want you to hear this we have to buy your number one\nWe have a caravan coming north we don't want all those people coming across our border\nAnd there are ways to deal with it I Believe that if we would ... those who are legitimately in need of asylum could be vetted before they even get to the border but you know what we're born in America you know how lucky we are to be born in America and not be born in Guatemala where they would say to your daughter\nYou know if you don't do what we want we will rape your daughter or we will kill your son if he's not a drug meal now they're marching north and you know what it could easily have been all of us that we're in the caravan there were marching north trying to save our families and save our children\nAll right so what is the ruse here or the technique here is a moral equivalence\n\nThere but for the grace of

about\nAnd\nIt may be something to feel very grateful for I have no quarrel with that but it's how you deal with\nThis [noise] that matters we simply can't take and everybody in the world they answered the solution is to\nSpread our area of dominant influence and to get rid of tyrannical regimes and dictatorships which treat their people like dirt\n[noise] uh and condemn that and do our best to spread our way of life around on the belief that it's good and decent but there are way too many people don't think we're the good guys\nAnd they think that the American way of life is an imposition to others and that we don't have the right to impose our views on people but somehow we ought to stay on the side and let everybody who wants him in because of our guilt\nAnd he says uh\nYou know it did their Marjorie nor is it could easily have been all of us that we're in the caravan that we're marching north trying to save our families and save our children\n[noise] but it isn't [noise] you know you can do\nI wouldn't [noise] [noise] no I haven't been\nTrained I don't work the post office so I haven't been trained but I I've looked at these things and knowing after the

but that one does strike me as a bomb in there [noise]\n[noise] [noise]\nBox News I'm Krista posture former vice president Joe Biden and the actor Robert De Niro or the latest critics of President

that if I worked in a post office and how many how many packages and pieces of mail go through the region every day I don't know how long they look any baggage but there was nothing that would have told me that there's a bomb in there now maybe\nPostal workers are trained that if things are in the shape and size and so forth I'm sure there's some of that kind of training that there might be a bomb something had the clue these people in\nA to the fact that there was odd and US Airways some of these were delivered like today it got to the CNN mail room or even though John Brennan doesn't
