[noise]\n\nEighty percent may hit ... even if it's just sixty percent of their time on your show again they're not focusing on the care of him [noise] [noise] that tells me that if the caravan wore a

interviews with a mean guy Trump is are they just want to come to America does and that may yet happen down the road CNN is is not wall to wall but they are predominantly focusing on the show gave\nAnd of course whatever CNN does just to try to damage Trump let's look and see wife CNN is so ticked off because Trump's approval numbers are higher than they've ever been now and there are higher than Obama's war at this stage in the ah in his mid terms with the same point in his presidency after two years there just beside themselves none of this\nIs happening the way it was supposed to happen now there's more and more stories about how the blue wave may not happen hip hid it never was going to happen I don't I don't think anybody has ever known whether it's going to be a blue

or a red wave election as an happened yet\nEverybody wants to rely on polling data to suggest that it's going to happen but the polling data hasn't been accurate either starting in two thousand sixteen or the presidential race\n[noise]\nSo we've got this caravan chugging north and I think it'll put some things in perspective on this\nAgain the way to look at it is is as a a microcosm\nOf what's happening every day at our border every day this is what's happening [noise]\nNot seven thousand a day but but but every day this is what's been going on for decades and it needs\nTo stop and Donald Trump is the only person that's ever talked about working to make it stop [noise] now the Democrats\nIf there are behind this one of the strategic ... besides getting somebody hurt [noise]\nAnd blaming it on Trump maybe what they're hoping\nIs a Trump actually won't do anything about it [noise] maybe they're hoping that Trump will be all Huffington puff talk about sending the military down they're talking about setting a National Guard but not actually doing anything they might be rolling the dice that Trump isn't going to do anything because they think\nFor a host of reasons every one

may go claiming they were inciting violence palm pay also they're inciting violence under the influence of politically motivated leaders\nHow is it raising the stakes\nTo point out what is happening what is the secretary of state Pompeo raised the stakes Sunday night how is it raising the stakes to point out what's happening\nEspecially when\nWe have a party a political party that believes in open borders a media and the party that believes in open borders they will never report anything negative about these invaders\nWho right mind wouldn't want this [noise]\nWho in their right mind

to happen it's not for the good of America it's got to be for something else so Pompeo goes down and promptly identifies what's happening here NBC says raising mistake what's cakes\n[noise]\nWe have somebody finally pushing back on this because remember the Republican Party up until Trump never didn't push back on this they they came up with their own reasons for wanting\nAmnesty for illegals and for you know having a fall push on securing the border on Sunday night ... who met with the Mexican president\nWent on the offensive alleging in a statement that many of the migrants were criminals themselves by definition they are if they intend to cross the border illegally they're all criminals political world\nIt's so damn hard to understand about this [noise]\nI think it's a classic illustration of how tough this country is getting in one of the reasons this country is getting soft is because the elderly or senior generations are turning over everything to the young who haven't lived long enough to know what's best\nThey're being driven solely by emotion govern slowly by a motion not any ... any kind of common sense and because of some odd quirk that's happened\nIn our

world do not have an entitlement to the United states taxpayers back pocket but the Democratic party assumes or seems to think that they do\n[noise]\nThe Democratic party is calculating that there are more people who want to get in to the American taxpayers back pocket then there are American taxpayers [noise] and so the Democratic party is siding with the people around the world who have nothing [noise]\nWho think that because the United states has a lot [noise] they should just be able to come in and get whatever they want [noise]\nAlmost as an entitlement we have a political party pushing this we have a political party promoting this this political party ought to be no where near winning any thing\nIn the next elections there is not a single reason to vote for these people under any

promote by some members of this group\nAll of these people trying to force their way and\nIt's called an invasion and thank God we have a president that will stand up to an invasion of like this but I don't know our constitution that Governor thing call out military troops to stop and invasion and I've heard people on TV so called experts say where you can use the military because of the positive comments out is look\nThat normally prevents a military from being used against its own citizens\nIt has nothing to do with using the military to stop an invasion from another country so there was nothing unconstitutional illegal about the president doing what we do a Wilson did put tens of thousands of people on the border\nAnd make sure nobody forces there way you know\nIt's a no brainer folks get is a number of the president can do that and has committed to it [noise] ... you you\nYou he may not send the military they may call as a as a Congress and the government says there but

Russian I Hope you and your family's all doing good listen I I think this has all the makings of a bad set up for Trump because of the optics are I don't care if you're a militarized border if they bomb\nRushed the border like the ... down in the southern side of Mexico where they tried to stop them what's our military is supposed to break out the times or water hoses or tear gas that's just going to look so bad that Trump is going to take the brunt of it but he needs to do is call a\n... a house and the Senate back into the emergency session and doing national address and put everybody on the line not just try to deal with this self\nSo bring him back in for a special session or their wife passed legislation specifically saying that this mob is seven thousand can't come in\nSomething though that short\nI mean you think Trump needs to share the burden of providing the optical that if Trump sends a military down and they started cracking the heads and it looks bad for Trump\nExactly so you think that's what the actual intention here is by the people that play on this thing\nExactly and that's where it can try to deal with this on his own she leaves to put everybody else's but on the line get 'em on tape on film or whatever what should we do what would you like to do if they come across\nActually like that in a way I like making Schumer and Pelosi stand up for

use AT and T. stadium is Jerry Jones palace where the cowboys play with a hundred thousand people in there [noise]\n[noise] [noise]\nSo you think the Democrats can get together a mob of seven thousand people have march jumped through Mexico mad look oh it's really they are those people really and we're supposed to sympathize with it they don't show you\nThe thousands upon thousands standing outside lining up twenty four hours in advance to get into a Donald Trump rally and I'm telling you that kind of thing does not happen\nTo people losing elections were about to lose elections who are losing favor with the American people it does not happen [noise]\nHow many of you by the way how many have you joined a crowd of of of of Seventy five thousand people at a Seventeen or Eighteen thousand seat venue and yet they do I wouldn't I wouldn't if I drop by and saw the crowd that being from the get go home watch it on\nOkay back to the phones we go to a voting in Macon\nGeorgia great to have you with us on the E R B network Hi thanks for having me on Russia appreciate you about Wilton it's great to have you here\nHe thinks the reason why I called it with a lot of years and military are retired from the range although we are very good a lot of things we are not good\nAt basically civilian type a non lethal warfare we've gotten much better at it since Afghanistan and Iraq started but that is one saying throughout the years we not be good at so this situation and look I'm I'm One hundred percent for put in the military before but this one is perilous and we have to be careful\nWell when when you say the military is not prepared for an invasion you're talking about this is not a military invasion you're talking about a ... a human way of uh invasion of people that are largely are going to be thought of is starving thirsty poverty stricken this kind of think simply demanding\nLife well my dad let it play\nIn the military is not used the standing up to people like that certainly not inflict thing and the harm on them is that what you're saying\nYeah I think the difference is you know when it comes to locality we're very good when it comes to less lethal we that's just not something we do that well we are the individual you're sort of very good at it but that wouldn't be enough\nTo okay what about this what about just the presence here is the U.S military standing at the border you will not cross okay what happens then if they do and whether or\nNot the problem that's the peril is part of the problem\nWe're about you know you and you'll ... you'll use bullet you use a one of the dummy is called I forgot about the use use some kind of force but not lethal\nAnd we have a variety of different things you but you know all it takes one person going down and squeal or like a pig and then it's you know we we just have to follow up I don't see anything good coming out of this but the presence would be tremendous\nBut the president's would be okay so there's ... ... you think the military showing up is let me just put\nWords in your mouth and you tell me if I'm right or wrong and interpreting you you think the military showing up as a lose lose proposition\nNo ethic additionally is a great idea but we have to be prepared for the next step\nWell but you say we can't take the next step because the next step is not what they're good at they're not used to it I don't know how to do it\nNow that's the parrot\nAbout ... or they wish that we'd have to be prepared politically and militarily while there what is it what's the preparation we\nHave to be prepared to use deadly force I'm like\n\nOkay well let's let's let's let's let me give you a scenario that okay I'm just doing this in the interest of time I'm not that may it may sound\nAnd says I don't mean that they hold the line they hold the line\nProvide a visual presents a visual obstruction they send the signal not welcome do not cross there will be constant warnings what somebody does and they have to shoot one or two then what happens\nThat we'd have to want to see a lot of people fall in line it probably would push or talking about members of the immigrants illegal aliens but we'd have to be prepared to take that one or two it's terrible but that's what it\nTakes you don't think if one or two got shipped than it was storm caused the mob the rain storm the military just in and and and essentially storm the bullet storm ... you'd think they would cease and desist\nAwfully they will cease and desist I'll tell you there's a lot of times you'll go to the old when they're going to we just have to\nBut even if there is a casualty or to the drive by having her story Trump or white or Jerry fires on harmless or an armed hopeless people\nAnd there's the parents yeah\nOkay so the alternative is so let me\nKnow know after a whole lot it and like I said you know what the Democrats are always saying hey somebody's got to tell you one for the the legal\nSleep it's unfortunate but this is what they what they take it all by taking there's just your\nOwn okay right so the responsibility for what happens to them has to be on them you think the media is going to allow that this is um [noise] a left I I look I Can't start another thought because I couldn't finish it we've got to take a break\nRush Limbaugh making radio\nAgain you're listening to the\nMid ...
