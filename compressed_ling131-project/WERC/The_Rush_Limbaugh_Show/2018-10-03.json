I ... I understand Republican senators saying what they're saying oh\nMy God I don't know why the president that\nHe did it for some reason [noise] everybody's pointing out that the Trump just last week was saying she was very credible yeah he did and we knew when he said that why he said it\nHe had to everybody has to [noise]\nAll this is a investigated and put your but you can't run out there [noise] and start ripping\nHer even if it's deserve even if it's warranted last week you could not read up on Christine Baltimore and there was nothing there is no upside to doing it no matter if you were right\nEven if she was lying there were teeth and you can demonstrate all last week was not the time to do it so Trump joined the chorus I find compelling I find her very credible\nWill now she's not so credible she never was but now she's not so credible is all kinds of holes in Trump just pointed out all Trump did is pointing out the flaws in her story which should've happened\nDuring the hearing last Thursday but the Republicans were not going to go there they were not going to challenge or because it just wasn't\nSmart\nSpecially with that voice that she was affecting to go after her in any way that would seem like an attack or like you didn't believe her whether or not been politically useful but in a in a normal congressional hearings committee hearing\nHer allegations wouldn't be challenged in tests that they were not that's all Trump did\nTrump pointed out the mistakes or the lies or the difference is the prevailing occasions she can't remember where when who the people she says we're there says they weren't that's only did Republican senators should have done that last week but they couldn't\nSo Trump's given uncovered Trump writing shade for them and let them go out and rip him for doing it if they want to understand that by this time we have to assume Trump knows what he's doing when he goes off script you doesn't step and it\nIt might look like it but\nHe doesn't but that's not the big takeaway [noise] the big take away from me as this one year the New York times has been investigating the trumps for forty years they've got tax returns going back who knows how long\nAnd guess what's not part of the story I guess what\nIs not part of any income tax story on Donald Trump guess what one word you do not see in the report anybody want to take a guess\nWhat I often do you say no that's not the word what one word is\nNot in this entire New York times story I'll give you a hint\nIt was the sole reason the left wanted to get their hands on Trump's tax returns Russia at ten for that yet they want to Trump's tax returns because their tax returns they said\nWould prove Trump colluded because his money came from Russia because his wealth was because and due to Russian connections that's what everybody on the left was convinced was true and now here's the New York times story\nYear long investigation Trump's taxes going back more than forty years and they're not able to find any Russian mommy\n\nSo now they didn't find any Russian money and I guarantee you they expected to\n\nThey're the ones that said this they're the ones that said I'm Talking about everybody on MSNBC CNN go back a year ago back to the two thousand sixteen campaign when everybody was held in on proving\nThat Trump was they put in storage\nTrump was it totally comp was compromised by Russia because it was Russia that enable Trump to get rich and his tax returns would prove it they said so I guarantee you when the New York times got these documents the first thing they did\nWas make a B Line key word search however they search it looking for Russia Russia and Russian names answer big fat zilch zeroed not so now they're on to something else now they're back to what's always been said about Trump but he got rich from his dad now\nI haven't actually or whatever something somebody said and James borrow things mostly are too young to remember\n[noise] a bottom line and I know what had happened to a woman comes for political\nNow what grams point is there's a lot of young people in his audience it don't remember\nThe Clinton years in Nineteen Ninety two when James Carville was trying to destroy all John's\nHey you never know what you got to do when you got to be able to print it by like what you're going to come up with what you're not gonna you're gonna come up with women like New Hampshire aren't great but it's not a\nBill Clinton and that's Hillary Clinton was right in there trying to help destroy those women and Lindsey Graham was referring that these people in the audience didn't know what they thought he was talking about Ford\nAnd that's when he stopped and said I see that's actually a reference to something somebody said James Carville most of you are too young to remember this so not only do they live in denial that it ever happened now they're trying to shut down anybody who brings it up\nYou know the Clinton years in what they did the women supposed to go down the memory hall\nNow I have a transcript and anti Kevin all protester was confronted a ... a Republican senator and he pushed back\n... this was an attack or a confrontation walking down the hall or any Kevin all protesters have flooded Capitol Hill and they've been allowed to get into the hallways of the offices\nIn Senate office buildings or how does that happen [noise] but\nWhat we all know that what happens but they're they're one of these protesters approached Republican Senator Bill Cassidy of Louisiana on his way through a Senate building walkway Monday\nAnd she said why are you supporting Kevin ... where are you supporting capital Cassidy did not ignore her he took the chance to push back\nHe asked her if she would like it if her loved ones were destroyed by uncorroborated charges [noise]\nCassidy why wouldn't I support Kavanaugh protester because rapist or bad Cassidy wait a second everybody there Senate didn't happen\nEither rape anybody so why am I gonna so you're going to you're going to believe mark judge over a woman no I'm going to believe her best friend who says it didn't happen she wasn't there\n[noise] her best friend didn't say didn't happen her best friend said she wasn't told about it in her best friend said she didn't remember it\nProtester so you're okay as a doctor to harm a woman Cassidy\nWait a second are you OK as a person to go ahead and do accept the non corroborated charge to destroy somebody's life\nIt would destroy your wife your son's life or your husband's wages that can answer that question if it was your husband your son your father whose life has been destroyed by uncorroborated would you like that\nProtester I Would support a full FBI investigation we're dealing with appropriate robots I'm Glad Cassidy push back but it's a lost cause on the protestors protestors not even hearing what he says she's got program dancers bought and paid for by George Soros\nAnd she hears key words and what he says knee jerk reaction causing things replies accordingly [noise]\nYou know no would you like and on\nFor robbery charge destroyed I wouldn't marry somebody that was a drunk said the protestor oh wait a minute uncorroborated answer the question I don't think you're able to because you know it's unfair\nProtester I Would stand up ... you know it's unfair protester I Would fight it would make sure women or heard clearly you're all care for rapist goes on the Supreme Court\nCassie no not [noise]\nBut then on the other hand clearly you're okay the absence of evidence obviously means nothing to you protest you know there is evidence look at a standard how many people are in jail for ...\nSo what does this ... unless somebody like me gets hold of a transcript of southern like this and help people understand that it's a total waste of time to engage in these protesters especially if you're trying to persuade them\nYou can't persuade them I just like you can't persuade the media you know I'm I've told this story when I was first at this\nVery young Web behind the ears naive and the media would want to talk I thought just because they're really interested I didn't know nobody's ever heard of me a radio shows taking off I thought they were legitimately curious\nAnd that's how I went into early interviews I found out that not at all they weren't curious about anything they were simply there to discredit me\nMake fun of me to raise doubts it took me\nLonger than I Want to admit to figure this out you cannot persuade these people you can't change their minds and debate it's why I say the only option is to defeat them politically and that's happening\nThat somebody has to have to say rush probably ... being met here Dave Ramsey

word mocking would have been to impersonator he didn't do that see this is what's wrong Donald Trump simply voiced what no Republican senator would have\nThese are the questions she should have been asked last Thursday by Republican senators heard timeline\nShould have been challenged her allegations should have been challenged but they weren't the Democrats weren't going to the Democrats announced her and stayed in her to be credible\nShe's above and beyond reproach you cannot challenge or she is the accuser so the Republicans they they they they played right along and without had Rachel Mitchell ask her some questions which now turned out to be brilliant but at the time we were all kind of curious what what's the purpose was\nUm all\nTrump this is reminding everybody what she said\nShe doesn't she doesn't know the people she says we're there say they weren't there\nThis is not mocking her and this is a sign of what really is wrong in this country and accuser comes forward and you can't poke holes in obvious places [noise]\nYou can't point out\nObvious discrepancies you cannot reference or make mention of the differences in her story from depending on the day she's

[noise]\nThat gives him credibility it makes people kind of caught their head they don't think Trump can be that's fair I'm Talking about the ... on the left Democrats they don't think Trump can be that that's a reasonable\nBut he does it to them every time it gives them the credibility later\nTo be critical and just step away he said yeah I found a credible I've found are compelling then as we learn more and then there's events play out Trump is able\nTo parlay his original statements into what he really thinks based on what is not a knee jerk reaction if Trump were to heaven sent initially when he said last night at the rally\nWhy there would have been held up pay but now he can back it up now there's all kinds of evidence that her timeline doesn't make any sense [noise]\nWe've got an ex boyfriend claiming she is a polygraph experts and has taught people how to beat them\nWe have people challenging her account we didn't have that last week it is perfectly fine for Trump to do what he did\nIt gives him a credibility later to be critical step away it's a common technique you use as he does it on everything\nIt's why I've always told you don't take his first draft statement or his first tweet as a sign that he's caving or flipping you people you I'm sure you remember there haven't been many instances in fact I may have fallen for one myself that's how I learned\nThat Trump will tweet something or say something it'll make you look like he's about late ... before he pulled out above the Paris climate accord\nWhat did he say climate change very serious thing and we have to look at it than we are looking\nAt the moon to the right to oh so he's on record as being open about that later on when he's learned when he needs to learn comes out tells you what do you think's really\nThinks it's a pattern it's a technique is a trumped developed I don't even know if he developed or it's just how he does it naturally and instinctively\n[noise] but I call it pacing now

E. R. C. [noise]\n\nBreathing so welcome back Rush Limbaugh the network books your ear is the is the James them to the gym and guarantee quote from a National Review\nUm the more time I spent covering politics the more I'm convinced that a significant chunk a grass roots political activists are not really arguing about politics at all\nOf these people are actually struggling with personal psychological issues and projecting them under the world of politics may know I've been searching for that description for years I have no\nProblem admitting that I was unable to put this together it's one of the rare moments I was unable to\nThis is exactly right\nWe're dealing with people who have suffered some kinds of psychological disorder\nThey've turned to politics for a solution or the written Ben is actually what they're looking for and they don't just want revenge against who ever did whatever to them they are now demanding that every representative of the group that or the individual that did something can\nBe made to pay a price for it that's what the\n... this this uh ... well [noise]\nMe too movement in large part was never bipartisan it was thought to be said to be but it never was a and even if it if okay even if it was it's been co opted by the Democratic party look at look at the uh [noise] Occupy Wall street\nBut look at black lives matter I take take any left wing group that you want it's made up of people who for some reason I think they have been unjustly mistreated by somebody\nAnd instead of dealing with that in their lives they enter politics and they demand that the Democratic party take up their cause of the Democratic party willingly has the Democratic party has become the party\nOf all of these disparate constituency groups\nWith their singular causes\nBecause the Democratic party realizes that they can combine all of these things into a singular assault on the concept of America that America is responsible for what happened to these people they capitalism is responsible that the power structure that the founding is responsible\nAnd so people with psychological disorders are being granted the status of normalcy\nAnd then the big donors come along and underwrite them and fund their efforts and they become political movements\nAnd then they become victims and then of course allows them to blame everybody for what has gone wrong in their lives and then they demand reciprocity or revenge or what have you and I can tend to view that most people in our side have no idea how to deal with\nThis no idea whatsoever so we ended up and debates about whether [noise] boys want to pretend to be girl so they can go into girls' bathrooms and becomes legitimate and stick\nIt in in many not that specifically but just the whole concept of what is happening here and it is a violent bullying intimidating\nMovement that has\nBeen constructed to push all of these disparate various agenda and the target is America the target as America is founded the target is American Capitalism and so when our caller says that Kavanaugh\nIs simply a stand in for men who have abused every woman out there he's right balls the\nFord will end up being supported by other women who've been abused whether she's telling the truth or not it doesn't matter because\nIt didn't happen to them these women we do know that are out there watching this it did happen to them and by God somebody's going to pay for it in this case will be capital that's how they're going to be heard\nRather than just deal with the specific incident that happened to them it's the same thing I think\nWith black lives matter or the NFL players kneeling for the anthem a all cops are bad every white cop is a rate every black convict is in is\nIn every instance here points to the country as large as being responsible in unfairness in bias and discrimination in racism all of this the Democratic party is the organizing party the collection agency for all of these complaints [noise]\nDemocrat parties happy to make victims out of anybody who wants to be one and Democrat Party is happy to promise these people that they'll fix it\nAnd they never do they never the raging angered never ends if only gets worse\nBecause the Democrats don't fix anything and finally it doesn't even depend\nOn being fixed it just means somebody's got to pay in this case capital he's got to pay\nWhether he did it or not\nNow Sarah Sanders White House press briefing is going on she just lay the end of the press and she said exactly\nWhat I said if I don't mind saying so she said Trump didn't mock anybody last night he simply recites did the fact\nAnd he said all of this can be laid at the feet of the Democrats they are to blame for this none of this needed to have happened in public they had ... ... email or in a letter ... way back in July they could have done everything that's been done to investigate her claim\nOff record behind the scenes nobody knowing about it but they didn't do that they waited to use it as a Hail Mary [noise]\nShe dispute the idea that Trump mock she said all he was doing was reciting the facts here it is again this is what the press the media everybody is out now ripping Trump claiming that he mocked Christine walls before\nOf attacks from Trump held an attack anybody told everybody who the guy\nIs and here is Sarah Sanders from the press briefing just now exactly as I said she got a question from John Roberts and it was all about\nDo you think that maybe the president shouldn't have done it marking her like that because it gets Collins and Murkowski ended me in the way they vote or do you think the president for maybe should have not done it\nThe president was dating the facts and frankly facts that were included in special prosecutor Rachel Mitchell's report\nHe was fading facts that were given during Dr Ford testimony innocent it has to make a decision based on those facts and whether or not\nThey see judge Kavanaugh to be qualified to hold the position on the Supreme Court every single word judge Kavanaugh has said it's been picked apart every single word second by second of his testimony has been picked apart yet if anybody says anything about\nThe accusations that have been thrown against them that's totally off limits and outrageous\nExactly right ya can't challenge her so Trump did for everybody else who doesn't have to go ... to\nDo it [noise] Trump did it [noise] and yeah he's provide no little shade for some of these people hide under [noise] [noise] and I'll guarantee they may be publicly saying I Wish you hadn't done a Dutch outrageous what prompted their thinking everybody did it privately\n[noise] somebody has to say it [noise] [noise] it's the freaking truth [noise] [noise]\nOkay

speak to you again a right to have your back you great to be on again anyways so I'm watching this whole thing on me too movement watching the Kavanaugh hearings I'm I'm Fifteen I'm just regular straight guy\nThat's going to have normal but I think that I really cannot believe any of these women that pop up on TV anymore you can't believe any of them or come an old guy raped me the guy did this to me did that to me you know you had to draw on CNN or like a couple of months ago saying that a guy raped or because he asked her for her phone number\nCan't believe any of them and I think that what this this whole me to kind of white\n... ... ... that that is my exact point I Believe that woman\nI Believe she thinks she was raped when somebody asked her for her number that's how she's been conditioned\nWomen's studies on campus the the outright hatred for a man you know I keep talking about it but it's relevant capturing the Kennan this was back in the nineties she was a professor of women's studies at Michigan\nShe taught women in her class the oral sex is rape even the sex of marriage the women were lapping up and women have been taught for two generations now that men are basically predators and that their own kids are not safe from their fathers\nAnd it's not random it's widespread it is part and parcel of higher education today so you have a woman and she could be acting I mean she could be making this up could be a political activist but it's entirely possible at the same time out from\nThat the cause of what she's been taught and heard on the news and talking to her she made all literally believe that men don't have no right to ask her phone number is the same thing as bullying her raping her that's my point she may really believe it\nWill rush of you know the same woman that are screaming about living rates are also the ones who want to have the right to having abortions it so they could have unlimited sex\nYou\nEver um uh you're right sex without consequences but you better not\nBut then they claim that all men are predators but then they run to run hook up and then they want to have abortions for free\nWhether it's their idea then everything's fine\nIf not better I by the way here's this you're\nAlso right of it's not all women but it's been made to look like that isn't it\n[noise] the me too movement supposedly includes women\n[noise] women on across America who do not think this way are being lumped into this movement\nAgainst their will\nOr it's just an assumption that the Democrats and the drive by media or making

L. and everyone comes home\n... ...\nJoining us American we're glad you're here this is the day Ramsey show mobile phones and live in a new five five two to five [noise]\nJake's on Facebook\nFollow me there ... dot com slash Dave Ramsey and you'll get part of the messages we put on their Facebook\nDoes not put everything through the throttle are messages\nSo they can make us by ads from them you know it doesn't really work that way guys but I Try\nAnyway he says what's the difference between a credit union in a bank a bank is owned by stock holders that when the bank makes a profit and they should make a profit we want them to make some profit\nWhen the bank makes a profit the stock holders the owners of the company\nYet that profit basically I mean it is the\nProfits dispersed in the form of um dividends or the value of the stock has increased because the bank continue ... whatever it is\nBut basically the owners of a bank are stockholders and that's where the profit ... a credit union is operated more like a cooperative where the owners of a credit union are there it's actually not for profit technically speaking\nAnd um the not the owners of the credit union are the credit union members which are also the customers\nAnd so as a customer of the credit union those services in\nInterest rates and whatever you pay the credit union they profit that has created is return to the members in the form of increased services or in the form of actual disbursement ...\nI mean sometimes you actually just get a little check from your credit union put into your account and so uh that's the difference uh banks don't like or don't offer banks don't like credit unions they say they have an unfair advantage\nBecause there have nonprofit status I'm more or less really not true\nUm the it's real simple the credit union simply does not make a profit because whatever profit is made just plow back into cheaper checking accounts\nBetter interest rates on loans or higher interest rates on savings and so the you know basically they end up not making a profit so if a bank wanted to uh make less profit could do the same thing\nSo they don't have a disadvantage they're just trying to keep stock holders happy and sell stuff to customers the credit union has customers that are the stockholders in a sense the owners are the members and so it returns and all of that really doesn't matter ... bit\nIf you don't get good service from the organization\nAnd so we endorsed credit unions\nAre not because of their nonprofit status\nBut because they have reasonably priced goods and ... are reasonably priced banking services for you to use\nAnd you'll be treated not like a number you'll be treated ... by you know people that actually care\nYou'll also have that similar experience at a local community by a regional bank and that's who I Do business with personally I don't personally have an account right now a credit union I'm not opposed to I just don't\nMy stuff our our business accounts and our a personal accounts are all how low called a ... our regional and I'm a community banks in our area we do business with several banks\nAnd so and it's very simple it's just because I Need to pick up the phone and talk to a human being that actually has a little bit of power that can pull stuff off now I don't my CFO does but my controller knows that kind of thing but but in you know that's what you should want you should be able to walk in and talked to a human and not be treated like a number\nAnd you know so I Do not understand why anyone would do business with people like Wells Fargo or bank of America it's beyond me they treat you like crap and they over charging for most of the services\nAnd this day in time there online offerings their Web banking systems are not any more sophisticated\nThey're not that good they're not good at anything\nSo I just don't get it so that that's why we endorsed credit unions you hear me in some of your city is endorsing a local credit union or a local small town community type bank and I'm just a a huge fan of using that for your", "show_name": "The Rush Limbaugh Show", "year": "2018", "city": "Birmingham", "day": "03"}
