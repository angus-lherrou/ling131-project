{"month": "10", "state": "AL", "station": "WERC", "content": "The a fire in a request for a pay raise or something\nWell [noise] there's a very complicated issue and I have not come out for or against um it is not a simple issue I Will tell you that um I was on the phone ... very late last night\nCoordinating um to get the mayor to come on the show [noise] he and I used to be very good friends back in the day\nAnd so what I have asked is that he come on and once I have the day I'm going to ask Marty length and with the fire is technically not a union I forget what the firefighters association\nI'm\nI'm going to ask the two that I'm going to have the two of them on we're going to do it in the eight am our we're just coordinating the day [noise] and I'm going to moderate and what I'm going to do is give each of them an opening segment of about seven minutes and then\nI'm I'm going to cultivate questions from listeners it won't be a gotcha I'm not going to let them interrupt each other [noise] um I'm not going to allow it to degenerate into name calling in and uh the ignorance or we're going to have a public policy discussion\nThe truth of the matter is [noise] a lot of times people want to make complicated public policy discussions about whether you loved firefighters or whether you love the cops or whether you loved the mayor or\nAll sorts of things like this um I Can't give you a short answer to that question\nIt is\nI served for six years on Houston city council and I will tell you\nThat the way policy has been made the white policy gets made at the city\nIs piecemeal patchwork [noise] and when you when you do things that are piecemeal patchwork over the course of Thirty years and it's really back to about Nineteen Ninety One well actually you you could you could really\nLook too about Nineteen Ninety five for where the current problems start\nUm you have a situation\nWhere the firefighters um the firefighter package\nIs not where it should be there's no doubt about that so now you're put it into a situation where you say is the passage\nOf prompt me\nUm [noise] the answer well\nIt's a pretty accelerated true up and that is a pretty dramatic effect on the city's finances is the ... going to go bankrupt overnight it probably pass this no\nBut it's going to have a dramatic financial effect overnight and whether you love Sylvester Turner or you hate semester Turner\nAnd I understand that the firefighters are cross ways with Sylvester Turner and I understand why but this is not always the best returns problem in fact very little of this problem is actually Sylvester Turner problem this problem goes back to\nA really goes back Thirty years and and uh\nHave to account for the fact that firefighters and police officers do very different jobs\nIn very different ways firefighters work twenty four hours on um [noise] how long you're on how much you have to pay to be competitive the various levels of danger the various levels of expertise\nThe pension plans which are different these two classified positions it it is I Will tell you if you love public policy if you love figuring out how the dollars are to be spent in what you want to accomplish with the city budget\nIt's a it's a worthwhile conversation to have\nI'm I'm fortunately that is never what these campaigns are about ... ... they're about picking sides [noise] um and and that's unfortunate because I I've heard some negative statements made by firefighters that they're lazy I'm all they do is he and I would I have a lotta firefighter buddies and I was a kid with them about that\nBut make no mistake a kid with everybody our kid with rebel when our kids would felt that um [noise] it is also a difficult job\nAnd I'm the firefighters have a reasonable case for a pay increase and and and some things that they're looking for that should be accomplished this is a big by all at once\nAnd that will affect the city's finances so I don't have the right answer I Wish I did I I Wish this situation had been dealt with Thirty years ago a in a more reasonable manner but every mayor for the last Thirty years\nBears responsibility for kicking the can down down down the road and that's that that is a reality that Lester Turner inherited so regardless what you think of him on any other issue that that is a reality that he inherited\nThey didn't even testing Indian DNA because they didn't have any and she goes out and announces this\n\nSo she is one one thousand twenty fourth Mexican\nOne one thousand twenty fourth Peruvian one one thousand twenty fourth Colombian and does she trace maybe to the drug cartels in Colombia\n[noise]\nWhy is there a dearth of Indian DNA [noise] why is there not much Indian DNA out there\nOr was the problem that bustamante couldn't find any matches for Warren using only in the ... so he felt the need doing expanded to include in South America when other reason there isn't much into your DNA is because they\nAre very very wary of\nThis the Indians themselves the Cherokee tribe the leaders will tell you they don't use DNA to determine the limit injured they use junior logical\nTrace you know who has one of the best junior logical trace apparatus was in this country in the Mormon church\nOut in Salt Lake City has one of the most advanced respected documented genial logical praise organizations that you'll find\nI have I've seen their work and it is [laughter] it's amazing and that story I\nGet is that many Native Americans have been very leery of granting DNA be cause they're leery of how it's going to be used\nThey already feel like they were discriminated bunch of people but on the same token there are some benefits that have been extended to them as a result of this and they just don't want to upset the apple cart so they don't even realize or utilize DNA\nIf any of this but\n... the media of course has a role here because everything they've reported about this turns out to be an abject lie except British inclusion by the Boston Globe that there wasn't any\nNative American DNA and by the way this is not what Trump that her anyway Trump that her that she wouldn't have to take a test from a little kitten with wandering around you can you can do a very rudimentary DNA test\nAnd he wanted to present her ... take the kids take the take the test of this kid's using it in a debate a future debate\nAnd that's what he meant that she wouldn't do and he ... that she wouldn't show up at the Indian if she did do it\nBut you talk about talk about a meltdown and its Trump that is causing this Trump is literally causing these people lose their cookies compass causing them to go insane and I think it's happening\nThroughout the Democratic party and for out the American left and I have I have developed\nAn even greater reason for it and it all in all relies on things that I have previously known and told you about\n... and most of it is related to my curiosity here and my suspicion and my my dubious a nature when it comes to this blue wave business\n[noise]\nWe've been hearing for the past how many months that there's going to be a blue wave there's no question about it there has been no question about the Democratic party is poised to retake everything they can in this next election why well the media tells us the American people are fed up\nAfter two years of Donald Trump they realize the mistake they made they wish they could do it to go do it over maybe take back their vote for Trump and this is gonna be the first chance they've had to actually do that until the Democrats are going to retake the house and a massive landslide and at one point that we're going to take the Senate but then if you look\nAt the reality\nOf voting patterns just in the past eight years let's say ten there's nothing in the world using common sense that orders for a Democrat sweep or blue wave\nThe trend in the past ten years is Democrats losing elections left and right and it all\nStarted with Iraq Hussein all in two thousand ten\nOr do you remember how many times I reminded you that during the first six years of Obama do you go through the two thousand four team in terms of the Democratic party lost over twelve hundred seats\nNationwide seats in the U.S house seats in the U.S Senate state houses a governorships ... are you even\nGo to a local often like mayor town councilman if you if you factor all of those races nationwide the Democrats after six years of Obama had lost well over\nA hundred seats they were losing everything after the two thousand sixteen election\nThey continue to lose even more and the and the dead and sat lock to women in a landslide Hillary Clinton got beat in ... near electoral landslide electoral college landslide\nAnother election where they were going to sweep big never going to wipe\nOut the Republican Party once and for all Hillary Clinton was going to be this winter they had it they couldn't they had it any better this guy Trump won the Republican nomination somebody did know when he was doing a gigantic buffoon a walking set of gaps they thought this guy would be easily swept away they believed all our polling data\nAnd we know what happened they continue to lose to the point that after the two thousand sixteen elections\nThat one and it got it precisely by holding steady in the spine on Kevin I'm telling you Trump is with the assistance of the Democrats treatment Kevin ... the Republican Party not all of it but it's it's it's\nMoving toward unification at least in terms of opposition to other Democrats the Democrats are not\nUnified and one of these four of them\nSay they want to be president now\nBy our media is committed to the growth of magic city and we're proud to announce a new feature called magic city on

find the time\nSo tempting to make your case it's considered to be a meltdown\nAnd again the big news about all of this is that the media is making fools of themselves right along the way by lying

Native American DNA Dr\nCarlos ... to a use samples from may go ... in Columbia to stand\nIn for Native Americans now she's out there touting that it's true is she is an empty you got one one thousand twenty fourth [noise]\nAnd there wasn't even any Indian or Native American DNA tested in which she could be said to have in common or compared to evidence laughable it is the static and I think\nThis is what Trump is doing to all these people Hillary Clinton is making a fool of herself each and every out there saying\nThat what Bill Clinton did with Monica ... no no no no no no that was not abuse that doesn't qualifies me too because she was an adult [noise] [noise] [noise] [noise] so\nHillary Clinton is making it asks herself an absolute fool of herself in the midst of the me too movement she's under cutting it\nAnd selling it out\nIn order to save both herself and her husband or soon to be barking on what\nA stadium chore\nOr yes bill and Hillary aren't going to mark a nationwide stadium tour where they are going to go and hopefully draw crowds at twenty and twenty five thousand to do the bill and Hillary show onstage\nBecause of course they can't let Trump upstaged them like this I mean if we can do what they can do it if Trump can do what anybody can do it they're going to try to get in on it\nThere's one thing missing one key ingredient missing nobody cares what they have to say [noise] not like\nPeople care what Trump has to say there is no interest in what Bill or Hillary Clinton are going to say\nThere is all kinds of interest in what Trump is going to say\nThere's just the it factor\nThat Trump has the Hillary certainly doesn't they haven't never has had you could argue that Bill Clinton to an extent habit and I'm Talking about this ... type of

neither of these two are anywhere near\n\nThe wake of Donald Trump you know what does it like it was it like the Democrats trying to come up with an answer to me in the first ten years in the spring

show who'd never done it before as the rush killer\nEvery one of them was anointed end inaugurated as the Democrat that was going to steal the limelight away from this program than Air America came along and uh and they did the same thing and it never has happened\n[noise] every attempt to supplant take over\nRelegate this program ... security has failed abysmally and just like the bill and Hillary stadium tour is going to fail abysmally\n... they're going to end up having to pay people to show up [noise]\nTo get the kind of crowds that they want that you may think rushed enough\nRabbit
