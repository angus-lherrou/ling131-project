{"month": "10", "state": "AL", "station": "WERC", "content": "[noise]\nIt is a scary honey and we don't know where our cars that [noise]\n\nRay you're on the Michael berry show hey Michael berry long time caller longtime listener first time caller had a question for you [noise] everybody talks about immigration they talk about\nUm\nYou know you're going to fix that a lot with immigration with a welfare welfare reform if you take care of that that will knock out a lot of people coming in your view them\nAnd not get all the benefits and all so I'm just went blank um\nWhy it shouldn't be in that either\nYou know what I mean it took me a honey do where it's a chore that something has to be done about the welfare then that makes sense\nThat makes sense but it's naive because you have to understand if your platform is vote for me because I Will give you things\nThen the giving of things from the government to people is not a ... is not a down side it's it's not a negative factor it's baked into the DNA it's it's a it's a a an integral component\nSee\nWelfare is not a problem for everybody to be able bodied people living on welfare [noise]\nIs a problem for you it's a problem for me it's a problem for taxpayers whether they be workers are retirees [noise] [noise] [noise] but it's not a problem to the recipient\nWho said the old line robbing Peter to pay Paul will ensure that Paul stays loyal to you [noise] you see\nThis goes back to my original point about funeral we think that we all share the same values we like to believe we all share the same values when nine eleven occurred [noise]\nEven the Democrats were willing to stand out at the Capitol and sing the national in [noise]\nAnd everyone said city we're all the same we're all the same we all feel low then we're in this to get there and there's togetherness in unity where you know five and they're always wanting to unify us if we can just you know by\nOkay I'll be for unifying [noise] um let's eliminate welfare and start over\nAnd let's kick a bunch of people off welfare that we all agree\nAble bodied America as well [laughter] we can't unify there\nIf you did that Democrats would lose elections worse than they already do number one how about we unify over the fact that we simply enforce the laws on the book with regard to immigration\nIf they're bad last let's change um [noise] can't change 'em 'cause the American public wants those rules and effect so they break the rules that's how they get around it we have a limited enforcement up\nWe'll let let's all agree that we will strictly enforce our immigration okay maybe we're not all all the same page here [noise] [noise] [noise] I Will say this I think that reducing the size of the welfare state\nWould deter some level of illegal immigration I also think it would be a good fiscal decision\nFor our country and in our budget in process I Do not think it would end illegal immigration\nFor anyone who's ever been to most third world countries in the world you know that the opportunity to come to the United states\nIf you were to create the ledger even if you're living in a country with the different native tongue so you have to live outside your native tongue you have to live outside your native cuisine outside your native culture\nAnd be estranged from your family [noise] even with all that in place many people will make the decision not all many people choose to remain poor and the country where they're from\nFor the reasons I just mentioned [noise]\n[noise] but think about all of the things that we have built in to residing in this country not being a citizen residing we have declared that everyone who's here will be provided public education\nK. through twelve or your child will be provided public education no matter the reason you're here that is very well established through judicial precedent everyone who is here will be provided healthcare it doesn't mean it'll be gold plated health care but it will be healthcare\nJust show up at the emergency room you cannot be turned away or those two things alone [noise] put you above resigning in the country where you are a citizen in fifty percent of the countries in the world maybe ...\n... ... you see we we have a tendency to think that the pressure to get into the United states is limited to caravans coming from central and South America incorrect\nAlmost all of Africa would stream into this country and much of Asia and parts of Eastern Europe if they were able to simply walk across the contiguous piece of dirt but they can't see getting here is the\nHard part there's far worst poverty in Africa far worst poverty and I'll tell you that if if the people seeking to get in here were Russians Chechnya ...\nAlbanians white Bosnians\nPolls it might change the laughs opinion of how we treat those people seeking to walk across the board you could vote until seven PM\nIt's the point is\nIt needs to be addressed every effort that Trump has made to fix this problem has been met with opposition everywhere and yet we have another caravan this time with people loaded with guns in bombs now that are heading across\nSouthern may go with their intention to get to the United states and the drive by me to just just just being ... up that Trump's base that the ... people in Trump's base are just teetering on the verge of sanity\nAnd Trump knows that and he's trying to send your over the edge with this stuff to make sure you're go vote it's again\nA classic expression\nOr illustration of how they haven't the slightest idea who the people are voting for Donald Trump who remain supportive of\nDonald Trump but that will get to more details that I ... back to my little test so I read all of these people at the event last night it's going to be\nA red wave Russia and listen to you every day and I'm telling you it's going to be a red white but I said I Hope you're right but let\nMe let me tell you what we're up against forty five Republicans have announced their resignations forty five I mean that is a huge number many of them are\nCommittee chairmen not all that many of them are committee chairmen and they are resigning are retiring because they don't want to go back to being chunks you know just regular house members it's a it's a big come down so they want to try to parlay their years in the house\nInto private sector success license forty five seats incumbency has has incredible power\nReelection power certainly old back me up on those these are students the incumbent in house races windows Ninety eight percent of the time well we've got forty five Republicans who are not incumbents we've got forty five Republicans would never run before\nNobody knows I mean there are districts they're known but they're not as known as incumbents are no not as well known so that that\nMakes some of this somewhat iffy I and and then there is the traditional statistical aspect which says that the party\nThat holds the White House and the first mint terms after a presidential election all\nWays Lewis's seats so forty five seats they have been tough to defend\nAs opposed to if those forty five had not resigned and we're still in the house you can kind of a lot of those is reelect that you can't count now Israel legs and this is what the left and the drive buys are counting on\nIs that many of those forty five will slip and then you've got a contest of all races are in other parts Senate of course another thing now I mention of this to all of these people they didn't care and they said they're aware of this they knew about the resign\nResigning members of Congress retiring they ... they didn't know the number not all of them did\nBut their attitude was that it doesn't matter it doesn't matter uh the American people are set up\nAnd they are sophisticated and the people who are elected Trump and know exactly what's at stake they're not gonna sit home they're not gonna twiddling their thumbs they're not confident they're not sitting there thinking the job was done when they went and voted in two thousand sixty and it was kind of pleasant to um\nTo what the here although there was a lot of emotion and I'm like I Can't deny that night interestingly I ran across a piece today at a website called America dot com and it's by Dr Gerard Francisco slum arrow expert on forecast models [noise]\nUm I'm not familiar with his work by his headline is ran wave coming in the house and the Senate\nMy forecast for the twenty Eighteen congressional elections he says there will be a conservative red wave in the house with two hundred and twenty five a two hundred and twenty eight Republicans elected\nTo office and in the Senate with fifty eight to sixty Republicans elected to office let's look at some of the reasons that went into my forecast Dr Merrill rights\n\nAs you remember from my book great news for him [laughter]\nWith member of my great\nBook great in the presidential election or two thousand sixteen was both an historic and critical election that ushered in a new American constitutional era that I called the conservative era long range trans as well as short range trends came together to cause a fundamental shift\nIn ah in each of our two major political parties in addition the other major changes took places well those were predicted unexplained uh in addition to lower Democrat voter intensity\nAmong democratic voters Democrats have another major problem there are movements of democratic voters that are abandoning their party and voting for conservatives\nAnd it's all being ignored he says by the drive by immediate these free movements of democratic voters abandoning their party are the walk away movement the reading\nPill movement and the great awakening movement\nAnd he goes on to describe what these what these are I've I'm no I'm unfamiliar with the red peel\nA movement but\nHe says he's got eight productions here that'll happen in the near future and they appear to be happening as we approach the mid term elections\nWe've witnessed a series of fall surprises including the capital hearings October surprises caravan crisis mail bombs to some Democrats synagogue mass shooting we've seen outstanding economy tempered by considerable volatility a Wall Street we have seen extreme by it but that's another thing you know what the consumer confidence numbers are over the top\n\nConference board consumer confidence numbers over the top these numbers are not the kind of numbers you see in the ... electorate thats unhappy and angry and looking for radical change\nAt least that has been the case or\nIn in the past question comes down to just how important a factor is the economy in elections of um [noise] candidates in this in this climate or the drive\nBy as with like you to believe the economy doesn't matter hill of beans but they always say that when the economy is going great with Republican\nAdministrations uh the effort\nTo give credit to Obama the attempt by Obama to take credit for the economy Heller would argue that Democrats in the media think it is a problem\n\nThere's talk all over Twitter that Hollywood leftist are promising blood in the streets if Democrats do not win the house\n[noise]\nAnyway back to our production here from this doctor Dr Gerard Francisco alum arrow what has been the impact\nOf these falls surprises and the other events this is his personal thinking and again these\nThese events these falls surprises he calls them we call 'em October surprises\nThat Kavanaugh hearings that was that we know what that was the I mean that was totally trumped up\nMade up charges to derail Trump's Supreme Court nominee along the way it toward the railing Trump or we have the October surprises the usual the caravan of crisis mail bombs or some Democrats synagogue mass shooting what's what's been the impact of these\nCalls for prizes and other events\nWhile intended to hurt President Trump and keep Republicans were holding the house\nAll of the above surprises and events have worked to enhance the conservative red\nWave according to this guy instead of creating a building and blue wave and a red wave continues Republican voter intensity\nAnd that positive okay when we come back the drive by media all over not blaming me we're back first it was the Oklahoma City bombing and now me and others in conservative media being blamed for all of the rest of this today\nAnd Birmingham Christmas last year talking is going on right now get

this [noise] I think as a follow want it to Donald Trump following through on one of the primary commitment see made as a candidate\nWhich I think is responsible for his election and that is his promise to build a wall to get a handle on illegal immigration\nAnd to stop it because of its for ever changing consequences to this country but\nPrimarily with Trump is a law and order issue as it is with all the rest of us it's simply a law and order issue we have laws defining legal and illegal immigration we have a political party that is pushing illegal immigration\nAnd actually both parties have to the extent of promoting programs that have amnesty involved for all of them are both parties have different reasons for supporting in the meantime the very definition of what America is and what our culture is is under assault\nAnd the politicians in Washington don't seem to care because they think they're always going to be insulated from whatever negative changes results\n[noise] and in some cases it's even worse than that the left wants those changes the left wants this country overthrown from the days of its founding out to the left America\nIs it legitimate to a gym morals it's

forward [noise] again it was added after\nThe civil war its purpose was to overrule the Dred Scott decision which was a horrible Dred Scott sanction slavery Roger than it was the chief justice for ever immortalized in infamy [noise]\nIt held at black slaves were not citizens so Congress got into gear and pass the fourteenth amendment guaranteed that freed slaves would have all the privileges of citizenship by providing quote all persons born or naturalized\nIn the United states and subject to the jurisdiction thereof\nAre citizens of the United states added up a state where they reside which means the draft or is that the fourteenth amendment had no intention of conferring citizenship I'm the children of aliens who happened to be born here in fact\nThe very author of the citizenship clause senator Jake I'm Howard of Michigan\n[noise] expressly said this is why the original intent of founding documents is so important quote this meeting\nThe fourteenth amendment this will not of course include person was born in the United states who are foreigners who are aliens who belong to the families of ambassadors or foreign ministers\nIt was expressly intended to confer citizenship to slaves and their descendants [noise]\nThere was an Eighteen eighty four case ... versus Wilkins Supreme Court ruled the fourteenth amendment did not\nEven couldn't for citizenship on Native Americans because they were subject to tribal jurisdiction not us jurisdiction build an illegal alien here is not subject to us jurisdiction there under the jurisdiction of where they came from it they're here

welcome sir great to have you here\nThat get Russia I wanted to thank you for telling people about the truth intent of sexual on an amendment fourteen because I've been trying to do the same thing for years and people are on in the midst impression that it simply means if a child born to illegal aliens in this country automatically becomes an American citizen\nYou can't blame 'em it's been the case since the sixties and it's it's it's um\nYeah ... ... it it it it's ... we're we're dealing with mass ill education that's taking place on a lot of things in this country and that's why it's so important that we've got a president willing to push back on it yet because what's causing this is causing any discussion of it this is how it happens\nI've told everybody that this is what pushing back is going to look like so\nWhile you were talking about Dred Scott as a reason why the fourteenth amendment was ratified which was actually on July night they team sixty eight but another reason why it was ratified is because it goes back to the thirteenth amendment that abolish slavery well\nThe southern states weren't going to accept that so they passed laws are codes that were so restrictive the plaques\nThat essentially made them slaves once again and they were called the black codes so then Congress said okay you want to play that game that we're going to formally recognized former slaves as citizens which will make them subject to all the privileges or immunities to the citizens in several strays ... article for section two claws one\nSo after that the ... were abolished and that's why we have a ... you know the fourteenth amendment\nAnd matter of fact you know the one of the ... the the guy is considered the founding father to the fourteenth amendment was represented by the name of John ... from Ohio\nAnd he made some remarks about the fourteenth amendment a few few years later and you can find that\nIn a house report number twenty two dated Eighteen Seventy one January thirtieth so it all explains how this joint committee passed the fourteenth amendment so President Trump with all due respect to him he wouldn't be not be ending birthright citizenship because it never happened he would be appalled in the U.S constitution\nWell that's the point that is exactly the point that I made is why he should\nDo this and that's his point people have looked into this\nMay have found different rationale than you did but the point is if you look at the original intent of people who were involved in writing the fourteenth amendment all Trump is doing is enforcing the constitution and taking it back to its original intent the fourteenth amendment was never intended\nTo confer citizenship on people here illegally or the sons and daughters of ambassadors are foreign agents\nIt was expressly\nWritten to converse citizenship on slams\nAnd now it has been expanded and again that you can trace it back to the Nineteen sixties when this began which coincides with the Democratic party wanting to re open immigration\nYou know I I still run into people who do not believe me when I tell them that as a nation we suspended for the most part I mean ... there's always been\nA people being rapid citizenship but we suspended mass immigration\nFrom the mid Nineteen twenties to the mid sixties pretty express reason of allowing all of those who would emigrated starting in the late Eighteen hundreds all the way through the Nineteen twenties to assimilate [noise]\nThat's what immigration was people were coming here to become Americans and they wanted to be Americans [noise] they didn't have to give up their birthright they didn't have to they they settled in uh in in neighborhoods\nIrish have their neighborhoods in New York and Philadelphia the Italians ... ditto but they wanted to become Americans they learned English and they became part of American culture at ... of which there is a distinct and unique\nAmerican culture which is rooted in western civilization that's what's different now there is no interest in that [noise]\nWe don't even make a serious effort at assimilating we're Balkan icing\nIf they use this term tribal but we're more organizing our population because modern arrivals don't all seek to become Americans people trying to get them on the on the legal immigration side of course are\nBut this this mass illegal immigration has an entirely different purpose behind it and political support is entirely different for it\nThen for standard uh immigration so what Trump is doing is simply with his executive order if he does this\nWill be reestablishing the constitution to re asserting it so yeah no you're exactly right about that so two calls to great points that the guy who from Pittsburgh who asked a question he lives there and he watches the news and he's been blamed\n[noise] or the synagogue surely [noise]\nWe've got to tone it down and we got to come together we gotta do this we got to do that\n[noise] and if it's being set up as being said in the media you know it's all aimed at Trump and his supporters appreciate the call again Southampton in New York build your next great to have you with us or Hi\nThank you Russian thanks for all that you do for us yes you ... ... with the ... um with regard to the fourteenth amendment why not take it to the Supreme Court or is that where this is going to end up actually so that they can decide oh it'll be their language says it'll get there and I'll get there okay yeah\nIt'll it'll have to get there that now Senator Graham is going to offer the legislation that in the Senate ah look we're way way far away from this we're just getting the conversation started here which\nHas to happen [noise] there there there\nI don't think the solution to this is enterprise zones in El Salvador or Guatemala\n[noise] um maybe long term economic relief for any nation having problem is a greater dose of capitalism but\nThere isn't the political climate for that and many of these countries there their dictatorships of one degree or another\nAnd [noise] this is an immediate problem that's going to have to be dealt because if it's not they're just going to keep coming [noise] and ... [noise] we're not going to stop these caravans if we start implementing a tax free enterprise\nZones nominees nations where American companies can relocate and hire them there instead of hiring them here\nBecause that's these people are like people being hired anywhere yet\nBut I understand it if you want to talk political theory and economic theory it makes sense in the world and otherwise\nYou know quote unquote normal circumstances but this is a sure political movement here this caravan [noise] I Know has a\nGeorge Soros I think George Soros his name has become um like a bogeyman for everything people mean far left wing radicals when they mentioned George Soros I don't know who's behind but somebody is and their purpose is to destabilize the United states\nThe purpose is not to improve life for these people this caravan whoever's behind\nAnd this is not really trying to do something for these people to make their lives better this is being done to invoke damage on the United states particularly Trump and to advance the political advantages and notions of a particular political party [noise]\nWhich wants to welcome these people in as dependent voters a\nJam in Madison, Virginia great to have your weather's you're next on the E R B network card\nA yes fresh of two years ago my husband and I adopted or Hispanic sisters\nWho were in foster care and we had had him for a couple of years and then they cannot with action their parents about the Gulf of Mexico they have slipped over the border at least for high illegally one class at the end of each time they had children here too and then they come back to my left on my grandparents came back\nHad two more went back and got him a long story short is that even today I had you know they were came to us thanking Trump was horrible and that was that he would send them all that Coleman and you know now they love Trump and they think this has got to stop and have an escape because their fathers and president twenty eight years\nWith his mother fled the Mexico\nNot because of a sudden these people come here and cut it off all crimes against their own children\nAnd you know I just ate\nEverything Trump can do to stop that he's got to stop it because they come over here they have these babies and I have another situation I can tell you about what I Know our country has caught where they had a Fifteen year old girl at the border seven months pregnant and they let her across they sent the other six to eight teams with our back\nOn my stomach so they can't say we don't have heart they do see a situation they need help\nBut you know even Hispanic girls that\nThought Trump was horrible that he was offend all these people that they realize now that he is doing what the country\nWell we'll check them whenever they realize it is a is is is fine with me of course it's it's [noise] um [noise]\nOnce you understand what's going on it's impossible to support [noise] it's it's just it's impossible support on the less you have particular political notions\nOf what the United States purpose in the world is and what we all [noise] and so forth but in in terms of being the best policy for the United states it isn't [noise] anyway appreciate the jam thanks much will take a break and be back\nWith you you know rush Dave Ramsey\nLive this afternoon and one on news radio nine sixty you we are see\n...
