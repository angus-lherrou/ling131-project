solid\nFor centuries\nNearly centuries almost two centuries but more than two centuries actually yeah boiling two centuries little over\n\nNow we've had disagreements in the past and that's something to this country does it we have a debate and we have conversations we talk we have dialogue hopefully dialogue with his balanced and uh\nAnd and that's something I think we're lacking right now I mean we're writing off people because we disagree with them and that's nonsense\nIt Eighteen sixty one\nThere's only one time in our history and Eighteen sixty one where\n\nWe distrust of the system so much that we decided to have a civil war or we had a civil I don't know if we decided that the civil war broke out because we didn't agree it's such a disagreement about how our system is run and we have a ... we had a civil war there was so much instability\nAt that time the civil war broke out it wasn't declared it broke out there were divisions on on a on the front lines there were a\nYou know border divisions and things of that nature it was clear cut as to what a civil war was back in the Eighteen sixties were not living in the Eighteen sixties anymore America's instability is\nIncreasingly an undercurrent in political discourse right now\nBut I Know it's difficult to see that the civil war is happening because we always thought it would be an armed conflict that one day President Trump or whoever would step up to the pope and say what about your guns guys we're going to war here in this country\nBut he established with a battlefield America had already been proposed during the Obama administration is proposed by none other than John McCain\nWho now is a political hero of the left for some reason\n\nWe always thought it would be an armed conflict where we would be shooting other Americans every day with the police would be forced to shoot Americans every day we're martial law would be declared\nAnd all that can happen but at the moment\nThe symptoms of civil war have not been diagnosed by the majority of the people and most of the diagnosis you get about wars are from history not declared by the president but ... be declared the aftermath\nNow in the past there were a number of ways that the military had identified illustrated the point by point sign post\nAs to what a new civil war would look like in America and this is based on contemporary standards not the standards of the Eighteen sixties or the Nineteen fifties or or the forties or whatever I mean there were major coups in the planning for Truman and for FDR major coup of course planned\nAnd and and I actually executed by a those are the deep state against President Kennedy\n\nBut a new civil war in America look something like this according to military planners number one the country would be infringed international polarization would do obvious meeting place for resolution\nWell the opposition the instability of of the political discourse is one of the first signs of civil war the idea that violence is the only way to somehow or change the discourse is part of civil war all of these factions are part of civil war and the only\nReason why people don't regret in civil war is because it didn't happen the way they were told it was going to happen we're not having an armed conflict right now\nBetween America and there would be Americans just shooting American Well I mean American shoot Americans every day or Chicago or it seems to be a highly climbed written with guns going up and things happening like that but when we have bombs into leadership or we have people who have to a planet around mob these are ... and parts\nTalking part designed post symptoms perhaps of what would be a civil war and as I say the diagnosis is not come from you it comes from history and
