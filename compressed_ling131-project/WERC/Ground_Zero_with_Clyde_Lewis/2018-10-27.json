I'm just an average person\nBut I had some celebrities talking and they wanted the board and one lady who who son committed suicide at the border she 'cause originally the board was just\nThe same image but I put it on would ... with glue you know I made a color copy ... [noise] and so I Would in a lot of people in Los Angeles used it in one very famous actress\nAnd a sudden they killed himself and she reached out to us meaning me and my friend and I sent the board and she said that she had spoken to him\nRepeatedly and thanked me and she's a very famous she's dead now I can mention of you if\nYou don't you go ahead and it was it was she was from the tech Van Dyke show Mary Tyler Moore and she was very sweet very kind Rosemarie\nNo she was Mary Tyler Moore Oh Mary Tyler Moore was on the Dick Van Dyke shattered shows that are on shows weren't Tyler Moore\nNow but she was very she was searching for ways to communicate\nAnd just understand so it is it's so in other words what I'm saying\nIs it's not just evil you can you can deport all is it you know to channel what you want I think Bob was naive and he put he put this together to talk to his victims and then you didn't realize they're gonna come they come back\nAnd haunted him and he kept on driving around at one point in my grandpa was it was it was in one day and then a month later he was in another town another town and then it caught up to them and that's I think that's why he just and he killed himself he drowned himself\nAnd his body was ever found\nNo but he turned my he sent my grandfather a note I saw the note and it was typed because he never would write and free hand bomb never rode anything down and he were type it or you stencil\nAnd what did he say what was his last words in the letter\nHe said that he can't take it anymore because of the the the stress that he's being haunted he said he made a mistake by making the board and people were haunted him that he has hurt\nAnd then he he went into a New Jersey beach town and walked into the water he said he was going to do it anyway and the letter and no one ever saw him again so my\nGrandfather who was a much healthier a man like a stable man and he loved he loved Bob for all his faults\nAnd he said that

we know that the industry of do the talking board into the into the community of the spiritual Smith meant and also is in the United states only that it was an Eighteen Ninety the we used to board that we know today got its start in Eighteen Ninety One it was patent and trademark and was in production at that point\nSo there's always some interesting stories about that but an Eighteen Ninety to Canada bought some rights from us the United states to sell their own version of the ... board and so they started making boards in Eighteen Ninety two and the rest is history and so a board such as Bob sport which again falls into the category of talking boards\nA lot of sports after the ... makes it a prominent splash into the market I mean ... everybody was buying them and using them at the heyday I mean this this has been a spiritual moving with going big time and\nI was going on with their communication at the time that people started making copycat boards and started doing different types of their own type a\nBoard and of course we jazz a trademark passes the name they couldn't use that name\nRight so you have to use different names but I mean this is the story behind this board is rather unique I've never heard anything\nA particularly unique is the story of of Bob being a suspect in serial killer or making a board of basically it's almost as if it's penance for him to make this board so that he\nWould feel right about himself or what have you are in his own special way I'm just curious if there are any other unique stories behind certain types of boards that have been released in the past\nThere there are many reasons that people make their own boards and as you mentioned earlier people do make their own and start customizing assign them\nUm but the degree of this type of story no I've never heard of this story but there are reasons why people make boards and it could just be a personal their own little personal portal or they want to communicate with the deceased one or they see an opportunity to make money there's a lot of different reasons but this is a very unique case\nUm and it's I haven't heard ever heard of a serial killer making aboard before or I shouldn't say he was in a secular he was posted a legit or we don't know if he really was or not\nYeah we we don't know if you to be checked into somebody's mental institution right in fact a you know that's that's the that's the thing is he avoided a any kind of prosecution because he checked in a mental institution\nI mean in in since you've been using the board you've gotten longitude and latitude of you submitted any ... any of this information to the authorities and if so do they take it seriously\nWell which is kind of awkward because I haven't really you know this is really just a small thing that I was just selling on on on we just put the color\nA Xerox is on on board and then I met this guy used to work for ... which is an old TV show or on the which was only channel five or something right in the east and um\nShe was really for years he was kind of trying to do something with the board and he worked I hate to like show he could like producing I think mhm current affairs and then he was the one who\nIntroduced it to the guys that make these um it's a company called allied board and they make different games things and they took it to another level like the same image to same exact\nYou know but then they took it and they just put on more quality thing with boxes and everything\nYou know in the background to the background history\nYeah and they told him everything you know and they put it down to they made it more like a sophisticated I guess\nBut I'm the same story and it's a very good I tell people you know\nNot to I I made them put on that you can't be under Eighteen years old\nBecause this is real this is really happen this really works and it's very scary and if if you have the wrong intentions\nAnd you know everybody would call go to the same place at the end but says some bad people that are around and they go to you know so you don't want to some of them back so I always say that it's not a joke ...\nNo I'm In I Want to ask her and you know I have some idea of criteria that I have you know if I ever use the word I use a board in a long time was beyond as a matter of you to board\nA gosh I Can't count back maybe I I I've been president during other sessions with boards I mean I Know somebody who has their own board they brought it in one night and they use that it wasn't really a board it was just\nSomething that just rolled out like it was a laminated or lemonade peace that had a a crystal glass so they use I mean I you know boards can rudimentary like that'd be even\nWhen you see the TV show stranger things that you kind of a mix you bored with Christmas tree lights so that her little boy you could go to the uh the little boy can communicate with his mother his mother\nUm you know you you it doesn't ... we really do need boards do we care and I mean even the boards of bear or you can channel on your own and you can use a you know automatic writing and other things in my right\nYeah that's a good point the board is really not doing the work we're doing the work ourselves support just becomes a permission slip if you will or it becomes a stepping off jumping off point a springboard and to be able to to access your own abilities to this work\nA lot of people don't think that's the case and I didn't think that was the case for many many years but when I realized what was happening here when I started working the board was at my own\nSix cents ability started developing really started really being fine tune\nAnd taking the Broadway I can still do this work and pay a lot of people use and the old days these typewriters [laughter] word processors now they use computer keyboards and the channel that way\nThat's what I find it to board with people if the tactile experience and the movement\nMovement itself that kind of opens up the receptor so you could start bringing in the information and so again I Want to be real clear the board there's no negative energy is with any board that's why I have no problem\nHaving any board at my home something I got an ... even this board that I'm that great uncle made 'em for his purposes I have no problem with that because I Know nothing negative will happen unless I Want that to happen unless I Try to bring that to me or that's my desire\nOr that's how I view the world so that people deserving people scared us even talking about this on the radio so I have\nAre though they they they bring in the they don't understand and this is what I Want to try and bring out with this whole conversation or they don't understand that a lot of this has to do with
