sealed the deal for me\nIt's I'm a professor named professor gates and um he's a physicist who actually was looking at string theory and discovered a computer code within string theory and this just sealed it for me\nNow it wasn't just any computer code but it was a computer code written by a computer scientist by the name of Claude Shannon in the Nineteen forties\nNow I'm sure a lot of people have delved into computer code in one form or another everybody has a website these days so you know how complex computer code is right it's not just finding different symbols and things like that and

it just goes to show in my humble humble opinion\nThe um program nature of reality in of itself\nDuring the last segment you brought up the movie pie and within that movie they talk about the code that exist within the Torah\nAnd so every letter within the Torah is assigned a number and then those numbers um you take mother an added up to the number that father is and then you get I think it's like one forty four and then child it equals to one forty four and so it's really a string of code that we're looking at here and everything is built upon these numbers\nUm as I mentioned before
