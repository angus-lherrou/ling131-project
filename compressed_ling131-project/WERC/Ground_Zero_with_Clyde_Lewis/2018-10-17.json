Nineteen forties remember do you ever going to move the reefer madness yeah I remember ...\n... a a Mexican immigrants who are coming to this country for a year to\nTake the lead us back in the Nineteen twenties actually turn of the ... century it was asked to stash civil war maybe\nAfter the stash American War of ... are they a lot of Mexican started to come over here at the in the early part of the twenty century and they brought marijuana with them so marijuana became identified with Mexican immigrants and ah this was around the time of alcohol prohibition and\nUh the government got his great idea to uh to uh to prohibit marijuana wall with alcohol and we really complain about marijuana 'cause nobody really knew what marijuana marijuana was back then but uh they made up they\nCreated in his campaign around reefer madness this idea that if you smoke pot you would go crazy and there's a funny movie now wasn't funny at the time called re from Madison talks about all the stuff\nA ... but they couldn't make it illegal because it was a plant so they had to do is create something called the marijuana tax that which I don't know if you heard of that a marijuana tax act or ... you put people in jail for not declaring their marijuana\nAnd they put a tax on marijuana and they said didn't declare tried marijuana and taxes on it you go to jail and then the Nineteen seventies they actually completely ... or\n... with Nixon's war on drugs they actually completely may marijuana illegal and it's been a legal ever said but the fact of the matter is is that people have the smoking pot straight through prohibition or not and our ... our jail are\nIll with people who are they are simply because they were selling or smoking or possessing\nAnd like you said earlier we created the police that a police state around the around people are just around people who simply want to get high whether it's through\nA marijuana or ... or even with opiates why don't why don't we don't have a prohibition against alcohol but we do and that's marijuana clause I'll tell you\nThis is the thing that uh you know and and for me I guess it sets be apart from a lot of talk show hosts are mostly on conservative radio stations because I live in Portland, Oregon where\nOf course it's legal or both recreationally andme ... to to to uh use marijuana use cannabis and um what's really funny is that when I was a teenager\nA and of course one of the rights of passages or in some in some areas is to actually smoke pot\nAnd uh when I did and it was a teenager I smoked it and of course Scott Hi a couple of times and I never touched it again it was funny is that uh you know after you know you make a pact with you so I'm not going to touch this is not good for me to do this I don't think it's good for my body to do this then I got cancer right and uh when I got cancer\nIt became a so difficult to actually a deal with the law did every day the feeling of a a foggy had all this stuff felt bad and one of my friends came by and he says hey I Want to have you try something\nAnd I looked as though no no no I Can't do this and he says what's wrong he says I said I did it in high school it's silly you know no big deal I'm not going to and he said no give it a try and he says I'm a uses and and and it was a guy that it would just completely out of character\nFor him to suggest to me\nThat I should try Canada's and so I did and uh it it it basically took the pain completely away\nAnd it was not like some psychosomatic deal where you know so the idea ... helped me that that came to me because I was totally against the idea and I I certainly changed my mind in one of the things they found that in studies with older people who have had these hang ups about\nUm things like a cannabis that they ah let them use CBD Oil Somalian does it as an ointment on their joints and ever ... ever since they've been given it or if they're given it to end brownie form or an edible form\nThey find that it's far more preferable to the side effects they get from a ... a a a a an ... an opiate\nAnd so that's the problem is that it has such a bad rap and drug for this country have such a bad rap and see in other countries in Europe in England places all over the world\nThey they treat or this type of a crisis not with jail time and and punished but they they actually go in and they give them a medical arrest where they put them in the hospital and they have to be treated and and and they cannot be released from the hospital facility until they show that they're clean\nAnd ah and I'm thinking that I think it would be a far better\nOr a far better thing for this country to look at people with this is not\nFeeling morally but they actually people who are in need of help and they're in need of a ... there are needed medical care\nAnd I know that that may put a burden but there are ways that we can develop facilities we developed cancer facilities were developed a facilities for specialized treatments and I think the facilities a specialized treatments on various drugs some of the more lethal ones like crack or\nUh or or or even heroin addiction and other addictions you know everybody complains about you know the needles everywhere well if we were to find people put them in facilities and have him is not going as criminals and be trained is going to be put into the position of criminals\nThere actually put into hospitals where they were under a medical arrest that would be something I think would be an idea that we would need in this country to help ... rehab all the people that have gone through this because the problem is bad and you can agree with me I Know that doctors\nDo not know how to actually get rid of pain that's one of the things pain is one of those things I said in the beginning\nBut it evolves over time and you even brought up ... you brought up deep pain inside the body that is not pain but it's felt physically but it's pain that is felt on a on a I guess you could call on a conscious level or or your consciousness is he in pain are wracked with pain\nExplain I don't hate those work on that I hey they do yes absolutely that's why people do it I mean I I don't I Can't speak\nFrom personal experience but I Know that people I've spoken to many people\nWho say that they like things like tram at all and uh I don't know if you've heard of that is a similar to opiate similar they went over it or or biking or Percocet because it makes them they say it makes them feel good\nAnd what they really mean is it makes them takes them out of their painter the pain of existence you know we we live our lives as thorough set and most people live their lives was quite a sense of quiet desperation mhm and like we get beaten down over time\nAnd that creates this sense of I don't want to be ally basically ... you know what I mean one of the scariest\nThings one of the scariest things about opiates then I'll tell you this this was a scary for me I remember when I had my first cancer surgery and uh I was given a a pain at I don't remember\nWhat it was I was in the hospital and all of a sudden I felt balance I felt no pain and I felt great because you know after you're dealing with the initial pain and you're feeling stitches and you're\nAnd this is my got here and it's been caught you know you can't move because you know your your core has been cut and you can't move and it was really weird it was a weird experience to have something that takes the pain completely away and you feel balanced\nAnd that's exactly how I felt when I needed the pain medication or to get rid of my pain\nAnd see that's the thing is it's the idea of the balance at times feeling that balance when the pain will not go away and you have that balance of of calm where you have that moment where the ... the the warmth Russia's over you and the pan is gone\nAnd we'll be bad news radio nine sixty W.
