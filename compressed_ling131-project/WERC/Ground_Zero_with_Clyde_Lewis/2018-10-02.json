going to wake up magically and started chatting about the weather no we need sensors\nTo see here smell and taste and feel on the behalf of these machine\nWe need sensors didn't tell us when it bridge

we're going to have to figure out which cities are the best in the most desirable by behavioral by behavior data data by a way of life data or the quality of life data guy so we're gonna sign these smart seems to be perfect and then the aggregation\nWill be reviewed and we'll be adhered to and it's going to lead us to score cities is the latest the score people or you know ... it'd be like one

go oh well imagine that being you twenty four hours a day I imagine that being your city twenty four hours a day but how are we going to drop one trillion sensors\nBy twenty twenty okay that means we
