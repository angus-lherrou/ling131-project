have\nA a dead woman Chandra Levy a we have an investigation started in may and probably just disappeared off the map after that no one cared about it because of the nine eleven attacks\nAnd you're right you know there's that that that's a pretty big deal to cover up bad to have a bat but uh I Would say that you know\nThey're not connected but I Would say that something like this once again distracts people from other stories and of course I'm sure many people lost track of what happened was John relieving the Chandra Levy case with Gary Condit that is if they were able to look through the dust cloud nine eleven attacks\nRight okay well I got out there and I'll let you get good\nVery good point though very good comparison history you get your brownie points for being a story about I

discussed just recently by the previous caller right Kentucky yeah it does have an area quality to it in\n... you want if you want to get technical when was the brown broken for the Pentagon\nWhat I've what was that September eleventh\nAll right yeah I'm saying just one thing but I was calling about the rice and and to to go on Ben and I forgot where the young man was from but when he was speculating on it being possibly from someone on the Republican or or Republicans sympathetic side\nBecause if you recall back in terms of predicting programming\nWhat happened to them Adderall in

astronaut elation CJ I'm Sorry to tell you it's not speculation in fact I knew it was going to be done and over with on when as far as news that I heard it already from inside or that I have\nBut the speculation will be now that Mitch McConnell pressure them to wrap it up to a quicker than would necessarily be a\nNecessarily the FBI are quite frankly all they had to do is just to value wait a certain times in certain other things he could be guilty as hell and they wouldn't tell you\nOh yeah but now Mitch McConnell has to take the fall based upon the fact that they'll say his fingerprints are over this\nAs a matter they're getting what they are getting and the American people are going to a prize over it and that's what I really don't\nCause you when you when you start playing with the
