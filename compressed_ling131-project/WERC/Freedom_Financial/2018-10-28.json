{"month": "10", "state": "AL", "station": "WERC", "content": "White but wait let me fact check something here's a fact check\nWhen Damon Wayans posted that when the little photo of him with a tiny cut on the back of his bald head\nAnd he actually called it a short rap now injury I'm Sorry that is complete and total ... I've had worse injuries on my cuticle at the salon\nI I you know a ... minute what happened but I'll say this I was shooting a movie two years ago in Budapest and I went through a ... it was a phone call spectral that we shot for Netflix and I went to a glass door in a short glass four inches long went into my armpit in its severed all the nerves in my left on oh gosh I don't have\nI only have one buys up and only two of my triceps they'd never regenerated\nI never said anything to anyone I took my surgery hosted on [laughter]\nI went through four surgeries a it was extremely um\nDifficult uh you know you'd think that you're not going to have the use of your arm yeah um and especially being an actor right\nUm I I never made it personal uh I I take I take responsibility for my own actions and when I it's like if I'm going to play football if I Want my child if my child is going to play sports I acknowledge the threats and the dangers that come with that share I Can't turn and blame someone else\nI'm you know again I was directing that episode so again I take full responsibility for it\nThe problem here is that actors are kooky I'm kooky everyone I've ever worked with a somewhat kooky several broadcasters\nLike people in the entertainment business we're all the words to me that I think like her way up there in the psychopath we hire people\nThat were suits were living who have degrees from prestigious universities and we put them in charge to kind of manage the circus innocent and I'm just you know you got a coach got Nick Saban done in Tuscaloosa this got two five star great quarterbacks and he's able to to\nNavigate though he goes in their best freaking friends right you guys can't get two actors making a ton of money on the same page so you know again it it it is what it is I'm grateful for the experience I Wish those guys nothing but luck\nWell that's nice of you to say but I Wish them nothing but misery because they took away my favorite character on my favorite show it is the most ...\nThing I've ever seen is the worst decision that Fox and Warner Brothers have made sense I can remember so whatever lethal weapon\nIs dead to me and it's probably not going to last past this season however I Will say that I tuned in just for the first episode to see how they were going to handle the unfair and timely disgusting death of Martin rags and it did give me a little satisfaction deceit Damon Wayans have to pretend for an hour they missed you\nKnow I Wish to shine Williams got all the luck in the world and I feel sorry for him I did too says no idea what he's stepping into I don't\nThink he knew any idea what he was stepping into the beginning you know I I from being from the people I talked to on crew who are still buddies and they called me to football games you know they say this guy's pretty pretty sad and that he was kind of soda bag a good and\nI'm sure for you I just can't wait to see what you do after you're done mowing the lawn [laughter] you know you know for us\nWe just happened to be back in the state and we're working on HER Foundation you know which again how beautiful it for me to be in the situation for two years and we were able to get a foundation up and running that first year we had two successful of this we raised over a hundred thousand dollars last year and we're giving it back\nTo the individuals where we can see the money go first hand you know I my my my whole thing was when it comes to charity is a lot of times\nYou're paying for overhead and and you never really know where your resources and we all work hard for our money and and we all want to feel like that we give and we support those that are less less fortunate\nBut for me I I was in my buddy's house and his his mother in law was a his stepmother by the way was was was was loading up backpacks and I simply doing you know she said well there's a lot of children\nThat don't get to eat on the weekends I'm because their families don't have enough resources to provide so their last meal comes from school on that friday that's correct to she goes so I put together this food and some underwear socks and his food for the whole family but I just got covered in ... and my heart and I said well who's doing this with you choose to log on to another friend and she's at her house and her garage packing up her lunch\nAnd we'll get them all and then we'll take them up at the school\nAnd I looked at my wife and I said this is who we help the people that have devoted their life to helping others\nI I'm not that selfless I like entertain into being a goofball so for me if I can help those people who have devoted their life to helping others\nThat I Know exactly where the money's going so if I say to you okay you guys support this well it's going to ... vote at three hot and it caught those guys are getting that then they're going to use that thirty grand to by X Y and Z and then I think that makes us feel better about where money's going so that's kind of been our motivation throughout this whole process well\nI saw you on\nInstagram Emmy are huge on Instagram he really used Instagram to promote a lot of different things and I almost\nOr my shirt but I thought God that'd be really really cheap where am I don't trash stash shirt because I Would have worn it today I purchased it solely to support\nYour foundation I Know that you guys were doing something you were promoting you needed to raise money for veterans um you were doing some big promotion I was I\nYou know this crazy that sure came in that was those guys came and quick to and they came and so here's what's funny they had been working on that ... months before we knew about the negative stuff so how funny that don't trash to stash turned into\nA heck of a completely trailer no ... there is no coincidence is life and look these guys called us and they go hey can\nWe send you some ideas and I go to great they send it to me I look at it and I'm like that's pretty funny roller say then they go look you don't have to do anything we ... we do all the work and then we give you the money and then imagine dragons contacted us and they were yeah they're foundation for can't fool\nWith cancer and uh and again it all just lined up perfectly we've been so grateful and also to be in the south I look forward to\nI Want to shoot here I Want to work in the south I think we have so many resources and said\nOh a lot happening in Birmingham and he's a matter of fact\nLast year I had the opportunity to speak with the producer of the film that\nThe big star of the weight and I was so happy they decided to do opening night here in Birmingham the only bummer\nWas it you were filming lethal weapon and you could never get away by the film had a whole bunch of people go and check it out and we need to see you do some more stuff here in the south of Portland to the south you know and you want to ask me about Birmingham a subset frames we [laughter]\nWe have to do that\nAnd you know there there's the fruits he was showing credible and I think I fit in with what's happening with the film was I think the overflow from Atlanta because it led to his blown up especially with pun would be a bill to who is kind of set up shop down there that people are realizing oh you're just drive a couple of hours and you can get the same thing so I Am hoping to\n... raise it or where to someone shoot film here and uh it just the way all the buildings yeah right that's where there's a lot of history is with the yes on streets exactly I mean back in the seventies when we abandon the buildings we just left\nThem standing and some now everybody's going back in the renovation and the restoration and we have such\nBeautiful architecture it's just a perfect said well hey look\nI I plan on going nowhere well I cannot tell you how happy that makes your fans and let me just reiterate one more time\nSince Klain Crawford is way too polite to do this every thing that was on social media that was pushed with this fake false narrative that he was a hair on set\nScreaming at children and the set was unsafe\nIt's all complete BS\nAnd I think by now most people know this because they've seen the stories that are still coming out\nAnd now it's really clear exactly what happened there but I'm so glad you're here and congratulations because the foundation came out of this everyone can go there right now and get all the information Crawford foundation dot org ... you're talking about bullying\nYou know this month and again it's just a though there are\nNo don't want to do with it but yeah I you know I think for\nUs right now we're raising awareness I think it ... the parrot indoors at home and how there's a lot of time to do that are doing the bullying\nThey're getting bullied correct it isn't that heartbreaking that they're they're just they're they're reacting\nIn it and we need to just go to the shores so that we're trying to ... to get parents involved and to make sure that we're asking the difficult questions are kids starting a dialogue but they're not taking this energy to school taking it out on the other day we had also\nBeen willing to do something to do to win it is proper foundation dot org claim Crawford I just cannot wait to see what you do next and make sure that you come back and talk just about it okay

breaking down the fear that I Hope that like this often brings by telling us vulnerable ing here lived experience and thank you for reminding us the truth of good news\nBut it always set us free and that my friends is why who you are it's so important\nThat at this church regardless of what you were ... service you choose\nTo be and you hear stories like that that offer love and grace to all people\nAnd if you look around there is clearly still more room available for those who need to hear the truth of that good news\nSo as you hear these stories don't just let them be a moment to look into the life of another but let it be a coal to you to go and find the one out of the Ninety nine who is still being abused by an oppressive theology that tells us we are not enough\nAnd invite them into a love and grace that has always been\nThere's that says you are more than enough\n[noise] we're going to pray together this morning um before we do that many of you know who this this and if you will not but uh but loved sacred member of our church passed away last night and that was Dr Harvey Harmon many of you may have heard that news\nI ain't that for you because in the last couple of weeks we have shared in the space um beautifully um what it means to love to care for someone who lives with old timers in the family that support them and that is what harming ... Harvey has been living with for the last\nSeveral years and signed by cheetah uplift their family but I invite you to remember that though we may die\nThe love we share together always live on and it never dies\n\nMany of you have seen me use the ... some of your probably like what is that she's brought into the sanctuary [noise]\nThis is a Tibetan sinking bomb um it is made out of metal it is a bowl that end Tibetan alphabet it spells the prayer of compassion so this morning I'm going to bring the ball as we began our time prayer together we pray with me\nOh\nI'm\n\nGuarded the Hebrew children got at the Muslim children God at the Christian children\nGot the Buddhist or Hindu up the seat and God of those who claim no God at all the sound of this bowl echoes the cries of our heart as we mourn so much loss and pain in our world\nWhenever by one takes life we grieve whenever your children threatened one another with bombs we agree when we tried\nTo diminish or a race to one another with our words\nWe agree\nWhen we militarized our border separate children from their families and refused to see the humanity and another we agreed\nWhen we lose someone we love we agree\nRapids and your gentle arms like a father who raps his crying child in a warm blankets\nSeeking to calm their fears\nSurround us with the strength of your love as a mother seeking to protect and defend her children when they are threatened unafraid\nRemind us and all things that we are always with you we are never alone we\nWill never be separated from you our family we cannot be erased we do not have to choose to live in fear\nAnd above all remind us love conquers death and loss can never die\nWe are your resurrection people who see even more now to follow Jesus our savior and our light who told us to pray sang our father who art in heaven hallowed be thy name die kingdom come\nI Will be done on earth as it is and haven't given us this day our daily bread and forget about Star Trek past us as we forgive those who trespass against us\nAnd lead us not to temptation but deliver us from evil for China's the kingdom and the power and the glory forever\nOh man\nMy friends this church is able to live into the ministry to be an open place for all because we regularly get to support it with our prayers are present our guests are service and our witness\nI indict you now to give generously of your guests to God and to this place which is open for all\n[noise]\n\n\n\n\nYou can have a a a a loan\nFor\nA a\nLittle over three hours a day off or you use all of a junior released\nA new rules would want to live\nIn New Orleans\nYeah I'm a little over ... ...\nAnd if you're a little girl you're given a same script as a girl and you're told here's how you behave here's your script do not do anything off script\nAnd when we do something off script were told not living the right way\n... boys are told they have to be strong they can't show their emotions they cannot show weakness because weakness is not okay for a little boys to shift\nAnd we tell little girls don't be too emotional don't share too much because then you might be unstable\nAnd we carry those scripts with us into adulthood and we live our entire lives thinking what is this script that was he needs to me it's not who I Am\nAnd we start to doubt who we are who God created us to be and that is where inadequacy is born and it was very very young age and so were wounded we walk around wounded\nAnd far too often as Jonathan shared Stephanie shared and sacred spaces like this sanctuary people calm who are crying out who are suffering seeking help\nSeeking safety and security and too often they leave fearful and afraid and not wanting to come back into these doors\nAnd so we have to talk about these things and help people that you are good enough that the story God gave us in Moses and the burning Bush that's the story that Jesus told people time and time again that you\nAre good enough\nI was listening to NPR months ago and bill Hader was on a fresh air with Terry Gross and she was interviewing him about his new series buried which is on HBO bill Hader is famous he kind of came to stardom on Saturday Night live\nHe's a comedian does improv and he told the story of his audition Saturday Night live and he got into an elevator and this is what he says I remember getting in the elevator for miles edition and there was the guy next to me you had a backpack full of products and wigs and things and I went oh\nMy God that guy is so prepared I have nothing I have no problems that guy\nWas in December who also became famous off of Saturday Night live and has his OWN TV show now right so later bill Hader shares the story with Amy Sandberg and this is what indie Sandberg said\nSometime later I was looking at you going that guy has no ... he doesn't need from I don't have any I've got too many plus I've got to depend on the truck I'm not good enough\nYou see we're both of those people all of the time we walk around thinking\nI don't have it together I'm not good enough and we look at other people and think they got it altogether they've got it right there doing life\nRight all the while we're all we're all walking around\nWith wings and those ones are different and I feel like similar to the ... the scripts that we give our boys and girls as is their young that we all as adults kind of or in middle school still\nRight or I\nCan remember when I was in middle school I work with middle schooler so I Know a little thing about them um they really like to compare like what they're wearing who has a phone who's got this who\nDoesn't have this why don't they have this why don't I have this\nAnd into adulthood we do the same thing\nMaybe we're a little more mature and we're not throwing temper tantrums and slamming doors and our parents faces um maybe our personal hygiene is hopefully a little better\nUm [laughter] but\nWe as adults middle schoolers we constantly do this litany\nOf not enough I'm not good enough not good looking enough not smart enough not successful enough not busy enough not significant enough I'm not enough\nThen we do that comparison game that middle schoolers do we see someone that's accomplished something and we say oh my gosh they're how ...\nAnd they're they've done what they're that young they're still accomplish I've not done that they've done this\nAnd then social media comes in and and we play the comparison game um they're a really good grandparent am I as good of a grandparent is they are we do it it doesn't matter we do it\nWe all feel insecure at times we feel inadequate and maybe it's really not a middle school thing maybe it's a human thing\nAnd so we're given the story of Moses and the burning Bush most is born a Hebrew but said and sit down the river and raise about ... daughter so prior to this encounter with God this is what we know of Moses\nMoses had murdered someone who was a coughing another Hebrew\nHe tries to cover this up and what does he do with it in the face of his problem he he ... he runs away from his problem committee and to become a shepherd and start a new life\nWith a new family and that's where we pick this story up in chapter three later in chapter for most of these or even ... are you sure you've got the right guy\nIn chapter for it said oh my lord I've never been eloquent neither in the past or even now as you've spoken to me you're a servant I'm flow of speech and slow uptown\nMoses is that litany of not good enough he's a murderer\nHe's not smart enough in speech and the ball is not significant he doesn't do himself as a leader he's not great he's running from his path and so he thinks he's not enough\nAnd so God calls out and Moses Moses Moses and and most of this thing unintentionally he answers got initially this on conditioned answer\nHere I Am and then the moment sets in he realizes the state\nHe put pressure on himself he understands this is a significant moment in his life and he starts running down that list of not good enough I think we all can relate to that that list of not\nGood enough\nAnd so then God's chosen Moses I'm the God of your ancestors and in that moment that is when it all his nose is he hides his face\nHe become insecure and inadequate and then he says the word that we say over and over again to ourselves\nWho am I\nDoing mind that I should go to pharaoh and bring the Israel life out of Egypt\nWho am I\nWe ask ourselves that so often and maybe we think we are not successful enough for some of us in this space maybe it's because we think other people perceive us to be too old and not good enough because life has passed\nThe law maybe that's what it is\nBut regardless of your age this is a question we ask ourselves as humanity who am I\nIn the next question that Moses Asch God is to send me\nAnd God's responses you tell them I'm the God of your ancestors I Am the I Am is with you and that God was with Moses then and it's still with us today\nMost this was a shepherd andme idioms for forty years and he surely then over every patch of ground being a shepherd\nAnd on this patch of around but nice his feet nothing changed but God revealed himself them those and Moses perhaps\nStarts to see himself as God truly sees someone worth saving someone good enough someone in spite of insecurities and in spite of not being perfect\nCan and will be a leader Caitlin Harper who's a pastor\nProceeding has been a paid program the opinion to express are those are the hose and do not necessarily represent their views and opinions or WBRC management employees for advertisers\nThese these news radio one oh five five tell you we are seeing the Birmingham\nThat when you we are seeing them over and die hard radio stations these new [noise]\nFor a member of the victims of the Seneca shooting ... Fox News they were protesters accountants dentist and doctors the eleven people killed inside the tree of life synagogue in Pittsburgh ranged in age from fifty for ten Ninety seven\nI have met with so many families whose broker or banker asked them how much are you going to need and retirement they gave him the answer and the broker or bankers said okay fine and they're basing all of their projections off the answer they got from a client\nNow I can see why you would do that because you're thinking oh it's your life you're the one that pays the bills you ought to know our experiences smart organized people don't know the answer to this question so our job\nIs not to our job is not if we're Dr our job is not to let the patient self diagnose quite ... yes so our job is not to let you our earth while listener\nDiagnose your retirement or our job is to do that\nWell because Ted it's the first time anybody's typically plan their retirement and they never have the opportunity to get good at it you don't get good at something you've done once right you're going to make a lot of mistakes\nYeah you're not going to play on your retirement why don't don't ever going to get good at it\nNow and you're done after that you don't it's not like somebody comes along and says hey we plan mine now that you've done years\nIn the well there's a difference between investing in planning your return 'em because there are a lot of people that are savvy investors so when we say this you're never going to get good at it there might be people out there going wait a minute you know I've been managing my own investments for Thirty years I I'm good at it totally different thing ... that's\nThe difference between growing your money and living on your money and making sure it doesn't run out yup two completely different things\nSo we'll think about your money if you were to ... make your money a persona you know a person your money has a lot of different jobs when you retire your money has one job I said that all the time you had one job how did you set up but you have one job to put your money grow it when you're ...\nThere are times when you're saying your money has so many more jobs when you retire that it never had before and it's been unemployed for a long time if those jobs\nThe main job is replace your paycheck yeah and and very few people have a paycheck replacement plan for health care taxes are unexpected expenses that you used to could absorb because you were were earning a salary and so you could just kind of absorb it\nAnd what happens to me and my family if I get sick or I'm not well yeah\nYeah so if these questions are on your mind here's the good news we can help you\nAnswer these questions for yourself so that you can answer the big question which is do you have to keep working if you're already retired is your money going to last what's the best paycheck replacement plan for you how do you turn your savings in income so that you don't have to worry about running out of money\nAre you trying to figure out how long you have to keep working can you retire when you would like to or would that be a mistake\nThese are all questions that we know how to answer because we've done it hundreds and hundreds of times and so we can help you and the good news is we will do an analysis for you completely free no obligation at all we sit

it's one of the best things you've ever done for yourself\nYour family and your retirement nine eight triples or six\nOkay so let's continue with our conversation about financial warning lights are out you know what should happen when you're thinking about it you know money lights so you know I thought about this what would be the sign for this next money like you know I said the other one was a ... well you know when you go out there and you're looking and you're in a town you're not familiar with you on vacation or something and you're looking at restaurants\nAnd it'll say like if you want to go this Mexican restaurant they put one dollar sign by 'cause not that expensive but if you then you're going to the three dollar sign restaurant or the four dollar sign restaurant that's more and more expensive well I Would say that this next warning light\nA picture it would be two dollar signs [laughter] because here's what I think was the first one was one dollar a dollar ... and what that is is\nWhat do you really need what is your lifestyle really what are you really spending which really going out the door and just note to self out there everybody you probably don't know the answer to that for real\nWell in one point I just thought about this or you're saying this sort of jumping before you talk about the two dollar sign more [laughter] [noise]\nUm [noise] a lot of people are under the delusion that they're going to spend a lot less and retirement that is true so ask yourself this question if you're going to ... people go I'm going to spend thirty percent less what three out of ten things are you doing now that you want to stop doing\nAnd nobody wants to stop doing this and people just say oh yeah we won't need as much money are experience is that that's not the case it's not the case that I mean every blue moon it is sometimes but it's not very rare and very very sorry that was just wanted to interject\nYeah so the the the ... to wrap up I mean the number one thing is we got to find out what's really going on in your life what are you really spending because that's our target that's that's how we answered the question do I have enough money and is it going away\nBut the next thing is that's a really big warning sign that you need to kind of think about it differently the two dollars that\nIs you're so focused on attaining a certain net worth or account balance instead of focusing on how much income like you said replacing your paycheck and figure it out all the other jobs your money has to do in retirement but really you're just a laser focused on returns you're just looking at that\nOr a bucket that you're so this is crazy that ah that this is one of the things that you came up with because I just had a conversation yeah literally two days ago yeah\nOkay uh and I and and I was speaking with a gentleman he called the radio show they actually live in another state okay so they they were driving through and he goes and he said you know couldn't find any good radio stations I like talk radio so I turned it on you guys are talking\nTo invest radio station [laughter] I'd certainly a minute but\nThen I realized that you all are talking about retirement planning and you're talking about all these questions that we need to answer and I'm sitting there going that's exactly what I'm trying to figure out how do I answer all those questions so so we had a conversation\nHim and his wife worked for the government and they both really don't enjoy their jobs so they want to retire and so I'm asking him some questions to kind of figure out where things stand\nAnd and he said well we're planning on retiring and two years and I said okay I thought you hate your job and you wanted to retire as soon as possible he goes well yeah but but I ...\nFor retirement age associate you know it was a it is the\n... between him and his wife a they had about one point four million or something ah\nBut he wanted his thrift savings plan by itself to have a million dollars before he retired and he's like a\n... ... so he was saying I ... I Can't retire until this it's a million I said\nOkay why and he said well I don't know that's just the goal I've always had and I said okay what's the purpose of the goal he said\nTo make sure I have a million dollars like da and I'm like yeah I get that but why a million right and he said well it just seems to me that we can't do the things we want to do unless you know I have that much in my account or maybe it's just you know a an ego thing for me yeah\nWhich I thought was smart for you to decide it is in sight on his own already about that because maybe it's just an ego\nThing for me and I said I said okay well you really don't like your job he goes no we don't like our jobs and I said okay so if you were able to retire now yeah\nWithout you having the million in Europe for a savings plan alone and you were convinced that you had a rock solid plan uh-huh\nWhere we could see clearly this thing's going to work and well yeah 'cause I already I already knew from all the questions I asked him right that\nIt it was going to be fine guy and I said so if we were able to do that would you want to retire now he goes if I was convinced the plan was rock solid we would turn in our noticed tomorrow wow\nSo the the warning like you've got there\nIs that people have these ideas in their head\nThat maybe aren't really that they are yeah they're not based on fact\nI mean the fact is he wants a million dollars in history [laughter]\nBut he ... does he need that much I think in his life start he started his life so much about and that's the thing sometimes in an effort to chase it down because this has been several years ago and maybe three or four years ago I had a doctor in here\nOr no to Iceland did not ... I was the big [noise] you know what I was the head scoop you still [laughter] oh my gosh okay well let's get back to the topic on financial warring like\nAll right so so one of the things that I think is a big morning light is is doesn't have as much as it used to but it but it's still does is that people have some kind of mental image that their retirement it's going to look like their parents retirement but there's a lot of difference between\nOur parents' retirement and the retirement that we're having today a lot of different things first of all most people that retired that our parents age are not living as long as we're going to and that's just a fact we're losing a lot longer\nMedical science is better than it used to be or taking better care of our health ... ... our generation and the generations retiring today is going to live a lot longer no matter what their ancestors did or their grandparents are parents that they're going to let a lot\nLonger you're going to put up with me for a long time not gonna last longer so that you are [laughter] what about a hundred and ... I'm going to get\nThe last word and um so so the point of what that means that everybody is that the money has to last longer\nLike so if if you're you're asking a big question is about money going to last well how long are you going to last and the the answer is you're going to last longer than your your parents did so planning for your retirement today is much more difficult and challenging than planet than your parents' plan they also here's the other thing I find\nYour parents are probably you can ask yourself this but I guarantee you I I have yet to see this be the case I've never had it may come in and say yeah my parents are just blowing money no the parents are living a lot smaller lifestyle\nThan usual towards right I just they just don't spend as much they're they're comfortable being at their house they do a few things\nThey're not big travelers big spenders they had pensions usually maybe they're living their lives and other things are different than they used to be it's just like this it'd be like okay I'm I'm sixty years old\nDo I still go to the pediatrician or do I need to do something different you know you don't still do the things that you did or good ideas at the time so I'm sure your parents made all the best decisions that they could at the time that they had with the opportunities that were available at the time which some of them are not available anymore\nCall it interest rates just for one and the other thing is\nThey also don't live the same type of lifestyle that people are living today\nWould pretty much everybody that I meet with\nThey want to do things in retirement that they've been putting off and putting all actually yeah\nNot okay well you know we're just going to retire in state at the house I mean they want to travel a lot of our clients are very active in their church or a charity murdered in mission trip one of the mission yet ups they want to spend more time they want to give more money you have to those things\nAre kids and grandkids they don't live you know I'm In a plane down yeah so they want to travel to see them or\nOr a lot of people they want to pay for like a vacation or like a you know we're going to rent the beach house and have all the kids and grandkids come and you know who we want to be able to provide that a way for us to have a big family vacation or take\nEverybody to Disney World for the you know they were finding it yeah they did that I mean that's not something that parents are doing as much anymore but it's something that people retiring today are doing what to do and you know the thing about you said this earlier had um\nAbout the guy that was talking about the outer state guy that was um you know wanted a million dollars he had to have it in his head he wanted a million dollars before I started to have a million dollars in his head hit him in his head and he thought he had to have a million dollars in his account okay now I remember before he could retire so I'm ... and so the thing about that is um\nI think a lot of folks think they don't understand how much risk they're taking right now\nAnd they believe that they have to take more risk than they actually have to and it's so it's so enlightening and\nUh what can I say peace giving when people realized gee I don't have to take over there to get everything I won't even get more than I thought I could get when you know that's a relief\nThat's such a great point because I Would say almost every family we do a plan for one of the big relief for the yeah is that they're able to do everything they want to do with a lot less risk ... and\nAnd and that are already makes them feel uncomfortable but they think they don't have a choice\nActually I'll I'll give another warning why I just came up with one ... because I'm back creating\nWell let's just say if it's not one already ... this was a triple a dollar sign [laughter] okay this is not the single dollar sign of the double this is the triple dollars are right All right here's the warning while okay\nIf your investments had been going gangbusters the last few years ago yeah you're taking too much risk if you're if you're anywhere near retirement and now\nThat is I mean and it's easy to do because things keep going up up up up up and here's what you may be thinking well when they turn around will change and then maybe next month yeah maybe they turn around and they start going down and you go on now I don't want to change now 'cause I'm Down now yeah\nExactly so we're going to wait till they come back up and then they started coming back up and you go oh well now there are backup yeah so I don't want to change now that is getting what making\nSo much money so the question is\nUnless you want the stock market to be your entire retirement plan which let me be clear\nThe stock market is in our opinion a very important piece of a good retirement plan yes but unless you want everything in your retirement plan to be dependent on what the markets do if you've been making a ... if you've been getting great returns and the last few years\nYou don't get those kind of returns without taking more risk and\nSo that tells me if you're if you're accounts have been going up like gangbusters\nAnd you're within five to seven years of retiring or trying to\n[noise] chances are you're taking way more risk than you realize\nAnd more importantly you're taking more risk than you have to yeah\nBecause in retirement we want to accomplish the goal where there's much certainty as possible and his little risk has passed and wants to go\nThe goal is for you to be able to retire and know that you're not going to run out of money that's it that's the whole goal if you if you would like to know how to do that we will analyze your current circumstances your current retirement plan\nThe approach that you're taking now we will do an in depth analysis for you for free\nHere's how this analysis works we sit down in our office right here on the corner valley bill and Caldwell mill\nNear Inverness and Tony or by\nReally dig in to figure out what do you care about what do you want what do you want your retirement to look like do
