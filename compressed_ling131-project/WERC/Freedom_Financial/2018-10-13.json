I I mean so ... with metal pipes in a high humidity in a basement in a clash of cool when warm\nThat high humanity turns into water droplets water droplets are usually on the surface of the piping\nAnd\nJust you get that surface Russ say well I I Can't see it but I can kind of visualize how it'd be it'd be more surface rushed you've kinda got the\nProblem in check now my guess it's it's fine if it's distasteful looking there are a different types of products one is called rust reformer\nOne is called Russ neutralize or it sprays or its brushes and what it is it's not a pain it's actually a chemical that creates a chemical reaction with the iron oxide\nWhich seals the rushed into the medal it turns it black\nAnd seals have rushed into the metal so it doesn't look like it's resting old but it looks like it's got like pain on it\nAll that well only that white collar ... only ... her from the west wanting a yeah ... ... that are on the west where I thought how white ... ... ...\nIt's probably a little oxidation\nWhy are they must a little bit of a you know maybe just sitting there with a sanding sponge or something will knock that off and I don't think it's going to get any worse as long as we control that humidity in the basement full although it's really caused many more than anything you could wrap the duck work\nYou know if you wanted to go that direction just a matter of how much it's making you crazy Renee\nI'm Sorry I don't know I ... I ever found All right Bye bye oh my gosh look at what yeah yeah yeah I'll Try to cut it out in front of all you\nKnow yeah so that's a really good basement humidity anything ... below you were probably up near Seventy I Would bet [noise]\nWhy that we are I Know about the problem with my ... but yeah I was that I thought well I'll tell you they kept calling for life okay\nAll right very good to have a good weekend they are by ... by as they said the top of the next hour we're\nGoing to talk about smart homes and or even if you think there is no way I'm going to get involved and having the smart home listened to this hour\nI'm from a standpoint of making your home more secure more safe there's some wonderful products that can be incorporated run your home and I'm really really really easy to install that's what we're going to discuss it in the next hour in the meantime Troy welcome\nHey Gary got a question and moved into a new house a couple of weeks ago and it's got a sprinkler system [noise] cool what that never had one for what the maintenance as we head into the winter my ... I'm ...\nNow they're ... you know I mean I could never hit a sprinkler system in a house but certainly hit some or not you're not in a house in the yard I'm Sorry oh in the yard okay alright okay ah there was a big push for sprinkler systems in houses\nSome reason my head went there [noise] um you didn't have shut off in in\n... below them out\nA ... you know just just shut them down and now's probably as good time is any um I have a service that actually comes out and just shuts mine out and they're going to do it Tuesday I'm OK though but you can do it yourself too if you want to go that direction\nThere is a product that will definitely eliminate that smell um\nThe the question I have is not knowing exactly where it is we're both assuming that the deck\nHas been used as the bathroom for the dogs and yeah and but it has come and it is on the wood it's not around the deck it's not underneath the deck it's not cats from the neighborhoods it's it's on the deck correct\nYeah a comic back I mean they are there any that Grapel based on your age ah and so obviously with is facing and I'm Wondering if some if they got in there because I have partial washed it multiple times you know throughout the summer mhm\n[noise] right and the ... the wood deck is open correct is not an enclosed patio room or something like\nThat yes it is open okay\nUm there's a website which I'm going to give you and it's called odor exit actually we had them on as our project of the week last week it's\nO D O R\nX. I. T. Dakota odor exit dot com they make a multitude of different\nUh products that um will take care and the limb and ate a smells in fact they have one that eliminates mold in viruses but uh the product you want for this is called the odor exit concentrate\nIt's four ounces two gallon the secretive using this as you want to saturate that and one of the challenges that we have in you said I think that you had sealed this stack [noise]\nYeah uh he actually staying at a mhm uh beginning of the year I let it sit for a good year from last year good and then the beginning next year I you know like ... you know all the way through the weather good weather [noise] and then uh\nSo I think it was around ... ... and April early may that's what I stand it\nSo that's one of the challenge if that's stained his sealed that would I'm kinda\nWondering how they urine is penetrated into the woods\nTo create to smell and to hold that smell for two months so we certainly want to saturate the would because you know use the word saturated because that is the way you should apply it but I'd really concentrate on where the boards about each other okay because that probably is unsealed\nA man maybe it got down between the boards that are unsealed urine was whipped into the woods and hence we have this lingering Notre ah but I feel real confident that that product will eliminate your problem wing\n[noise] okay All right Chris shady Yes sir okay it's older ... dot com okay thank you are\nYou're quite welcome thank you you do the same again our phone numbers or eight hundred eight two three eight to five five and we're talking home improvement again a reminder er at the next hour\nAnd we will take your calls we're going to learn a little bit about smart homes together also going to be talking a safety and security around your home like I said I was watching the news last night and somebody had a camera on the outside the home they had this picture of this\nGuy this guy was inside the garage and around this home for like Fifteen minutes and uh so what are the things you need to think about when you're buying that type of equipment for your home for the outside of your home\nHow easy is installed certainly want to think about that\nWanting to think about the ah the quality of the video that you're going to have we certainly want to think about that and so we're going to learn a little\nBit about how easy it is and I'm telling you it is a very easy to use and um you don't have to be a computer genius to do that so that all be in the next hour and we'll have our friends in from ... will be discussing that will be taking your\nCalls in a filling in All right so\nA great day do other projects around the home certainly one of the things I Want to talk about is a is we were just talking about the the deck will quickly run out of time in many parts of the country\nTo ah get those deck sealed again you want to use and acrylic sealer\nIt's going to hold up much better in the sun or make sure you clean it makes your use a bright and her make sure we open up those wood fibers so we can get that debt ceiling compound into the woods or last longer so run that time to do that also says you know what I'm staying on the ceiling theme\nWe've got the feeling of decks we also they have concrete Steelers\nAgain there's a website masonry defender it has project specific Steelers so if you have stamped concrete to get a sealer for that garage floor they get a sealer for that I'm a exposed ... for that papers this\nYou look for that six or seven different Steelers again a lot of these products can be used in the forty degree temperature you want to read the label\nA and then there's going to kind of cut off so I Know you've you are going to blow up against the calendar and quickly eliminate those up project but while you have part and it's been a while especially if you live in different parts of the country where you get snow and ice and\nYou got road so that is very very corrosive\nTo concrete so it's imperative\nThat the concrete gets the old um to prevent spoiling you've seen that it's a cold like concrete acne it's the surface popping off the concrete so ceiling that minimizes that salt brine solution from penetrating into the concrete\nAnd doing damage to it so giving that sealed giving the brick around your house the old um asphalt driveways again\nYou know if you leave salmon started falling and the temperature hasn't gotten too cold or certainly recommend getting that done two and a those are good good projects for this time\nOf year another good project this time of year using one of my favorite ... grand a gold holidays coming up detect granted at least tested and see if it needs to be still just work and the

as you mentioned earlier you basically just take off your old light fixture and replace it with the new fixture and you just use existing wiring that's already there yeah no additional fires yeah it was all everything else has wireless so it's basically it's a ten or Fifteen minutes a project to turn off the record by the way\nSo could point very good very good sea turtles to brag are literally\nI made sure we put one up and it was it was no more than ten minutes and um the ... has a nice little diagrams you know how far the screws need to come out and you just slide it in black\nWearing a black why or why are why our ground to ground screwed\nYour business him absolutely any download the Q and a half which is a very powerful user friendly half you download that and you connect your light using the app to your local route or in the house and that and then after that basically your light than is connected to the cloud and you're ready to go it's a very easy\nProcess okay so seriously it is that easy is that I mean it really really is that easy and you got a flood light so via the old flood light you can just simply ...\nYes if you get a flight over your patio or your your garage or your driveway or corner of your house you basically just remove the light and then you installed a new and we have what's called a quick connect plate\nWhich is a a plate that you mount a first allows you to wire the played up you're not actually holding the light and you're right it's just a just a disk that you actually wire up\nAnd um went that's once that's mounted you take up to like you just snap it into place and you're good to go\nSouth really a fear has managed to light the maximus flood light is easier to mount then a flood like you buy the big ... it really is because of the quick ... am absolutely hit really really is All right now the fun part okay you said you download the app so this\nCamera in light functions on the app on your phone\nRight so you know there's a very user friendly app that you can see all of your cameras on your lights are on your your smartphone with your apple user Android doesn't matter um you know the first thing that happens is even when you're not looking at your phone if someone comes to your door you get a notification and someone's at your door\nSo I'm at work you get older I'm In the ... in fact last night we were having dinner the one fellow that was with us 'cause well somebody's at my door and it was very cool and so it notified makes a sound or ...\nWhatever the notification you have it vibrates or the noise would however you set it up in your phone and then you can actually click on it and if you click on it then it actually takes you right to that camera alive\nAnd you're seeing the person real time and you can actually talk to them real time that you can talk to them have a conversation if you like or you can you can press you can dial nine one one you can actually pressing alarm if they're a burglar I mean you go to his alarm that can be\nPress so if you don't know who this person is and they're not dropping off a package or maybe they're taken aback each um you can take action\nAbsolutely yeah on the spot and and no matter what if you if you answer the door or not or if you go to the live feed the the video will be recorded as into the cloud for for downloading viewing later\nSo so if mom and dad say no kids in the house while we're gone [laughter] you can see if there's kids coming out and see a lot ... usually not every child likes our products to we've heard lots of stories last couple of years to sell this\nCoach light with camera or are these prevalent or do you are the only ones that have the ... are usually cameras free standing or\nYeah so there's a there'd be an issue again and as a consumer I think you know you have to decide you know search the mark and see what works for you the best but in terms of the porch light a application you know we're really the only ones that carry a porch lights solution\nAnd we offer that the foresight does come and different um different styles indifferent finishes 'cause we try to accommodate you know the delights in the design of your house I'm so we don't really have any ... competitors in that space there there's some knock offs that are trying to mimic what we're doing but really there\nYou know as it relates to porch lights we've you know really know competitors\nThe flight there is another option or two out there um but again I I think we've got the best solution if you compare the the products are in the market with ours I I I Believe in our customers tell us as all the time they replaced their existing\nProduct with ours and how much happier they are what the product [noise] what would be the difference is that the quality of the camera and the quality of the camera detection range him in our detection range is Seventy feet um detection on the camera\nIt's a hundred and two hundred Seventy degrees around the camera to detection range definitely I'm I'm you know one of the differences the quality of the camera\nYou know we use you know not to get to technical but\nBecause of our application and our software and the from where the products we actually use less resources so\nUm we're not as resource um heavy so our products will work a lot of times when social services week\nOr the wife I said no it's not as strong as as you know others products requires so um you know just generally speaking we have a very good um customer satisfaction the app is definitely a difference if you compare our app with other\nAnimals so I'm really yeah I mean we do some nails are so that means is when you're looking at your videos you know you don't have to actually play a video to see what's on the video we show you the thumb nails for all the videos\nAnd you can sort by camera and sorted by by day and time\nI'm it's just it's again there's so many uh features in our app that customers really like and what we hear that you know quite often\nNow on the coach like with the camera that camera is I mean you talk about the angle and you talk about the distance but its position of ... too\nYeah so it's a it's in a ball basically um both the the flow of light and the coach later the other a poor choice we put the camera in a in a in a ball that can be when you first installed a product\nYou want to aim that cameras you get the optimal um field of view so you want to cover your porch or or cover your driveway you basically look at your apple you're aiming that camera and then you have a locking ringing lock that camera and the place in ... men and typically it just stays there then\n... but when you're watching a when you're watching the um the either the life feet are you watching the video later you can ... you can actually ... so\nYou're able to go in pretty close to a to whatever you're looking at through the camera you can get pretty close if you use them in with that but pension is great great\nSo I'm Daniel let's open up the phone lines if someone has a question about the ... lighting or whether they have um a any

seconds before before what\nBefore you see the right so what happens is the the cameras are always recording in memory or in buffer so when we're when we do have motion a sense and weak in the video clip up to the cloud we put that ten seconds onto the front of the video says nothing's missed\nSo if a if a driver or FedEx or UPS drivers dropping off a package you actually when you watch the video

you have a question about this feel free to jump on board again it's eight hundred eight two three eight to five five and Diane welcome\nMhm how can we help me yes\nWell I just had a question for the cattle and ... with a camera huh now what happens if somebody perfectly comes out there and damages that are covered it is that possible for them to cover it for the Clinton thing\nOh sure I mean if they are they cover the camera that I mean obviously it's going to block so sure of the um the view of the camera the you know the good news about the cameras are very and conspicuous I mean you don't even really realize there was a camera on the light\nI guess that's also another good thing for that ten seconds buffer though right yeah you because you've got to walk up you got to get to the camera they've already got John camera and on video\nSo yeah there's also one other small feature we actually have a status light it's a little um indicator light\nThat used to tell you you know different colors blue it means is on line but if you really want to be you know in talking to you know you can actually turn that laid off in the app so that little blue light is not on the person does not see that when they woke up to your door so\nBut very good question no die and you're thinking\nNot alarm goes off on your phone at how many were actually not a light off the wall faith so to speak\nNo you would just get your normal notification greeting someone's at your door and of course once that happens I mean there is a panic button on your app that does sound an alarm so some some someone does damage to the delight or covers it up you can push the panic button the light flashes and the alarm goes off on the light itself\nI think you're right not All right Diane thank you care so it is smart importer than we already said hundred eight to three\nTo five five we're talking about smart security lights by maximus lighting fascinating Randy welcome [noise] [noise]\nI uh I have a question we shoot the runaround what they're saying trick or treaters\n... yes I mean the ... you know if you have the porch lights on your front door um I mean it's designed to pick up motion within say ten Fifteen feet your porch area\nBut you can set in the Arab you can set the zones that you actually want to be active or hot that would actually trigger the the motion sensor\nI'm so yes they will pick it up the other hand you can do to there's another feature that I didn't mention earlier mentioned in now is that um if you see the dogs that are in your yard you know you look out your window you can see them\nUm you can go into the app anytime even whether the the motions been triggered or not and you can do just uh you can hit the record button live she can do record on demand\nSo if you're something going on in your yard is in the field of view of the camera no matter what it is um if you want to start recording you just hit the record button in historic recording that activity\nOr any type\nOf care is very true right now and I have turned off every ten minutes though they're turning around the house [noise] I just wonder if they are the way to get the sense that\nThey're absolutely so there's two things one is you can you can control the zones are literally would just show you a grid of the field of view of the camera\nAnd you can actually you can highlight the areas in that grid that you want to be a sensitive for to to the actual activate the motion and the camera and beyond that you can actually turn there's a bar you can slide the sensitivity up or down so you I call it tuning so winch installed a product you can kinda tune\nWhich alert you want to get the ones that matter and that again we've built all that features into the product in the app very cool and then see\nThat's man you gotta think everything don't you I'm fascinated by by\nThe questions again it's eight hundred eight to three to five five or Sheila welcome [noise]\nHello yes I was wondering like how do you have any generators that are run by ... or any solar panels or any how Kyle or anything like that\nWell they're selling the security lighting but that's something you could add to your home but these things are are they go ahead I'll be quiet [laughter] okay so let me\nWell I don't I mean I don't think of the show\nOkay well ... actually today\nMarks ready to go with your ... question he he may I think he's got an answer\nYes so one one feature we do have um that's important is that we ... we do send the alert to your smartphone when your cameras on line or off line\nSo if the power goes out on your home no matter where you are there'll be a mess he gets into your phone and it says that the the cameras off line so at least you know that it's off line for some reason which is usually it's a user either the wife dies out okay or the power's out\nOr do I get here and they're like well yeah\nYou can pick up a podcast angel again we we got that on our website scary solve it online dot com but one of the questions I have for you is we we hit somebody actually concerned about that also and and again did they have any video of this happening\nAt all [noise] yeah but I'm the max and on this particular product is ... ... this maximus lighting that wouldn't be a problem though\nRight we're going to we're going to one of the videos is to send up to the cloud we actually I'm at ten seconds before the motion sensor goes off we ... we both that on the front of the video so you would get the person coming up to the door\nAnd see them in the video before the they damaged let's keep in mind though are cameras integrated into the light fixture is not a like a lot of other products are separate cameras you can easily spot right this is actually a just a a ball that's on the bottom of the light fixture that\nMost of the time you don't even know what's there yeah it looks like a ... coach would know the cameras there unless you're really looking forward but if you did you have that extra ten seconds\nWhich is awesome unavoidable were catch him don't worry we're going to catch him yeah\nSecond tunnel up on that answer possibility that the middle of the week the only thing that\nI watched the first of all the time in our new vehicle to\nWell I mean we can we are re integrated though with a with Google Home an election which is now in your vehicle so I suppose that bridge could could be done yeah I have at the first time I've heard that question it's a good\nOne that's great that one day yeah sure yeah but in the Google it certainly could be pretty up there are

[noise]\nHey my question was you touched on the lights earlier but as far as our in the camera I got a ... actually just at the light switch as I'm walking out the door and my hunch analogy of the camera\nYeah so you know a lot of the uh your porch lights are on a switch we recommend that you actually a wire around that said that the camera cannot be turned off I mean you get an education at the ... the cameras off line but um we recommend that you actually eliminate to switch so that the powers never uh never turned\nOff and then just programming is on your apt to do whatever you want it to\nEnd and you can turn a alerts off too so let's say you're back door and you go in and out of your backdoor all day you can actually go into the app and turn the alerts off you know during the day if you don't want to get those you know while you're home sure but we recommend the optimal way to use the product is just not have the power be able to turned off All right All right\nVery good thank

connect\nAnd or do you hope you're watching as well as listening and if you're not go back to the live stream later and watch it because the scenery behind her as beautiful in Alaska\nBut do lose generally boys and girls who served ... how are ya [noise]\nI'm doing great thank you for having me\nThey were not be mad at me for that whole thing like friday and the people know I was actually and this was unfolding on me or love you are listening but I was telling them what was going on and and I got a random Facebook message from somebody not named Jew\nWho said Hi Sarah Palin and pick up the kids up and dropping kids often and I'm listening is what is a good point they submitted you've got a famous name and correct me if you're a teacher was do you remember what you said you said it's really neat I promise [laughter]\nTo\nGo back and forth that when I needed it oh\nMy goodness somebody is listening to the fact we get pumped a lot and yet I'm Still thank you for doing that and it was funny I started getting the calls and the tax people up here in Alaska listening [laughter] I don't know what I'm trying to verify me\nWhile I tried to verify the few ways when I got the email back from Sarah appealing dot com I knew that it was somebody connected with you at least um but then I sent you a tweet that you guys couldn't find and then finally I said you have an iPhone ... face time you'll let's just settled this once in a row and as good as we got to figure that figure so much for reaching out by the way\nAnd then one other thing about that is yeah so I'm grabbing Todd phone by that time out of the vehicle and we're all in all the button to try to figure out how to say that\nAnd it worked out 'cause you press the button you took my first time in ... her not to say that's her that's out there you got a hold of me because you are seeing what was unfolding or in in Washington DC I still to this day sir I have no idea how Lisa Murkowski be became the senator as a write in\nReally so that's the starting point for me and then she says as a Republican IQ support Brett Kavanaugh and the reason she says she couldn't support him was that he's not the right guy at the right time\nDo the people of Alaska except that excuse\nYou know and go back even further\nWriting campaign after he lost the primary up here remember what your Senator Frank workout after having served twenty two years in the U.S that he gave his daughter the job\nWhen he was elected governor up here right there on charming and I ran against him into heated yep that's how we got in that that we said the man once you're in and you have special interests from\nAround the country right up funding you you know you shouldn't have yet to hold them accountable and say okay enough is enough time to go but no rational reason that she provided regarding that that\nThat vote again cabinet because as you point out sheet that a good man it's not about qualifications and I'm like wait you know of course it is and whether either good manners\nYes I Know it makes sense and then her speech on the Senate floor which is kind of talking in circles are very very very disappointed because Joe as you suggested it outright set on friday\nThe things that she's putting in jeopardy just for the state of Alaska you look for this country I mean it comes down to you that's the\nHaving so much with in its graph having to do with our ... our sovereignty and she was willing to play some games with that\nShe was looking to play games and the point that I made that I really appreciate that you that you are you like was it about the Ninth Circuit court of appeals that I'll I'll repeat that in a second it's us their opinion of course the former vice presidential nominee\nThe Republican Party back in two thousand eight and of course the former governor of Alaska and just a great all wrong person or you know this but I wasn't a vote for John McCain is going right at my mother's name until you got on the ticket and then I voted for you\nShow and I think a lot of people actually did that the point I made friday was Lisa Murkowski and people like her were actually putting in the hands of the most liberal court to the United states the Ninth Circuit court of appeals the the um\nThe more issues of Alaska and everybody in the west coast in other words if the Supreme Court is eight members that it's tied for the foreign almost everyone would be for the for now it goes back to the previous court in the Ninth Circuit court of appeals will just started the first amendment Second Amendment Fourth Amendment Fifth Amendment Pence Amendment for Alaska what does that make you think\nThat's exactly right and Joe I was so impressed because nobody else was talking about that book share um what her\nAction was was essentially bolstering the Ninth Circuit had she had her her way and that's the Ninth Circuit out\nI just go right he talked about injustice and justice being delayed for Alaskans because that court a million people they are to quote unquote served it's the largest by far\nUm the second largest the eleventh and they are only thirty thirty five million right so there is such a backlog of cases and not even talking about the ideology behind that very very partisan very liberal Korea is just the practical reasons why we don't want to give them any more power\nAnymore say over Alaska so for at least to be messing around with that uh that was very very dangerous another thing is that the Trump President Trump saw the lights and is allowing animal are only decades of the nation understanding what Anwar has\nIn terms of resources to help our country become more energy independent that inherently between energy and security energy and prosperity that Anwar that's our oil and gas development here in Texas and elsewhere that Lisa would put that in jeopardy and\nOur little group of girlfriends out there that we\nWould like these radical [laughter]\nYou know we haven't gone I\nThink that the fact that you know the more they become unhinged I I think the more that and reasonable rational Americans which is the majority we said nah enough is enough of that and we're going to get in there we're going to put government back on our side get it off our back we're going to follow the constitution constitutions all about\nLimiting government that we can govern ourselves and I think people like you get to be out there every day in the arena make you a different where you guys do keep\nOkay we're going to do that as Sarah thanks a million along with millions of other Americans I voted for you two thousand eight I'd vote for you in a heartbeat again I really appreciate your reaching out and thanks for taking the time today\nThank you so much cricket you\nWe appreciate Sarah ... taking the time you know it was interesting how we ended up connecting she's riding around in Alaska and\nListens to my program every day we're on it you know in in Anchorage I'm guessing that's where she hears it we're also on in a in Fairbanks but to have\nThe opportunity to talk to her and she really doesn't have a similar if not even worth story being cabinet does because Kevin only had to put up with it for three weeks or ... or ... eleven days where Sarah Palin had to put up with it for more than a year and her family under the microscope and just the\nThe craziness from the left him and the lawyer showing up in Alaska her perspective really made a lot of sense to me\nAnd I look I Hope she runs give Lisa Murkowski\nLisa Murkowski in my opinion do not represent the people of Alaska which you voted no on Brett Kavanaugh um the reason she gave was because he's not the right guy at the right time which doesn't make any sense your thoughts on

I guess they hit the right buttons that one day and getting that anonymous strange a message on Facebook\nEnded up getting the interviewing and hopefully we'll have run again and again and again um I Do hope she runs that of Lisa Murkowski Lisa Murkowski showed that she is not who she told Alaska she would be when she said she'd be a Republican there is no reason for any Republican\nOr anybody who's a conservative a traditional American values person to say no to Brett Kavanaugh uncorroborated allegations don't count I'm\nInnocent until proven guilty due process do count and and her no vote

little dog and pony show every day I Would never ever have thought in my wildest dreams that the Democrats have been doing this\nFor Seventy years you're telling me Seventy years ago how they do the exact rice said em oh this is a modus operandi as we just saw a bunch of indoctrinated idiots scratching and clawing on the ... of the Supreme Court so you're saying this is what they've done for the ages for generations now\nAbsolutely but this is what happens when you make a deal with the devil when when the left decided\nThat the end that there are ... getting power\nJustifies the means this is what you end up doing your will destroy innocent man\nYou will try and you'll use every dirty trick in the book because as far as that can set\nIt doesn't matter what I Do to another human being because I have to have the power and that was so important I I couldn't put it in my book why we fight half adopt they came out yeah but when the president stood out\nIn the White House two days ago in front of the world\nAnd pulled out the Democrats for the evil things they did that justice Kavanaugh and thin pronounced him innocent that was a historic moment because just as wicket chambers was

idea as to why\nBut but I'll ask you more more specifically\nWas it so successful because the right always cow town gave in and again you just have a outlined it incredibly this president said I'm not giving you this justice cabinet\nDecided I'm not going to give it I'm not going to allow them to do this to me but is that why it's lasted for probably the better part of a century because the right always gives in and pull the nominee or or bend over backwards for the left\nI'll tell you what I saw when I was in the White House so I I I had very quickly I developed the reputation the White House a lot of people especially the press department said I'm I'm a ... and the strange one why\nBecause I refused I just refused flat out from day one to talk to the the fake news I I didn't know whether
