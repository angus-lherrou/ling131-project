the moving crew helped me to unload and hook up my appliances\nAnd then they were gone and I was alone in my new apartment in Elmira New York I felt like a character wandering around the wrong stage in the wrong way\nI just wanted to wake up from the nightmare to normal that is before I started losing my memory\nI was angry with God because this was not how my life was supposed to go I had a plan in place to retire from ministry when I turned sixty five and I was only fifty nine\nMy dreams fell apart as the memories fell out of my brain\nI Try to cover up the fact that I had trouble remembering faces and names the parishioners\nAnd the deep secrets that they had shared with me well these the secrets would be safe I missed meetings I missed appointments\nI forgot more than I remembered I was so humiliated that I couldn't even name the books to the Bible during a cognitive evaluation\nOn his so humiliated I was so humiliated\nAfter many tests the doctors told me that I had MS stick the mild cognitive impairment do the Alzheimer disease\nAnd that it was time for me to leave my position as the pastor of the church I loved being a pastor I knew though that my talk was

I didn't I was not that you don't have you ever worn suspenders\nA and maybe an address some day when we had to do something like ... de ... maybe I just didn't where's this\nWasn't necessary under person let's but but it's ... it's kinda like that it is I don't like when you know you have got so much confidence and what's going on that you are literally able to go out there and dance in the rain or whatever you're doing you're able to go and just enjoy your life\nYou know we're we're we're joking around a because we like to have some fun but this was a very serious thing that you're talking about I Can't tell you how often people come in and they do not have a belt in suspenders on\nTheir entire plan is going to work flawlessly as long as the markets that have like they want them to for the next twenty or Thirty years\nAs long as you're holding onto their path right\nIf we if we get a if we get a two thousand and eight or we get a decade of of no returns like twenty two thousand two thousand pin their players not going to work they're either going to have to seriously cut spending go back to work or run out of money yes and so\nWe want to create certainty and peace of mind for people and give 'em a belt\nIn suspenders right and that's what our process does if you'd like to make sure that your retirement plan has a belt and suspenders we're happy to sit down with you and show you how to do that\nAnd yes we're having a good time here but we take this very seriously because look once you retire you've got all the money you're ever going to have and you've got to

eight zero zero zero six one of the first time caller is right now\nWould advise we services offered only do we just are individuals to eat well management Elsie W women freedom financial group are not affiliated companies [noise]\nHey we're back we're going to talk about irreversible decisions now and and in retirement planning and in life I guess but in retirement plan and there's plenty of decisions that\nThat you'll make in retirement planning that sometimes those things can't be on ... and so you really want to make the right call the first time and and really be working with some and who who knows how to look through all of those things so\nThe first one that I think is a big when I see a lot a whole lot nothing ... do you do too but is the Social Security decision about when to take Social Security and it's all over the map and people have all these different ideas and send those they're just doing what somebody else did or some family member dead but\nBut I just think about this if you start your benefit at sixty to the earliest days you can take it\nThen it's sixty six or ... may you may be starting to think about it like I didn't know if there's going to have to pull this much out of my nest egg to supplement that small Social Security payment maybe I took it to sent maybe I made a short sighted decision and\nSo so just one thing to let people know is that every year you delay from sixty two until Seventy your payments gonna go up by eight percent a year so from sixty to to full retirement age depending on when you were born for retirement age is between sixty six sixty seven\nYou could see a twenty five to thirty percent increase between sixty two in Seventy it'll go up fifty percent\nRight and so why is this important this is important because this answers the big question will my money last yeah I mean huge huge decision here and people take this decision so lightly they don't they don't have an analyzed and I looked at it but I mean this literally answers that question will my money left\nYou know what I I Would say this I I don't think people take it lightly I think they're not sure how to figure it out yeah and they don't know anybody that knows how to figure it out\nThe ... decision as important as huge just like the Social Security decision is huge because I've got many stories about this topic in particular but we have a current family that we help now at still hear\nThe they came in five years ago six years ago something like that okay um he had already elected a benefit for his pension that was just ... nothing left behind for the spouse okay nothing left behind for the wife couch because\nHe's much healthier than her um she was a couple of years older than him but just to [noise]\nUm and that she was more unhealthy so okay yes she had some health issues and that they both agreed they both agreed they made the decision together that there is no way she'll ever outlive him and this is the best decision possible for them\nSo they'd already elected the Social Security decisions and they'd already elected to her Social Security was very very small her her ... her piece of has a very small guy\nAnd then so they had great income while they were both here\nAbsolutely great income [noise]\nUm unfortunately about a year and a half less than two years later\nHe passed away and but he came in first and was saying we made these decisions because we know this is going to happen and and you know I'm going out with her and this is going to be fine and we don't really need to\nThink about those things we want to think about some other things and plan for some other things and and I think Ted you're the one that kind of sat down with him and said All right here's here's the impact if that doesn't happen\nIf you go before she does she will lose Seventy five percent of the income coming in the door right now so I'm Seventy five percent that's a huge difference and so you know he looked at you and said you know what okay well then what is the house shut off access how would you fix this if you or me\nAnd we were able to put a plan together for them where it didn't impact anything else they wanted to do it didn't change anything they were doing what they were both here it literally was like something in the background a plan B if you will have to know it was a point yeah safety net in case this didn't go the way they both assumed that it would go\nAnd it didn't go the way they thought it was going down to less than two years later he passed away in his sleep I don't know what happened don't know why it happened it was unfortunate she's still here she's still a client today\nAnd um you know she's not in the best to health so it's costing some money um but it's a good thing but it is a huge for her I mean it literally I don't know what they ... what would she have done I don't mean I I don't even know it would have been completely devastating not just a mostly the financially per\nYear and so there are strategies where we can uh where we can set aside money today and target a specific amount of income in the in the future\n... will continue to increase while you're waiting yeah fact it will go up by you know depending on the strategy eight percent a year\nTitle why Social Security exactly so you know it's a it's a function of water you trying to accomplish with which dollar now what problem are we trying to solve so in that case that's that's a good when we you know we're talking about pensions and the reason that this was important your
