I I notice I think twelve meal of the lowest to a millimeter um\nAnd then it's high I Know that I've seen that commercial break and go as high as ... I guess what's good for residential\n... tell me how uh where's it going again and how many people in the household and all that uh\nThere were five of us all I'd like to put it in our basement and um 'cause I'm redoing our basements while at like the pull up the um\nThe laminate down okay go with that it will be the so it's five of us in the house um it'll be more for recreational use down there and then the master bathroom where my wife and I and then again\nI'm\nSo normally I wouldn't go anything less than twelve meal a day\nThat that that's number one I I kinda liked the commercial grades in high traffic area is\nUm is especially like uh you know maybe like a basement recreation area um again the inexpensive stuff in there like every product line there there's junk out there and you start getting into you know even four five six meal and you started sliding a refrigerator\nOver or something you're gonna have problems with the separation on it so\nIt is middle do or that\nWay so I don't have time for coal wedding ... oh yeah yup\nAnd use it you spray it on the next couple of weeks you'll be absolutely fine\nOh okay and what kind of fear here that you say\nWell the sealer you want to make sure you get a good breed the bull sealer so again we're always recommended one called a brand name is masonry defender and then put the driveway and sidewalks sealer\n... okay thank you very\nVery good thank you take care and that's a good project it really is this time of year perfect and get it down and it's going to take you know five six weeks it'll start to light and and then all of a sudden\nIt's [laughter] ... story I did this on my driveway per se I did it in the springtime and um it was all kind of a black T shirt\nAnd I was sprayed the wedding forget on it and it is funny outta sight outta mind it's not like I was obsessed with it where I kept going out every three days and looking at it but\nI didn't at all actually and uh about two or three months went by and I just pulling in the driveway one down and went [noise]\n[noise] that's all gone [laughter] I mean and that is the way it works it just ... is all gone and it takes the sunlight the rain and everything else to get rid of it but it'll work quite nicely Kay welcome\nHigh on to crash I every time we get a really heavy rain I have water thinking in tonight tend to block wall in one corner basement crawl space and then I get these really late fall over to match that down the drain\nOn anything I can give to stop it from coming in\n... so I didn't hear the part that comes over and falls into the drought\nBut yeah it's a crowd at four feet at any static finance floor in there it's very clean\nAnd but I can kind of looking at the block with a flashlight I can see their stance on it flying now that's where it's coming in and then you get all the time the concrete floor of the crawl space and then it gets over the edge of the crowd space on the regular flowing down the drain so\nYou will just keep water from getting into the crawl space reserved some bumps in the crawl space\nAnd now I don't need when a kid like little teeny raking that but there are I don't know what a ... if you pour a glass of water on something and it had like a couple of little rivers coming down rather than in ...\nOkay um well to stop water from coming you got to give it a pass the path of least resistance so right now the path of least resistance is going through that wall and you have excess of water now is it coming through the walls are coming up we're the floor in the wall beat\nA wall authentic lockout K. so is there a got her on that side on the outside yeah everywhere and they're not clogged now and the down spouse where do they empty\nUh there's one in that corner and it goes underground\nAnd ... are you sure that's free flowing all the way in removing all that water away from the house\nI think they make it I can think\nWell that's what I Want you to check\n'em because you know it it didn't leak before something changed\nAnd are actually like had bought the have fate you pick out okay\nSo houses so there's there's three things that are causing the water and there it's either the gutters the ground water or the grading on the outside the house so we got to make sure they're all functioning to start with the gutters make sure they're you know free flowing in all cleared out\nUnless you're going out there during a rainstorm with an umbrella and watching where the water from that down spouse exit out that pipe I can assure you don't know if it's free flowing or not\nSo next time it rains that's what you need to do the second thing is you want to make sure that the soil is slope away from the house gay\nOr you know we have the overhang of passing the overhang tense at Stanford on the show the here and there is always try I have to water it\n... yeah uh-huh and and is there any tips or ... or anything how ... how about the pipes going around that house [noise] [noise] I'm leaving water\nYeah we have a tentative go their finger former [laughter] get going down that corner that it\nOutright PVC pipe and there I Know [noise]\nIt looks to be unpack [noise] but is it underground knowledge with Africa\nWhat good is doing a book or I don't know [laughter] personally time on it and they are\nReally doing any good above the ground so you know there is what they call it underground French during\nA that would go around the perimeter which it moves the water away\nI'm so in just sum up I mean if you're looking for a quick cure or I don't know if there is one if you can get somebody that crawl space and put a waterproof pain on that wall like a product like dry locked that'll certainly um is seal that wall\nAnd make it more difficult for the water to get in\nA to Z crawl space itself so you'll still that wall up the question mark then becomes where does that water go and does it cause any more damage so I Would um you know if you're looking for a quick easy solution\nOr go ahead and put some luck on that wall but keep your eyes open to make sure that uh isn't coming somewhere else into that house but the three keys to getting water out of the basement I'm telling you is gutters\nGroundwater in grading they're called the killer jeez so you're kind of telling me all those are just fine and you still have that problem so maybe sealed up with some dry lock and uh hopefully that'll take care of the problem if it's a simple easy to solve problems maybe it will [noise] All right\nThanks much for the call okay I appreciate it\nUh one of my all time favorite products courses jaws you hear me talk about it all the time it's a just add water cleaning system they got a glass clear that is outstanding is street free you can

justice Fox is Jared how far is live on Capitol Hill\nHe has the votes but opponents of Brett Kavanaugh are not letting up\nSo it really never came off or whatever okay okay so that one of those trends are wondering\nWhat is going on we have an irrigation system if I may be that what it was hitting that tired of the house would probably help that yeah so we quit briefing on that side and uh just don't know well [laughter] [laughter]\nYeah yeah I hear ya it does um so it is up for us and so I'm sure there is salts in masonry products of bricks the mortar between the bricks\nAnd when that becomes compromised and um get sweat a lot that's how it becomes compromise those salts begin to bloom\nAnd they started out as white shadows and they can actually get to a point\nWhere literally looks like table salt on the surface of the brick\nAnd um you know I'm sure what the folks soul Jew a is an F ... remover I I Can't tell you why would not work I can tell you however when you use an F ... remover\nUm it will remove the F ... but that doesn't mean it's not going to come back\nThe other ... there's some deterioration taken place in there's moisture outside and it will continue to be a challenge to keep that off but once you use a cleaner it should be clean for a while so that part\nI don't understand um you know one of the products I mentioned for this as quick creek makes a product called a fluorescence in rushed remover\nA knee and it requires an application requires some scrubbing rinsing et cetera and then I Would get a brick sealer on there to minimize the amount of water penetration that can get into the brick and get into the border so it\nSlow the process of the F ... blooming so you know that's that's my story ... but I don't know why the other stuff lemon juice isn't strong enough\nBut uh if he got rotted she went to a brick company I'm sure they saw who and a fluorescence remover in I I don't know if they did why that didn't work and let's sit right are heated applications did you check back with them and expressed why that didn't work or followed all the directions and everything [noise]\nWell I'm going to go back to them that lever road listening to even try not to call it maybe yeah oh yeah I'm\nJust guessing they sold you a product that that that would work I you know I don't know why wouldn't work but again it's a long term\nUm ... it's a long term problem Mary and that's just kind of really what I wanted to emphasize you'll clean it off and I would get at a brick sealed\nBrick sailor yes mhm that we need to get it off first but you got to get it off ...\n... ... but okay they can't get along and um [noise]\nWe've power wise but then we're told we how or why\nRyan power wash it actually exacerbate the problem because you're putting water that you're kind of force and into that brick\nOkay so that\nSo you know again you can check out that quick create a fluorescence remover read application you know instructions follow him to the letter of the law and then get a good missionary brick sealer on that house and that'll slow down the process\n[noise] okay what what's your name again quote quick create have fluorescent scene and rust remover a stream of and learning and get that\nI'm Home Depot Lowe's some you can get it on line to\nOr not yeah my my ... and I guess it might be it might be I mean it's good to Home Depot and it's a good go to product [noise]\nOkay I'll Try that\nYep just to make sure we read those directions thoroughly [noise]\nMake sure we follow the entire process of how it should be done because it it'll work it may require a second application and again I don't really know what the what they ah um you know soldiers but I'm assuming it would be a product of mild acid that would\nPotentially move that eh fluorescence of followed\nA correctly or what other thing too is I I talked about a brick and masonry sealer I talk a lot about\nUm a website called masonry defender dot com and they make a again a breed the bowl and that's what you need breed the ... case moisture is behind that brick that it can breathe that moisture through\nUh the surface so and then minimize

dorm owners where you don't really know where the sources from mhm and it makes it go away it's not going to leave a forum lilac you know try right now just kind of freshmen\nThey evidently they discovered that long before I did but my boards are rotting maybe ten at a time I have about fourteen hundred square foot deck\nAnd so this is regular pressure treated would correct\nYes sir outweighs the lifetime warranty still Kay All right um and they don't\nGive me a really hard time about it they just require an incredible amount of documentation but what I was calling you about is have you heard a lot of people a\nVoice in his ... ... ... ... ... it's the cellulose in the woods teary rates and that would actually rush not on the surface what from the inside out I mean you could there's the board finally kicks in and does is you can put your foot through\nYeah um I just wanted to make sure this is this is not a composite decorating fluidly no it's okay it's what yeah I've had a few calls but I Can't say that I've had a lot of calls I've had more\nAbout the composite than than I have the pressure treated wood but the whole industry as a whole and I'm sure you realize this and found that out\nIn your researching it wasn't just one company as the entire\nIndustry when they went from cc a treated wood to the AC cute to then other formulations\nThere were issues there were issues with the AC you\nI'm with the um rusting of the\nActual joins hangers an actual nails and screws exact and then they went into these other ones and the the the different types I mean everybody's using different formulations and they weren't but but I Can't say that it is a massive problem at least that is touched me\nWell I can see from my standpoint it's actually I Can't call it a massive problem it's a ... so aggravating because as I replaced boards\nIt's so hard that you know you see an individual board and my deck is probably dying ten twenty percent at a time\nYeah well it's a massive problem if it's happening to you well\nYeah but I my decision has to be whether I keep fiction replace it in the Borgias they go bad or tear the whole thing up and spend a huge amount of money to put something else though so anyway I just was concerned if you've heard that I had a few\nCalls and I have heard of it and when I said massive I mean I'm not getting calls every week about it um but let's\nSay it is out there um yeah I get it then I get the whole uh you know do I do I bite the bullet now or do I just keep letting it may mean just doing a little bit of time I totally understand that\nThe other thing I wouldn't I'd like to share with your listeners is is that one of the documentation things on these boards it's\nNot the stamp the stamp on the board that only tells them where the lumber may process right but the sticker on the end that little stapled on usually a plastic stick or the or if they're going to put down their boards pull a couple of those off stick them in an envelope Ryan save them\nBecause that's the that's the crucial part of proving or your words were processed\nAnd anguish buying houses process that exactly what interests us and who saves those labels huh\nYou can't walk exactly I actually was fortunate that one peeling up some of my bed boards I found a couple of those into joining early said my ...\nAnd I hear ya I don't think I Would have saved them an oral actually ride in you know even to this day Jim I'll just taken a step further because we just try to educate people the best we can um we went through a process just a three or four years ago\nWhere in processing they started this thing called ground contact and non ground contact pressure treated wood and I stated on here numerous times\nYou can have a deck that's twelve feet up in the air and if you got trees around it and wet leaves fall on it it's the same as ground contact\nAnd ... do you got to use the ground contact pressure treated would all the time in my book and now after four years we're starting to see some of the big box stores the lumber yours figured is a long time ago\nUh but you know it's all about price in the big box stores and they now some of 'em are just carrying just the ground contact thank God because\nShe says makes perfect sense yeah exactly well I don't know if\nYou want to hear a quick version of this but you know if any of your\nFolks have been to Stockholm, Sweden uh-huh disk they discovered the ship was ... was discovered in the Nineteen nineties or late eighties and it was a ship built\nBy the king of who you know what warship he went down to the architects office after they get laid the keel for this thing and he said wait a minute you've only got one deck on the ship I Want to ...\nThe architect should know your your majesty we can only do one gun deck because that's the way the ship design that he said hey I'm the king I Want to go back so\nYou know he's the king [laughter] so they built the ship with two ... actually launched the ship bands played one old and it it drifted out into the harbor and a little breeze came up the ship flipped upside down and went to the bottom\nAnd they discovered it a couple of hundred years later the buildup museum so that ... is in a museum in Stockholm harbor was a result of this the the Swedes who got me sleeping lumber people their whole life\nAre probably the foremost uh in this whole idea would preservation mhm and those are the guys they're the best stuff already on what happens to cellulose into would have made some pretty ... I imagine the discoveries they've made probably which kind of leading the industry that day and stuff\nBut I Will keep us postage him on um how your uh\nTrials and tribulations or proceed thank you much for the call and uh we will\nWrap up another our men Thomas like hey you want something that really last put on your home I'm so envious of this metal roofing [noise] boy if you're getting ready for a roof and you're going to be in that house for a while I Want you just consider a metal roof\nIt's a and they say second most preferred type I guess if it wasn't for the little ... cost it would be the most preferred site because it's low maintenance it looks great and then he comes with a light\nTime Warner sheet metal roofing dot com you can learn all about metal roofing looked at some of the beautiful architectural features of metal roofing again this metal roof conduct out All right a break and back to you you're at home with Gary Solis [noise]\nAnd you have questions give area call I'd won eight hundred eighty two three talk he's at home with Gary television\nNews radio nine sixty W.

L. dot com for news\nShe says it got to be more judge was in the room was playing the music loudly running interference for Kavanaugh mark judge says wasn't there no idea what you're talking about\nHer her very good friend Leighton somebody a girl said I have absolutely no recollection of that ever happening and I don't think I've ever met Brett Kavanaugh\nAnybody and everybody else but she said was that the party has refuted the claim well Christine Blasey Ford testify in front of his panel the Senate Judiciary committee\n\nAnd leaving their left and right middle everybody's orange incredible credible witness credible which is actually on true she's not credible she might be believable that she really is\nWhere she really does believe that she's a victim and something really did happen to her but it is incredible that it was Brett Kavanaugh and it's simple to to go down logically as to why\nShe doesn't know when it happened not even a year doesn't know where it happened not even the neighborhood doesn't know whose house it was doesn't know how she got to the party doesn't know how she left the party\nShe's been incorrect about everybody she says was that the party and she's actually given a couple of different numbers as to how many people were at the party\nBrett Kavanaugh on the other hand\nHas everybody corroborating his story and he's got to a calendar that shows what he was doing every weekend and every weekday basically in Nineteen eighty two or whatever it was\n\nSo as much as she might have been believable that something happened to her and I hope she can smell the bees and hope the person who did it is brought to justice but it was not credible her allegations against this guy specifically\nAnd that to a point ability Asia and that the the legacy media didn't want to have legacy media didn't want to say well she's credible as somebody who probably had something happened to her but it is not credible what she's saying about Brecht cabinet the legacy media didn't do its job and then a report that correctly\nThe second accusation which I'm a woman named Deborah Ramirez who says that at a party\nThey were playing some game\nThat I don't know it was due to spin the bottle or it it was a quarter as if they were playing something to where if you lost you had to drink and they were purposely making her drink and got her so drunk or you're gonna remember anything and then uh she's told\nBrett Kavanaugh put her but his member are pulled pulled it out and put it in near her face\nThat she admittedly doesn't remember it\nAnd when Democrats staffers from the Democrat senators that are on the panel calls are contacted her she spent six days calling old friends asking headed something happened to me\nYou remember anything happened to me and nobody remembers anything\nBut after six days you decided yeah I I guess it did happen I wasn't I wasn't sure but yeah I I Am now you did it I don't remember him doing it but I remember people telling me that he did it to his cabinet are set up with no there was anything like that what are you talking about\nThe third one\nIs from slime ball lawyer ... it was really sweating ec who says that for three years Brett Kavanaugh mark judge worthy organizers of parties where there would be trains are boys part taking in gang rape\nKavanaugh and judge she said would spike the punch with grain alcohol\nAnd quail moods\nShe knew this was going on but she was smart enough to not drink the punch then one day and this happened between Nineteen eighty one Nineteen eighty three she said but one day a one party joins ten of them\nIn our community to she somehow was the victim and was gang raped will continue to go into the parties for another full year\nAnd instead of calling the police which she said was just don't drink the punch she changed her story to NBC News at least once\nNBC News instead of saying we can't run this because she's not viable not credible not believable that ran it anyway and then said it's important to note that the stories you're saying today is different or there are differences from the stories you originally told us her story has changed a bunch of times in her history comes out especially somebody that makes you got about allegations all the time\nSo completely not credible\nBut that didn't matter to grow because Booker and that didn't matter to lay he that didn't matter to Feinstein that didn't matter to ... they didn't didn't matter to Kamala Harris it didn't matter to any of these people\n\nHe was he's guilty Cory Booker grow because you know it causes all Spartacus but he's admitted Grover what are your Fifteen he grow up to a girl he he admits that he's a senator somehow he actually said at this point it doesn't matter if he was guilty or innocent\nCory Booker said that and he made that\nDoesn't matter if judge Kavanaugh's guilty or innocent at this point well that I Believe galvanize this as a people we said vaccination\nFair due process of this in this country is guaranteed you are innocent until proven guilty and if that's the threshold than it is\nThen he's innocent nothing any of these women\nHas said or the the the slimy lawyer has said or the far left wing resist lawyer cats who is a lawyer for Ford nothing they've said\nHas proven anything\nAll you have is Deborah bureaus completely uncorroborated in fact refuted by people Julie sweating there just seems to be a ... from outer space story she's given\nAnd of course the Ford only vase say something happened everybody else named and the FBI spent five days\nSix days interviewing many more people who didn't come to the Bush has offered up evidence that there is no corroboration there is nothing more here\n\nYet the left is still today go on Twitter read your favorite website they still today have these paid protesters showing up in the Senate halls\n... ... people which means are putting out their information their their phone numbers or address is\n... it's a\nA violent crew of idiots better still just completely disconnected from the rest of us\nMelissa mulatto is your spokesperson Amy Schumer is your

their trying their best\nTo change the best although flawed system judicial system on earth to to being Saudi Arabia or something or China\nOh man\nSo Brett Kavanaugh and again as I Do a show it's not happened yet but I assume that he will be confirmed later today there are a couple of things that could happen\nBetween now and then and and yes we've got to talk about Lisa Murkowski who is a an

confirmation process has been disgusting it really has been enrolled it all started with Diane Feinstein sitting on this letter that she had for two months you realize that Dianne Feinstein the ranking member of the ... member of phones then you realize that she had this letter\nEven when she was talking to Brett Kavanaugh privately in her office didn't say a word had the letter when she was questioning Brett Kavanaugh I'm In the open hearing didn't say a word\nWhen it looked as though Brett Kavanaugh was going to be fast track because he's easily qualified for this job then suddenly somebody in her office or some lawyers somebody leaked the fact that there was a letter and with the woman's name was\nMatter what you think of course the gloves before she was a victim your two of the left politics eight hundred and five zero one Seventy eighty let me go to the phone line to see where you are on this because we're either a country divided or were country galvanized I think this was just\nAn absolute practice\nIn futility for the left and I think that it probably served to motivate those on the right I think you'll see a lot more conservatives and Republicans now go to and even centuries that lean right go to the polls for the midterm whereas they might have said sat at home before I think the Republicans will gain two or three seats\nIn the Senate and we'll keep control of that body it's still going to be very close in the house but it'd be a better chance now because now the bases riled up\nThis was a really bad miscalculation by the left in this country the political left let me go to the phone lines and he'd say hello to uh Roger who's in Spokane Roger what's going on high\nIn line and go hey I think clay clay is appropriate name thank you and who\nWere

together and that he truly representative and not\nGetting this crap and and get very disappointed in the whole ... thing that we have and needs to be elected in ... the ... court justice\nRoger I think it's a very good point the Republicans were very weak in the beginning venture for the call by the way I'm very weak in the beginning they just they wanted to keep decorum they wanted to keep it all up and up and I and I can appreciate that but when the hearings started let's go back to that a month ago\nAs students grassy started speaking Kamala Harris interrupted him rudely you all this fake outrage about how cabinet interrupted Feinstein and some others because he was fighting for his political and personal life and for his family\nKamala Harris purposely interrupted him Cory Booker purposely interrupted him\nI think ... started there were ... ... it was it was set up that you had protesters that\nThere are some pictures out there that suggests they were getting paid to go to the chamber and protest so all this they got rage about bread cabin on it and his ... and his temperament is that it's all BS\nBut I agree with you the Republicans a grassy I think that in the end they did it the right way but as that was going on hey wait a second elections have consequences we won were in charge of the city I Will clear this room would be given interrupting than it would ... would proper protocol is\nWhen they were breaking it on purpose us they really thought they're putting on a show which somehow window for them he turned out it made them look like idiots will be it used to

getting worse ... about a month or just getting worse and worse and they try to take this man down it gets\nVery frustrating or the other thing is I Can't understand how anybody could think that Corning praying or at a man next and guilty\nAnd you got to listen to both sides if that's true but that's why the court case and I just I get off of what they're trying to do to Brett Kavanaugh because that guy obviously has a lot of classic that very well rounded young man I call and young because I'm sixty six I'm over the hill\nBut ice age he he's just a great guy and I hate to think that people think that our justice system is going to come down to just pointing the finger and you're automatically guilty of due process in this country now understand that that's what makes this country

I'm with you but but you you and I both know that the the left said well here's what we're going to do with was before no matter what she says the word we are going to use as credible to everybody that we talked to and we're going to force them to repeat credible because then the the watching and listening public will will agree\nBut she was credible but around with you and I and I said there's really on me I Believe that maybe she was a victim of something or survivor or something I don't think anything she said about Brett Kavanaugh was in fact credible in fact that was the wrong uses your bed words and that's where I was I mean and I was attacked because I said that what so what I mean I saw when I saw or heard what I heard\nAnd even her best friend doesn't corroborate that tells me something\nWell and and I was meal in a way it's how much I have personally been attacked\nBy or there's survivor's all the victims\nBecause they've allowed it to victimize that likes me away as I had a guy friends that I grew up with that I Can't\nBelieve with your history that fully her I wouldn't be doing a complete disservice if I get\nI I agree we we have to run great phone call I appreciate you taking the time we've asked somebody who really gets it we come back we'll be Donald Trump junior here on the weekends bigger [noise]\nNews radio nine sixty W.

know ... it's been so Bogle he'd been so tough on it and and it was time you know you you see the nonsense that is going on you said it on the reality is that there's no one that could have accomplished what he's been able to do that no one that you know with so few that ever signed the front of a paycheck\nSo few that had ever you know in our whole political system that had ever had their someone's family some of the livelihood their safety and wellbeing of their kids and grandkids dependent on their success he'd actually done it I mean\nThat was the big laugh I had last week

I mean ice only save nine hundred kids last year from you know a sex trafficking but there are terrible we should get rid of them I mean these people are insane and so we have to get out we have to stay motivated we have to bring our friends\nAnd you can't buy into the media stuff just look at what's going on in your business is look at what's going on your place of work looking your paycheck I mean you're winning with these policies these policies are moving the needle these policies are making a difference in America's getting respect again because we're not going to let little third world countries push us around and slap us around\nYou know I gained ... and we have\nTo remember that because they can all go away in November\nAnd people need to realize that it's Donald Trump junior and I appreciate the access let's talk about taxes I actually don't based in San Antonio Fifteen stations in Texas we've got a hundred twelve around the country but we focus now on taxes because there's been a real challenge Robert fruits as a war because what I call these somehow cold really appropriating but he's Hispanic but he's\nNot he's not at all Hispanics and he'll pretend he is for the road but that's a democratic ... you can get away by the way if Ted Cruz did something like that now he happens to actually be Hispanic swimming but if it's something like that they would destroy ... absolutely you you you were going to get out of every day for better or\nIt's not a problem when he said something about what was the voluptuous breast or whatever that that's not a problem that only one day story of Ted Cruz did that it it would be you know he shouldn't be disbarred he should be you know write it killed ... we're not fighting a fair fight and there's down ticket races that are dependent on this thing\nHas been great for Texas He's done he's fought for those values I look at the ... platform and like I said I mean this is in New York City mayoral candidate running for senator in Texas\nWell he's getting big support from Ellen so you know that's\nGood it was like oh this is Donald Trump junior so you're in Texas you got Ted Cruz who I've known for ... wait longer than he's been a senator and he's always made promises that he's always done exactly what he said he would do what is your dad and then went out in the primaries but\nThere are very very similar politically in that they're not doing it politically based say I'm going to do this this this ... and you're dead and Ted actually believe I should do those things I promise beat her it was just given as you know a rainbows and puppy dogs it's weird well\nOf course I listen I I really respect that I mean it was it was a brutal primary\nAnd a little story I don't know if I'd actually even said this publicly ... you know a couple of weeks after that and it was a brutal primary there was a big ... a a dinner in DC you know the usual you know this stuff I I went and all my friends are from Texas I'm there all the time hunting fishing or raised a lot of money there and campaign down in Texas I'm sitting there at the Texas table and a couple of friends\nTests at the table and we actually have a great dinner good conversation at the end of the dinner and we say hey you know we're going back to the Trump Hotel right in the middle of the AC on Pennsylvania Avenue we're gonna have a couple of drinks hanging out whatever you want to come along\nIt came with us and that and the Trump Hotel we had a great time for three hours knows\nThat got you know but you know when I showed me beyond the guts is he understood Donald Trump's going to be president and he was going to help support policies that he believed in that we're going to be good for America and they were going to be good for tax and he was able to put all of that aside and now they have a great relationship\nBecause they're doing what's right for their constituencies and that was impressive to me that was a great\nA testament to his character and everything and I don't think I've ever told that story before but I think it's actually relevant huh because you're doing what's right for your constituency and I don't see that everywhere else I mean they can look at where bagel rocks money is probably coming from that probably doesn't represent the average guy in Texas right now that\nIt's probably represent the average guy in Hollywood studio somewhere else you know that's\nThe difference and I don't want Texas to become California\nAt Texas a I mean just look at the economic success if it had to look at all this debt but you want to become California give me a ...\nAnd the people from California bringing their politics but that doesn't make any sense to me it's a it's Donald Trump junior up you have an opinion as to why anybody would listen to I'm going to take away your tax cut ...
