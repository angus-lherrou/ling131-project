right now are trying to pick out some of the more things and as a quick\nOh yeah my wife is really interested I'm right now our kitchen it it'd be a white catch and and she won a apron farm think uh-huh and then\nWe're trying to figure out what that material is cause I Know there's you know several out there but they're trying to figure out what you ask them what's going to be the most terrible\nFrom ... so the question so what are you looking at like a glazed porcelain and then a composite that type of thing [noise]\nUm [noise] yeah and she also looked up the cast iron where a month or so when the name on it now as well [noise] [noise]\nYeah well if you had a I don't I I you know what I haven't really done a research is saying this as best I think one of the things I kinda like right now it's kind of the composites only I mean the\nCast iron I mean let's face it the cast aren't poor since ... been around for hundreds of years right\nI mean they're pretty drew role but you know if for whatever reason we drop a big old iron skillet they have a tendency to chip\nA composite it a composite I think is a little bit I'm less likely to be damage to but I haven't really dove into it to really compare that to have you looked at the composite yet or not\nI'm a little bit here and they are but I mean we just kind of started within the law\nThey have All right well those are the two main ones that I Know a ... in terms of their ability and that's the two I guess I Would investigate further I I\nDon't think you can go wrong with either but porcelain ... dust chip I mean but you and let me put that in context to soldiers granted\nYou know and then they can both be repaired but I I just kind of get some uh\nFolks that are selling both um you know get to a a Ferguson cut ... kitchen and Beth show room and and give it to people that are ... both of them all the time to get their take on it and there may be something and I'm not even aware of ... to be honest with you to\nThose big farm sinks are beautiful and they they are trendy right now [noise]\nYeah yeah and they are All right my friend daycare thanks\nBye bye and if if you're listening and you have some take on a love to love to hear from you too so feel free to jump on board and mark welcome\n... very long time listener thank you\nI got a two problems here in the same area uh let me give me a little background first ah this is for a church sanctuary where we had a slam problem okay\nStarted where we had a pipe or should we had to replace the carpet will replace the carpet we found that the swam in one area had a reason not to to fight breaking\nUp but it was a difference of one inch between one trap and the other\nSome other great system we're on the outside and that seems to be working we did finish that July and it's a lab is or buy happiness but not as only half an inch change in elevation\nThe first one I Want to know is what you're suggesting is on fixing that slab of looking at things want us to just grind it down so that you got an either so\nBetween the two ... and the second is to kind of a a section out a Fifteen inch section is about\nForty foot long area that we got this problem in and cut back section out in in a slope down from one slap to the other they're so both of them will end up looking the same but they're two different methods\nIn terms of cost a big difference I guess between grinding and then I'm cutting the whole sleigh about reporting and sloping correct\n[noise] uh I haven't really priced him out yet I I I did get a little price one time on on the cutting them out some guy did not get a one on how you\n... your loan them know how how sick is this lab lab is five inch by inch\nSo really grinding a half inch shouldn't you know create any a issue with the\nUm integrity of the slap itself I'm you know I mean to fix it permanently I guess I'm kind of liked the idea of grinding it out or not greening up but actually cutting it out and replace him put a little slow but\nIf we got five in slab I think it's going to be a lot cheaper to grind it probably focus on going that\nWay okay if you cut it out with your pin it with you\nYeah you have to [noise] you would have to look at a construction joint oh\nI really look at time trying to grind it I really would either store one time it was all ... lab and we had an area because they poured concrete when it was like Fifteen below zero\nAnd so it's going to be you know paint you get ultimate protection solid color staying you get fairly great protection dark color ... parents you get a pretty good protection when you get down to clear it is it's weak in terms of protection [noise]\nMm [noise] but it's a little if you want so you got to decide if that's the look you want you're probably going to put that on there every couple of years or so\nYeah okay and it it's called the FAA\nDefied D. E. F. Y. you'll use their debt cleaner or oxygen needed bleach is what it is and you clean that up real good and then they have a deck brighten or\nI Would use that a jak bright and re stores that would to kind of it's natural color and what it really does is it opens up the pores in the wood\nAnd that enables that that ... that clear sealer to be sucked deeper into the woods causing it better protection\nYeah OK okay alright ... All right ... thank you my ...\nYeah the clear is the weakest of any brands before you even get into the brands I mean you get into kind of the good type ... cleaner or ... and you get a clear six months to a year and a sunny area that's it so that's okay\nYou just got to know that you're going to re apply every year you're getting clean it\nAnd re apply every year and if you're using ... that's a built in ... so it's not like you're stripping it sanding it or do you know anything along those lines you just re apply and another vote\nBut that clear [noise] it just doesn't hold up to the sun in anybody's brand\nIt's the weakest link but you can use it you just gotta ... Jeff welcome [noise]\nHey Gary how are ya I got a question to question for you and I first I have a large would shake shingle roof\nAnd it is starting to get a lot of loss build up at the end of the shape okay and so I'm Wondering what I can do about that to prevent ... second\nIn some of these Cher rancho rain that we've seen this summer I'm getting you know the water that's going over the guys are and it has\nFallen down on them I damp concrete deck and I'm getting some of the mosque build up there as well I think maybe from the roof mhm so to\nHype and power washing that but uh it seems like there's gotta be something that I can do to coded that might\nPrevent it from building up the way it is I'm just yeah\nYeah well whenever we got a water you know outside we certainly got all those spores that are going to grow is actually what's growing on your roof and on your concrete so what we can do uh I guess the first thing they ask is why is it spilling over the gutters are the gutters\nUndersized do they clogged are they what's going on there [noise]\nUh [noise] you know I Am going to try something that uh [noise]\nThey got a rush thing you said I think it may be a little bit under side but it really only one we're getting those trench arrange the normal rain it doesn't happen ... do you know what size got or they are\nA fan [noise] uh I don't think I made me a orange yeah yeah\nWell minimum you'd want on your house is a five and then for five is spilling over probably a six a the go to brush does a good job keeping a leaf and debris out it's not going to do much for clean gutter if it's still spilling over\nUm but just keep that in the back of your mind or obviously as much water as we can keep off that slab the better it's going to um stay non moldy in non middle do so there's\nA product you hear me talking about all the time the wet and forget\nProduct [noise] um so the\nWet and forget spray they make it in a concentrate that you can put it in a spray tank or the hose in wet and forget you spray down on the cedar roof it'll get rid of the mold mildew or the moss the algae the fungus like in and everything else\nAre you spray it on and you could do the same on your stamp patio it'll probably take a anywhere this time of year four to eight weeks for to disappear but you spray it on and it just dissipates\nYou might notice it or you might not notice anything for three or four weeks but it'll kill it it'll be a complete kill it will um minimize it's re growth that will prevent it but it will minimize it\nUm you could come back on that roof and spray that every just two or three years as a maintenance spray\nYeah 'cause uh usually that stuff's growing a couple of years before you ever see it but it'll help minimize the re growth as they go ahead\nOr anything like what we get it off that I didn't put on there to protect it seems like it eating away at the shingle\nSure and it is ... and it will um so yeah there's there's certainly Steelers for cedar shingle their Steelers for your stamp concrete\nAnd the more you can get those particular a substrate sealed the less water penetration of curves a but first the first step is to get rid of the ... do\nMake sure it's all gone when you come back in the in the springtime or I Would send you to a a website called masonry\nOr they have a stamp concrete sealer I Would get it on their when we're talking about the the fly would sustain that too can be applied to the cedar Shaikh group which is it minimizes water water penetration in both the substrates\nAnd uh then you you you know they're the both of those just going to be maintenance issues [noise]\nThey're going to answer\nWould harden that would\nAnd then you could re stain or repaint\nIf you do go in that direction my recommendation would be after you use the liquid would and it just ... the existing T. one eleven is get some talking at the bottom of that open grain\nAnd even if you just smeared on with your finger if you want to paint it that's fine too that all sealed\nBut I like to use the cruelly talking just mere across the bottom of that and that are really waterproof in seal up\nThat open grain so that's an acrylic a silken ice talking for that uh another thing you can do is you can get in there and just cut off the bottom you know six inches or that bottom foot just cut removed that T. one eleven\nCut another strip that said same distance you're going to have a scene there just nail that back in and take some of the\nA clear acrylic clocking put it at the bottom of that board and also in that scene and then go ahead and paint that a shutout ah or staying that shut out whatever you want to do but make sure those seams are I'm certainly sealed and you'll eliminate the problem it's a\nAnd and so there's three ways to go ahead and take care of that problem All right sorry Bob we did have a difficult time hearing you apologize All right let's go from a Bob we'll go to Rick Rick welcome\n[noise] Hi how are you yes are fine thank you for taking my call you bet I\nI have a I have a question I uh my front porch and trench ah we had family over and and now I've got a garbage bag outside a\nOnto the concrete and apparently the grease or whatever uh soaked through the bag on to the concrete and now there's a big about three foot strained by eight inches house one after the way to get rid of that\nYeah isn't graces that what it is great from meats or what is it yeah yeah okay\nUm what have you tried to be tried like dawn liquid soap or anything along those lines\nI I did not um I was afraid to use anything to push it back and very concrete march out like [noise]\nSo um I I got to to suggestions one I feel real certain about\nThe other one with some scrub and you might get it done so when I say the dawn I'm a lot depends on how sealed or how um deep that Greece ran into that concrete which is what you read about two but Don brand the liquid so\nIf you put that on there and just you know full strength\nOr dampen a scrub brush and just really work at it and work at it and work at it and then flush it and then maybe put some more dawn on their lead set come back and really work who was a scrub brush you might remove that\nUh but it's going to take some scrub and um another option\nThere is a product called ACT cleaners are usually recommended on a petroleum based stains like\nMotor oil greasy anti freeze that type of thing ACT was actually invented in the oil fields in Oklahoma and this cleans machinery it's actually an enzyme it's a powder\nYou sprinkle it over the grease thing and it does work on on Greece from meat so that's why I asked\n'em so somebody had like a ... or a concrete patio and the Greece can on their gas grill spilled\nUm you can take this ACT cleaner sprinkle it on there it goes on it's a white powder and you just leave it alone you don't touch it and it might take three days it might take a two weeks but that enzyme will actually eat that Greece\nOut of that concrete\nAnd the white powder will just disappear also and um you know or you can get that only on the Internet and its ACT cleaners dot com\nUm but that's an option not cheap but it's a it's a wonderful product for getting rid of any type of grease stains on concrete or would surfaces\nAlright thank you very much All right good enough thank you take care of ... ...

with a great it was a time of year to do it it is yeah you want to make sure that your garage doors working right so a washing waxing that's a good first step I'm making sure that the weather seal uh that's the ceiling the bottom than touches the concrete isn't good working water it's one piece\nUm that's going to keep the water out the wind out that sort of thing\nUm and then you know\nIf your door is unreal dire need of help\nIt's okay to replace it we encourage that so yeah I got some good products out there and to me I won't have to clean up there you go I mean it's still got a lot of life in it if it's only Nineteen years old but I'm telling you we have some new designs that are worth you know\nBefore we get into the designs Justin let's let's seriously talk about the benefits as we head into the winter months\nI had last year I Can't I Can't remember last week besides last winter but I think less where it was kind of chilly we had some pretty cold well I think we got below zero in our neck of the ... days\nMy garage never got below forty degrees I kept the little you know their stuff to come in for that but I never got below forty degrees amazing in in ...\nYou think about well you know my garage what do I care about the temperature in the garage well first off when you get in your car do you want it to start up right away do you want it to be styling\nPipes doing your pipes to freeze your beer in the ... you know if you're in the garage sale has said on the bottom of sorts of things can happen and those are important things not they have a right so now but in all seriousness the ah ah pipes freezing as a real concern and there's a lot of pine earning garages\nAnd if you're having insulated garage door you're going to have far less likely probability of those those guys many years ago when I was dating\nMy ... my my my my job\nWas to insulate those pipes and that garage was old wooden door\nAnd pipes run across the ceiling man those things would freeze every year we don't really get those daycare then my job was to fall so now that I was thinking when you're talking now is probably not even a problem if you had a really good insulated ... is it different qualities of ...\nAre a yeah you can get a\nA a poly ... that's the same type of insulation and having those uh phone cuts might use guy and then there's polyurethane orange ... that's the big one yes our intel core garage doors used that polyurethane a phone and what that does is that gets in all the nooks and crannies and it's\nIt's a higher our values so it's a it's going to keep\nThe cold out the warm in better than anything so yeah that's our until the court product line and it's going to be the top of the line when it comes to insulation\nSo we always talk about the beauty adores would ears are but the real bones how effective it is and how warm it keeps your garage which in effect with and keep your house that warm that really plays that's that's a that's a key if somebody has an old steel ... or ... would door\nRight yeah it's not I mean having the ... the base of a quality insulated product is important and then the aesthetics for sure is something that we uh we definitely focusing\nI had a one of your a big dealers or bill every door on last Saturday and we're talking about yeah we're talking about getting that door ready for winter doors breaking January Man\nYeah you know one thing people don't realize is um springs need to be replaced it's you know cars when they you know there are certain things that you need to do every so many miles in a spring replacements one of those things too so in the winter\nAs the metal gets more brittle because it's cold um that's when things like that can wear out and that's that's something I Know a bill Weber and his team do you like a job or you're placing those are the spring's when there's issues there and that's something that you want to watch out\nFor you find a good good door contractor and let them do once over going into winter\nNo doubt the key is to find a a reputable dealer or a ... there is as good as they come for sure um but if you're in a different part of the country what you want to do is you want to find someone\nThat is on the you know a better Business Bureau or another thing to consider is an ID A member that's our industry so that our industry is I'm backing them\nUm and you can also go to ... pay a door dot com and you can find a dealer on our list yeah and then you can you know anyone that we have out there would be a good deal as well but that's you want to

what do you say it's eight hundred eight two three eight to five five bill welcome\nSir yes my son I have some questions about\nUh I have an older one garage door with windows ... and um I had some issues with the top ... a section of it coming all the way forward to create the female I guess one or a\nRat and also what what is the weight of the store and being replaced I don't even know how old they are\nWell [laughter] [noise]\nYou know when it when you say could be replaced or you got any idea how that would ... thirty forty years old do you think [noise]\nI I Know the house it was a Nineteen fifty four I gotta believe it's been there ...\nYeah um well ... are just there and light years apart you know it'd be a good investment for a couple of reasons bill I Would answer it this way number one is the new doors a will operate\nA perfectly they will operate quietly they will offer a huge insulation value based on what you have now um cosmetically it will be an improvement it will also return on investment\nSo those are good reasons to replace it now if you decide no I don't want to replace it sounds like at the very least you need to get a service call on there to find out why those uh\nUh panels aren't folding properly could be something as simple as a strip screwing that hinges um are just getting loose and maybe it's jutting out too far and not folding down properly but uh\nThe doors of today in the doors of yesteryear it's night and day it's like a comparing windows from fifty years ago and the you know the double insulated\nA replacement windows of

next year at home with Gary seldom [noise]\nMake sure you go do that again the live stream was on the top of your school down a bit you you'll see a section for parodies people been asking you to both my parents for a while now so I've done that is also a section for interviews a section for monologues and some some news stories on the left inside\n\nIt turns out I started new stories this morning that\nNobody one what was the mega millions\nOr was it the power with Dell one it was nobody won the billion dollar jackpot\nNow it's going to be one point six billion come into what the hell is going on one point six billion dollars can you imagine\nThat would be nuts that would be absolutely nuts\nAre let's talk about Elizabeth Warren Elizabeth Warren for decades has been claiming to be a Native American or as I like to say American indian why am I right when it comes to American indian because the individual tribes actually call themselves\nIndian tribes if it's okay for them it's okay for me she's going to be an American Indian uh Cherokee in fact\nFor admissions to schools for applications to jobs she she has been listed as the first\nWoman of color to be a professor at what Harvard or Yale or something like Harvard\n\nShe's been making this claim but there is no verification there's no proof she's never ever given any bit of evidence\nTo suggest that she is in fact an American Indian so the president like he's apt to do\nHas been name calling her because it sounds so stupid because we're both on us I think it's funny as hell\nPeople who are offended by it are very smart and don't have a sense of humor you know white Rachel does all who's white\nLike Sean King who's white\nYou know they're both pretended to be black Elizabeth Warren it seems has been pretending to be an American Indian\nWhat's your well because my cheekbones proves it no that doesn't prove anything in fact thanks though\nSo president been calling around he said do a DNA test if you could prove to be the urine Indian or give it a million dollars or your favorite charity so she I guess it really does a DNA test\nGet to the test back\nAnd gives the results of the Boston Globe which is the far left wing left is the outlet\n\nAnd they write this big story that she proved that she's Native American they say there is a there is a likelihood of up to one in thirty to chance or she's one thirty second\nNative American to as little as one one thousand twenty four ths Native American\nAnd then the Boston Globe out to four hours later updated and corrected and say well the most you could possibly be as one sixty fourth Native American and the least is one one thousand twenty fourth then when you look into\nThe actual test further it turns out there was no comparison of her DNA to DNA of American Indians\nIn fact the only comparing that was done that was even close was was South American native tribes\nAnd maybe she's got South American blood or maybe South American made of blood both the probability is one one thousand twenty fourth is this not only didn't prove that she is a Native American disprove that she's not\nOn average the average white American\nHas more Native American blood than than Elizabeth Warren\nThat's affected me making it up it's a fact she's not America in American indian she's gotten benefits for pretending that she was she just thought she was going to prove the president wrong when in fact she proved herself and it is she is so not\nAmerican indian but the Cherokee Nation is coming out and asked her to just stop now\nOr when they did bad some left wing cable news outlet called the Cherokee Nation racist or a [noise]\nCharity the Cherokee Nation is racist resolving a white woman to stop pretending to be part of their nation\nVets the world in which we live guy let that sink in\nThat any of you go through this week's thinking that lives with Warren proved to president wrong that anybody go through this week it was meant to yourselves while she really use Native American and by the way this is not a story anybody any of us didn't even care about\nExcept for the fact that it's an abuse through lying to get benefits that were meant for somebody else but nobody was talking about this nobody cared about this and Elizabeth Warren Pocahontas herself decided I'm going to go and start this whole thing up again\nAnd you ask yourself was she thinking nobody nobody was thinking about this for even a second\nYou have for some reason\nWe had to have her thrust of this in our face again why is that it had to do a a a packs

abused as a country and\nThe people have to get out there they have to get out and vote\nIt's Eric Trump to sort of a president Donald Trump you're absolutely right but as I watch these races it's very very suspect how the Democrats are running what they're saying use in races across the country you remove all the advertising is saying\nOh well what Trump gave a tax cut to his corporate buddies

I'm guessing the family got at first I'm going to actually\nDo the ... Rouge Rudy jerk reaction because as you said he didn't need for anything you could be you know playing golf every day in Scotland right now and not worry about all this political stuff but his love for country said this is my calling was my duty what was your what was your thought process when it looked like\nYour mother in law was really going to take the stuff\nHe ... he actually that all of them down and said\nI Want to do this and then two days before the famous athlete or a ... a day during dinner and that you guys need to know that they're going to come after me they're going to come after you they're going to come after all of us they will attack us they'll tell lies about it obviously it would have been hard to predict it will get to this level rose um\nBut but I I said I was a hundred percent on board and because I knew\nThat my father in law to do this job he's a businessman the is so smart when it comes to negotiating you see when he's been able to do in in so many different respects what Tara with trade um he's really great at that than I knew back then that he would be great at it um so for me it was a hundred percent and\nAgain I don't think anything prepares you for for all of this um ... it's it's it's so much bigger than any of us but that's why I think although we all get attacked on the time although the president gets attack every second of every day\nNone of us for a second one change any of this because we know that it is about the bigger picture and the future of the country and if we have to take a couple of planes and arrows here and there and the president\nOr you know take that every single day more than any of us it's totally worth it because I really think this country is headed in the right direction they get an I always tell him he's going to go down in history as one of the greatest presidents and countries ever had\nA ... roof that it's Laura Trump or her husband was there with her father in law is the president's ... back in twenty six teams of because you just said it was nowhere near I mean you expect to the media would come after the leopard come after you does but not like this\nAnd I understood it was completely unexpected he said no I Know that they would probably go hard on me probably go dirty on me but aren't a lot of friends in the media you told me I made millions and millions of dollars for NBC on The Apprentice for thirty or forty years the media actually treated me very well and wanted me to the newspaper on the television and radio show\nSo he didn't know that it would get to this extreme you've been in the media for a long time I've been to newsrooms for a long time as well yesterday le left but I didn't know was going to be like this\nSo what what it was when was the realization for you in the family that this was way worse than we thought it was going to be\nWell I was actually still for a portion of the campaign working at my former job in television and\nI ... it became very frustrating for me to to work there because\nI Would be all different nations but sometimes ours including um the way that they would find things in and say hey that's not what he said you know what he said um that that was it it it was a very clear wind to me that I don't didn't think that I was going to be able to work there for for\nForever if you know he became president wrote but um but certainly after they started attacking all of us personally and you know when I was pregnant and they they attacked\nMy unborn child needs to make this talk about it is it is\nSo crazy but again I think it's because they knew before that I'm trying to McCain president that if he got in there there was no turning back that he was all business and he was really going to be looking out for the American people and their own way of life was going to come to an end so\nUm I have to say that it's it's just another sign that he's doing a great jobs\nYou know I Would agree with you you guys were you have the ... of any family members you and my wife is Laura Trump's ear because her husband her father in law of course is the president of the United states we've got we've got social races now that are starting to lean writes the midterms are starting to look better in the Senate for Republicans although I can say that it doesn't mean anything most people don't vote\nIn Texas where I should go Ted Cruz being told that he was doing an incredible job in working with your debt with your brother in law a very well know although it was rough on the campaign trail who's being Jones from a guy by a guy who's basically Obama\nAre saying you know we can work together yeah one one undivided touches but under the surface those you know these are far left wing socialist disco ward you look at places like Michigan were Debbie ... been there for three decades and it's time for her to do now and you've got a guy named John James who might actually be able to get\nThat show it to real seat this really used gonna come down to whether we can motivate people who believe in what they see happening now in the country to get off the ... you can go vote for him is really what it is isn't it\nOh absolutely well as I speak to you right now I'm In Minnesota not traveling estate campaigning I Will be in your neck of the woods in Texas on Monday youthful I Will be onto your day ironically in Michigan um ... it's so so important we we know that\nThe president has done incredible things already and that's what a lot of people against and even people on his own party sometimes money and get them ... think about what could happen\nHe had a cohesive unit of people behind him that voted alongside the president and and really pushes agenda forward we can be so much more progress in the country and by the way\nI Know we talk about socialism if anybody has any question about what socialism look like look in Venezuela right now that could become the United states of America if we let people like or or take over and and put his agenda forward it's really very frightening\nSocialism has never worked in fact that the Democrats are embracing people like that since shock everybody to a degree that you knew not only are going to get out and vote in the midterms but you're going to take everyone in your neighborhood and everyone in your family to go vote\nUm it it's very serious and I know that it felt like a fight in twenty things seem to get Donald Trump elected in ... certainly will", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Freedom Financial", "city": "Birmingham", "day": "20"}
