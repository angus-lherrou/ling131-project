{"month": "10", "state": "AL", "station": "WERC", "content": "And if a senator Jones chooses to a vote more with uh the Democrats on other uh votes and is perceived as as moving away from what he had campaigned on being a centrist or it may be a ... a lot of votes but right now this will be front and center\nUm there's no question Alabama wanted to see Doug Jones vote to confirm judge Kavanaugh\nAnd interestingly enough when\nThe votes were being discussed\nHe was never actually mentioned in the four or five that might vote for judge Kavanaugh ... the the senators from Montana and North Dakota and West Virginia and Indiana\nOh were mentioned as as Democrats in red states that may or may vote for a judge Kavanaugh and Doug Jones was never mentioned in those conversations it was always assumed he would vote against judge Kavanaugh before even any of the issues that come out early on so\nOh I think that will be the the really number one issue and I'm already hearing that you're probably already hearing that it as something that will come back\nTo a really bad a discussion point in the campaign trail and twenty twenty the fact that he did not um vote the way most Alabamians wanted to say and vote which was to confirmed judge Kavanaugh\nRepublican congressmen Bradley Byrne has mentioned his interest in the race do you expect others to do the same\nYeah I think once we get past November\nThe November ... election the rice for the twenty twenty Senate rice will will begin in interest she it'll slowly but start but by next spring you will say\nThat campaign going full swing a as you will start saying that the twenty twenty presidential election starting to people focus on it so get ready um we've had a lot of elections this past year from since last November and the Senate or rise to this the rights of this year but\nA November sixth um will come and go and everybody will start getting ready for next year's races\nAnd twenty twenty including the the rice for the United States Senate here in Alabama\nAnd listening to viewpoint Alabama or against Republican former state representative Paul DeMarco so I'm a big issues coming up in the state or in the closing weeks of the campaign or one of them\nAre turned out to be the a part in parole board uh and uh we had some major developments there are a lot of concerns about a large number of violent criminals coming up for early Paroles and a governor ivy stepped in and took action\nEverybody needs to pay attention to what's going on in Montgomery with the um parole board Alabama preserve parole board there has been a lot\nOf I don't know if you want to use the word mistakes but the way the parole board has operated allowing individuals' violent\nOr individuals folks convicted felons felonies to get out of jail earlier than they should have been allowed to get out of jail a there was an incident where an individual was paroled or no one kept up with them and a murderer terrible murder three individuals in ...\nThe governor has stepped in a changed or the chair of the board\nHas I'm asked for a freeze on releases and and uh for the parole board to come back\nWe need to go beyond that I I personally think that we need to have a brand new parole board I think the governor needs to ask\nFor a fresh start a this has not been fair to a victims and I'll tell you give a lot of credit to vocal they are victims advocacy group too early stepping in with the governor and attorney general but this needs to be addressed and\nI think just a temporary suspension is not is not enough in my eyes I I think we need to see a new parole board I think we need to see a new a leadership\nOr in the the um at the parole board and I also would like to see the legislature come in and really a take a handle take a look at this entire way the parole board operates a you know including having a special committee meeting\nTo address to have the parole board come before the legislature\nAnd address these issues and then let's see some legislation in next year's legislative session to resolve this I I Am not a\nConfident that based on what the current parole board and the way they're operating that unless the legislature steps in with legislation to permanently fix these problems that we may go back to where we weren't before\nOr the governor and state attorney general Steve Marshall once or the board to ask them questions about the Jimmy Spencer case do what you referred it was released and went on to murder a child and to women and governors vote and the governor said she was very disappointed in the answer she received from the board\nAnd she painted a picture of a highly dysfunctional system let's listen\nTo lead is lower level made a decision if recommended go a little bit chain and when the file to vote and members they approved it and that's just not accept\nAll the Marco your chairman of the house Judiciary Committee during your time in the legislature uh what is your view of the situation that the Alabama board of pardons and\nParoles this has been such a scandal that we need a fresh start with the ... and in every listener to this session\nNeeds to make it clear to the leadership of the state of Alabama and and I do think that the governor and the attorney general did do what they needed to do to to start making some changes but I think to really complete the process you need a new leadership\nAt that bored and you need the legislature to step in and by statute make changes to the way this board operates it is not working this is a complete failure of a system\nAnd and it's not fair to the victims of some of these individuals and again thank you to vocal and what they have done to I'm really get this addressed and bring this to the attention of leadership the state of Alabama\nThere was a stunning development and perhaps we'll see some movement on that in the upcoming legislative session\nWe also saw hurricane Michael effect part of the state especially farmers around the wire grass a lot of crops wiped out the governor asking for emergency agricultural aid from the Trump Administration and of course all of this happening against the backdrop of an election\nBoth here and in Florida where you have that state's governor Rick Scott in a very competitive Senate race\nAgainst democratic incumbent Bill Nelson\nWhat are some of the ways that natural disasters\nHave had an impact not only on the people involved but perhaps on a campaign or this late in an election cycle\nWell people judge leaders on how they operate not only on a day to day basis but when there's a crisis and and we've seen that around the country um when you had Hurricane Sandy you've seen blizzards in Chicago that has affected mayoral races in Chicago\nOr you you look at uh what is happening around the country when it comes to natural disasters and you expect to have you looked at ... Hurricane Katrina what happened with the governor of Louisiana\nUm and the way she handled it as opposed to the governor of Mississippi\nDuring Hurricane Katrina so people or or you know rightly should look at their leaders when there's a a natural disaster of some sort of Christ say you know are they stepping up and leading the state the way we expect them to do ... you know more than ... that's when you need someone to step up\nSo what do you say somebody should be judged politically during disaster you know that's what people do and it can have an effect in if if there is effective leadership that take care\nOf those that are in need is reflected in the ballot box but if there's a perception that uh this was not handled the way they would expect with the leader is also handled at the ballot box so hopefully we'll see a you know our prayers to all those owned the the the coast of Florida but also\nUm farmers in South Alabama in South Georgia whose crops were destroyed by the hurricanes\nAnd the the number of folks who lost their homes and also the loss of life so [noise] uh as we go to the next to a not just weeks but months in recovery will be thinking of all those on

have to have to do this all alone and that everyone knows that they are worthy of belong\nAnd so we pray for courage enough to ask for help we pray that that people can be bold enough to be vulnerable and the guy you will make a strong enough to name that we are weak\nMaybe we always know that we are made in love by love and for law\nAnd now let us join our voices together and pray the way that Jesus taught the disciples to bring\nOur father who art in heaven hallowed be thy name by kingdom come by will be done on earth as it is in heaven\nGive us this day our daily bread\nAnd forgive us our trust passes as we forgive those who trespass against us and lead us not into temptation but deliver us from evil for China's the kingdom and the power and the glory forever I'm In\nThis morning before you all get generously\nI'm going to invite you all to watch a video on being here first church we believe that we should talk about giving all the time because what better thing to talk about then how generous guy has made us out of love and how God cause us to be generous with our love and with our gifts\nAnd so this morning I invite you to hear the story from Brett in Atlanta who are both members here first church\n[noise]\nAnd ...\nAnd I'm Bradley CNN and some of the first church for a little over two years to do\nAnd how did the right thing to get a chance to actually see how

they leave one by one The Elders first I've never been treated like this my shame it's beginning to fade away he turns to me and forgive me saying go and send them more\nAnd I walk away with my head held high and my shoulders back for perhaps the first time in my life I'm Free an on ashamed\nJesus shows us that love and belonging\nAre what matter not shame and stone throwing\nAnd this is not the only story where Jesus invites us to look past are getting it right to see past our failures and are false\nThink of the woman with the Alabama surge are often unnamed at assumed a prostitute she come to Jesus his feet and pours out an expensive perfume and the disciples well they want to chastise her\nBut the you know what Jesus does\nJesus thanks er and calls her actions beautiful think maybe if the woman at the well who's out at midday so that she won't be seen and her shameful state\nJesus sees her and Jesus listens to her\nAnd rather than condemn her he forgets her and tells her that he loves her\nLove and belonging\nThese are the way that Jesus teaches us\nAnd I cannot draw attention to these stories particularly around same as these are the stories of women and ... other stories can be found in our Texas well I think it's important to consider what these stories have to say to us today in the midst of our modern\nMe too movement you see Jesus would not have shame or blame the victim as our society is apt to do rather he would break down the barriers\nHe would stand up as people share what is valuable to them he would listen to their stories as well\nAnd he would tell them that they are loved love grace mercy bees or their responses Jesus teaches us to have let us remember that the next time someone shares their wins\nAs we've seen over the past months and years shame is an epidemic in our culture and dare I say in the church\nI cannot tell you how many visitors and members in this case that I have sat with over the past eight and a half years have told me they never thought they would ever be able to come back into a place like this\nTo the church and do you know why shame\nShame from the religion they grew up with shame from the churches they visited before\nFear that they wouldn't say the right things to be included or do the right\nThings to be loved shame over their gender shame over their sexuality shame over their doubts shame over their questions of this is not how Jesus teaches us to be the church\nWe've spent far too much time focusing on right behavior as a way to achieve greater connection with God as war might say it's easier and our ... mines to understand this behavioral model\nThe church has laid out in the past kind of like the first few months have right bully then you have a right to have here and then after all of that\nYou belong\nBut I we read in our ... earlier this is not have the the the thing is first and seeing a knowing God experiencing mercy and love that we are then moved to write beliefs are pathway\nNeeds to be flipped around so that belonging is first then right behavior and write belief\nWill follow\nFirst church believe this is a critical adjustment to be made in our understanding of what it means to be of eleven community\nOne of the ways that we're speaking to live and to this along\nBully that have believed formula is by changing the order in which we do our baptism and are joining so rather than asking questions about right the leak then right action first we begin instead with the congregation\nAll response of love of affirmation end up\nAlong this is where we all begin each of us\nNot from shame or fear around right to leave or right action but first from the experience of being a law and being\n\nIn addition to this somewhat backwards half way the church is often got it wrong with a focus on original sin or original shame\nWhich often creates a pit so deep it's\nDifficult to find a way out\nOf Richard more points out it's one of the main reason that many people today resent this kind of Christianity I mean as any child might present a foundation only rejecting parents\nWhen we believe that we're creating a totally different or as ... points out some reformers even use this phrase to describe human nature a pile of manure covered over with Christ\nWhen we begin their\nShame breathe under the surface and we suffocate trying to crawl back out\nWe're currently wrapping up our first church one oh one theory that first church we operate in spring and fall to help newcomers and anyone who needs a refresher remember what our United Methodist understanding is that is Stephanie ... shares summed up our United Methodist understanding of theology in one word\nGray\nAnd our United Methodist understanding of preventing grace in particular reminds us that God has an active presence in our life that is not dependent on any action\nWe take first it is a gift that is always available\nGod take the initiative and relating to humanity we don't have to\nBack or plead we don't have to have a certain way or say the right word\nFor God's love angry God actively seeks a and at first church that's where we begin\n\nSo how do we continue to try to come out from the burden of shame\nIn her work and research Dr Benet about brown has tackled this question a lot in particular how to combat\nShame and she shares that the only way that we can overcome shame in our culture and I would add in our church is their empathy and community we can be the church for one another by talking about our shame by sharing that's hurtful experiences from the past\nThe way that we believe that we had to get it\nRight to be loved my God the way that we are never felt like we were enough\nTo share in a way that Shane feeds in and soured out our experience of church for NATO described shame like\nThis if you want to put it in a petri dish and feed it only judgment secrecy and silent\nIt will grow out of control\nBut if you take that same petri dish and you doubt that full of\nEmpathy law and community it cannot survive\nBy looking at one another and saying me too and our moments of pain and struggle we squash the feeling\nOf shame and so here we are this morning\nTalking together about same doubting are petri dish with empathy and love so that shame can no longer thrive here\nSo this morning\nNo matter what you've been taught about church or what you've heard from the church\nYou belong here no matter what you thought about yourself or what you've been told about yourself you are enough and no matter what you've been told about God or thought about God you are loved just as you are\nFriends this is the good news of Jesus Christ amen [noise]\n\n\nThe proceeding has been a ... program the opinion to explore after those are the hose and do not necessarily represent their views and opinions or WBRC management employees or advertisers\nThese news radio ... five five do you we are the Birmingham\nJail you we are seeing him over and die hard radio station new [noise]\nStanding by their story I'm Pam Susannah Fox News\nAs officials from around the world continue to doubt the narrative being told by Saudi Arabia about the killing of journalists Jamal ... inside the Saudi consulate in Istanbul, Turkey\nSaudi Arabia's foreign minister is defending the kingdom and do algebra their tails Fox is Brett Baer the Saudi king initially received erroneous report\nWell it is double taxation [laughter] so [laughter] we we paid it on the front in and they were paying it again I mean it wasn't always that route yeah if the law [laughter] so so that's good to know and you know I I it just uh it it dawned on me as you're talking about our embassies in the amount\nOf money you're having to pull out and that sort of thing or another thing that I've been talking to our clients about in fact we just we did a client of that recently where I was going through and telling everyone that you know this is an analysis that\nWe needed to do for them [noise] was\nWith the new tax brackets so so most taxpayers are their tax brackets are going down I mean everybody is going down and most people I ... I should the tax brackets are going down period but for most people that are going to pay less taxes when the new tax law so\nAnd you mentioned earlier you said you know even people with great wealth a lot of wealth they don't necessarily have a lot of income\nAnd we see that all the time with our clients that are retired that have done a really good job of of building up\nWealth is you know let's say they've got a million dollars or more you know several million but they don't have a lot of income right and there are younger than Seventy and a half so the government hasn't made them start taking\nMoney out of their tax deferred accounts because it's Seventy and a half you have to start taking money out of your tax deferred accounts called RMC required minimum distribution\nSo they might be sixty sixty two sixty five whatever younger than Seventy or half if they don't have a lot of income there is a small window of opportunity for those people to get some of that tax deferred money\nAnd do a tax free bucket by converting door off and buzz I'm just curious to know you know what your thoughts are on that for people that that are in that circumstance that I just describe what\nTad let me give you an example and I've got a client who was he's been very successful and he recently retired he's not Seventy and a half yet\nTherefore he's not in the ... he's not taking required minimum distributions promise IRAs which which are quite large Rob the way he listens to the show where we can because he told me that [laughter] so ... when I met with him just a couple of months ago the majority of his income this year is capital gains in ... and qualify dividend income\nAnd the first Seventy seven thousand dollars of those two items is tax free subzero tax bracket yeah so so my suggestion to him was let's consider I Know you don't want to take money out of retirement but let's go ahead and take some out because we can get it out it it virtually little or no tax\nAnd of course being a smart ... businessman he said well why don't we just take that in ... because I don't need the money to put it in a Roth IRA\nAnd and we'll pay little or no tax on it and it was a great strategy for him and will continue to do that especially until he reaches Seventeen and a half and we'll be moving money from an IRA which has a from an inherited standpoint has a lot of a\nCumbersome issues into a ... hour a day which will serve his children well if if he chooses to deal with it that way\nAnd you're in it lessens the burden way does to understanding haven't haven't how big of an art indeed does he have to take and you know all those kinds of issues we just talked about\nYeah so in just a so folks understand because some people may or may not\nA Roth IRA the money gets taxed on the way and but then all of your earnings are tax free mhm so all of your danger dividends interest it doesn't matter how you earn money once you get the money into a raw it comes out tax free and so you're either raises you just said buzz\nWhen you pass that money or even if you're not passing it on and you're just taking the money out it's the most tax hospital thing you can have\nYeah and he didn't want tax free money [laughter] yeah that that guy and so so that\nThat's a you know you always hear deferred deferred tougher in in his true because you have more money going in and compound interest is you know having it's wonderful effect on a larger pile of money\nBut then when you start pulling it out there are no a tax advantages like there are in in taxable or tax free account at all can get taxes income sat Roth conversion is a good way to deal with that\nBut let me uh offer our listeners this because there is a window of opportunity right now for people to take advantage of a lot of these things and the only thing that has to happen for that window to close is the laws to change that so [laughter]\nSo if you are wondering\nYeah I'm retired or I Am\nThinking about retiring trying to figure out how to retire and I'm not really sure how to make sure that my money's going to last I don't know if I Am working how long I Need to keep working I'm not sure how to figure out all this tax stuff\nAnd maybe you've been doing all of your investing yourself or maybe you're working with a broker a banker somebody that's not really a retirement plan or that it's not really their job to help you think through these other questions\nIf you'd like to understand how to fix these things for yourself\nWe're happy to sit down with you right here in our office on the corner of valley Dylan called will mill or near Inverness and do an analysis of your current approach we will sit down and go through everything that you're doing\nAnd we will let you know in detail here the things that are going well and here's the opportunities that you have\nTo make things better if we decided to work together past that then it's a decision that will make mutually but this analysis was designed to give you an amount of clarity that you probably have never had around your retirement\nIf you'd like to take advantage of that we do specialize in helping people with five hundred thousand dollars or more plan for their retirement but if you'd like to take advantage of this offer and and just because bugs is on the show for the people that come in and sit down with us\nIf they come in and and sit down with us and do this analysis\nTony I'm going to give them a free copy of our book\nRetire with freedom so I'll just finished a book on retirement planning I think it's a pretty uh enlightening for people that are trying to figure this out over the folks that come in and sit down with us that have this review with us free copy of of my book tower freedom send them home with a call now nine eight triple zero six\nNine eight triple zero six so that the offer for the book is for anybody that calls in the next ten minutes\nSo that gives you time to pull over if you're in the car\nAnd uh we don't want you to be dangerous and running into people on the road ... there's no five alarm fire your ten minutes nine eight triple zero six two oh five nine eight eight\nZero zero zero six so bugs or keep helping folks understand or some more about tax stuff what do we want to talk about now\nWell I I'm a loyal listener of the show too [laughter] and we appreciate that and that's how I got to know you guys but\nThere is some some tax news and Tony I listen to you many times say you know people are living longer and you don't want to outlive your income right and evidently the federal government now agrees with out there listening can they finally\nFinally listening Trump\nIs issued an executive order and they are up dating the mortality rate yeah okay so now they are indeed may be going down because the life expectancies are going\nUp that's a that's an awesome thing that is really going to be helpful for many people\nSo so buzz or you know this is one of the things that that I talk about when we do our retirement planning class which by the way we just did one a recently and I think\nIt's the best three hours you can spend to prepare yourself for retirement and we knew a class typically right here Jeff steak that the campus own valley bill road if you'd like to attend the next class\nCalled the office you can call now and the operators can take a message or you can call during the week and just ask for Tracy you're an hour Travis somebody here in the office can get you signed up for the next class but we do a deep dive into retirement planning and ... in one of the ... so that the number to call is nine eight eight triple zero six nine a zero zero zero six\nI think this class has time well spent in fact I think you're crazy not to do it [laughter] um [noise]\nBut one of the things I talk about in there's how er and these are calculated so you just said they're they're raising the mortality tables which they explain to people what what what that means how are are in these calculated\nWell when you when you turned Seventy and a half the required minimum distributions go into effect and I think that that if that age I think it's like twenty eight so you have to take out one twenty eighth of your IRA balances and by the way you don't have to take them out of each IRA you can choose one\nAnd you know I don't know a lot of you know a lot of folks don't know I have\nTo you just have to take out the appropriate map or more it's Seventy and a half so right now it's around twenty eight so it may go to twenty nine already so the devise there will be going up there for the required minimum distribution will be going down\nSo that's good news for people 'cause a lot of people don't want to be taking money out of their tax to for the camera and I just have to at seven and\nA half I mean even if they might not even be spending it they just made me put it over and I joined a counter and individual account and reinvest and yet but they do have to pull it out and pay the taxes on it and let me just clarify that to those factors that you're using or these mortality factors that are that are good visors\nBut the percentage that first year is like three point six five percent is you know somewhere in there\nUm that you know it's funny 'cause sometimes I you know people get all these percentages and there had mixed up like fifty nine and a half and the Seventy and a half um some people think a lot of times they have to take ten percent of their ... you know they think that's what that does seem\nTo be a common misconception\nYeah and it's yeah and a lot of fun and I ... the first time I take an hour I going to start taking out ten percent I'm like no good lord wait wait wait we'd be in trouble of it take to well and I\nYou know here's here's my thought here's my whole salt like all of that whole thing you're one ... one whole thought\nOn that please please do not go with your gut yeah please please get advice get get it analyze not just somebody who tells you sure that looks like enough money\nI have an asking any questions about what you're spending and what's happening and why do you want to be doing and all the big things I'm not letting you guess at things and we're not guessing that thanks please please ... get a real solid analysis that you understand and can see\nHow your money's gonna last as long as the both of you do well love for you take this off\nAnd we have a lifestyle analysis process that we go through and you know you said if if somebody's not asking questions about how much you're spending and that sort of thing I think even brokers it you know big brokerage firms and people at banks ask people they do at\nHow much are you going to need and retirement the problem with that is in in please don't take this the wrong way are loyal and wonderful listeners\nOur experience tells us you don't know the answer right so even if they're asking the question if they don't have a process that they're giving you to say go do this so that we can nail this down\nAnd it's not a budget NATO budget work she please not to mention budget worksheets don't work\nSo we so we have a proprietary process that we call our lifestyle a mouse's\nAnd are inaccurate and we choose not to share it on the air 'cause we don't really want to be educating our competition on how to do retirement planning if they can't figure it out on their own [laughter]\n[laughter] so ah so this is if you're trying to decide do I take the severance or not you know Tony you just said don't go with your gut 'cause everybody's got is oh yeah let me out of ...\nAnd any any me out so when you when you get a figure of thrown at you it seems like a lot of money at the time right I mean it seems like a lot of money and so you know seeming and feeling and hoping is not solid\nPart so I'll I Will tell us this is a this is very um [noise] a timely we just had a family that that we've been working with for several years now and ah they were both planning on working for several more years and she has been offered a\nBuyout and uh she does not like her job came he does not like his job mhm uh and they're both kind of force in themselves to work longer so she really really really really let's say or this waltz affected by yeah right yeah\nBut we had to sit down and redo all of their plan because this is a big change mhm [noise] and so when we got done\nThe results were\nTaking the buyout will work ... everything will be fine but there were some variables in there you\nKnow there's some things going on with their kids where they're still helping their kids a little bit\nUh they've got a couple of uh they've got a a real house in in a in a regular mortgages they're paying off and so they're planning on selling their main home in and\nThey they've got equity so even though they still have a mortgage they've got equity in the house so that they think they can sell their main home and use the equity to buy something else so there were several moving parts yeah\nAnd so these are not things you can just guess at or take a swag out on the you know with a pencil on the back of an envelope right really got to I mean it it it was a it was a long long conversation in in shown here in our office that's one of our advisors he had done a lot of work\nPrior to my conversation with him he had gathered a lot of data and we had already done a lot of analysis before we sat down her right arm per se\nBut these are the kinds of conversations that have to be had this kind of detail right\nAnd I I let them know I said listen\nUh\nIt's gonna be better if you don't take the buyout\nAnd she said yeah but but ... but what they're\nTelling us this this will probably be the last time they will offer this kind of severance so I'm concerned that if I don't take this buyout\nThat\nI may be getting severance [laughter] in the future at a lower and with no without this kind of offer yeah\nAnd so it it's a complicated thing and so and so I as I just said listen how miserable argue right I mean how much you know because at some point there is a quality of life yeah question that comes in absolutely it's not just about money\nAnd and here's the thing to say this ah we do all and most of this work behind the scenes before somebody you know when we know something's gonna happen we're doing all this work on our on our families that we helps the half\nAnd then when they come in and we are ready to roll up our sleeves and get some stuff done and so every time we're meeting with someone it's super valuable time and we can get a lot done in a smaller window of time because we're doing so much\nAnd and so that's a very good point because ... and here's an here's what\nNeeds to be this is very can be very detailed and you've got to be diligent so I'll give you a great example she had given showing a lot of information that needed to be analyzed so Sean uh done it\nWe're forty five minutes into our conversation mhm okay this is something that I Know how to do hopefully help people think about right\nWe're almost an hour in and she said something in a way that struck me as funny yeah and I'm like okay wait a minute you mean funny strange yeah funny strange so I said okay wait a minute so what you're saying is\nAnd we're talking about how they're going to manage the different buckets of money for paying off their mortgages and and all that sort of stuff they've got a remodeling project that they're doing\nSo she was just some ... an offhand comment on what wait a minute where's that hundred thousand dollars coming from\nAnd she said well it's coming from it's going to come from our cash and I went to cash this at the bank and she said yeah I said oh we hadn't taken that out of the number yeah so again\nShe had a long conversation with Sean Sean and done all this analysis we've been talking for almost an hour\nRight and and then eat and we have this thing yeah right so so what what's the point I'm making here\nYou've got a really dig in on this stuff and you got to really care about you got to hit in the air and you've\nGot to know how to ask the questions and if something doesn't sound right you got to dig in further and it's\nIt's a science but there's an art to the science I we will sit down
