have to write twenty five extension cords\nAnd I think uh I mean yeah yeah I understand the question a little bit more now so I Would definitely say that transfer which would be mandatory yes or no yeah yeah exactly\nExactly and one more thing for you Gary uh [noise]\nI'm not as young as I used to be hitting that big five oh soon but uh I found a awesome awesome chore which put the key posts Rogers that standard manual thing that goes up that with the weight on it yeah yeah it'll\nYeah your shoulders weeks afterward right what I found a gas powered T post driver\nAnd in Kentucky I got a

thanks a lot of coal any time appreciate it thank you so much have a right that you do seem to care excellent very good very good yeah very good\nThirty eight minutes after the top of their eight hundred eight to three to five five that's our phone number up Patrick\nWelcome [noise] area are you doing doing good\nGreat a money issue I have a master bathroom there we tore out to the studs took out the floor and all nine yards and when it was about a little over a year ago and when we were traced everything including the ceramic floor\nIt crowds out and we had to have to come to come back on the floor and regarded [noise] and it's hailing again [noise]\nAnd the problem is that the cap probably work\nToo well here has a new flooring what kind of ... of the pattern ... you're mixing with water yeah okay\nAnd um is it the ceramic tile tell me about the ceramic tile size of the ceramic tile\n... twelve inch okay square [noise] yes\nSquare okay and how about the uh the sub for that you're putting it on what's that\nAh that are only the house owner didn't put it in myself so I'm not I know they actually recording this\nUp for the second time too so I imagine it's some sort of a porous membrane\nYeah so it's my guess is it's not the ground and it's not the tile it's the stability of the ... floor um whenever there's any kind of movement the first thing to fails to grab the second thing the fails to tile\nGotcha um had this problem when I had a home built [noise]\nI was actually on vacation when they put the floor and\nAnd uh two years later I started seeing a crack in the ground and I pulled the register cover off and I looked at the ... floor\nThe wood was fine and it was I Can't remember say five ... ... a ... be me me and I can't even remember and then it was a quarter in cement board and I remember ... as soon as I saw it I ... that had to be ... cement board\nAnd um I had the foreign company come back and then that by the time in between our phone calls the towel it actually correct in one spot 'cause I was just there was there was bouncing that ... there wasn't enough stability there and they had to tear everything up replacement board and the whole works\nSo that you know you kind of get an idea of kind of once you're looking for and then you're going to have to\nHave somebody out there to see how it's going to match up to the house okay because you'd have so many ways to vent different types of fire places now I tell you one thing I was at home not long ago they had a coal burning fireplace and they had a pellet stoves I don't know if you know what those are\n... and it was a direct vent right through the back of that and it was really kinda fits motif for the house\nJust talks does come in all different kinds of sizes so I think I Would just going to block out the whole\nUh gas log thing first\nAnd see what's available in terms of pellet stoves aimed gifts love\nI'm a comb stoves too I'm In the direct vent and a kind of kind of figure out you know what's in your price range how's it going to line up to the house and go from there we're kind of backwards\nOkay see that's how they went on\nYou have an opinion on like a ... a logs or or stoves versus\nYeah correct thing I I'm not a fan of the vent less never have been deaf people it's whereby him but you're asking my opinion I'm not a fan of getting by yeah I think a direct van is much better\nOkay All right fair enough sorry for your time\nAll right Tony thank you take care Bye bye yeah there are so many very cool things you can do and if you're not familiar with uh the old coal burning fire places I mean I doubt if they're\nTwenty four inches deep they're ... they're probably more like a Fifteen inches deep\nSo it's not like a big fire box so a stove and a drug vent or you know which you can get with a gas logs in which you can get with the ... really ideal for that situation but see what's out there in a kind of work your way back and I think you get your answer um let's see we go to Colleen Colleen welcome\nThat morning I have a problem with glass window and my foundation ... at first I thought something was heading in them but it's not from Milan mar they're not doing anything but the surface and the glass on the outside it's chipping off what causing that\nThey have no idea where\nThey chipping well just just a tiny little tempt you know land on Mars sound like and I have no\n... shipping from the sides from that that ... yeah glass rock from the surface\nYes and that things happened on the inside the grounding sign\nOkay they are grounded in in in their shipping right in the center of the block right not on the edges right in the center\nOf any any place center and size center and they don't try huh [noise]\nI have no idea when you when I saw that it was chipping I Would think maybe on the sides are now it'd be some settling in that foundation creating some torque on a a grab a glass block may have that happened I Would say the ... would fail before the glass now\nLecture can house are down in about sixty five shows surely shouldn't settle right now\nWell no it's not necessarily true there is that how they're going to I don't know for a hundred years you can also yeah\nSo what I Would do I I don't have an answer for you maybe somebody listening has experienced that Colleen I Would if it were me I'd probably call a couple of glass block companies and see if they've ever heard of it okay I have not anything\nOn hand that I could\nUm [noise] [noise]\nAt a liquid not\nLike you know I Can't I Can't fix it until we know what's cause yeah I really uh and I really truly have no idea what it could be\nOkay then I have one other question you mentioned in may and and the beginning and Dr Lacey or anything like\nThat so and so the the the caller actually from Connecticut called and said he loves the ultra max\nOne thousand and um the ultra max one thousand blackjack culture max one thousand\nIs the name of the driveway sealer it's sold at Lowes an ace hardware as\nIt is eight ten year a driveway sealer uh so it doesn't really fade it's a gel that you can put down with a regular driveway a ceiling brushing squeegee you don't have to stir it\nAnd it's an acrylic residents sealer so it is just a it has a fade resistance from the sun and uh you put too thin coat song and it does a great job [noise] thank you very much right thank you take care\nBye bye by the way if you've ever heard of that and I have not I have no idea which will be causing a little tiny chips coming out of a glass block I too would think from lawn mowing shooting little rocks shipping some of the glass block\nShe said no it wasn't that I don't know how she would know what that but ah she said no it wasn't that um but I've never heard of glass blocks just light legal chips in the center of the glass blocks or on the sides of the glass bug if you've ever heard of that ever experienced that uh you can do so again our phone number is eight hundred eight\nThree eight to five by one thing for sure if you have a house there's always a little mystery is going on in their little mysteries may be a lot of people don't know sometimes go back to the source but saying to the fact of glass block I think she said her home was built forty fifty years ago but going back to a glass box told me to view\nFolks ever had to deal with anything like that I have never heard of it before but of course in the business they may have an idea\nOf something that a pledge sprints to\nWrite music playing got to tell you about my favorite products and the do it every week and keep those gutters flowing as believes will turn colors this year and Paul\nI promise happens every year they keep those ... gutters clean with a product called the governor brush just lied three foot sections in your gutters and it blocks leads from accumulating in the gutter\nNow you can get if you'd like to free six foot sample and give them a trucker you can order the gutter brush here oh out its gutter brush dot com check it out it's great stuff\n... okay All right Scott good enough things they care about by by yeah I so somebody a and it\nWasn't that warm where I met this week it was in the fifties dropping down to the mid thirties or during the night but I saw somebody a painting a house in painters painting a house or\nWas it yesterday ... kind of rain must have been like Wednesday ah but yeah you can paint in Chile whether they're going to pay when it's snowing or anything but the chilly weather you can you can paint gets wrecked banks All right let's get to a Jerry Jerry welcome\nThank you for your program thank you sir\nI'm Gary I'm redecorating our home we are moving from all paper to painted walls I've had excellent for fast and prepping and painting paper\nWallpaper ... have a large master bad rep bathroom with vinyl wallpaper bring any parents or suggestions for voting taken that down at painting over vinyl wall I\nWell you can paint over everything I say it all the time ... you really can a but it has um [noise] you know it has drawbacks\nUm so ideally you always want to take paper off and if you can't\n... and there isn't much other choices yeah you you can certainly pain over but if you were if you are definitely going to do it preparation becomes the key like everything else they're your answer really scribbled down and make sure you get all the roads duo surface\nHopefully the seams are intact ... mood the net thing is so tight you can't get it off and then you would use just a good you know a latex or cruelly bonding primer\nOr to the paper\nA and then you would come back and the and pain on top of the primary ... use of paint with a primer so you kind of double priming yes um but what happens sometimes and just you know just so you know um sometimes additional weight will actually in the in the moisture actually help remove paper\nI'm less so with vinyl\nA vinyl is more of a slick material so the challenge here is to making sure that it doesn't feel from the vinyl and doing the bonding primer and then the ... with a primer [noise]\nWe usually take care of that\nSo did you how'd you how'd you do on the uh how'd you do on painting the paper paper\nOh absolute a trip [noise] uh I I run or two after there's a lot of work because the walls romp prep for probably thought to stay there and it was well done uh probably we pay\nBut I used a dry wall mud on the same hand it to make sure it was it was ... and ... and everything was tied put a kill\nCoat and then primer\nAnd then put a coat of paint eggshell finish didn't get a single Bob now and it was absolutely thrilled with that and\nThey parents had been remodeling the violent a big kitchen ... took a lot of ... almost as if you were prepping a new Wal yeah gosh track and I bought in that big master bath I'd be great and ...\nPaper always paint sound a little better than the vinyl um I mean there's paper on drywall rights\nSo it it always paint job better than the vinyl the vinyl sometimes has a little bit of a texture to it yes uh the drywall compound is less likely to stick to it so there's a little bit more challenges with it but if you got a really good tight jeans and\nYou wash it real good and it doesn't have a texture to it and you put a primer on you probably do All right I just hate to ever guarantee it because you never know you know it's that one a variable\nThat's right well thanks for taking my call and we enjoy your show\nThinking Jerry good luck to you that care about my married fourteen minutes after the top of the hour eight hundred eighty two three eight to five five that is our phone number by the way when he talked about kills kills the brand name made by master Kim and they make 'em\nA line of prime ... um the original kills was a stain blocking primer um you know if you had a water stain on the ceiling and you don't want it to bleeds who you're finished do you use the he kills stained blocking primer that'll set disdain if you're looking for an overall sick\nA primer I talked about it being a bonding primer or the kills one is in excellent primer that can be used over you know that situation of paper I'm In it it's a it's a very very good primer\nMy theory and see if you agree with it here my theory is if you can stay in the category of the paint your use in other words if you decide to use a been more or sure when Williams or whatever brain you're using a bear I'm In you you pick this\nThe top of their line a wall paint I Would take a look at their a companion or sister primer to go with the kind of keep it in the family um there that they have been developed to work together\nSo that some but if you're not going to go then looking for an all purpose the kills total one is a very very good primer right that at your primer on primary oh drummer all day and you'll come on let's take a break here at home with Garrett self and\nTime to get

I've seen them cars it's virtually impossible to remove [noise] literally\nAnd if even if you were moved with a razor blade of glass or something to leave a little yellow stain\nWell I don't think that's\nWhat her issue was I'm not really sure exactly what that issue was because we don't know what's on it we don't know what that stain or you know what's on it at all so we've had a\nOf mysteries today and sometimes you just got to dig deeper deeper deeper I left with her like she needs to work it through the pain company in the store for the wrong tent and was used that could have implications on many things on the outside of the house outside of just not drawing properly\nAlright eight hundred and eighty two three eight to five five that's our phone number you can grab aligned happened to take your calls as we marched through another weekend she'll walk\n[noise] [noise]\nHey Sheila hello yes I Am I really needing replacement now my neighbor just had his room\nPlaying Don ... houses were built with [noise] ah they had let whole valleys and they knew that his shows and cook them first layer of um [noise] [noise]\nHi over or show and I put on and down and then put some kind of I don't know I think of something and then he put that new I ... everything that black tile and\nWho have told them they don't use the um metal valley anymore and that caused problems are not as good I I'd never heard that before so I came to you\nWell it's called a California weeds\nAnd or your roofers wrong they do use metal valleys they still use metal valleys of galvanized in pain them they use copper valleys in in my opinion I think those valleys are actually better\nUm versus a California we've uh California we've used by a lot of roofers\nBut um you know my opinion is I kind of like the middle valleys that doesn't mean you have to have him that's just my opinion\nNot ... I'm not using that roof of that before I went to look for I guess I Want to know hey we only have one layer of tire out here and take off all shingles I mean it will take off all the shingles it don't put the shingles on top of an old one because they make them go\nUm you can put a second layer of shingles on top of an existing layer of shingles and it'll save you a little bit of money\nUm I tend to go back to the thing is I probably wouldn't do that I'm\nA first of all a lot of roof worn teaser avoided if you go over in existing layer of shingles\nOkay I'm also I'm\nA you know it's always good to check what's going on underneath those shingles in case she had some water damage or something maybe some would needs to be replaced that doesn't give you a smooth the look and you're saving a little money but it's ... it's a little money it's ... if\nI tell him what he did tell him about taking the original shingle off and putting stuff on the mall was correct yes have Halle stuff\nI'm going to talk to the paper I can hear 'em before I start to anybody I wanted to talk to you and make sure that I got um\nYeah and you and you bring up a really good point to Sheila because I'm I'm you know some refers to the California we even in swear by it okay but you know I'm saying I like the middle valleys in the reason having these conversations is\nIt's all about the quality of the roof or you know that other roof or he was good to he was saying Gees I wouldn't put it over the old layer I really recommend stripping absolutely\nBut I always say this people ask me all the time what's the best shingle I said don't don't worry about single worried about the roof or get the best route for you Ken\nOkay now the next question what is the vantage they let ... valley ... over the uh California\nI'm not really sure I can tell you what the advantages it's more long lasting it's more it's less I'm more susceptible to being intact if there was a lot of wind\nOkay that you know there is a real reason for me I'm a lot\nAlso depends on the slope of the roof to\nIt got it from\nYeah then I Would like the mental valley [noise]\n[noise] whenever you have a clash of temperatures um that can take the humidity in the air and literally ring the moisture out of the year\nWhich would create moisture so the close even though they're not wet they would feel damp and if they're damp that's moisture and if it's growing on 'em so then the mould\nMould spores or everybody's house right okay and if you have moisture\nAnd you have organic materials so that would be caught in a wool non synthetic 's okay and they got damp mold can grow up [noise] so what\nWe need to do is we need to a figure out um you know maybe those uh maybe there's not enough uh ...\nIt could be it can be many things may maybe there needs to be some ventilation in the closet maybe there needs to be insulation on those walls inequality\nThere why um but that that down that stuff I did have my house had it for what they do not have that job like I say the company and why it was eight is [noise]\n... how did they ah what did they do in terms of inflation is if there is zero inflation and the walls is that what you're saying at this point\nThere was some time now I mean I'm Sorry the houses in fifty nine it probably wise that I had that done about five years ago mhm it why is it a proper complaint job but it's better than it was so there is now inflation that go on the outside they spray it and stuff\nLike OK okay so there's some but not much so maybe that fireplace\nThat should actually be drawing out the air but if it's creating a lot of heat and it's hitting a coal wall that could create some moisture\nI'm a fireplace has on Brecht behind it so it um [noise]\n... definitely fine because of that way though firefights has a thought on the brick and up and the whole thing by paneling except can alter oil well\nTo answer your question will the panda humid a fire take it out it it it very ... who will may would I Would do is go to the hardware store by a five dollar humid stabbed or humidity gauge humidity gauge will tell you what your humidity level is in the closet\n... they put that humidity gauge in the closet if it's over fifty percent right now I guarantee you that's the problem\n[noise] okay so that little panda than will drive the humidity down below forty percent in your problem will go away\n[noise] [noise]\nWell you know what it was definitely worth I've lived here before I've never heard that so that is awesome appreciated test called the humidity gauge right hardware store that more like um for like an a cargo air\nYeah yeah and they did it just looks like a little\nRound thing almost like a cooking some moment or would be without to probe you can just set it in the closet it'll tell you what you ... you might even play around with a little bit see where the ... and the family room\nAnd see where it is in the clauses probably higher in the closet that's where the mold issues are and then you do you miss the fire will bring that down opening the door that clause it'll probably bring it down\nUm but uh just in the wintertime or humidity levels inside her house should be summertime fifty percent wintertime forty percent I looked at mine last night\nMy home humidity was forty five percent we're transitioning between seasons so it's going down once it gets the forty I'm you know I mean ... that's when we took me a little uncomfortable that's when we want to add moisture\nBut uh that's where you want it fifty percent in the summer of forty percent in the winter my bet is that close it's much more humid than anywhere else in your home you need either open up the door run now do you miss the firing you solve your problem\nHeaded off on page it very much ... very good at great about it All right\nThank you Bye bye alright about six minutes before the top of the hour eight hundred ... two three eight to five five debt is the phone number and let's see where we go we go to Rob Rob welcome [noise]\nHey good morning it was about a ... like I I got a project that I learned something I've never done before but I think with

question\nThere's this how do you do I need to go uh when I dig around the side of the house to put that pipe in the ground\nOr you want to get you know probably where you're at you don't have to go below the ... probably Eighteen to twenty interest\n[noise] yeah it will be up against the foundational show\nI'd say kind of twenty inches and you want to have slope to make sure that water doesn't stand in that pipe right so you want to hear that I'm ... [noise] yep\nYep yep I I I started to you to stop it makes no shortage fanfare I think I might be able to do this but uh yeah that's a great help that's what I call for the folk I'm certainly I'm for it and I want to go far enough so I Love 'em straight up and\nYeah and and again with that slope you're not going to have a problem if you're twenty inches deep get a good\nGravel base on there and uh and you're good to go [noise]\nVery good thank you much for the call appreciate it All right um well let me tell you about a [noise]\nWhat's going to go on in the next hour I think you'll find it interesting we're going to have our friends in ... pumps and we're going to talk about uh what kind of backup pumps you want on your home\nYou want to water or do you wanted to battery operated [noise] so that's going to be well we're going to chat about and I know there's always some controversy about that well I like to battery 'cause it's just I like the lottery 'cause it does it will get a straight from our friends from law that's all up next [noise]\nReporting that the bomber was going after Trump targets no\nNot the case what you have is a bad guy\nWho did something very bad and calling him the smog bomber is not only inappropriate it shows that you shouldn't be in the journalism business at all\nThose of us on the political opposite side we're not calling the shooter at the congressional baseball game the Sanders shooter even though he was a vehement Bernie Sanders supporter that's not what we do that's also not being honest and it's not reporting the news\nAs as it is in reality\nSo we've got more violence today we don't know why other than this person allegedly shouts some sort of hatred and I'm\n\nAn incredible hatred and loading of of people have the Jewish faith we don't have any motive other than that we don't know his name although it's been a reporter to use a white guy with a beard\nYou know we also was reported that the bombing suspect it was a white guy to that guy list themselves as Native American his first name is ... says are so he could be Hispanic as well and also a report that he's a talented Filipino\nThe media always the quick to say it's a white I remember George Zimmerman the guy who killed Trayvon Martin\nBecause Martin went back and was beating the hell out of them in in self defense he shot and killed them they reported him as a white guy for a long time until they had to once his picture was out there admitted that he was this panic so then they started calling him a white Hispanic\nSo dumb that is\nSo the media always is looking for a spin I'm always going to give it to you straight as I can and that's what we have out of Pittsburgh I'll give you updates as we go I definitely want your thoughts on this uh this bombing suspect that is a\n... that's under arrest than even more than that I mean it looks like it's some nut job who had some crazy delusion about\nWhat his role should be in politics in this country I mean just the pictures the van itself if you're looking at a going what there was a guy riding down the street with a van that looked like that and nobody suspected and even years ago where they are a substantial criminal record\nYears and years and years of convictions who by the way was a registered Democrat I've seen reports that he switched to Republican and twenty sixteen\nAnd suddenly Trump made them do it according to the media\nSends out a bunch of alleged bombs I'm not even convinced there were really bombs but he sends out a bunch of alleged bombs to people we put return addresses on these fake addresses on the actual said into\nAn area they were supposed to show up at all these prominent Democrats houses and their officers they never made it there\nBut it's for the media it's not about are the bad guys off the street thank God nobody was hurt it's more about Trump did this\nAnd I guess there was some letter signed by hundreds of journalists about how Trump is somehow inciting violence against journalists that's not true he's done nothing like that in fact that sounds really stupid and an journalistic to even say something like that\nIn fact I can make a good argument that the media\nIs inciting violence against those who support President Trump you if you were a make America great again hat your target and that's okay\nIf you go to a Trump rally or you have a Trump bumper sticker you're a racist in his ... his either fall but that's OK the media school with that\nYou're late night talk shows calling the president's mouth a blank holster for for ... and that's okay that's perfectly fine\nFake news incessantly that's just the way it is will correct it later\nAnd there are there is an example of for example at the example of that\nWith the media again playing the victim in fact Jim Acosta from CNN the other day tweeted out this appointment or Hangst over the fact that when President Trump was talking about the bombs that were they were going he didn't mention CNN specifically give better not\nThis is a guy whose job is supposed to be to go there to report the news and he's not ever supposed to be the story is mad that he wasn't the story and when the president does call CNN out\nThan a cost in in in his ilk say he shouldn't be doing that he's putting his endangering denigrating what we do for a living so make you make your mind up either you want to be mentioned by the president or you don't want to be on the president you don't get to tell the president what mentioned he has to make\nFor you so I mean we're living in bizarro world here really are those who\nPerpetrated violence on the left should be arrested and or or killed in the act like the guy with the shooter was in at that congressional baseball\nIs they should be prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law and sent away for as long as we possibly can those who committed violence and they're on the right same thing should apply\nBut this is elected reporting abuse the desired by the media to pretend like one side is inciting violence and the other side is that it's just a crazy person that was on ... D vats irresponsible\nBetsy responsible\nOr by the way the the bombing suspect very odd the whole thing's odd claims he's a seminal Indian\nIs family or a family friend or a lawyer or somebody claim that he wasn't at all that he is a one by one name that he went by different name one name sounded Native American or American indian and the other one sounded Italian first they've certainly sounds Hispanic who knows what he is\nWhat we do know is he was some promoter for chipping bills\nAnd some bouncer at at a bar even the night before he was arrested\nSo whatever the left is trying to glean from him and put it on Trump is irresponsible and stupid\nAnd the media needs to learn it's job again the job is to go there observing and tell us what you saw is not drug or observe and then tell us why from caused that\nWhat I Do know is the FBI says these were real devices [noise]\nThe FBI says yes [noise] they were really we're not a hoax they could have detonated thank goodness they didn't [noise]\nI Can't go and what you say I have to go with the facts are the FBI says that's what it is unless you're telling me of the FBI was in cahoots\nWith the false leg that where they found this guy out of their butts and just say hey look here's a guy let's change the election\nI Can't play that game it's a one eight hundred and five zero one Seventy eighty Joe ... dot com they're under there is the weekend with a ... pound [noise]\nNews radio nine sixty WBRC [noise]\nMessage ... burning your degree from one of the top business schools in the country might sound impossible to fit into your workload\nBut what if there were a business degree that further your career and gave you access to world renowned faculty leaders and mentors all on your schedule one that opened doors to some of the most influential CEOs tech companies law firms entrepreneur and thought leaders\nAnd what if you could earn that degree in his little less sixteen months one hundred percent on line\nTo find out more text offer to seven nine six four or five that's o F F E R to seven nine six four or five star chair on line MBA\nInformation management or business analytics master's program from the W.

I've seen that I mean you walk up generally speaking to my ... unless they like get a shot somebody you walk up generally speaking very respectful and and you seem to be giving them the benefit of the doubt now\nHow often do you figure percentage you can put on this where somebody will not get with the program not understand but you might actually be willing to cut them a break and they just don't shut up and they just give you a hard time and it's this whole community versus the police ...\nIs there a percentage of people that you think talk their way into jail or into a ticket or something\nOh yeah I don't know what it is for most police officers I mean for me it's probably about ten percent of those\nAre just difficult to deal yeah ... that you know I'm I'm a believer in calmness power if you walk out your calm and they can steal that they don't steal your wrapped up it just it really helps that situation go a lot smoother event you have to rest\nIt ended up going to last booster but there's some people that are just like you said from the word go they're not with the program and uh you can tell that immediately\nWhat I've learned from watching you would share of mark lampooned al ... Arizona and from watching other law enforcement officers on on shows like like pd and others um ... is that when you walk up\nYou generally speaking don't want to put somebody in a bind I mean there really is a lot more discretion that I think I ever knew there was a but again if somebody's going to get with the program you probably have three or four or five different charges on some cases that you can lay on 'em and but they're also minor enough to know where you could still get them home tonight\nThat that it's kinda it's I didn't know that do you hear from other people like me who say you know I had no clue that you guys could deal with it that way\nYeah you know a lot of people don't realize that and we do have a lot of discretion and that's why I Try to tell people look\nJust relax you know this is going to go a lot more did a lot differently or did you think if you just stay calm would just work through it um and it does give us the ability to use some of that discussion but you're right and if we wanted to get stuck on a ton of charges too so it it really just depends on on where they want to take it\nTheir ears can be hurt and they should be wondering what are we going to do yeah I agree\nWe're going to continue to protect our communities are we uh we're concerned about the amount of people that are going to flow into this country and in our communities and and so we're watching this very closely\nBut you're from law enforcement guy and I said that\nYour guest it's a compliment but it's also your job I've got people up in Travis County Texas not far from where I Am a where were the share of just doesn't care about enforcing the law I'm going to ignore those laws force these laws you seem to be a guy that says no here's the book this is where the laws are I'm going to follow those I'm going to enforce those going to make sure people abide by them\nWhat reaction do you get from people in our county residents there last question marketing appreciate the time or what reaction do you get from them when you say\nIt's been when they get here we're going to make sure that we we you know stick to the laws are in ... is there a sense of nervousness among the community now with all these people had no way\nYou know we're very supportive community because we deal with it so much you know in this county everybody understands what the majority of the people understand the immigration issue where with\nCars running from us almost ... almost every night we deal with the drugs coming into our community or you've been affected by heroin it by a by ... by these other drugs that they're trying to get our our American public and are you hooked on so\nHere in Arizona and here in our county we get for the most part yeah and uh so we get a lot of support and they they expect the I was voted into this position on those grounds that I was strong on border security and protecting our community so we had a lot of support from our up from the people ...\nAre good they sound like very good people and they certainly have a great share of sheriff mark lamb but al ...
