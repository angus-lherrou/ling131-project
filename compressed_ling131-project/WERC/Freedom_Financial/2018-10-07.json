{"month": "10", "state": "AL", "station": "WERC", "content": "Like in the case of Michael Jackson I don't know that that night that he set out\nTo kill himself he just he had been over medicated and it's happening with the help of his doctor who I I don't know if he met while or not but Conrad Murray I guess wasn't he didn't do it right and Michael Jackson passed away and then there's been others who they on their own get store medication they do it and\nYou ask yourself what leads them to that point where they think that's the solution\nBecause this is a form of self medication in order to deal with the pain they want to nominate pain temporarily but unfortunately when the drugs were of the pain still there because they haven't dealt with the core issue that caused a pain in the first place\nRight I've often heard it said suicide is a very permanent solution to a temporary problem\nIn a particularly disturbing trend America's teen suicide rate is among the highest in the world it seems that young people who have everything to live for are increasingly committed coming to the conclusion that their life is is worthless or it's so painful there's no way out why is this such a such a rapid thing with young people\nWell we'll go back to a lot of the\nThe social media and that was a man next question yeah social media if is is instantaneously so you have more incidents of bullying and we also have what we call it a professor\nIs social comparison theory so if you had a low point and then you turn on Facebook or Instagram and you see people having a good time and understand that a lot of times that's what people are trying to present mhm that their life is a lotta people compare that but on the on the internal part of it they are suffering\nAnd so seeing a lot of the the social media people being happy and so forth it caused a lot of internal paying with people you know so I think what's happening with that generation as soon as they are in that social media world this kind of\nBringing a lot ... has always been around but now you have different forms of it and social media allows it to be people could have had a computer and\nAnd then it hurts people\nIt's almost soft bullying because if you you go on line and you're lucky you never have a picture itself well here I Am I'm a self eating potato chips watching TV again don't usually do that but they do here's my new car my new girlfriend my new house and so you start to compare your life to that of what you're seeing there with your friends and and your\nYour neighbors and you go my gosh I like terrible I don't have a new girlfriend new car or a new house what's wrong with me and I can see where people could get very depressed by by those things\nVery depressed and and and it can cause a it can bring up some on one at issues for example or do you have an accent you saw him on social media and they were happy and and you're not in a good space it could take some of your\nIssues a little bit further because you're not able to kind of deal with and so I think the social media the Internet accessibility to to to information that can cause more incidents where people can have a incidents of mental illness or suffer from it\n[noise] doctor more do you think and I realize it's somewhat almost antithetical to what we've been talking about bringing awareness but do you think that there is because of all the attention is being paid is it causing I guess for lack of better where to copycat effect where people especially young people look and say\nNo one's paying attention to me I Am going to do this thing so that people will remember me and at least they'll they'll remembering a positive way and because of all the attention that a lot of people are getting now it's almost causing people think well if I Can't get the attention any other way\nOut I'll just kill myself do you do you think that's happening\nYeah a lot a lot of that is happening a lot of people probably just trying to like you say the attention seeking behaviors they're trying to\nThey're trying to tell people to show them and that's where we can go back to getting some help a lot of times people act out when they're suffering so that's why you can see it or a radical change people's behavior\nWhen your friend your spouse or someone in your life is dealing with something they they're they're really looking for attention they're saying look at me I'm hurting\nAnd so they want to show you that and then like you said with a copycat those are people unfortunately that think that is the only way out and so they're saying hey I gives no one is paying attention to me why I'm here so the centers\nIt's also the method where I think about because it's like you will get affection but it'll be post mortem you won't be around yes you know people will remember you but you know it's that's why I I sometimes wonder\nWith those things like you'll see like as somebody who was in high school and and they commit suicide and they dedicate the yearbook to them and I sometimes wonder is that the right way to do things because does that actually given to that and in in doing so create more of the problem\nYeah and there is a psychologist you know we kind of look into that and we're saying that you know there's a certain way the terminology and suicides change if you noticed people will say a person who lost their life to suicide is kind of given in a different way of saying they committed suicide it's illegal things behind why they happen as well but\nIs more saying that the person was suffering\nAnd they lost their life to suicide or the lack of so\nAnd I've always heard that if a person you know starts to talk about suicide that that's kind of a warning sign right there that's that's time for you to to seek help for that person isn't it\nYeah but but the thing about it is like I tell people that\nLike us individual you know the person well enough so\nLike we are trained to when they come to us we can you talk therapy and we can use a certain suicide assessment to determine that but what I tell people is that you can see it like if you are an individual individualistic so I might be dealing with something and then you say well he's gone through a hard time\nBut when you see it with your friend you can see erratic behavior not people do change and they go through different phases in life but a radical change is is was noticeable so\nAnd the ... so that's why I'm important for people around them to kind of helped them because when they are to harm themselves not only themselves but for other people you've got to say at this point about see for themselves to get what you do\nAnd Dr more do you ever find a situation where somebody might be reticent to come and seek help on someone's path because they're afraid that might\nDamage your friendship or or otherwise you know I don't well I don't want I Know my my brother I Know my friend is is hurting our free they might do something but if I if I tell someone they're going to know I told and I don't want to damage that relationship is is that a real issue\nYeah there's a real issue and actually what I tell people because I go around and do presentations and people say you cannot make anyone get help this is your friend Doug how can we give them some hill and I see where you love a person enough I Would love you more\nTo try to get you help so I understand that the conflict and they might be a little upset but you got a little bit more because it's a point there might be a danger to themselves or other people and they they don't have the cognitive skills in order to process was going on in the port ... threat to themselves and possibly other people's will\nAnd Dr ... here in the state of Alabama mental health has never been a very high priority from an economic standpoint\nI what what are the resources available to people living in and we're reaching people from ... to the wire grass to the shows what are some resources in the state people have at their disposal to to help whether they're seeking help themselves or they know someone\nGo when it was a good question because throughout the state they have they have a lot of resources available they have private practice of ... but they also have\nFree resources to people who can afford it so if you and your city\nYou can go to a clinic or you can go to the county courthouse it may have referral is a free services as well as paid services and if you have insurance you can just call your insurance company and they have a list of providers in your area that you can call\nIn and tell them specifically what you're dealing with America connect you with a local provider\nDr Marwan thank you so much

bowl the the mountains fall down into the bottom where the sea is so when Jesus would speak his voice will very naturally be carried down and across the water\nOn the workers from the bottom of the sea up we're pressing and towards him to listen to hear what he would say and he sat there and he shared with them about the way\nIt was on hold communion Sunday that we made our way through this beautiful church called the church of the bee attitudes to very small section of ground her we could sit and listen as we broke bread and we celebrate a communion\nIt was for me the first time I had el ever celebrated communion in a foreign land it was the first time I had been present with people from all over the world during the convenience service\nSure my home church had always celebrated world communion but it had not had the same impact or significance that sitting in this space surrounded by these people did\nThis church\nIs one that many people come to when they're traveling to Israel so as you might imagine it was rather crowded on world convenience Sunday so when we found our little spot that we can carve out we were in close quarters with other people near us\nSays we began our communion liturgy I truly could hear so many other languages around me speaking as they to broke bread I could hear Hebrew Greek Afrikaners Chinese Norwegian and English\nWe we're all celebrating communion and our native tongue on world coming in Sunday in the place that Jesus had chosen to make the plane to us that despite our differences God's love invites us all to come to the table\nNow I like to think that maybe one day maybe one day not too far in the future first church might travel to Israel to see together some of these sites to participate and learning from this sacred land\nMaybe we will hear on a trip like that multiple languages and we will be transformed by God's amazing grace\nBut today we celebrate in this space world coming in and we do so remembering the wide enough\nThe diversity the inclusion and the justice that God's presence brings to each of us all around the world and we prayed today for the world as as it is symbolized and the elements that are found on our table\nSo instead of a traditional sermon today I thought that I Would ask that we all participate in remembering celebrating and proclaiming the connection we have to all people in all places\nAround our globe through the bread represented on our table so for the next few minutes you're going to be invited to listen and participate in five short readings with a song congregation over spot\nThat we hope will help symbolized the world that we have\nThe ways in which we are all being transformed and the experience as we have after each reading you will be invited to

program the opinion to express those are the hose and do not necessarily represent their views and opinions of WBRC management employees or advertisers\nPolice he's news radio ... five five tell you we are seeing\nBirmingham we are over and I ...\n[noise]\nThe next phase capping off site ... Fox News Brett Kavanaugh has been confirmed that the next Supreme Court justice but some Democrats are hinting they'll continue to try to learn more about the sexual misconduct allegations against can't\nBecause it is the what their experience it is the experience of what their parents did there aren't seem to be fine surely there'll be okay to even if they don't really feel that way it kind of put a little it kinda puts you know sand in their ... states Columbia just procrastinators that we can wait longer\n... and so the point of this as is\nWe're not our parents anymore the world's not like our parents world was we're living longer we're having a different experiences or the economy's different economics or different there's electronic trading now the world moves at a faster pace way faster than it\nUsed to well in pensions used to be a lot more common and I are now yeah you know I think you just said this but you talk about this all the time you know the money has to last longer you know we're living longer right as a society\nAnd that's the number one thing people worry about is will my money last will my money last and that is the big quiet\nYou know in the idea of will just live off the interest in the dividends interest\nFor as not what it was the interest rates are coming up a little bit yeah but not enough to exactly to\nWhere you can get any real interest rate a decent interest rate on bonds or you know CDs or anything like\nAnd so the the point in your head is is there's a lot of things that people do that might have been a good\nAt the at the time even your parents to put things your parents did or were probably a great idea and maybe the only thing to do with the time right just like times have changed opportunities a chain situations that change\nYou know so so are the things that we live with today I got a it's kind of like this pet I don't know if you had this are now I guess we've never talked about this but when I grew up we drove cars without seatbelts\nWhy they don't even have them not no not that we didn't awareness late we didn't have them\nAnd some other has to just hold her arm out so that we didn't flooded when when she wrote in the front literally it was like an automatic reaction right even if there was an an emergency coming if they hit the brakes on they just stuck there are many yeah and it was that older didn't she just close on us that we use I I I Know you've talked about this but didn't you used to ride in the back\nWindow of the car absolutely look at the stars yes at night it was the best thing ever and in what's weird is\nI don't know if people know that I'm a midget but you know [laughter] but me and my brother a very small we're ... we're a small family and your whole family but\nMe and my brother and when we look at both fitness got much at all [laughter] I mean just you know go opposite ways and look up there this guy and we used to I ... my\nDad had a pickup truck and me and all my friends just wrote in the back\nRight oh that's a great time yeah and I mean you would never see somebody driving around in a pickup truck bunch a ten year old kids in the back now we get upset if we see somebody with a dog in the back of the truck right I mean you know it much less your child back\nThere so you know there are a lot of things that that made sense at the time yeah ethical you know when I couldn't imagine doing now and and so\nThe reality of it is if if you're trying to figure out when can you retire use your money going to last what's gonna happen if something happens to you or your spouse\nDo you have enough how do we put all this together that's what retirement planning answers for you those are the questions we answer and this is not\nYou know Tony I was sitting down with a couple recently\nAnd they said you know we've had three different brokers and all they ever did was just talk about how to invest our money they've never asked all the questions that you've asked they've ... they don't have a process like you do you know are retired freedom process is a multi step problem solving\nProject management process of retirement is a multi decade project so we have to think through all that stuff\nAnd so I really do strongly believe that there's a big difference between retirement planning and just investing someone's money so if you're trying to answer these questions for yourself\n[laughter] take Tony's advice and get the sand out of your boats\n[laughter] that's right [laughter]\nGive us a call we can help you and so we've had people that have that have said you know are you all are always saying you know for the first in callers and you know if you call in the next ten minutes but but sometimes were not able to do that we're in the car that sort of thing\nSo uh so here's what we're going to do Tony we've talked about this\nIf you want to come see us\nAh it's okay to call us at other times other than when we're saying this okay our calendars do tend to stay pretty full ... and you know that's one of the reasons that we're\nGrowing our organization and adding advisors and that sort of thing but our calendar does tend to stay pretty full but for those who do call and the next ten minutes and walk to come in in in have a visit with us where we will analyze where are you\nCan you retire when you hope you can ... are you in a position where your money's going to last for anybody that calls in the next ten minutes\nWe're going to give you a complementary a free copy of the book that I've written with Tony's help called retire with freedom\nSo anybody that calls in the next ten minutes is going to get a free copy of this book uh we sell the book is a selling for forty nine Ninety five but you will get a free copy of this book for anybody that calls in the next ten minutes\nIf you want to answer these questions for yourself we will sit down with you and it will cost you a nickel we will go through and analyze where you are are you on the right path or the things that need to be fixed and we will give you specific detailed feedback on the good stuff in here the things we would fix call in the next ten minutes\nNine eight triple zero six that's two oh five nine eight a triple zero six we do specialize in helping people with five hundred thousand dollars or more save for retirement to to plan for retirement\nBut if you would like to come in and sit down with us and get a free copy of my book nine eight triple zero six the next ten minutes\nSo Kat continuing with the procrastination procrastinating to procrastinate encounters um you know you know just one more point on on the you know how times have changed and and then we we can't still use\nObviously a lot of the same things that we're we're a great idea or are the best we had thirty forty years ago we didn't we need to make some adjustments it it's kind of like this do you still go to your pediatrician no it's not because the pediatricians a bad guy or he doesn't know what he's doing we just don't go to the pediatrician we've got we've got to go to the\nJets and pediatricians we didn't like [laughter] but we may go to the are always the one that makes those this is not that I had one I loved and he retired on me see a lot of where I'm Out [laughter] all the best people retire [laughter] it's right there you go there and uh and the really good ones have us help them yeah exactly [laughter] so\nUm so anyway I mean it's just those kinds of things to eat you need really to to live in the direction that you need to know where you are and where you're headed and where you're going so one of the ... other things about procrastination and I I Do hear this one\nI think that ... not just our show but there's so many shows pat and so much information today there's too much information whereas like I said before our world lives at a very fast paced\nUm you know there there's just so much being thrown at us it's really hard to filter out what's real for us and what's really just something that's meant for somebody else and it's very confusing so a lot of folks hesitate because they don't know who to listen to and they're trying to listen to a bunch of different people they maybe have an adviser that are less than two\nThen they turn on our show and you know he's telling them that more telling them something out and and they pick up money magazine and they read an article there and that seems like a good idea\nAnd then somebody in the cubicle next to them has you know he's about to retire she's about to retire and they've got information that they think they've gathered but some may charter thing they went to and\nAnd then they go into their cousin at Thanksgiving and he's got some things he's got to say about it so there's just so many things and and the weird thing is is if somebody tells you something with confidence it's really hard to decipher but I Will say that if you're if you are working if somebody's working with somebody and they've been working with them for ... for a while\nLike you said earlier when they sit down with us or like you know we've never had this many questions asked they've never had this the depths of detail or this conversation before you know this is an lightning for us\nI Will say this if you're if you're getting the same information from the same person you're going to get the same advice\n... is the point you were making earlier you know we don't go to pediatrician ... pediatricians anymore it's not that they're not great doctors but that's not what we need you know we're adults\nWe have to answer the big question is will not money all my money last tries not what we were asking when we were twenty model I think\nI think the vast majority of people in and I I say I think but I Will actually take that a step further our experience clearly demonstrates\nThat most people that are nearing retirement are still working with an accumulation specialists they are they're still working with the pediatrician yeah they're still working with somebody that really their strategies are designed for thirty or forty year old\nAnd when they asked them I I Can't tell you how many times I've heard this\nWhen they ask them okay I'm getting near retirement what do I need to be doing\nI I hear one or two answers most commonly one is well we're not there yet you know when we get there will start making some adjustments the other is\nYou're fine you just need to hang in there will be pulling out a certain percentage and you know the market goes up and so over time so you just need to hang in there neither of those\nA retirement plan and it's not even an income plan I mean think about\nRanch in the big question when can you retire will your money last right exactly that's what we're helping people figure out right\nYou know sometimes they're now keeping the grandkids a couple of times a week there's just some lots of things going on\nSo the thing about this this is we're all busy I'm busy you're busy I mean we're busy doing things\nBut I think that people should ask themselves\nAre we busy just being busy or we busy actually accomplishing something it's okay to be busy with stuff that doesn't that's irrelevant and just frivolous and fun it's fun to but sometimes it's time to like accomplish something and say I need to clear out all the\nEmpty busy work and really say All right right now and lift my head up I'm ten five years away from retirement\nWhat matters to me if that's something I'm interested in doing if I Would like to figure out do do we have enough for a little behind you know what do we need to do if I'd like to figure that out now is probably the time to do that because um I got to focus on that little more that wasn't that important when I was forty but now it's becoming very important\nWell and and I know this is true for you too but\nIf if people are already retired mhm than and I would say about half the people that come see us are already retired and about half are still we're still working planning on it if they're already retired then they're big concern is is my money going to last and I'm starting to hear this more and more\nStock market's been going straight up for ten years I'm very worried about when it's gonna crash next\nAnd I've got people that come in and say the stock market ... was my balance keep going down\nBecause of their spending and market volatility and when she the order that you pull money out and and what accounts for pulling it from and how was the account your point in front of invested all that stuff matters and people are just doing things in it it's okay 'cause they don't know you know it's it's not that they know any different they haven't been\nCoached any differently or guys any differently\nIf you have someone you are relying on for advice then you're listening to that advice right and so I mean again I mean I don't I think most people are trying to do their very best for their clients I think that's true you know the board I Do too\nBut if you're not a retirement plan or and it's not really what you specialize in\nThen kind of what you've been taught to do is hey let's just invest the money and take out a percentage and you know we talked earlier about our parents living on the dividends and the interest I almost never see someone come in who's advisor has got them invested were throwing off income\nAnd it might be a little bit but certainly they might have had some stocks that have a five percent dividend some bonds that are thrown off some interest income but if you look at you know if they've got a million dollars the income the giving him interested in common is usually you know Fifteen to twenty five thousand\nYeah which is\nThat is on the high end if I see yeah sometimes I don't see how to mount\nEnough so what that means is most people's plans are constructed\nBook so that they're having to to expect\nThe markets to go up consistently to get them gains every year and a half and so now they're starting to get antsy because the markets have been a ... for so long and we all know that can't last forever and so they they're very concerned about what happens you know if we see another market crash or a big correction or something like that\nAnd a lot of times the advice they are getting is oh don't worry about that just be patient hanging there yeah that'll happen but it'll be fine\nAnd you know we've got statistical models where we can show folks if you're if we lived through another decade like the two thousands and that's your income plan mhm hey just why we've got some ... some stuff and we're going to pull money out and again\nI this is not we understand why you're doing this you're doing this because\nChances are you're advisor is telling you that what you should be doing and you're relying on them I don't\nI don't put this uh I don't put this at the at the feet of the folks that are doing it now it's it's that they want\nTo know how to do this in a way that creates certainty and gives them security and those sorts of things\nAnd everybody's telling him to do that in\nEverybody's telling them now hey you just have your money in here and we'll pull out a percentage but but we're here to tell you know there's a better way there is a better way there's a better way to do income planning than just having\nA portfolio stocks and bonds that you're going to pull a percentage out of and hope that the market doesn't crash there are better ways to do that\nAnd let me say this so so if you're too busy now ... you know you'll never not be busy and and uh I got a funny story about this on me in Utah but it's it's bad for both of us this is my butt\n'cause you'll either deal with retirement now or you'll deal with it later it's unavoidable you're going to be retired at some point and you'll either paying for it or you won't [laughter]\nSo I got a story on me and Ted this happened oh gosh eight or ten years ago um somebody came we we just had a a a person come that was an expert in this field to tell us that we needed a new hot water heater a\nMember of the story so he and we were busy okay we're very busy people don't have time to deal with stupid things like hot water heaters and so he told us that and we're like okay fine he just wants us to buy a hot\nWater heater or you're just like it's it's rusty around the bottom and you you know this thing's going to get out I was at Lincoln yeah oh and we were like seems fine to me I I I was getting hot water come to our bass into our top you know everything you know we're fine\nSo so it seemed find us we were busy we didn't really have time to mess with that and we heard what he said and we're like okay you know what I was like I tell you what next week I'll be\nAll in one of the charges like four billion\nDollars [laughter] things are free water readers so so the point is is I actually told that I said you know so this is kind of on me to well I don't it's on both of us but anyway I said you know what I'll do I promise next week see I didn't even put it on how\nLong we're going on vacation you remember that yeah\nBut but I said next week I promise I'll I'll call the apple figure this out I'll go get to mother estimates and I will I'll take the bull by the horns and I'll handle it\nAre we were about to walk out the door we walked through our basement and the hot water heater exploded I'm not kidding so here we are waters everywhere or whole basement flooded and the hot water heater just blows up I mean it it exploded\nWater is everywhere everywhere and and I mean it it's you know the carpet surreal and stuffed ruined furniture's ruin I mean there's things we literally had to throw out\nBy the time you got to get people in there that I don't know if anybody's ever had this happen to you got to get those willing buyer how some\nOld family photos and stuff about it right from my parents yep\n... and ... and you have to get that guy that comes into those people are going to the giants fans that have to ... everything dry wall\nOh my gosh I went up the drywall that take a bunch of stuff out\nSuck all the water out of our basement and dry it out for how long and so let me be clear this call says way more than if we just got into hot water heater fix when to cut told us to do it I mean I mean I was when I looked at titles like did he curses somebody to do something well and when we knew it\nNeeded done but we're ... do you do it next week yeah so so my point is that sometimes putting things off and 'cause you're too busy can cost you weigh more than if you just fix it the first place\nAnd if you're trying to answer the question when can I retire\nIs my money going to last what happens to my family if something happens to me if you're genuinely trying to figure those things are out\nDo not procrastinate the the earlier we do this ... the better off you are so ask yourself this question even if you're busy is it worth one hour of your time to protect the next twenty thirty forty years of your life to make sure that you thought to everything\nIf you would like to do that we will do that completely free with no obligation\nAnd you can call us a anytime it's convenient for you are counter Dustin tend to stay very full but for anybody to calls in the next ten minutes we're going to give you a complementary copy of my book retire with freedom\nIt tells the story of how Tony and I ended up being here doing this it it goes through and gives you our philosophy on retirement planning and it gets very specific about strategies and that sort of thing that we don't really have time to go into on the air so we think it's a very uh good guide\nTo do in retirement planning if you call them the next ten minutes you will get a complementary copy of that book we do specialize in helping people with five hundred thousand dollars or more\nSaved for retirement plan for their retirement but if you'd like to take advantage of this will sit down with you and it will cost you a nickel to help you think through this nine eight triple zero six that's two oh five nine eight triple zero six two oh five nine eight eight triple zero six\nSo the one of the last things about procrastination I'll talk about is people just are so overwhelmed they don't know where to start [noise] yup it's just a big project it seems overwhelming and they don't know where to start suddenly say this quickly we do [laughter]\nIt's all we do we ... I may not know where to start with Clinton and getting the water on the basement that that was overwhelming you should've seen her face as we were like uh oh my gosh we don't know where to start [noise]", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Freedom Financial", "city": "Birmingham", "day": "07"}
