let's get you some help and let's get a psychiatry psychologist to talk you through this figure out what happened she instead says here's a far left wing resist lawyer and this lady Deborah attach go and talk to her I mean I I don't think that's the right move either were you on that\nNo I mean let's face it to her attorneys wanted a show trial you know they wanted to make a spectacle of her\nAnd Brett Kavanaugh and that's what they got they they they weren't really representing her interest as far as as far as she said what are rich resource you ought to remain anonymous she didn't want her life publicly exposed is way but that's what her attorneys did to her\nYeah it's a Senator Ron Johnson wrestle your last question on Kavanaugh notable onto the on affordable healthcare act and and what you guys are doing a very positive way for the American people are but one last question he's now on the court and the left the screaming and yelling give us back the house will impeach him\nI mean again it's ridiculous and I'm not really sure why any voter even somebody who lean left would say well yeah I'm going to vote for impeachment for no reason um what do you make of that that sort of their mind for we're not going to kick them off the court 'cause we're so unhappy that he's on the court\nWell was there an angry mob and they they've been\nThey've had this primal screams since the day after the election when the wrong person according to them one you\nKnow I've never seen his like this job you know in my lifetime there's always some measure of honey room there's some\nYou know best wishes to any president who's taking out an enormous task growing hoping they succeeding keep this nation safe and prosperous and secure that never happened there's been an effort to sabotage this mystery from day one in the media and certainly in the Democratic party\nYeah it's a Senator Ron Johnson Republican the great state of Wisconsin let's talk about the unaffordable Gary ... used supported the president as that all Republicans and has been all Americans because our paychecks are bigger and and this this individual mandate went away you supported the tax change and the individual mandate change that actually helped people of the major\nAmount of people that were paying that find that taxes are you an Affordable Care act were middle class people that were harmed horribly you guys had a great job of lowering taxes for all Americans for corporations\nAnd getting rid of the individual mandate nobody but nobody that I Know of on either side wants to get rid of preexisting conditions although the leftist pretending that you Ron Johnson and the president on down all want to get rid of preexisting conditions that's not the case but you're a big supporter of of the individual choice and health care\nAnd the the idea that the left somehow is making it a of a political thing is strange to me why wouldn't we want individuals to have choices and competition to lower the prices fill me in on how this is unfolding and how they think this was a win for them\nWell first of all this is just another big lie remember President Obama if you'd like health care plan and keep your\nFamilies who have their previous reduced try five hundred dollars per year me was politifact two thousand Thirteen live ear right beside to be the two thousand Eighteen live a year or they they are pushing a congressional Review Act to reverse a rule where President Trump is just reinstating the short term limited duration plans right in\nThe form they were under Obama right and they're saying that we take away preexisting conditions nothing could be further from the truth the Urban Institute which is a left leaning think tank said if we reinstate these things to three to sixty four days which is they weren't or Obama yeah\nAnd then in addition to that allow companies to offer Reno ability okay so so you give people greater assurances\nFour point three million Americans will avail themselves of these plants because they're far more affordable one point seven that four point three or previously uninsured because they can't afford Obamacare\nAnd Joe the premium estimates and get their just estimates in Wisconsin for example he health\nEstimated that a family of three that the lowest cost her mom and care plan costs sixteen thousand dollars a year they can get an insurance plan getting out the same kind of coverage but something that they would choose for about twelve hundred dollars a year that's an enormous difference other estimates say premiums will be cut in half or two a quarter\nOf the current level so in other words you're paying four thousand bucks here you may be only pay a thousand so I don't know where the premiums land a complete depends on the insurance product you choose right but it's your choice you putting patients back and nothing can be further from the truth preexisting condition guarantee remains in place those protections you can always go back\nTo the Obamacare exchanges if you could afford them and of course eighty seven percent of Americans are on those are subsidized with the the vast premium tax credits so they don't care what premiums costs because the American taxpayers foot that bill\nI Want to go back to something you said it's not going to go and you said a kind of quickly but I think it's probably the most important thing to do the entire conversation\nPreexisting conditions aren't touched nobody is saying of those with preexisting conditions can no longer get healthcare they're going to die in the streets lepers or something that just really reiterate that for me center if you can is there anything in this that the president or the Senate or the house are doing that will get rid of coverage for those who have pre existing condition\nWork across the U.S we've built our reputation on having the best built best looking and most convenient sakes what great surface and

I mean to be two percent so that's that's why they're doing it\nIs it rational or reasonable Doug of ... I heard today somebody made mentioned that there's a rumor that the left is trying to do this before the midterm election if the if the Trump ... tank and he's ... he didn't work all the tax cuts and all that stuff is it reasonable rational depicted politically people can make this happen\nUm that that's a stretch that's a pretty big stretch um think about it if you're on that side of the political ledger you're kind of hurting yourself right if you're right ... thanks go down I don't see that yeah\nOkay uh each they'll gambler he's managing ... vice president of a investments of regimes that associates so as\nWe watch this you know Obama when he was an officer and talk to you about this before we started so he doesn't pay attention to the daily dry rations of the stock market or when it wasn't doing so great and and what it was doing great he said look I've read I Am\nI'm this of course the left politically is saying well see the bubbles burst for for you know sixteen months Eighteen months almost two years now\nThey've been sending the bubbles going to burst this can't continue like this\nDo you think this is something temporary and it will correct itself again\nOr are we seeing that maybe you did get to big bridge bridges\nYeah no I I think so investing the one thing that gets lost a lot of times is people you think it's a bull market or bear market and they have an opinion based on how they feel about things but\nReally what it it's a probability business and so if one were to answer that question by looking at the probabilities I think you say this fat some the regulatory reform that's positive we've had tax reform massively positive we have an economy that had been held back because the consumer\nAnd then very low in terms of their confidence in the outlook well right now and this is actually right we're at twenty year high something like that in consumer confidence I think last week we hit an all time high since Nineteen sixty nine for small business confidence so when you feel good about the prospects what do you do you open up your wallet\nAnd in that regard I have to tell you this is really profound two things first one is\nThat service so that's just simply what comes in in income or into a household and then what goes out for obligations like student loans car payments mortgages credit card debt okay read at the lowest level the percentage of income go into debt services the lowest level\nIf the mid seventies and household networks in this country such assets minus liabilities it's a hundred trillion dollars a hundred trillion all time high yeah\nSo if my debt obligations are low if my wallet or purses is full of cash as it's ever been and I feel good about things what's the odds that I'm going to suddenly just stop spending money because of the doubt drops eleven hundred points\nWell it's not affecting my spending that's a great question and it's interesting but you bring it up that way because I think it was two months ago maybe a month ago we were hearing that big box stores are reporting better sales and they've ever seen ever restaurants we're seeing more people go out to eat than they've ever seen the big scene in two generations so clearly people do have more expendable cash\n'em but you know what the media does the media has to find a good lead bleeds it leads and the stock market's bleeding right now that's where the leading with it but when people generally watch or when you when you talk to your investors the people that that you work with or do they call you immediately say oh my God what do we do or or did they say well it's kinda crazy going to go out to eat now", "show_name": "The Bulls & Bears", "year": "2018", "city": "Birmingham", "day": "13"}
