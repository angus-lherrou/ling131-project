Democrat nominee for governor who's a far left wing socialist\nA run I appreciate Joe how are you\nI'm doing good how are you doing I'm living the dream in really glad to have your own it would be a it would be bad for me to not start we're the most important story of foreigners happening and that's Panama City in that area I Know that you've been there a lot you've been you've been monitoring what's going on you been talking to the people fill my listeners and viewers in on on what you see there and how things are going\nWell they really why I mean we thought I'm born and raised in Florida and we've seen a lot of storms all the young one and two homes better Ninety to buy\nInto the worst damage I've seen in terms of Panama Sandy and in terms of Mexico beach in some of the area so\nI'm a I'm a self servants rising was totally out um they're starting to get power back off\nOn a structural damage because you had basically about category I\nHad um I talked to some of the sheriff's they're um they're actually progressing ahead of schedule which is good I think uh\nYou know one of the threat neighboring counties golf county are going to have their power on by the end of the day it's supposed to be back on which I thought was going to take another week or two but you know there's a certain amount of damage that weren't going to have a you know at that\nAge secondary obviously we're talking around to see it as former congressman he's a Republican running for governor ... um this is secondary of course but I've heard reports that I've seen reports I've read reports that voting might be an issue it might be not as easy to vote because a lot of the places that are\nTraditional polling places in that region of the Gulf Coast um or going to be out is that getting to handle is that getting taking care of who's working on that\nIt is said there's a the governor's working on that some of the local folks I think what you're going to see is they'll probably be extraordinary accommodations or the people that were displaced\nOr just for the people are still in the county so I think you're looking at adding additional\nPolling location and then I think there's going to be\nA consideration or if you are displaced or you can vote and other counties and your vocal silk out so I think they're working on that and by that\nThat's something that's doable and I think that they well look I mean you know a lot of these folks um uh you know are not necessarily thinking about voting on the first thing on their mind but at the same time\nThese are resilient people I mean you know the people in Bay county I mean they're so they're very ... minded so I think a lot of them are even\nThough they got a lot of there's got to deal with it I didn't want to appreciate the opportunity to cast a vote\nIt is a Republican Ron deceived is running for governor would reach me to float around you may or may not know this I've got several stations in Florida very highly rated in South Florida which is where I grew up I'm I'm I grew up in South Florida who's there for Twenty one years and I love to go back all the time my mom was there my sisters are there and I thought I understood the politics of the area\nI clearly don't there's there was a sea change that happened since I moved away that I didn't see coming in and the southern bureau Florida that is very heavily populated is is having a fight whether it's center writer's center left but of a lot of like the school districts and school boards and a lot of the sheriff's officers do lean left\nOr how much of a challenges it for you to get any any movement in the southern part of the state which is so populated or to understand that your your your conservative guard that believes in traditional American values that and that's a good thing for Florida\nWell look we're getting we're getting good tracks and I mean I think if you look at\nSouth Florida for the Miami Dade County huge energy with Cuban Americans\nUm other Hispanic Venezuelans and the Nicaraguan to understand the dangers of socialism\nThey don't want to see socialism in Florida they know it didn't work in their home country or we also have a very significant contrast which usually doesn't work this way in Florida politics but you know I'm One of the leading a pro Israel leaders in the country had been in the Congress\nYelling at the hospital to Israel I mean he is endorsed by a group that dream defenders which is prominent in the ... movement against Israel they say Israel genocidal apartheid state\nI led the effort to move the embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem I think that was a great day you don't want to look at the alum opposes\nHaving our embassy in Jerusalem he opposes recognizing Jerusalem as Israel's\nA total of individual capital so when you look at some of the voters who that is something that they are concerned about uh we have an opportunity to make some headway in areas that may be a Republican wouldn't 'cause the Democrat even though their party has drifted more and more in Israel and Florida\nThey usually nominate somebody who's pro Israel but they didn't find they nominated Andrew Gillum who's really aligned with the radical left which is really a very hostile to Israel now\nWell he's he's like he's really he's also a part of freedom and liberty he's also pro taxation and it'd be government he's also pro abortion me the guys are socialized launch\nMedicare for all we can get into all the problems with him but I think that it's it's even more beneficial to talk about the positives that you bring to the table you know it's interesting to me run in and I live in southern Texas now so I grew up around Hispanics I now live in a place where it's a predominantly Hispanic\nOr I've never met a Hispanic person who generally speaking as Catholic or Christian who is some far left is loon why is it that the Democrats have always been able to count on that Hispanic vote and would have guys like you and me how to do to let them know that we are on their side\nWell I don't know that day that they have always been able to I think that the Hispanic voters not monolithic I'm In Florida you know we have a lot of conservative Hispanics and in South Florida um and it's just different than I think what you would see in Texas or California", "year": "2018",
