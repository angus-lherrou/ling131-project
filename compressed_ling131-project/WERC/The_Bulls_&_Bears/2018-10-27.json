a whole nother story in our movie theaters and other other tricky how would you get that a church\nHey action sort out ... ... ... the bad guys again a good guy with a gun and I'll tell you I'm a good guy with a guy I Know and I certainly\nWhen I go to church I go to church and I take it that personal responsibility right not only protect myself but anybody that might in there that might come under attack\nAgainst the bad guy with a guy you know [noise]\nWell I first and foremost would allow concealed carry at churches but that that's for sure I carry a gun everywhere I'm allowed to ah I live in Texas still allowed to in many places but at the same time they are also signs up that prohibited from carrying my gun I think at that point if you're going to\nIf you're a church or any facility that can be deemed a soft target the simple answer is this\nIf you're not going to allow me to carry my gun in\nAnd you should but if you're not going to allow me to you better have protection there for my family and for me and that goes for any facility whether it's a movie theater or school or church or whatever I mean I'm so sick and tired of seeing signs up and say that that prevent you from carrying concealed handgun you weren't to to get a license for and\nYou've gone through the classes for a and then there is no protection whatsoever I mean we can look at the Aurora shooting a gun in Colorado that guy quite literally avoided six southern theaters in the area because they all allowed people to carry guns\nBut once the interview tack did not allow good guys like you and me to carry guns in their\nTwelve people died so we are I think that you have to work in conjunction with the synagogue\nShould either allow people to conceal carry and I don't know if they do or don't I'm guessing they don't\nOr they should they should have protections to make sure nobody gets in there with a gun I Would also close it down to one entrance an exit\nThis way anybody getting an are getting out or anybody get a good mood can be an emergency exit on the other side to get out but anybody getting into that facility\nAnd and they want to cause harm you're gonna you're gonna identify them before they can pull the trigger one time\nHere and then I got that they can do it at the land they can certainly do it at a church\nWill they will be doing it in the in the halls of Congress they do it at the White House so that people that we pay to be our legislators or representatives or a president they are protected one hundred percent I've been to the White House\nYou can't get anywhere near the place until you have a full body scan so why do they do something to protect the good guys when they're out there a church synagogue school whatever they happened to be doing\nYeah as much as I don't think it's a bad idea there there are other things I think that come into play in like obviously that economic a full body scan for example or even a metal detector and you know those are those are those items that it's not just a that\nHave an accent that the people around them and in a church probably qualified people that are going to be there anyway you know that kind of thing but then there's training and call and right now I just feel like they're\nLike I said it's not just I don't agree with you I I certainly think that it would be a great idea I also almost ... think that it's not a realistic idea at\nMy well I I think that you allow concealed carry them almost at a time if you allow concealed carry by guys like you and me\nCongregation members that people

know unfortunately I made a mistake and got blown out of my seat could uh you know there were political reasons for that as well which I described in the book but a you know what I was there to help the president of loyal to the president you know I did some a\nMedia this morning I was on CNN and try to stand when I said that I called the president a liar not what I said the president is telling the it's like that and he's covering the truth he's doing it to set your hair on fire right into a finger in your eyeball 'cause he knows it's going to distract you cause you to be like a school monitor all ...\nAnd it works every single time when you go to a CNN or MSNBC when you're walking into stores and look I've done worked at CNN headline news on fifty over there I mean how did that when you walk in it still feels good it's a nice organization but then you realize that there was a definitive spin when you walk into that ... did you know you were to get\nYou know some some left hook from them and it's hard to get you to spend the president a certain way\nPretty much on message I think they were really hitting these horror this morning and I'm trying to sell a book they figured that could kill me with the base but that's fine people that know me they know what I'm super loyal to the president to say listen I get fired Fifteen months ago I wasn't loyal to the president's Joe you would have figured it out by now or I wrote a very colorful very funny book [noise]\nAbout my relationship with him do what do you like it like it as a guy what he's like behind the scenes and by the way that a lot of research on him and his father when they were a lot younger you know his father's deceased but I'm going to get back into the seventies\nWhen his dad was working with him and mentoring in what they were like so this was a real fun book to write a ... call yesterday uh she said that she she went through the book she read it a hundred percent for Bush said\nIt was great each couldn't wait to show it to her father Kurt\n... one of his best friend said the same thing you know I listen I I I Love the president I said that from the press box you know I got criticized for saying that I Love the president two or three times when I was given my press briefing last too bad I'm a New Yorker I have to be an Italian I like to use the word love Joe and Joe ... guy we want me to do\nIt and again I'm from New York I'm an Italian ... of course short for Pagliaro so why are we we we we enjoy I get where you where you're coming from just like yesterday I got to tell you my mother's from Jamaica, Queens so as the president of these people are fighters\nWho come from Jamaica, Queens and I don't know that that the rest of American certainly not the elite media in America they don't understand that do they\nKnow they don't understand it they get sent it there's micro aggressions cricket president is that your doubt that the left wants your brain disconnected from your mouth you know you get up and emotional\nFeeling you could ever politically incorrect thing to say you are and they want that totally sanitizing edited and God Forbid you should say something that they're offended by right there was a tiny bit of a micro aggressions they started sending bottle rockets off the president place than like a Stradivarius that he does\nA ... and that's how people from queens or from my area in your area talk and I don't mean anything by it I'm sure that my personality\nI agree it's embodied Sarah moved to the blue collar President Bill blue collar president it's out now going up his great book\nLet's go back to the media stop because again you were there when he did The Apprentice he made tens of millions of dollars for NBC now NBC turned itself on him him almost immediately when he's running for president were you surprised I've talked to him seven different times he he was actually not surprised that they turned on him when he was surprised by how dirty and how nasty ... were you\nYeah I think he's been blown away I mean I I there was a scene in my book where I'm Talking about us in the oval office and he looks at me so she you know I had a forty five you're great relationship with the media will do and what happened I said there was a combination of things they don't they don't like your some of your policies\nAnd you know we we let Steve Bannon declare war on the media and that they're trying to take it out on you\nThat I and and it took them a second but he realized what was going on so he kept on going out and I think you're right the purposely looks for a cost them out and tries to tell me your fake news than the enemy turn and Acosta eats it up he does it every time you make a fool of themselves when you were dealing with the media and again give him a job for eleven days but uh but again if I thought it was really good pick\nUp a time I understand what happened but um when you were in the job did you think that the media wouldn't work with you\nDid you think that they wanted to actually get good information from the White House when the price of\nA I thought I thought we were going to have a ... month I thought there would be some kind of a peace offering me Jonah what Adam ... and the press I turn the lights and cameras back on that first day job we announced era as press secretary I did the first press conference\nAnd I ... that would be my last one I was going to focus on strategy and building the communications team and also wanted to put us in a service position if you go you can find it on the net my calms plan\nBut listen you know I'm accountable for the mistake I made I trusted a reporter\nI was having off the cuff conversation with ... everybody forgets context to\nEat was being very of secrets and flattering to me any begging me effectively did do a profile story with him yeah trail me around and I'm like well I'm not as the ban and I'm not their self promoting myself when I\nUse of expletives which I obviously regret she loved that got it shaped ran over to CNN with it right he waited he wrote this ridiculously\nHim you know exaggerated article and then you really ... you know four or five days later people look and I'm like jeeze the taste sounds like to normal guys from queens talking to each other right why would you do that to the guy and the answer is well we want to the ambush them to see if we can get him out of the White House or a you know some people thought I Would have been very effective in helping the president so\nI thought it looked if you went back in time\nIf you went and checked up a pod cast after you were named I thought it was a good pick because I felt like you were a guy who wasn't gonna pull any country just who's going to be very direct you to be very strict with the information and and you would say look if you want a relationship with a retired minister Asian here's a way it's going to work but you're right I think that you got suckered in a little bit and it doesn't feel good I've had that happened to me\nBut you got you got pulled in because you're actually trust somebody something that guys like do you want to do we want to trust people\nHe ate Joe I made a mistake it's a vicious by first place down there I didn't anticipate how bad it was a I told my Wall Street present Thirty years on Wall street now let me tell you something the worst person on Wall street is literally the best person down there so while I\nI Know how bad it is down there and it is what it is and so for me uh a lot of my book is also about that well that you know where I got up\nDusted myself off I was sort of like mayhem and they all stay commercial coming through the car crash right and I told my kids watch what I Do with this thing now because you never want to do is be on your back for too long or you don't want that left wing media to build a shame box for you to stand inside of\nYou want to be you and so I'm I'm fully expressing myself a lot of fun writing this book I Hope that people who go out and buy the book at ten percent as much fun reading it as it writing it was really an enjoyable thing for me to do a lot of research that\nIt's a Anthony Scaramucci the name of the book is the blue collar prison and I urge you to go ... go get five copies give it to your friends and family it's the blue collar president a last question and I think people are dying to know the sooner but what's the relationship now with the president\nYou know I Would say it's good I mean we we we don't talk or a super ... is the price of the United states I don't feel the need to bother him\nI had a very good conversation with him last July recording trade I put in an op ed in the F G we had a rigorous intellectual discussion about that um and I get along I mean we I think we see the world\nAre pretty similarly I'm and I'm not sure damn I Hope he's not a short me for what happening he seems to be a that kind of guy I right at the end of the book guys like ... gate bossy myself a day wasn't fired because he was fired I was fired I call this S P L Z were\nFired but loyal [laughter] so you know I I feel very good about the president is that the one of the toughest jobs in the world you I certainly didn't want to make it harder for them I was there to try and make it easier and by the way I'm here to help until I Do a lot of media surrogacy for the campaign a and I'm writing a lot of op eds warm state by state\nEverybody going to get this book the blue collar president is Anthony Scaramucci you know some of that

network a lot of you listening there and I appreciate you every single time\nIt is your boy Joe packs a note about ... before I go to John I Bush a couple of things are important number one when you called your radio show\n'em you can't both be heard at the same time so when you make an allegation that I Want to comment on it you got to stop for a second and then I'll let you continue but the fact that she wouldn't have stopped talking she thought that she would win if she kept talking unfortunately for you I have\nThe microphone and I have control of of what's being heard at any given time I now have a decision to make\nEither both of us speak the same time and my listeners and viewers don't get to hear either of us or turn you down or just hang up on you know just keep talking um it's not going to be both ways now I Am a fair guy that I'll stop and let you continue but if you're gonna make allegation after about an allegation about how great CNN is and not let me respond it's not going to work\nWhen it comes to ... because there are there are a few big lives out there about Donald Trump he was trying to ban all Muslims from coming here that's not true\nIn fact the Muslim ban or the the travel ban yes\nYes predominantly Muslim countries were involved but Ninety One\nPercent of all Muslims around the world are allowed to come here so that's a ... a Muslim or focus just not true of the second allegation is that in Charlottesville he said that white supremacists are good people or very fine people he didn't say that what he said was it's a it's a a very\nLoud debate debate an emotional debate there are very uh there are bad people on both sides there are very find people on both sides\nThat if they were talking about isn't whether white supremacy is good or bad the debate is about monuments and statues to Confederate a war heroes of soldiers or leaders\nThat's what it was about cause they're tearing down people are tearing down monuments because they feel like they can\nAnd they really can't it's against the law first of all and secondly it's a debate that we should have are there are good people on the side of of course the monuments should stay there it's our history of course there are\nOther bad people on that side yeah are there are good people on the side of terror tear it down sure or they're bad people in that side absolutely so he's been he's not a racist because of what he said about Charlottesville but those of you who have listen to CNN and MSNBC and\nAnd the other left wing media outlets saying it over and over and drawing on and on and on you actually believe\nThat he is a pro white supremacist guy he's not he's never said anything that would that would suggest that he is\nAnd this whole thing about how we mocked a disabled reporter is also ally yes the reporter does have some affliction where his hands are are are are in a position on his on his arms where I I guess he I don't know what to do with the ... it's called\nBut I'm showing people on the Web cam I mean his hands are sort of like this and when he talks his have stay like that that he doesn't have the full mobility of his hands that his in his forms as as most people do\nAnd the president what I guess the guy wrote something bad or report something bad about or negative about the president and he said do look at me any sort of did his hands in a similar fashion and made you know spoke at a at a certain kind of way well the guy doesn't speak that way so he wasn't mimicking him that way\nAnd be very good it's good of you to use your brain and actually see the other side of the story\nThere are are are ... several examples example after example of president Donald Trump before he was the president before even considering running when he's on Larry King live and other places where he's making fun of himself doing the same hand motion exactly\n... mocking the disabled reporter uh beforehand was the president was the clear boy and once he making fun of the reporter in Nineteen Ninety when reporters didn't do the report until two veteran sixteen or maybe just maybe and whether you like the fact that he does this or not\nSometimes he acts like a dark that way the president and he doesn't have that way and he speaks that way do look at me and double trouble um stupid ... you have to make a decision\nEither you're really you're going to believe what these these fake news outlets are saying and doing\nOr you're going to do your own research it independently decide what is it that he said and what is it that he meant what is it that he wrote what is it that he met with the hand motion did he do and if you ever done that before and we're not talking about this reporter and then you make the decision\nBut if you buy hook line and sinker with fake news media is giving you you're the person who's in the wrong\nAnd don't ever give me your four year degree crap\nAs if I'm some lowly radio guy or TV Guide know squat an angel in New York and I know more than you\nYou may in fact at the end of it a little more than I Do but you failed in any debate when you walk into thinking you're superior\nI'm telling you that right now I'm going to have a debate on any level with anybody at any time\nBut I'm not willing to walk into where you think you're better than I Am and you'll win the debate by reminding me of the paper that you that you got from some journalism school\nThat's not going to help you I've got Thirty years in this business Fifteen of which were I was just a journalist I was not a commentator wasn't somebody who gave an editorial is outlook I didn't write opinion pieces I gave you a straight news to the point to my viewers and listeners had no clue what what my politics work\nSo bring it next time I get Angela but you better bring it better than that All right let me get to John Hi Bush he's the guy that runs the or the Reagan facility the Reagan Institute I'm ... and it's a really interesting conversation about how that President dealt with the media and how this president deals with the media John appreciate shower you\n\nI'm just great to be with\nYou I Am really glad to have you back I got to tell you something you'll with wonderful but that thing behind just got my attention or it appears to be a plane of some sort and some beautiful flags waving the breeze John what is that\nWell we're right here at the Reagan Library that's our at fourteen and Jen is one of the famous jets that little often carrier or a President Reagan ordered to shoot down the Libyan fighter pilots when they came after our fleet at one point in Nineteen eighty six\nI Do remember that and I also remember that the President Reagan said watch this and went back in and launched an attack on
