{"month": "10", "state": "AL", "station": "WERC", "content": "We're talking thousands with an S. okay\nA little piece of free advice folks if you're going to buy a one inch filter\nBy one from your local big box store your age your lowers your home depot wherever it is that you're going through filters nowadays and here's the number one rule the number one rule is to get a filter that you cannot see through\nOkay if you can hold your filter up and you can see your hand on the other side not a good filter okay\nThat's basically is and sister take that out are looking for gold or something take that to the beach with you we call that a ... it's good for golf balls bats butterflies and stuff like that okay but it's not good at filtering\nYour air and it's not going to protect your heating and cooling system and you need protection your heating and cooling system is expensive\nOkay that's what the filters for for crying out loud okay and these people they get these little ones that you can see through I mean I can watch TV through it okay\nCome on people spend some money I'm a good filter good filters don't cost you anything they save your money okay\nNow the correct one for you to buy if you're going to get a one inch filter is a one inch pleaded\nFilter that's P pleaded filter\nLook for one that resembles the ridges and a ruffles or wavy potato chip okay goes up and down and up and down\nAnd it's going to cost you somewhere between six to twenty dollars and I know it's a big span um I don't think that I Would go for the twenty dollar one and the reason why is because while they are great filters they tend to be pretty restrictive\nAlright the machine has a hard time getting the air through them\nHaving one of those little one inch twenty dollar filters on your furnace or heat pump or air conditioner is like your eye running down the street with a wet cloth stuffed in our mouth\nYour system just has a hard time breathing through those kinds of filters and it can cause some damage All right so I buy one that costs between maybe six Fifteen dollars and here's the ticket folks are you ready for it\nChange it every thirty days whether you think it needs it or not no look I can see how that might be confusing for some of you out there but here's the deal when that filter starts to look a little dirty\nIt's becoming hard to move the air through it and when that happens\nYou use more electricity operating your blower motor\nAnd the top that off it damages the blower motor and it damages your compressor\nIt'll damage a lot of things in your system I mean filters have zero sympathy for your heat pump your furnace or your air conditioner okay so change them every thirty days please and I promise you you will absolutely thank us for it long term okay\nNow the other thing you could do is put like a five inch thick pleaded filter on some of these five inch filters will sit right on the side of your furnace or your air handler and they are way less\nStrict give them the little one inch twenty dollar ones and they do an amazing job and I'll tell you what you only have to change them about every six sometimes twelve months and that people just love [noise]\nSo thoroughly hey you're rock steppers you're saying sisters folks and get yourself a good filter good filters don't cost you a penny they pay you back in droves they give you a

[laughter]\nSo custom you're right Marty custom Taylor fitting a planet if you're listening right now and you want to get accustomed plan you\nWant your four one K. analyze Marty the big problem with four one K. is a lot of people are participating\nThey're putting money in every paycheck but they really don't know what allocation of selected they don't know if this election is they have a good and they don't know the hidden fees that exist in there and by the way folks are a lot of hidden fees and four one K. where they wouldn't be pushes or we can analyze that for you get you right on track and go according to go through a Quarterly Review process with your selections\nAnd then make sure that when it comes time to make sure that four one K. now turns into a tree retirement plan that income we can help you with that as well but the first step is to get a financial and retirement review looking at the road you're on right now the path you're going down and we take a GPS satellite view making sure that the road you're on right now will get you to the true destination you think you're going to\nAnd you'd be amazed how many people were way off course\nAnd beat every year with their visor advisor tells them everything's fine ... why do they tell them that\nWe do a lot of that money a place that's why we stress the folks who come in and get that analysis done so we put an Eighteen page report together\nAnd it is the best of luck in opinion that you ever did on your investment account we look at fees we look at expenses and we look at risk adjusted return Jeff arm are returns where they should be commensurate with amount of risk that I'm taking which is crucial and that's what we call it the personalized plant\nSo we take those Eighteen pages and we consolidate I'm right down to one page plenty AdReview interviewer radio listener right now and you have at least four hundred thousand dollars save for retirement\nThis review will be for you or strategies do work best but those have you with over a million dollars but as long as you have all these four hundred thousand or so safe retirement and in four one K. is or not you're home you're home you're not going to sell your home and live in the streets of retirement but\nAnything but real estate like that is in court right now if you have rental real estate that can be included in that\nBecause a lot of times when people get older they want to transition out of the real estate and into a safe investment that will grow it'll give them protection and it'll give them income for the rest of their life\nAnd if you have rental real estate it all depends you only get income if someone's paying your rent so we'll we'll put all that together for you if you're one of the next twenty callers right now\nAnd Marty the most important thing is they'll have their own customized income plant folks you have your own income plan if you call right now that you'll be confident in and it'll be true again it'll have gross\nIncome and protection all built in is a triple play the positive triple play in the financial world but what Marty talked about the most important part of this whole Eighteen page plan\nIs we give your own personal lives and customize calculated risk exposure level as it currently exist now based on their risk you're taking right now in the market what would happen if it went the wrong way what would it do to your portfolio and if the market keeps going up what would be on the positive side so we'll wait a positive person negatives the secret of retirement is to get that curve down\nSo if the market goes down you don't lose much if any of your retirement money now there's nothing wrong with taking risk but don't do it with money you're going to need\nAll the way through retirement we can show your own calculated risk exposure level as well as your very own income plan which we call turning a financial plan into a true\nRetirement plan no

take back into by right right yeah no I bought it their mailbox kind of thing you'd you know drive up and throw it in there and then\nIt's up to them to say you really turned it back and if not sort of like uh you ever had never library books back into the check a book out and you have to do overdue by you maybe forgot to turn it back in all summer so they they sent you a bill for like fifty
