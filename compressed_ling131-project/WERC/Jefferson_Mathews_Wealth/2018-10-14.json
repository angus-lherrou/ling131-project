take that out are looking for gold or something like that to the beach with you we call that a ... it's good for golf balls bats butterflies and stuff like that okay but it's not good at filtering your air\nAnd it's not going to protect your heating and cooling system and do you need protection your heating and cooling system is expensive\nOkay that's what the filters for for crying out loud okay and these people they get these little ones that you can see through I mean I can watch TV through it okay come on people\nSpend some money I'm a good filter good filters don't cost you anything they save your money okay\nNow the correct one for you to buy if you're going to get a one inch filter is a one inch police did\nFilter that's P pleaded filter\nLook for one that resembles the ridges and a ruffles or wavy potato chip okay goes up and down and up and down\nAnd it's going to cost you somewhere between six to twenty dollars and I know it's a big span um I don't think that I Would go for the twenty dollar one and the reason why is because while they are great filters\nThey tend to be pretty restrictive All right\nBut she has a hard time getting the air through them\nHaving one of those little one inch twenty dollar filters on your furnace or heat pump or air conditioner is like your eye running down the street with a wet cloth stuffed in our mouth\nYour system just has a hard time breathing through those kinds of filters and it can cause some damage [noise] All right so I buy one that costs between maybe six and Fifteen dollars and here's the ticket folks are you ready for it [noise]\nChange it every thirty days whether you think it needs it or not you know look I can see how that might be confusing for some of you out there but here's the deal when that filter starts to look a little dirty it's becoming hard to move the air through it and when that happens\nYou use more electricity operating your bar motor\nAnd the top that off it damages the blower motor and it damages your compressor it'll damage a lot of things in your system I mean filters have zero sympathy for your heat pump your furnace or air conditioner okay so change them every thirty days please and I promise you\nYou will absolutely thank us for it long term okay [noise]\nNow the other thing you could do is put like a five inch thick pleaded filter on\nSome of these five inch filters will sit right on the side of your furnace or your air handler and they are way less restrictive than the little one inch twenty dollar ones and they do an amazing job and I'll tell you what\nYou only have to change them about every six sometimes twelve months and that people just love\nSo thoroughly have your rock steppers you're saying sisters folks and get yourself a good filter good filters don't

hands I Want to see if we can actually get coached to answer one of these are we going to pivot away\n[laughter] All right so I'm looking at this ... you actually want to retire and you know some of them seem like things that are easily believable but I'm looking at different number for I don't make enough money to save for retirement now now coach what do you think about that can wow sounds ridiculous to me\nAgain these are these are eight rumors have desert the rumors are basically on facts not true there you go we tell ourselves them over and over again whether they come through there's something called the ... the adult fake news but force wrote about it in a way to help people identify what they shouldn't believe\nAnd so we hear this over and over again I Do I Know you probably do and ... Thomas you're thirty some years old you you have people in your age group that are probably tell you this all the time absolutely you know I Can't afford\nOr don't make enough money to save for retirement well you're making a salary now hopefully and if you're making a salary now\nThink about retirement when you're not making a salary range and think about the fact that your company doesn't have pension plan anymore no one has a pen to hardly anyone has ... wins anymore so you have to save on your oh there you go and the sooner you start saving the more you're going to have waiter mhm so like we were talking about before the show today and you know is Nineteen year old as soon as you start making money put some money away right away\nAnd so I told me yeah because you have the time that you money on your side you have ... years and years and years to build money up and so the sooner you can start saving the better\nAnd then once you save then worry about where to put it a lot of people say I have no idea where to put my money so I'm not gonna put anywhere trying to find out of it yeah yeah yeah and so then you get to retirement and it just uh you know you look at your your money and if there's nothing there [noise]\nThat's not a good strategy for retirement does not know Thomas you're talking about you know people can give they can put money away pre tax doesn't hurt as much in the four one K. plant so if you want to put ten percent of your income away your gross income it's really only cost you about seven percent wow huh right so let's say you're making I don't know let's say you make fifty thousand dollars\nA year shore or is it ten percent of that pre tax is five thousand absolutely right but it's but if you were taking that five thousand and and take it at home with you instead of putting it pre tax and your four one K.\nOkay you wouldn't have to come home with five thousand you want to come home with probably thirty seven fifty or maybe right right sure yeah cause taxes eat up a lot of money or bypassing taxes by putting the money away make sense out now you got to pay the piper eventually though don't you [laughter] shore so keep in mind if you have four one K. balances and you're looking at that for you as your retirement your sole retirement which many people are\nThe tackling heading and they get since his butt out your anger in his head

but you know it's so good though it really is All right we're going to ask Abby\nHow the exchange rate was in Canada compared America\nI'm so it was nice because when you looked at the prices in Canadian dollars you know you figure it's about a couple of dollars less in American money\nOn my my grandparents and a lot of my family's from New England Boston all river New Bedford area and I remember we'd go up there on summer vacation back in the day and every now and then you get back and change\nWhen we would go to the convenience store and buy it in the seventies candy panic in the back of the day yeah we get Canadian pennies or quarters back and they were not worth as much back then in fact if you try to buy a drink with a drink machine that they were quarterback then you put a Canadian quarter in\nAnd it would bounce right through and come out the little change returns do yep it worse than when you're thirsty and you don't have another quarter by the way\nHow are you in Canada and the tax rate it OK sane it's Thirteen percent so you know well you you subtract a couple of dollars because that's American money exchange rate but then you got to add more than you think you do because of the tax rate\nYeah exchange rate is good right now I Believe so yes and so yeah but then the taxes are bad yeah yeah there there is a real that to their taxes go for\nYou mean Thirteen or is that it would have that money where's that going to use it if I had no idea I don't know [laughter] I bet you say for a lot of health care [laughter] I Know well yeah they all have free healthcare right yep yeah\nAll right so we got this article read the article titled is from Ford's magazine and we've been talking a little bit about it because there are a lot of mistakes that people were making in the financial world don't even know it or they assume they're making mistakes so they don't do something which procrastination does no one wants to save money but what is what's what's one of your favorite of the\nCats and um I like them or kill everything will work out fine that I think that's really a a millennial kind of perspective to look at it and my my dad's saying that millennials don't have you know they feel entitled everything will just work out fine and I'll be fine or\nEven in the financial world I see a lot of this two were guys or something you've taken a lot of risks they shouldn't take on and uh we've got a very special segment right now inside this segment don't ...\nDon't fly that don't buy don't by saying that OK yeah All right now we've got to get what we talk about this thing everything will work out fine writing that's what we're talking about that's a myth right you just put money over here and everything the retirement and you'll have plenty of money\nWell people have looked at a company and we talked about this over over the course of the last year and I do a money segment and we talk about a company named dry shifts the R. Y. S. and they do a great job of promoting on all the little stock boards the message boards where people go and try to get advice which by the way that's the worst place to go get advice for anybody\n[laughter] 'cause you don't give any advice there you go hungry it'll profile of someone who can event their own profile on line to Fifteen minutes to make themselves look like a multi billionaire investor and really there just is Fifteen year old kid in the garage somewhere or if they're not getting paid by the company themselves a lot of times that happens to\nNow dry shift is famous now what what they do is they have a really good stories are called a story stock and what they'll do is they move dry goods\nWorldwide okay shifts ... so that's why it's called dry ships they moved the dry\nAnd so it seems like a novel concept well yeah that's pretty good I mean the big ships you see the big ships out in the water is gigantic tankers and all that yeah something problem is\nThey're stuck is constantly being reverse split it okay so can you explain\nWhat that is because that's what I did that confuses me so much\nOkay so are you a regular split is like when you buy a company in in splits two for one you hear about that every now and then the head hunters she has now you've got to understand yeah sounds good yeah of course the prices reflected on that so the two hundred shares is is like worth half the value of the hunter shares what's all the same\nAnd then but but confidence is high because why would they split why would they issue more shares if they weren't confident they were going to keep growing his may make some parts of the exact opposite of having confidence that your company's going to grow\nIs having non confidence to companies going to grow and you have to keep shrinking the shares okay to make the company seem viable in Asia more shareholders get more cash so when you when a company issue shares\nThe company makes that money on once the shares are out there in the in the general public\nLike let's say I I usually shares I make money at it gives me money on the company and an avid now has the shares right and then ... years to Utah Thomas I don't make any money on that they make every new money back and forth okay yeah well dry shifts what they've done is they've done something called reverse wedding\nAnd so let's say you had a hundred shares and they say we're going to give you three cheers for every hundred or\nOr for your for for what go seven ... seven years you have are going to give you one back so they take your seven and they give you one back so the stock\nPrice has to like sort well in theory it does it's it's supposedly were seven times more than ... because we have seven times less stock right right one for seven to reverse with them is the very next day it seems like they're\nIssuing more shares the companies selling more shares into the open market the looting the value wind it done this over and over and over again matter of fact in the last year they've done seven reversed with low why every twenty five years you have they give you one back a twenty five to one reverse wet yeah which is the exact opposite of a twenty five to one good with that\nAnd so then right after that they issued enough shares out there they they the company printed more seriously get the printing press fired up and they diluted the share of age that they had to do another reverse but while because they've done so many reverse bliss if you're holding one share right now it's equivalent of millions of shares if not billions of years back in the day while we went back into our\nFinancial time machine or get in there goes the door every\nFlux capacitor is overloaded\nOutweighs the bad year two thousand seven All right okay and", "show_name": "Jefferson Mathews Wealth", "year": "2018", "city": "Birmingham", "day": "14"}
