a good filter okay that's basically is and sister take that out are looking for gold or something take that to the beach with you we call that a rock stopper\nIt's good for golf balls bats butterflies and stuff like that okay but it's not good at filtering your air\nAnd it's not going to protect your heating and cooling system and you need protection your heating and cooling system is expensive\nOkay that's what the filters for for crying out loud okay and these people they get these little ones that you can see through I mean I can watch TV through it okay\nCome on people spend some money on a good filter good filters don't cost you anything they save your money okay\nNow the correct one for you to buy if you're going to get a one inch filter is a one inch police did\nFilter that's P pleaded filter look for one that resembles the ridges and a ruffles or wavy potato chip okay goes up and down and up and down and it's going to\nCost you somewhere between six to twenty dollars and I know it's a big span um I don't think that I Would go for the twenty dollar one and the reason why is because while they are great filters\nThey tend to be pretty restrictive alright the machine has a hard time getting the air through them\nHaving one of those little one inch twenty dollar filters on your furnace or heat pump or air conditioner is like your eye running down the street with a wet cloth stuffed in our mouth\nYour system just has a hard time breathing through those kinds of filters and it can cause some damage All right so I buy one that costs between maybe six Fifteen dollars and here's the ticket folks are you ready for it\nChange it every thirty days whether you think it needs that are not no look I can see how that might be confusing for some of you out there but here's the deal when that filter starts to look a little dirty it's becoming hard to move the air through it and when that happens\nYou use more electricity operating your blower motor\nAnd the top that off it damages the blower motor and it damages your compressor it'll damage a lot of things in your system I mean filters have zero sympathy for your heat bumped your furnace or air conditioner okay so change them every thirty days please and I promise you\nYou will absolutely thank us for it long term okay\nNow the other thing you could do is put like a five inch thick pleaded filter on some of these five inch filters will sit right on the side of your furnace or your air handler and they are way less restrictive\nThan the little one inch twenty dollar ones and they do an amazing job and I'll tell you what\nYou only have to change them about every six sometimes twelve months and that\nPeople just love\nSo thoroughly hey you're rocks diapers you're saying sisters folks

get you to think they're the coach of [laughter]\nA little red riding up today at a lot of golf we gotta get all the story out there too that a lot of these people are self proclaiming themselves if you were actually\nNamed coach by a group of teachers you initially helped\nWith our retirement someone tries to tell you they are called the coach asking why their goal to there you go and they'll say well because I heard ... go to southern [laughter] I Love it here is why I\nCalled the coast so I think before I even talked about that let us get into our financial time machine Shelley yes\nThe we're now in ... county North Carolina Nineteen Ninety three was a year and I was going into a school I used to meet with teachers and educate them on retirement planning and now they could save protects the deferred retirement get building up Monday through their paycheck to have a better retirement matter of fact a lot of my teachers that I work\nAbout three billion Yahoo accounts were hit

to find out how realistic your retirement plan is from a realistic expectations\nAnd it's very important to begin creating the income now that you need and retirement use some of your growth portfolio to set up a safe stable income producing foundation\nOf your portfolio you don't have a true retirement plan unless you have safe stable retirement income that will come for the rest of your life so

Kansas this genius was just released from jail and thought it was a good idea to steal a car in the jail parking lot\nCops knew it was thirty three year old Kevin Jones because it was all captured on camera\nBut before officers could chase him down they got a nine one one call reporting someone breaking into a car about six blocks away you guessed it it was Jones trying to steal car number two\nHe was arrested and the other car but that was found around the corner Jones was out of jail for less than an hour that's it for now joined us again next time I'm Steve set off the financial safari news network [noise]\nWalking back into financial support consumer advocate Thomas let's come here with you in Studio alongside the coach America's wealth financial and income coach coached Pete to root out he is a best selling author winner of many awards including ... again like I said earlier in the program I could go on and on\nIn the studio with us as well as Chris the rocket man breath our now\nCoach you were talking about financial dignity before the break and it reminded me I'm going to open up and probably get left out a little bit here [laughter]\nWagon again yesterday when I was a preteen so you've got to think like eleven twelve year old Thomas ah there was a band called ... and that was very popular back in the day that there were these kids they all had long hair\nSo I had grown my hair out because I thought it was cool and trendy I go into a gas station one day to pick up a bottle of pop bottle a coke or whatever and the ah clerk their refers to me as a female instead of the male ... cut my hair the next day some little dignity example there just to kick off the segment\nHow how how long is your hair so I'm just about down on my show I've seen pictures would you would not much here at all you have yeah is that after the the episode [laughter] or time it takes on a dignified right right well yeah it's\nIt's on again your terms so financial dignity though you know doing what you want when you want where you want with whom you want that's financial dignity and we see so many people every single week that come in from the show we talk to them\nAnd they are wondering if they have what they need put aside and places they should have it to get to retirement they want to have and unfortunately well fortunately or unfortunately unfortunately sometimes they don't but fortunately there are there are thinking about it so that we can get them on the right path mhm we call it critical thinking\nAnd its benefits we look at the benefits of of what what you're doing right now versus the benefits of something you could be doing who should I mean so it's features advantages and benefits and why would you make a decision that didn't benefit you completely and as much as it more of that anything else out there\nYeah I I Would imagine it's just not making the true comparison not not nearly being educated\nYeah we go through what we call the financial stress tests with every single item that is in your current portfolio while and then we compare that to what we would recommend is independent financial for do share as we can go out across the world\nAnd find things that makes sense to you know one of the things that are largely I keep seeing it over and over again from people that come in from other planners is these other planners are pushing like crazy these days something called a real estate investment\nTrust otherwise known as a wreaked okay for them called rats before two lines that is a real estate investment trust is when they're being pushed by financial professionals they get a pretty good commission see that's why they wished that\nAnd many times it comes right out of your return ooh okay so if you or right after the money put in so let's say a hundred thousand dollars into a real estate investment trust and the person you're buying it from is not a truth do Sherry\nThe hundred thousand dollars you put in Ninety One thousand or so goes to work for you guess where the other nine thousand Ghost Wars the guests Tom and I was\nTalking about a person sounded okay that is that makes sense knowing of ISIS immediate loss now you have for the year right unless it I mean what's that real estate goes up like crazy now here's the thing and that's bad enough that I think you agree that's bad isn't it and risk does that make you met data it does I mean that's almost ... percent right there I went to\nHarris Teeter shopping center to buy a half gallon ice cream for five dollars\nYou give the person five dollars a in of course tax cuts that on there to see how you get to the person five dollars and fifty cents [laughter] and\nWhat they do is they take your gallon ice cream to take this big knife you see like a ginsu knives [laughter]\nRemember these to cut through the cans with it and then to cut through a tomato I remember the guy to take the ginsu knives out and then they take a tape measure out and they measure one fourth of the ice cream\nAnd they cut it off a hold on to attack and then they put the dripping part of that's left the big three forced into your bag and it drifts over everything up they take that one fourth and they start eating it right in front of you that's equivalent to what happens when the person takes a fee\nAnd ... out of your money that you're trying to invest why that's a really good in the United states slice helped me slice of the money you put in some it goes in their pocket some of them do and yours while and so but that's bad enough but another thing is when you buy these real estate investment trust\nThey are ill equipped for the most part they are non traded really produce you've heard the phrase non traded read have near that I have\nYeah and probably when I met when I'm Talking about you for me you know yet what about you know yeah in that but yeah\nAll right so non trade it means if you buy it you can't sell it [laughter] right or locked okay it's sort of like when you buy silver and gold now but it's the silver gold at least is liquid because you can sell it back to the person you bought it from chore for Los yeah sure you buy it for a hundred dollars and they'll say well I'm Glad we buy back from you for night [laughter] I\nMight as my commission they say so they may commissions both ways okay yeah so be very careful if someone is peddling\nA real estate investment trust ask them why\nAnd say how does that fit in what I'm trying to do okay sure because they're taking advantage many\nAfter the fact that people know they were they want some real estate in your portfolio and if you want real estate go buy some real estate you can sell tomorrow that's what I was going\nTo ask you know we we hear a lot of people who'd advantage of the rental situation ... is very different than okay\nSo we've got this cheat sheet that you can use to and it's like oh gosh one two three four it's got six main topics in each each of those main topics has eight sub topics Mm So forty eight\nDifferent sub topic wow and six main topics but then be because you need to go through this before you buy something you'd never heard of ... like a real estate investment trust there we go yeah and one of the things that you have to say what what is that what are the strength and what are the weaknesses of that\nBecause many times when people come in and show us what they have all they've heard about the strikes\nA which is hopefully this will go up in value could sell for profit that yeah but what we're doing not liking it then it's yeah the maybe the hospital I said hopefully hopefully yeah yeah I\nCould have got to put the bell but ... said you said maybe we can do it done hopefully your fun to play with ... All right so but\nIt's not joking better people are getting into these they shouldn't get into that and a lot of that money's money they need to have liquid in a cup in the future maybe five years ten years there's no guarantee that money ... ... and there's no guarantee that money will ever go up in Bay we seen a lot of people lose a lot of money in real estate investment or I'm going to have to say about that okay at least if you buy real estate locally and if you if you negotiate a good price\nAnd maybe you get some people in there that are renting it from you can we get some income generated from there but again if you're buying the ... you're in a big pool of other people buying these big buildings or or these these commercial properties and it's no guarantee that they will stay with people in them\nYeah it sounds like your control just dive bomb\nYeah so you know Amazon has chicken a lot of people's but these days and so if you buy a shopping center and it's based on retail shopping and Amazon announces they're going to have even better deals all those companies get say business yeah and so then that property now that was a hundred percent or Ninety percent\nTaken non vacant occupied when you bought the ... now becomes twenty percent taken or eighty percent vacant ... oh there goes your money no doubt\nIt yeah so you'd be very very careful that no I didn't mean to talk about that as much as I did but that was something that was on my mind and then when is this acceptable and unacceptable to own that's another question so we'll do again who what where when why and how are all questions you ask\nAnd then when they say you want to pitch in the real estate investment trust you say how was the similar to blank\nYou know you're trying to you you said it's going to generate income has a similar to a new ...\nNot even close to being similar to the new the new he's given certain annuities guarantee certain strains of income for the rest of your wife is to get the right one okay and certainly knew what he don't have these that come out of your pocket and the broker does it make money out of your money in certain annuities ... every single read I've seen the if if a person as a broker selling it they're making some commission out of your money well now", "show_name": "Jefferson Mathews Wealth", "year": "2018", "city": "Birmingham", "day": "28"}
