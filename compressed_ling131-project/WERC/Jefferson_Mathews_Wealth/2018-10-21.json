{"month": "10", "state": "AL", "station": "WERC", "content": "Well if you are you might want to start a savings account because it's likely that you're going to need to ... lead disassemble your heating and air conditioning system have it completely clean sanitize disinfected and put it back together and that can get expensive\nWe're talking thousands with an S. okay\nA little piece of free advice folks if you're going to buy a one inch filter\nBy one from your local big box store your age your lowers your home depot wherever it is that you're going through filters nowadays and here's the number one rule the number one rule is to get a filter that you cannot see through\nOkay if you can hold your filter up and you can see your hand on the other side not a good filter okay that's basically is and sister take that out are looking for gold or something take that to the beach with you we call that a ...\nIt's good for golf balls bats butterflies and stuff like that okay but it's not good at filtering your air\nAnd it's not going to protect your heating and cooling system and you need protection your heating and cooling system is expensive\nOkay that's what the filters for for crying out loud okay and these people they get these little ones that you can see through I mean I can watch TV through it okay come on people\nSpend some money I'm a good filter good filters don't cost you anything they save your money okay\nNow the correct one for you to buy if you're going to get a one inch filter is a one inch police raided\nFilter that's P pleaded filter\nLook for one that resembles the ridges and a ruffles or wavy potato chip okay goes up and down and up and down\nAnd it's going to cost you somewhere between six to twenty dollars and I know it's a big span um I don't think that I Would go for the twenty dollar one and the reason why is because while they are great filters\nThey tend to be pretty restrictive alright the machine has a hard time getting the air through them\nHaving one of those little one inch twenty dollar filters on your furnace or heat pump or air conditioner is like your eye running down the street with a wet cloth stuffed in our mouth\nYour system just has a hard time breathing through those kinds of filters and it can cause some damage All right so I buy one that costs between maybe six Fifteen dollars and here's the ticket folks are you ready for it\nChange it every thirty days\nWhether you think it needs it or not you know look I can see how that might be confusing for some of you out there but here's the deal when that filter starts to look a little dirty it's becoming hard to move the air through it and when that happens\nYou use more electricity operating your blower motor\nAnd the top that off it damages the blower motor and it damages your compressor it'll damage a lot of things in your system I mean filters have zero sympathy for your heat pump your furnace or your air conditioner okay so change them every thirty days please and I promise you\nYou will absolutely thank us for it long term okay\nNow the other thing you could do is put like a five inch thick pleaded filter on some of these five inch filters will sit right on the side of your furnace or your air handler\nAnd they are way less restrictive than the little one inch twenty dollar ones and they do an amazing job and I'll tell you what you only have to change them about every six sometimes twelve months and that people just love\nSo thoroughly your rock steppers you're saying sisters folks and get yourself a good filter good filters don't cost you a penny they pay you back in droves they give you a great return on investment okay [noise]\nYou know I Can't tell you\nHow many people we talked to on a weekly basis have allergies or

lawmakers don't believe that Fox's gr now Scott has more live from Steve\nYou know looking at a say stick it up it must be a thunderstorm either way [laughter]\nIt's a good like the route that way about getting the cells All right so I wanted to talk about today because there's something very confusing a lot of people are having trouble with and then I see it every single day and I talked to the planet team and they see it and and people think everything's fine they've got all their money either many types of books if you are listening you know this to most all your money for retirement isn't your four one K.\nIt's in your fourth rebate you're ts be three savings plans to federal boy and\nYou really have no control there I mean you have these options they give you and many times you don't know while you're putting your money in certain places maybe a friend told you to do it or maybe that's what they were doing but you don't really have a plan put together you have a big lump sum and I call that a lump sum time bomb us when the bomb in\nIt's a friendly bomb is not that bad you didn't know was going to happen to\nYou know I don't even know it it's bad for me because I just lost water part because of a lightning strike\nOh no that's right now but we don't\nConfusion when it comes to retirement because when we get to retirement we need to have that money give us a lifetime income for the rest of our life yet all that money is in a lump sum so how do we take money out of our lump sum\nAnd know with certainty that we're not going to run out of money and that's the dilemma and that's a problem a lot of people have said what we usually recommend is something we call bucket balance right so buckets of money so we need to take your money out of that one big bucket and balance it amongst three buckets and each bucket with its own purpose\nAnd you know balancing your buckets is very important and so simple and it yeah but it's but you know 'cause we're looking at one big bucket and and if you ever have a big bucket of back in the day we'd have these gigantic ten gallon buckets we'd have to fill fill a water and bring it one place to another ... one summer and then\nForgot about him and the whatever health reasons but never tried to carry a big bucket of water that spilled over the top what happens to a lot of that let's bill I suppose it's all over you and it doesn't help you at all does it know and so every now and then uh maybe you'll lose balance in and they'll all tip over to God\nAnd so we have our money in the market bucket and the market goes the wrong way and we may just run into trouble and maybe we'll get overloaded as the market keeps going up like it does what are you going to do the money's going to continue to go up if the market goes up but at the market goes down is what people forget about what happens to your money them\nAnd how do we know with certainty that we're going to have a count that has gross protection for the market protection for peace protection from risk and also income for the rest of our life so we go through later on the show and the next day when I'm going to start talking about the buckets but I wanted to just let people know there is a way\nEspecially if you have those lump sum those big lump sum and risky accounts there's ways to make sure that some of that money can stay in the market but other money the money that you're going to depend on is going to be there when you need it the most and that has all the way through retirement or any time you need it we'd like to say you need it starts retirement planning\nTaking your financial plan turn into retirement plan by the time your age fifty two\nAnd if you're older of the fifty two that's fine I'm fifty two now but I've been at this in this arena here I'm In ... in the financial industry so I've I've been planning for retirement all my life\nBut most people are you're you're more worried about working and and I said listen I Know

better be going pretty good after twenty five years at a company or I Hope so yeah so when you when you put money into four one Kay what do you put money away for\nYour retirement that ride that steady retirement income later\nOn life so but the main problem I've seen is the options many times you don't have enough options or maybe you haven't had good guidance because you have a four one K. and the person who administers the four one K. you may luckily\nIf you're walking see that person once a year if you're lucky and you really have to say do what makes you feel good they really don't spend enough time with you and then you don't really know how the performance is or the hidden fees and therefore would just rather personal\nExperience tells me that absolutely so again the four one K. accounts or for your retirement wouldn't it be great to retire your current four one K. was not performing well what an ounce of the past year so to speak there you go you know and so a lot of people ask Ken I retire my four one K. account well I'm working\nNow economic optimism is running high end is this an opportunity to really shore up your retirement savings it's a question we ask America's well coaching best selling author coach Pete the root of coaches a strong economy a motivator to save more for retirement\nWe'll see but I think it can go both ways a lot of people get over

now folks if you're just joining us I'm Thomas Lipscomb joined alongside coach Pete ... winner of three ... to ... and ... now have to ask coach for those who may not know what is a ... award\nWell clearly is given to a best selling author ... and\nI was surprised when I got when it looks like a big golden feather okay now I can see that our studio and then our offices we have two of them and I actually have a ring the best selling author ring wow which are that they may be paid for it\nBut I thought I was qualified to get it in the spring and it looks like a Super Bowl ring decay it does yeah yeah and I got one of the one of the ... at least for success or not mix with the four okay\nOr the other one race those Evan baby steps yet when I Love the wonderful love the stories throughout it but the successor comics books with Steve Forbes is loaded with chapters on how people can make themselves better okay\nAnd Thomas we talked earlier on the show about the retirement ready to get we did I guess and make sure you retire when you're ready on your terms and\nWays to recession proof your retirement years now what does that mean to you and I say recession proof your retirement what does that mean to use the thirty two year old\nOkay so that makes me think that are in the long term when I Am ready to retire I don't have to worry if the market where to begin to thing yeah I'd have that confidence\nWell yeah because the recession and I remember my grandparents that this was back in the seventies nothing ever got thrown away food was ... I mean by grandfather make chicken one day and the next day be chicken soup chicken something else to get Detroit who knows like he would never waste the chicken as they would take the chicken bones or the turkey bone\nAnd put it in a stew pot and make turkey Stewart you go yeah so it is about making sure that everything that you have gets used the right way okay and unfortunately when we're paying fees that we don't need to pay ... you are in effect throwing that edible food away every single year yeah and\nIf that food could have been put into better use or maybe you know get a lot more food with it so basically if you're paying the you're losing the buying power for that money so we need to make sure number one rule of recession proof in your retirement is make sure to have a the reporter forensic the analysis to make sure you're not over paying on these that's\nRight and and a lot of folks maybe like throwing food away they thought I was just garbage you know anything else with\nIt so you look at a statement and it doesn't look like you have many feet right not statement where the fees are really show many times and it's looking at the actual products and strategies are in and many times of fees are built in or they are in documents that you don't know how to read\nIt's incredible every time we talk about it I just don't understand how it will I really do\nThe recession proving retirement well it shouldn't it be something called the fiduciary standard where the advisor is supposed to put your needs ahead of their needs us right I've been practicing that for twenty five years since I started very but a lot of people don't so I like to put myself in my listeners shoes in what they are doing what they need\nAnd what would make me mad is would be paying fees that don't have to pay through that I don't know about truth right double play wrong thing I hear you and so when we look at it we we want to be prepared\nNot surprising retirement so about ... ... you can retire early if you get your ducks in a row the right way we need to make sure that we don't over analyze things we get a good team planners on her side\nThat understand what your needs and desires are and custom designed\nThe plan that fits with your will be for the very very important yeah we're going to talk about this and the next segment of in real detail but nine ways to protect your nest egg hot okay how your nest egg is money you're saving for retirement\nAbout a bird it sits in the nest and it's like sits on the egg and it is it all nice and warm and it finally hatch is mhm 'cause it's growing right right well you don't want it to be stolen or or crack before you before it ... and so what are because we want to make sure but\nSome of the topics here we need to talk about is and who else out there besides million you\nIs worried about rising healthcare costs\n... a magic and many of\nRight now it's a big enough war when we have a paycheck coming in that's right and you get mad about how much comes in and that goes out to shore to think about retirement when you don't have a a work paycheck coming in and you still have now let me ask you this to the health care costs go up or down when we get closer to or to retire [laughter] we did that they would begin going yeah yeah\nSo we are going to get into the way back machine\nWe're going to talk about the nine ways to protect your nest egg this is from a class that I taught back in two thousand and five\n... about this on the radio show started by the way wow and so that's a long time by the way time but it is does it seem like it do you enjoy what you're doing exactly so we need to make sure we designed plants that we have a transfer made this conversation okay\nAnd that's an informal usually private discussion in which two or more people exchange thoughts feelings or ideas by spoken word\nOften causing someone's life to be better in some important way and that is right from Webster's Dictionary right so a transfer made his financial conversation is from my dictionary here and we're going to go through all those ways nine ways to protect your nest egg we're also going to talk about the twenty two steps now we're ...\nWe do these all behind the scenes in three appointments but the total retirement plan\nAnd this is a way to retire with confidence many times to retire early but when you retire you know everything's going to be like it should because there's no guessing\nAnd there's no might happen such right like when you talk to some advisors or here's some other radio shows the guy say\nWell if everything goes right and and certain things do happen you have about Ninety percent chance of everything being okay dangerous where Thomas what I don't like and I don't like all that stuff but the main thing that I Am for is a hundred percent chance of everything coming out right to strike so then it's not a chance anymore right All right that's right and we'll chance to become a guarantee when it's a hundred percent exactly\nWhen something you said as well coaches you want to prepare for retirement of success not one where you have to take you know ... percent of your income like a lot of people tried to shoot for\n... and again yes we ain't for a hundred and twenty percent of your working income in retirement not Seventy percent of what we call retiring which success there you go not guessing and hoping for success exactly [laughter] and I ... I Love all these legal legal these things these days where people put disclaimer at the end where they try to make a\nWell everything will be fine assuming no wait a minute and once you say that word assuming everything you just said gets a race verbal racer examine other word is but exactly you know I Want you to have a great retirement but uh uh they don't really want me to have a great retirement that yeah so we need to be concerned\nA lot of people are concerned about if they'll run out of money and retirement and so we need to check that off we need to totally eliminate that concern of running out of money and retirement but not just not running out of money but having enough money to do what we want to do when\nWe want to do it that's right period mhm no disclaimer no but no uh most of the time all these other words\nNo data mining like I heard one guy and radio show say when we were talking about the way he was talking about four percent really had a caller call in and they said well a lot of eyes are said to four percent road doesn't work it right into down market right and so he proceeded to say well it works fine that up markets don't listen to advisor who talks about the bad things [laughter]\nSo if if you've got to retire here's here's here's a good guarantee\nIf we reach retirement we have a hundred years of a marketing environment right\nWhere it will will the force that will be fined you've never run out of my all time and Wheldon Thomas we've never had a hundred straight years up in the market so if you're retired you know Murphy's law strikes a lot of times in the day he retires the data market goes wrong way exactly you know so here's what I Want to do though very important we need to get educated we need to get the proper plan in place\nAnd we need to do with confidence and we need to be comfortable with our planner", "show_name": "Jefferson Mathews Wealth", "year": "2018", "city": "Birmingham", "day": "21"}
