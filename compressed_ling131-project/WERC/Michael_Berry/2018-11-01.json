statement on air which he did that have to back down from and apologize 'cause it was so dumb that it was indefensible but but in response to that I said this is not even the dumbest thing that you will see or hear on CNN all week\n... not even this week will that be the single motion because we got election coming up next week ... people are going to try to outdo one another on the left with stupid hyperbolic destructive nasty comments\nI said it wasn't the dumbest thing this week and I present to you to prove me correct none other than Mr Don Lemon ... pie too\nI keep trying to point out to people not to demonize any one group or anyone ethnicity but we keep thinking that the biggest terrorist threat of something else some ... some people who were marching you know towards the border like a feminine and living in the last time they did this a couple of hundred people came and they you know\nMost of them to get into the country most of them are tired you know got stuck it out before they even made it to the border um\nSo we have to stop a theme and I think people and realize the biggest terrorist threat in this country is white men most of it I'm radicalized for up to the right and we have to start doing something about them there is no travel ban on them\nThere is no fan on you know they have a Muslim ban there is no white guy band so what do we do about that\n[noise] that's right folks multimillionaire CNN anchor says we need to stop demonizing people comma and understand that white men on the right or the real threat\nThere is a real evil the real monsters maybe we should ban them from traveling [noise]\n\nI didn't make him saying I'm not taking his words out of context I'm just playing for you what he said on national TV\nAnd you can say about why there's so much for a while either you're focusing on these income uh no no no she is representative of the overall mindset on the left that's why we did the montage this is this is what these people this is what the other side the left the Democrats what they think\nThey really believe\nThat they're not the problem at all when it comes to nasty overheated dangerous rhetoric and the other side is the problem dot dot dot because the other side's a bunch of evil racist Nazi bigot Gina fold you know ... ... with blood on their hands\nOh\nI see that that\nIs at the heart of why we're having such a a descent into political madness in this country they don't even have the self awareness\nThat don't even have the ... the the the honesty\nTo be able to understand that you are not going to improve the temperature of political rhetoric if in fact your go to position is that the political rhetoric is bad because the other side is basically Hitler\nAnd I wasn't exactly how many how many references to rights and you know the right stack fires and Nazis and ever did you hear that opening montage\nThis is how they think about the other side and you know that you know what it really drives a lot of this\nIs the success of the successes that Trump has and the relative failures of the eight years of Obama's and before it\nOr that they told us they being all the opponents to the Trump movement they told us that he would fail miserably that he was completely in over his head that he had no idea what he was doing\nAnd that we would all essentially they will be able to laugh at us as we all suffered the horrible\nConsequences of having Donald Trump as president but you see\nWe have suffered the consequences of Donald Trump as president and it's suffering with things such as the lowest unemployment rate in sixty years the lowest black and Hispanic unemployment rates of all time a booming economy a ton\nOf investment no massive foreign wars getting started no crazy foreign military interventions that are going to stand our bravest and best Americans into harm's way for missions that the powers that be already been clear on how they're supposed to end and what's supposed to happen\nThat's that's\nThose are the consequences of Trump ism and now that we've felt that for\nTwo years now that we've seen it for ourselves there's a desperation\nOn the left what does it say about\nThe judgment of some of the most celebrated names in\nThe Democrat Party whether it's politicians or pundits or anybody with real power in ... what does it say that they have been wrong wrong wrong all they can do is\nCriticized Trump's words his persona his attitude\nIs tone a but they're not able to say oh look at this issue of look at this major policy issue where we're from either lied to his lied to his supporters lied to his base or failed miserably\nNo quite the opposite\nThey they hate Trump more because he is successful they hate Trump more because he is by his ability to withstand them and succeed despite all their efforts\nHe's in a front to the left very sense of self\nHe makes them feel insecure about their beliefs and on the left belief and politics are tied together in such a way that the true believers the left wing zealots don't know who they are if they do not have their\nProgressive virtue signaling they don't know who they are\nIf they can't believe that CNN is objective and the New York times isn't liberal and you know all the smart people all the good people\nVote Democrat it rattles them in a way that people that view politics really just as a as a system for managing conflict in a\nIn a civil society which is what I think conservatives that have a good perspective on this understand it to be a don't feel as shaken up\nRight we see this is okay what are we getting how's it going what are the results we try to take a rational approach to it and and even a somewhat just passionate about\nYou know bash Trump's session these people\nAre a disgrace and you don't really comes down to they don't believe that he's the president they ... they they don't accept it not my president\nMy president you remember that the chance on the streets they think that he's not just not their president but he's not the president period\nUnfortunately they are wrong\nBut they're delusional enough that they think it doesn't matter or they should be ashamed but as we see [noise] progressive there aren't capable of shame these days\nPeople still think an education from northern Virginia community colleges just\nSettling but when you think about it

Mr buckled the wisest one I I really enjoy your show your your your discussions are extremely thoughtful I really appreciate that you're very kind on the other thing that they don't want to mention it and believe it or at the scene of ties in with Don Lemon\nDog the left has their own then on the towards white men Israelis they're down towards losing working class voters\nOn and especially with the Trump presidency they've lost a lot of union ... this is their animals towards like working class voters but but but that's not really my main point on\nThe ... thing I Wonder and wondering is on the ... this whole birther thing got me thinking about anchor babies when it comes to welfare all day because there's a crisis on the caravan coming and then two more caravans after that caravan\nUm what what do you think any idea of Trump freezing brand new welfare applications in light of this crisis until this gets sorted out\nBecause one of my pet peeve destroy a long long time is that people don't understand that a white in his country means your your ability and freedom to do something it is lots of white the pound and a government desk and expect money\nWell in terms of welfare and and immigrants I can say that\nTechnically new immigrant including legal immigrants are supposed to be on welfare in fact in immigration law there's a\nThere's a there are clauses about how you cannot be a a ward of the states are so you cannot be dependent on the state and that they know and that's that's supposed to be the way that we're in our immigration system\nIs set up as we know that's not the case what ends up happening is for example with the anchor ah the anchor baby issue once you have and as a child who is a is it given citizenship either to uh to illegal parents then\nBenefits accrue to that child so then you start and and it goes to the household so essentially the benefits start coming in for that child and they have to go through the adults right you don't give a a a a two year old you don't give a newborn\nA government benefits you have to give it to the parents and ... so there are ways that families because they also will adjust these things for family size so even if you have a few illegals and a few legal living together or they'll do an immigrant I mean they will do welfare benefits based upon", "show_name": "Michael Berry", "year": "2018", "city": "Birmingham", "day": "01"}
