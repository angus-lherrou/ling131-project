this feeling\nThat the targets as his particular devices as we've been reporting so far are all connected to individuals that the president but typically and has political allies have been attacking\nThese are all people who have been or perceived to be critics of the president who have been the subject of his criticism very directly\nIf you look at who they've targeted so far it's almost like they're following Donald Trump's Twitter feed and people are going to act out and there's no human being more responsible for the climate weren't that Donald Trump\nThe president and his allies they need to dial down to the political rhetoric they are making people let's say they are making journalists last day and they are making law enforcement\nSorry ...\nLet's remember we have a president who has talked for a couple of years now about imprisoning his political rival and Hillary Clinton who is encouraging violence against the media\nBut there's an obvious thread the Obamas the Clintons John Brennan CNN um George Soros these are people and organizations that President Trump continually attack will demonize us\nWho I Believe the heated rhetoric that toxic environment\nIs part of this [noise]\nYes we are in an era now where violence seems to have licensed by the president of United States\nAll the president's fault you see almost everything that\nGoes wrong in this country according to the left is Trump's fault\nIf someone is a in a high profile sexual assault case it's Trump's fault if someone says something mean to someone somewhere it's Trump's fault if someone engages in a hate crime or says something racist somewhere it's comes full these people are nuts\nThey have really lost it ...\nYou know that there's this whole Jake Tapper trumpet demonizing them oh as if the media doesn't demonize the president and those around him by the way we CNN makes it very clear that they will not be happy until ... some of the top people in the White House or arrested\nHim and they want them to go to prison that that's clear from their coverage they want to see them in cells the left doesn't just want Trump to no longer be president they want him to be ruined and destroyed an air concocting narratives to achieve that their rights are hoping for they're trying to make it happen\nI've talked to a quarter page I've talked to Papadopoulos talk these guys this whole thing is we're still is about Russia collusion it's insane\nAnd what does Russia collusion really at its core what is it all about Trump as a traitor that's what they're telling the Trump is guilty of treason\nThat's what they're saying I'm not making this up I'm not exaggerating pressing that states he's a traitor according to meet you meet it is a traitor according to Democratic Party with no evidence but what not\nAnd they want to talk about demonizing place\nWhere I Know we don't often take that many calls here because I could socialize city we have every single line late and I know there's a lot more people that are when you get in and I want to hear from you on this so uh let's get to it a first up Tim in Phoenix welcome to boxing show\nNew ... trend\nShe'll time in this group is this what was going well how are you\n[laughter] you buddy a woman I said when you stay with us five ... felt the just over the head as it's not a cost but but it sounds like the left and the media and I'm not saying\nChange shape than their share Carol Dan\nSemi add a little bit of a soft on a little tough time here you're saying that this changes the narrative away from damaging things for the Democrats you bet ... that\nJust as that is true it does do that so there's no question about that they'd much rather talk about this in Trump's rhetoric and how bad he is and then I mean the caravan was a loser for the laugh which they didn't figure out until too late and and they're still hoping that everyone just forgets about what they didn't know Kavanaugh situation so\nAbsolutely no problem with John ... yeah yeah I actually calling into shields uh uh we've got Charlie in Maryland hey Charlie\n... thanks for taking my call book I just got a question you dealt with the FBI and their investigation of this a bomb threats\nAnd it turns out to be a ... a less deep political move\nHappens and can make so called comedy shows it happened in the so called news channels it happens in the mainstream media happens everywhere really the New York times perfect tighten up five novelist imagining Trump's next chapter you know one including murder\nGood grief ... that's that's maybe a little inappropriate for president you think\nYou know it's and then to watch the calls for civilian it just brings hallowed to me and I'm not blaming these people they you know they can do what they want this what the Democrats do every two and four years we have some interesting developments in the state of New Jersey\nWe might have a race\nAnd then this is only up by three points people in New Jersey of figured out who Menendez is just like in Minnesota people have figured out who Keith Ellison is he's down seven\nIt looks like you know when now finding out that people have figured out who reticent is down in Tennessee and who McCaskill is in Missouri and who's Christine seminar cinema isn't a you know for sure I don't have a problem in America and throwing the Taliban\nWhy would she get one vote in Arizona after being that crazy\nBut we have a race there in the ... race now with the attorney general of West Virginia Patrick ... he's up by two over Joe Manchin a lot of people weren't expecting that but when you think about it is logical\nAll the success of the west Virginia economy and saving coal jobs and energy jobs and all the prosperity is because of Trump's policies and mansion didn't even support the tax cuts and frankly my guess is the capital vote was just an election year conversion it'll go right back to supporting Chuck Schumer\nAnd Missouri you've got the Daily Caller reporting that Josh Hawley who's running against Claire McCaskill sharing a photo of a yard sign that have been vandalized with a swastika and his name on the sign is this what it's really come down to we asked you now the Missouri attorney general\nClaire McCaskill also caught on tape saying I'm just like Obama I'm just I'm just saying these things to get elected um she doesn't care about raining in or or representing the people of Missouri\nAnd you've got another Daily Caller report\nTalks about non exploding bombs turned up yesterday and today the New York times has no reason to seemingly to apologize but the Trump assassination fantasy that they published the day before the\nPipe bomb was discovered the first one\nTimes publishing ... short story about assassinating president Donald Trump on Tuesday one day before potential explosive devices showed up at the addresses of all these political figures New York times are asking novelist to conjure up possible outcomes to Robert Mueller's investigation\nThey don't care you know the only care about Russia collusion as long as it's a Republican only care about sexual misconduct or salt if it's a Republican they ignore Ellison Spartacus Clinton\nThey only care about incendiary language when they think it comes from a conservative not their own\nBy the way Charles Grassley is issued a criminal referrals for ... and Julie sweating ... remember she was the woman that made the accusation oh that almost on a weekend basis they would they would spike the punch bowl and boys would line up in the halls and they would then take turns gang raping\nYoung teenage girls\nAnyway Grassley announced he's referring Julie sweat neck and I've been out into the Justice Department for potential criminal investigation into the potential they made false statements to Congress\nAbout time somebody follows up Chelsea Clinton saying she might run for office of

continue more of the Sean Hannity show eight hundred nine four one Sean is our number Paul is in Ohio Paul you're on the Sean Hannity show glad you called sir\nYes sir thank you for taking my call what's going on how are you\nA good good first of all want to thank you for your exposure of the left and liberal for you know who they really are and um uh the reason I'm calling today is concerning a repeal and replace Obamacare\nA I Know other stories or you know kind of taking the lead now but we really don't hear a whole bunch about a repeal and replace much anymore it was just wondering if you could give us\nAn update about Republicans are doing\nIf we in two weeks to have a more Republican senators which I think is very very possible and West Virginia being and plays huge if we can hold on to the house you know it doesn't matter what the margin of we hold on\nWhich is far more difficult I'm worried more about the house races then the Senate races\nIf we can get those two victories I guarantee you that Obamacare will be repealed and replaced and then we're going to have and by the way pre existing conditions of big lie that's being told all over the country\nOr the Republican bill dealt with pre existing conditions nobody is going to be denied coverage because they have a preexisting condition but\nYou know innovative solutions like we've been talking about I've been able to get Dr Josh amber atlas MD in front of a lot of politicians that all love the paradigm he's created in Wichita\nHe's duplicated in and close to five hundred cities now and that is fifty bucks a month unlimited concierge care for adults Ninety five percent productions in in pharmaceuticals\nOr even breast cancer medicine certain medicines he's getting for six bucks a treatment for people and you couple that with catastrophic care which is very inexpensive in case you have a heart attack cancer or a bad car accident\nAnd you have the best concierge charity ever dreamed up twenty four hour access to a doctor\nOh your primary care doctor do you get your check ups every year you get great reduction and pharmaceuticals and if something really really bad happens you have the hospital care at a very reduced rate because it's it's catastrophic it's only for the worst case scenario\nAnd it's much less expensive so I think all of that health savings accounts there all the table and I'd love to see that for every American imagine\nConcierge blue ... medical treatment for every American we can do that but it's not going to happen top down from the government you know or if you block grant the money to the states where you have you know fifty states have been a vacation\nLet me tell you what's going to rise to the top those they're going to want to turn over every nickel in those states to make it work for the people of those states or they're not going to be in power and I think that is far more economically efficient so there are a lot of good ideas I was disappointed with the Republicans last time we know John McCain had a chance to to fix this and decided against that last minute\nBut does the president's not done the individual mandate is done thankfully things to the tax bill that was passed\nUm but we've got a lot more work to do on it absolutely just like we need to fund the border wall that's also something that'll get done if we hold the house and Senate in in twelve days are but I'm focused on these house races all say it again\nEvery single house race matters\nSome more important than others we put up the most important on my website Hannity dot com\nAnd the top races that are going to tip the balance of power in the house of representatives but you know if you don't get out and vote in every ... we have four hundred and thirty five house races in play here even if you think your guy safe go vote even if your guys behind go vote\nDon't take don't leave it to chance Democrats are going to come out as soon as we have history working against us\nBut I Do believe that we can pick up the Senate seats look I think we can win Florida real little behind them Florida with Nelson and with the Centers for governor Marsha Blackburn who's going to join us later she can and should win Tennessee Claire McCaskill should lose to Josh Hawley a Dean Heller needs to hang on in about\nA we definitely need more than ...

I Love music city\nAnd I love the people of Nashville and I've got to imagine they were pretty insulted a and a little bit shocked that somebody would be that duplicitous behind the scenes and then when he he said well those are just college kids volunteers and we find out no that's a full time staff\nAre I'm sure that uh he was embarrassed again\nI'm certain that they should have been embarrassed whether or not but of course he didn't they start saying well it ...\nWas our campaign my campaign that put somebody in there which is not this was a project their toss project but they started saying well all these other excuses but the point as they got caught they got caught saying we made this decision\nBecause we want to go to people about where he is don't worry he's gotta get get crap when he gets there\nSo you got to say this that and the other in order to get up there and it's\nLike as a parent I mean when when your kids do something wrong my kids do something wrong\nWhich rarely happens ah kidding but uh you know what it's not I'm I'm never is mad at what they did but if they try to lie to me about it then they're in big trouble\nNot a little trouble I don't care what it is I can deal with a mistake I Can't deal with you lying to me looking in my eyes and just outright lying to me and my line to my kids is you\nKnow I I Am not stupid stop treating me like I Am stupid I'm fries it's crushed is frustrated dodge swear to God I Swear and when you know darn well they did it\nThat well that is true and\nIn any of our relationships whether it's family members are now that we've worked where so where in church organizations with we expect them to tell us the choice to have that integrity to speak the truth\nAnd when you don't then it causes a raft and that is what you're seeing with the brightest and campaigns\nAs people are saying look if she didn't want to get you say and what people know about me is that they may not always agree with me but they are always going to know where I stand and that that is has been central\nTo me as a part of my public service and people expect that and\nI don't do a long time\nA congresswoman and I know you'd make a great senator and I hope the people of Tennessee understand that um what are the issues because the economy's doing very well in Tennessee things are looking up we've had two years of great economic growth since Donald Trump's but president\nOut of the people of Tennessee feel about the president's policies and and the important vote the boats that you will be casting that if you become the next great senator from Tennessee\nIf people are so supportive of president Donald Trump and say look to see his policies succeeded they want to give my ... going to be a conservative and it's going to support President Trump and his policies say well look constitutional Supreme Court justices and federal judges\nThey want to keep the tax cuts the economy is so good in Tennessee it has the fastest growing median household income in the southeast\nAnd that's awesome battered for you to them fast they deserve a trade\nYes absolutely and I tell you something else building the walls securing that southern border and it was just caravan marching through Guatemala and Mexico people are saying\nLook secure that border theirself rightly or wrongly come to the United states we've among people to come to the right way respect the rule of law you\nKnow what Congress owner that wall was up I'm very concerned because we have to protect our\nOr constitutional republic we've got we're based on the rule of law we have borders sovereignty issues here if they ever get we had the wall up nobody would be marching they would be following the law and the proper process\nAnd necessary vetting if they want to come and visit or maybe even come and say we don't care where you come from we just need to know you you are somebody that accepts our values wants to be a part of our family and doesn't have any intentions to cause any harm or doesn't need assistance the minute you get here\n[noise] that's right and then in Paris, Tennessee today and Camden and I'm telling you Sean that is what people say this is why we need the wall this is why we need to make sure that sanctuary city policies are into it because\nWe want to protect our communities without it every town to

leader and I doubt that he's going to be whatever support of Kavanaugh\nAnd he's going to go along with the resistance and they pretty much said as much and I think for the people Tennessee this was a clear choice election\nYou want your tax cuts do you want to make them permanent you want to keep them do you want to eliminate burdensome regulation and keep it that way do you want America to be energy independent you want to secure the southern border\nUm do you want the record low unemployment we have to continue you want an innovative help alternative healthcare alternative that will
