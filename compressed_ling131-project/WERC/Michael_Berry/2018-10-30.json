{"month": "10", "state": "AL", "station": "WERC", "content": "Kennedy tonight at nine eastern on the Fox news channel we will talk about the synagogue shooting that took place over the weekend\nA caught in such a horrific circumstances this and now we do what we can with in some cases direct aid and assistance but also just just prayer\nAnd uh and words of support and everything else that we can do for the Jewish community in this country\nAnd yet it immediately turns into a political issue\nAnd without\nA moment self reflection without taking just a beat to let the American people more than they make this about\nTrump these people who do this every day on every issue at all times are are sick\nThey have a problem they really do there are no longer capable of being objective you know last week we were told\nThat there was a bomber who Trump is responsible for it because this guy would already called it a bomb threat you know over a decade before Trump's presidential run and at a uh a career criminal clearly you know psychological problems\nBut Trump's responsible because he criticizes people in the political arena and those are the people that were being targeted they can't point to Trump ever ... ever inciting or or calling for violence against any of those individuals but\nThey say that Trump is basically responsible did they use these kind of weasel words they'll say oh well he's he bears some share of the blame and you know 'cause they know the Trump didn't pack the bombs himself you know Trump wasn't wasn't crushing up glass to use the shrapnel for they're not that\nCrazy I suppose they're not that stupid but they'll say that Trump was the reason for this in some way\nAnd what the point you as well he had his van this guy had this van say oc covered in Trump's stickers covered in all of this pro mug up paraphernalia and so we had to deal with this last week we talked about on the show now here we are over the weekend there's this terrible shooting on on\nSaturday on on the Jewish Sabbath and\nWe are told that even though this shooter it is clear did not like Trump because specifically Trump was too friendly and chew favorable and too much of a friend to the Jews\nIt's still Trump's fault now if we take this theory\nAt face value this theory that Trump is just raised hate in America\nLet's be clear that that means that now Trump is responsible no matter who in gauges and they hate crime against anyone else you know if there is an anti Christian an anti Catholic\nYou know hate crime in this country let's say you know ... or ... you know if there's if there's an Islamist extremists let's just put it this is a jihadist kills a bunch of people in his that Trump's fault\nI Want to know where the lines are drawn here\nAnd I think the answer by the way they would claim it's Trump's fault because you see somebody from the Islamic community if they were radicalized it would be because of Trump's anti Muslim rhetoric so he would bear some of the share of responsibility for that too if they\nYou know neo Nazi white nationalist kill somebody somewhere at Trump's fault because she has implicitly encourage them they'll say\nIf a anti Semite who is anti Trump you know you got on this list doesn't matter who does Trump is always responsible\nNo matter what the situation if it's a terrible circumstance if there is violence and bloodshed here in America and there's there's hate and there's venom and there's nastiness\nAt it's at the root of it all eat is Trump's fault they say this is to lose you know\nAnd it's really destructive to how can you have a conversation with somebody about Trump's policies when they really believe that he's dog whistling to white supremacist all the time\nIn ways that I Can't even begin to fathom\nI I I'm paying attention to politics all day I'm hearing the swamp I this is I live in brief politics and national security and I have no idea what some of these other pundits and and ... and such you're talking about sometimes no I'm like what are they what it will play something for you later you'll here's what does that even mean\nWho are these idiots\nWho's paying so much to be so stupid on TV all the time and so they they talk about division as they are creating divisions I mean this is how you know that the left cannot be taken seriously on this\nThey will try to escalate rhetoric\nWhile saying that rest a rhetoric needs to be de escalated they'll say the reason we have terrorism and hate in this country is because of Donald Trump so Donald Trump needs to stop saying that the other side is bad\nOh that seems like a brilliant idea for Trump why not just caved your political opponents let them beat you and your submission\nBludgeon you into silence on issues that matter to you by\nAttaching all these issues all these problems all this violence is nothing to do with it\n\nThey're calling President Trump and anti Semite I mean President Trump grew up in New York City he's served as did I which is a city that has\nI Believe the largest Jewish population anywhere outside of Israel in the world Trump is is has had countless friends who are Jewish his personal lawyer Michael Cohen I Know they've had a falling out but you know he was Jewish his son in law's Jewish market convert to Judaism is grandkids are Trump is not an anti\nSemite not even a little bit not even close\nBut they say this the media says they pat themselves in that oh that's right yeah we're speaking truth to power know\nYou're a bunch of destructive little individuals that are saying this\nIt's immoral to make these claims it's immoral to call someone an anti Semite was blood on his hands because somebody else who hates the president who despises his position for Jews decides\nTo be violent engages in this in this replicate crime and he's now facing the death penalty and good this guy should get the death penalty for what he he did and that's in a guy\nTrying to track attached drawn to this though it's just so intellectually dishonest each show unfair and it just\nTo show you that there's there's no effort in good faith there is no let's have a real you know last week was all okay let's let's tone things down\nCover and with the comments section of some website then he pulled together\nAnd deciding to take these incredibly violent because everyone agrees with this guy did was discussing the president said everyone has said it but I think something else going on now on the left\nWhere they seem to think that this kind of intimidation is warranted because they think the Trump is a fascist because Trump is destroying the country because Trump is undermining our institution that is the rhetoric that's coming from the top of the Democratic party enemy the apparatus arena and all the time when\nYour\nAll of that is true then by all of the reiterate all of it\nRepeating all of it I mean it it is what needs to be said here in this moment to oh we all need to come together really need to come together here's like well here's what they put on TV over at MSNBC the politics editor here's where he has to say about Trump when we're all supposed to come together now for twenty four\nAs much as I may have criticisms of how law enforcement operate in this country they are still our line of defense against maniacs and terrorists out there but but I I have to say nickel and this has always been a problem with this president he has always shown a sympathy or a dismissive this towards terrorism\nUh he is a is a a terrorist sympathizers or I mean given the way that he responded what happened in Charlottesville given how he responded to go she'll be given the fact that he he puts what's happened today and through this week and the concept of how it affects the midterm elections we don't have leadership\nIn this country when it comes to domestic terrorism this president foment but uh as much as he is occasionally for speaking against it a\nTerrorist sympathizers you MSNBC politics editor calls the president of United States\nHow much more stupidity do we have to really be subjected to before we just said I I just don't want to hear from these from these idiots anymore I just I just can't I Can't ... I Can't even pretend to engage and here there are arguments I I feel this from friends of mine they say I'm just sick of it and I understand the feeling sometimes\nYou know and and I spend a lotta time drawing a lot of left us and it is it is no easy task these days you know what this really comes down to and this is what they don't want to tell you they know that they are not going to win the Senate and they know that the house is going to be tight and the left is\nAware somewhere deep down that if Trump was anywhere near this monster this caricature that they've been saying for all this time\nThan Trump should get blown out his party should get blown out in the midterms right it should be wipe out in favor the Democrats what does it say that almost two years into the Trump presidency who they say is a traitor and a fascist\nIn a big it and a rapist and all these horrible things what does it say that the party that has led by that guy\nIs going to gain Senate seats and almost even though it's an off year election hold on to the house of representatives\nHow much more out of touch and diluted can the Democratic party be that's the question they don't want to have to do it's just so much easier for them so much more satisfying to say that it's just all about how Trump is a race just at a terrorist sympathizers\nJust not true [noise]\nThey don't Birmingham Christmas last chance election is going on right now even on Christmas gift to sixty five percent off guns vacation spot packages concert tickets items to the home and so much more opposite ends of member fish don't if they don't Birmingham dot com powered by Alan trust credit\n[noise] they don't want them a little sick of flip a lot of politicians hot air and the U.S after glimpse at the top of the games\nAre lying to us highlights of Sean Hannity happen entirely moral afternoon I Do want news radio one oh five doubled you we are in the\nNews I'm rich Dennison the man accused of going down to eleven people

the White House's deploying fifty two hundred military personnel along the nation's border with Mexico as a caravan of asylum seekers makes his way from Central America late\nLast week at ... and it's pointed to only eight hundred US troops deploying but their mission remains unchanged official said these are support troops like engineers not combat troops\nFox's Lucas Tomlin so that the Pentagon

secure renovations Facebook page [noise]\nHe's holding the line for America bug sex thing is that\nAnd that's what the rhetoric is doing is giving\nA people a license or certainly unbalanced people certainly people on the fringes of American Life but it is telling them that what you're doing a is okay and that's why yes there are always been an anti Semitic incidents that American history\nNationalism go hand in hand with the anti senators have the entire idea of anti Semitism is conflict is outside the body Hal attack outside the death of ... of ... and that's like Donald Trump guys that his fame that's what his party is now committed can dealing\nA limit nation is the rhetoric and the president has not been dabbling in elimination his rhetoric at some point he doesn't dog whistle teams as megaphones to tell these tribes that they belong to him and this is waiting to violence directly\nDirectly leading to violence they say it is not\nSomewhat or partially Trump's fault I mean I saw a a an editorial about this over the weekend in the Washington Post no less saying that uh it is directly\nSomewhat you know that they'll always put his qualifier it's Trump's fall to an extent\nYou know or you know drunk Trump should hold some some level of of the blame here uh this is this is disgusting it's disgraceful but when you have the\nIndividuals in the media who have taken Trump's entire presidency so personally ... and as an affront to their greatness and their values and how wonderful they are\nAre there are no limits really on the Bible that they will throw at this present there are no there's no good faith there is no decency whatsoever that they will extend to him an end to his supporters\nTo all of us remember it's not just about Trump underneath all of this there's always this heaving\nHatred of the Trump voter too that's a part of the anti Trump movement they they despise voters they don't cause they don't think that really we've been fooled\nThey figured out enough now I Believe the left is in the media and the Democrat Party have figured out that we've made this bargaining word good with it were like yeah I like Trump I I Know he's not perfect I Know we make mistakes but\nI think Trump is actually the right choice for America right now so they hate us because of all of that and that's why they feel completely justified and saying just the most despicable disgusting things I mean here's here's a another Washington Post personal over at MSNBC play three\nThere's always been the old right or its equivalent the differences it was always on the French and the mainstream elements of the party and certainly the president's ah never validated that\nAh what's happening what so extremely dangerous about this is you now have the man with the largest megaphone in the world\nGiving a nod in a way sometimes outright praise or to the folks who are carrying on these conspiracy theories and it is telling them these people that it's okay that they're getting a blessing to do this\nYou know it's it's interesting that that you can go on TV that Dana Milbank Washington Post\nAnd say that Trump gives them a blessing right after he use explicitly openly repeatedly condemned this but you see this is one of the games that they play they'll say why doesn't Trump why doesn't Trump condemn white nationalist\nAnd people will say okay well he did he just condemned them a couple of days ago well well he hasn't denounced it enough and then people will do a little Google surgery and will say well we're on a second Trump is called white nationalist losers he said there's no place in America for hate he said this many many times then they'll say well\nThe ... from talking about white nationalist so much you can't win folks\nYou you know it's there's nothing he can\nDo that will make them stop calling him a racist stop calling him a white nationalist they they do not extend the most basic\nLevel of good faith do them in any of these discussions and and they love to try it out these these fake conservatism is fake Republicans like Jennifer Rubin who is that\nShe is the queen of fake Republicans the Washington Post still list or as a Republican when she writes thing which is just amazing but you know she she blames Trump not just for what\nHappened over the weekend what happened last week but for the overall increasing hate in America she says like the before and that\nOf ... side of downtown ... faith that we've had at fifty seven percent tax and the last year and anti snack hate crimes\nBut that doesn't stop them they're so desperate to get noticed\nSo desperate to help the Democratic allies and friends when one week from today it's pathetic\nFrankly it's slander and then of itself\nWe've got to get to the point in this country of you skip slandered you ought to be able to sue and I have a chance to win or you have to prove the absence of malice well how about an absence of research because if they ever listen to watch they see a very different Sean Hannity than the caricature that they paint\nWhen do you know the sewers Ferris to us in the news media I could not believe I was on the front

see him go to the U.S Senate that too is a tight race\nLet's talk about the FBI investigator buying what thousand dollar Hamilton tickets for Andrew Gillum and you're saying that there was a quid pro quo involved well\nThis guy was posing as a developer a he went and he paid for Andrew at least a thousand dollars for that ticket that's an illegal gift ended up itself Andrew never ordered it\nThis developer wanted a zoning change in so happy and sure enough later he got that there were text messages release were that an FBI agent is a tax thing that the main lobby is buddy of Andrew saying really appreciated mayor coming through\nAh why wasn't he got arrested isn't that buying influence in corruption well there is an ongoing investigation\nI mean that's the thing I think that um uh we don't know what's gonna happen because this has been going on for quite some time they've been gathering a lot of evidence Andrew also the same lobbyists that arrange that New York junk get paid for for night stay in a luxury Costa Rica villa for Andrew Gillum\nAnswered and pay a dime of that and then Andrew turned around and gave that lobby is a two million dollar contract to do a restaurant in the city of Tallahassee now we know in addition to that thousand dollar ticket\nThat the agent gave to go on the FBI agent also under wrote a forty three hundred dollar dinner for Andrews campaigned on twenty sixteen that was never reported which it needs to be and so the question is\nAnd you can't report after the fact that just basically cover in your tracks CYA so interested in a port\nIt at all the only reason we know about it\nIs because there's an ethics commission investigation of Gillum and and and a response to those subpoenas uh one of the lobbyist attorneys release that said the public so forty three hundred dollars and then at least a thousand dollars for Hamilton Andrew says he's not under investigation\nBut Sean you tell me what other reason what an undercover agent have to do those things if he wasn't investigating mayor Andrew Gillum\nWell let me ask you to two days ago\nIt was the political reported that apparently his running mate you know claimed that quote Jews nailed him to the cross and read the text message to you know apparently it snow out there many you know people in in South Florida apparently are pretty angry at this remark\nAnd er which seems pretty anti Semitic to me as he's standing by this\nBook I think it's reprehensible Andrew Gillum picked this guy knowing\nThat he had done that but here's the thing about Andrew Gillum he is aligned himself with some of the most anti Israel and the anti Semitic groups in Florida including this radical group called the dream defenders which is a leader and the boycott divest and sanctioned movement\nTargeting Israel they actually say Israel's a genocidal apartheid state and so that's one of Andrew strongest supporters Andrew to this day opposes having our embassy in Jerusalem he opposes recognizing Jerusalem as Israel's capital and when\nA Israel fought back against the Moffett fats and make a deal and blamed Israelis do they just use those attacks as a pre tax it'd be able to do a disproportionate response to\nWhat what is really ... organization that he won't disavow\nThey're one of the most radical organizations in Florida ah they they believe that the police and prisons have no place in justice\nAnd that the police needs to be funded they paid they said the U.S is the biggest bully in the history of the world that our military needs to be caught\nThey if they favor replacing what they consider disaster capitalism is their word with socialists principles that are so radical it'd make Nicolas Maduro flush\nSo he signed their candidate alleged gang that he would support a this radical manifest there so that's just who he is he believes in what they're doing is endorsed them personally and uh it would\nLose a tape of him I guess that was discovered in June and saying that he's pleased I'm proud to sneak food to dream defender\nActivists during a thirty day sleep in protest that the Florida State Capitol referring to the twenty Thirteen month long anti gun protest or after the Trayvon Martin George Zimmerman case and I hope you keep at it and he supported them but you're saying that there are radical groups\nWithout question I mean they they are anti law enforcement there in the free enterprise they're anti military um they're anti Israel uh I don't know I mean like that may be a group you would want to be aligned with if you are running for the mayor of the Gaza Strip but not for governor of Florida\nWow well let's go over a little bit of his his background and the proposals that he's making but he's I think it's fairly extreme a number when he was endorsed by Bernie Sanders that speaks volumes to me\nThere's a lot of outside money uh reports that he's getting money from the left wing billionaires like George Soros the George Soros really spend one point two million in this race in Florida the help him\nOh yeah I probably much more than that at this point yeah he said\nIs that he supports Medicare for all I Am a champion of treaty healthcare and as a right not a privilege so he wants what nationalized healthcare\n... isn't the bill he supports what abolish Medicare and Medicare Advantage for seniors enforce them on a single payer\nGovernment plan it would eliminate everybody's employer based coverage and force them out of government single plan so it really up in the arrangements have millions and millions of ... that he thinks it's appropriate for government to take away health benefits that people are burned and to force them to be on the single payer plan I think that'd be a disaster\nHe wants to raise the corporate tax rate forty percent of forty percent increase ... what's that going to\nThe impact that is going to have on Florida businesses and Florida workers if the businesses pack up and leave\nWe will lose jobs we will lose business it and we're also I mean you know shock because everyone who works and high tax states they're always thinking about relocating to Florida and we have a historic opportunity to really capitalize on that went on governor buddy Andrew has his way\nHe'll stop the flow of investment coming in to Florida because people are going to end that if you have the highest tax rate in the south east and actually he would raise it to be higher than New York\nYeah and they also was the first democratic candidate Nash nationwide I read to call for the abolish men a vice is that true\nHe supports abolishing ice and impeaching President Trump\nAnd he wants to eliminate Florida's Stand your ground law\nYes he wants to impose on law abiding already in the duty to retreat so somebody up a criminal is attacking you you have to run and try to hide rather than fight back\nAlso supports legalizing drugs in Florida like marijuana and others yes he does\nWell I mean it you're just looks like he is Bernie Sanders on steroids that down there I mean I've got to believe with this controversial background that looks like a almost a phenomenon that the media's just pushing for him and pushing for him\nAnd you know his record I I only spent about a half hour and I was able to dig it up it wasn't that hard to find and it seems like most of the media is ignoring who he really is\nOh without question any day he won the primary particularly the national media you know they've tried to elevate him and try to make and then that's great candidate um they do not like the scrutinize his record\nUh the fact that those documents that relief after he lied in the debate last Sunday or the media kind of had to cover that but at the end of the day\nHe has been given very glove treatment so really calls me and other folks to go out and make the case and let people know and the good news is already and figure that out or they definitely don't want to know their governor and so we're going to keep making the case for the next week\nI'm worried about our friends not only the recovery I'd uh thoughts and prayers go to all our friends in the panhandle\nUm but but the panhandle to so many people whose lives have been up ended and disrupted and some people losing pretty much everything they own and they now moved out the panhandle happens to be one of the most conservative areas of Florida are you concerned that people\nFrom the panhandle of going to be able to get their hands on a ballad maps and tea or otherwise would maybe be part of early voting is Florida doing anything to assist in and help those people that have been displaced would want to vote in this election because Florida is their home\nThey're doing a lot of everything from mobile voting sites to accommodations for absentee ballot\nYou know the bad news is that you said it was a terrific stormed the good news is I think all but about Fifteen thousand homes are going to have power by\nThe weekend a which we weren't sure could happen that quickly um and I know the rest of the folks there is a combination is being made so are they are resilient people I understand them at city area um but I Know a lot of them do want to vote and so they'll have the opportunity to do it\nYeah I'm I'm at the devastation once again to the people there how long do you look at rebuilding not part of Florida and some people I looked like a tornado would wiped it out\nYeah look I mean it's got to take time I say with me coming in as governor I'm gonna have to deal with it and take off where ...\nI Will say though um had that gone forty miles west of the population would have been much bigger\nI'm sure there is damage and its extensive damage but I think it's damage in a relatively limited area is there's a couple area that got hit pretty good so we know what we got to do and I think we'll be able to go in and do what we are the president has committed to doing any repairs necessary for ten do air force base\nOutright is an important not active duty site right so I'm really pleased that that is going to be fixed\nI got to take a quick break we'll come back more with Florida gubernatorial candidate Congressman Ron dissent this on the other side might cybersecurity some things you need to know cyber security\nThat's the protection of networks devices and programs from cyber attacks that are designed to access or destroy sensitive data or extort money from businesses and people strong cyber security is layers of protection spread across computers networks programs\nWe didn't techniques for harnessing the Internet and Facebook to generate leads and new customers with valuable seminars at the higher place on highway one fifty and Hoover November sixth through the eight or ten minutes is free but the information is priceless feeding is limited to call for your free reservation right now two oh five four three nine eight four o seven that's four three nine eight four oh\nMind as we continue with former congressman now gubernatorial candidate the all important state of Florida around the census going up against radical leftist Bernie supporter Andrew Gillum just as a way of background you did go to Harvard how many years did you serve the country\nI was active duty for five years in a U.S navy\nYou know I'm you know I I look at Florida they'll they had a little bit of a red tide problem is not something that happens sickle ugly over long periods of time occasionally\nIt 'cause it's natural I think the issue we've had is Lake Okeechobee the Army Corps of engineers discharges\nFeminist polluted water into the rivers and so I write who's the director goes into the area where you where you live in southwest Florida and I think what happened with some of those nutrients mixed with the red tide and exacerbated the we we got it bad that was born I got a really really bad\nSo I'm committed to making sure that working batting that stopping the discharges got in order to do that you got to work constructively what the Trump Administration because a lot of that state federal partnerships I'll be able to do that Gillum wants to impeach track so I don't know how the hell is going to be able to work with him on any of that I think any of those problems we have and\nWhat I understand it's gotten a lot better sense of it so I guess the early part of the spring and summer of this year a lot of it's gone away right\nIt's just I mean quite frankly Michael washed I'm a bad\nUm you know out and so it's not as bad as it was for sure but it really yeah there was a two month stretch there in South Florida where people were just getting hammered it was in that sense of our fish kill it hurt our economy and tourism so are we need to do whatever weekend but a lot of it as a fault you know the federal government are discharging\nYou know all this water into the river\nA round the Santa is running for governor the great state of Florida Rick Scott running for senator down there a it is one of the most important states us Florida always is a forty percent business tax by Andrew Gillum would be a disaster economically put Florida\nI Hope people are waking up to the fact um and you are you how you're in the middle of early voting now and absentee voting obviously goes on and a one week from today we'll find out hopefully that you're the next governor of Florida\nOtherwise I think I'm On packing up my bags and I'm going to pull out of Florida and I'll go looking at Texas no offense to my friends and I got\nAnd I look I mean we're we're going to be\nGoing to go there and you're going to agree on business taxes forty percent forget it I'm Out\nNow I Know now that's exactly right so we're going to get it done I think that folks understand that and ah you know when I'm governor will be able to do about it I got a world track record year\nRound the Centers for governor of Florida

say in public they say in Providence that and\nThe video they put out yesterday this is not great ah is Loren from which per project ... field organizer for your campaign for something you learn from part of your team and second is telling the truth or you are progressive and are you just acting moderate to get elected\nBy I don't know who ... said I said to answer that question\nUm but when they say she's a field organizer for your campaign well let's take everything they say with a grain of salt convicted criminals\nAre really well joining us now to answer that question is project Vera toss a dot com CEO and founder of project ... cave or Mr okay how are you sir\nI mean good but that's that's outrageous I'm Sean that that she doesn't know who this person is and and that you should take her with a grain of SALT I there's a picture of her this gym sharp ... local radio host in Arizona posted tweeted today Lawrence from standing with with\nHer boss a saying that she can't be who she really is and cinemas responses to attack me called me a criminal\nCall me a criminal and and say that I should take what I say with a grain of salt I'm reporting she's a field organizer that's who she is she's paid to work for Christmas and I and and the Senate candidate is attacking me\nOn the heels of of a Senator McCaskill calling me fraud thing that fraud for me to report what these folks are saying and if\nIt was no one wrong then you wouldn't you you would be a criminal and you would be in jail but you go into states you know what the laws are it's one party consent you get these people on tape and they don't like what you report because what you've ... bows with Phil Bredesen\nIn Tennessee in his staff and Claire McCaskill and her staff and Missouri and Heidi Heitkamp and her staff in\nNorth Dakota now Christian cinema who thinks it's okay to join the Taliban in Arizona is the same thing is that they're lying to their constituents they're running a propaganda campaign and they're acting like they are purposely misleading the people of their states\nTo make them think moderates when they're anything but and they're all all the people working for them or in on the boat secret which is don't tell the voters in those crazy voters in the meth capital of the world\nA meth lab democracy Arizona the state known in a famous way and Lindsey low and kind of way they'll let them know the truth just you know say what you need to say lie and then be a liberal as soon as you're elected\nIn this video Sean shows a number her staffers it also shows send him or herself as inside of a posh fundraiser for send them a and she says that that that the people of Arizona would shoot you\nIf you talked about assault weapons ban her own campaign manager for on this is not a low level person the person who runs her campaign says quote we can't be talking about an assault weapons ban that we need an incremental approach for gun control\nWe have two different staffers both one of whom uh send them a is is saying that you should take with a grain of salt ... that I'm reporting that she works for her when in fact it is a fact that she does\nThe staffer she she can't be who she really is another staffer us in our is her name Madison ... says quote send them is going to stand up and protect Arizona value is whatever the effort that means unquote so they're mocking the idea they're mocking the identity staffers that send them off to represent the state\nThat she supposed to be the senator for that show that they're they're mocking the idea that she should be be appealing to moderate people and representing the people of Arizona and they're doing so in this video\nAnd send them there has not responded attacking me and and obfuscating the fact that these folks work for her it's pretty pretty extraordinary Sean and it's blowing up locally here as I speak\nWell it's bigger than they it's blown up locally in Tennessee Missouri North Dakota and now Arizona I'm I guess you know a gym sharp who was the head of the program did know a whole lot about the project and\nAnd but he's followed up on the story and apparently found that she lied to him directly which doesn't surprise me at all the making a comment about that\n[noise] you know it's interesting sharp is tweeting about it is what he said of course even if she does work for her that done it doesn't mean it's kind of a notice her personally but and then sharp plead the picture of Lauren from this this worker for sending a standing with cinema in this picture\nNo I'm look at where we are going to read out the picture now because you know we've got a copy of it I mean they're standing like their best friends\nBut we don't want to if there's a greater issue here Sean and and that people are attacking me and my methods here and I try to just for Fifteen seconds about this\n... that it's wrong to record people in their own words than an election and these people are saying some pretty extraordinary things they're saying they have to lie they're saying they have to mislead they can't be who they are\nAnd and McCaskill who who came out and said that that I committed fraud let me be clear okay uh it is what we do reporting what people say one more next to them is fraud\nThen you know we'd have to be wanting to allow restaurants to sue restaurant critics who frequently dine out undercover for trespass we'd have landlords to sue fair housing testers 'em and stores who you\nStoop Rouzer is ... I'm older than you\nAre James but that's how sixty minutes made their mark in television Mike Wallace was known for this sixty minutes was known for this to quote ambush interview and this isn't even an ambush\nUndercover very or an ambush I'm not I don't agree with what they did what they did undercover\nAnd they did it when Bush interviews where they run in and they weren't expecting cameras it's all legal they just don't like being caught that's what they're ... it's\nAbout power shots about power it's about who\nThey write their out to investigate and who you're allowed to expose\nThat

protect Arizona value this whatever the F that means implying that the yeah Arizona's are ... are crazy\nAnd uh and send them has come out saying that uh um she wants you to take with a grain of salt

to get free health care great job Gavin Newsom watch this implode on Californians it's got to be ugly and the mass exodus out of California will even continue\nAt a greater clip and a greater pace you know so now what's happened is somehow we forgot that what eight years of Obamacare Americans slowly beginning to forget\nThat their premiums are have gone up three four hundred percent in some cases forgetting that they only have one choice of a health care provider forgetting that they lost their doctor from long ago that they really liked and wanted and they forget that\nPeople with a pre existing conditions well with Obamacare you pay more higher premiums than any other plant\nRate hikes that nobody ever expected and they lie to you about people losing their doctors that was a lie\nYou like your doctor keep your doctor people losing their plans with no choice anymore and this has now become and the final week of the election this is their talking points all across the country they're saying well where we're going to where we support healthcare pre existing conditions while the Republicans repeal replace planned\nSupported preexisting conditions and they're trying to basically go with the narrow\nLie that Republicans want you to die Republicans one dirty or water dirty air\nThey want to kill children they want to throw granny over the cliff of course they're racist or sexist massage those thicken Xena phobic Islamic phobic homophobic oh and by the way Donald Trump's responsible for the horrible shooting at the synagogue in Pittsburgh and Donald Trump's
