at the consulate in Turkey\nWas able to show during the presidential debates if she were the Democratic candidate all of this being left out by the way by the\nMedia that's for a feverishly fervently trying to cover for Elizabeth Warren some reason to the words are coming I could be one way or the other I'm not sure which I'm going to go with it keeps happening today\nBut she released the information from her her test today right or she has decided to let the world know that her long scrutinized and uh many would say debunked Native American heritage\nIs now back in the headlines because the analysis reported on by the Boston Globe\nWhere the vast majority of warrants family tree is European is it says that she has a date of American ancestry quote in the range of six to ten general [laughter]\nSix to ten generations ago so this is a really a non scientific\nBackground ed and heritage analysis of of Elizabeth Warren but six to ten generations ago that would mean she is getting ready for it between one sixty fourth and one one thousand and twenty fourth\nNative American and the Boston Globe initially did the math wrong on that one uh so I'm I'm here to to to fact check the Boston Globe's math among among many other things that we have to look at here\nAnd this was this was a truly\nJaw dropping moment today this this whole phenomenon because this was not some analysis that was released against Elizabeth Warren's will this wasn't a some surprise that a a competing campaign or somebody else a decided to drop\nAnd make it difficult for her to get elected\nTo the contrary Elizabeth Warren took the position that this would bolster her claim\nI don't know which is worse here uh that Elizabeth Warren is\nShow delusional she thinks that this proves her case or so tone deaf as it has to think that this will stop\nContinue mockery of her for racial fraud I mean the hill where I work in response to this ... wrote that Elizabeth Warren DNA test shows quote strong evidence of Native American ancestry but the the real headline here if I may finally be civil\nIs it there's strong evidence that she may have had a Native American ancestor a couple of hundred years ago and since then it has been one long on on on interrupted line of white people\nIn fact if you look at the percentage that Elizabeth Warren is likely Native American compared to the general white American population she is less than average\nIn her connection to the Native American population meeting you and to me listening is if you happen to be white and an American and a lot of you or not but if you have any weight an American is likely you are more Native American that Elizabeth Warren\nAnd yet here we are\nHere we are she she must have thought that this was going to give her some degree of of credibility I I don't know what she's thinking I mean ten generations ago\nThere's no realistically there's no way to know if even the ten generations ago if this is accurate and then when you when you look at the Boston Globe analysis\nAnd you start to read some of this you realize that this is all it's all kinda hazy and nonsense anyway quote the this is from the Boston Globe ... the analysis of warns DNA done by Carlos Bustamante who's a professor at Stanford\nA really he tracks DNA Analysis via population migration\nHe quote concluded that the vast majority of warrants ancestry is European but the result strongest support the existence of an on ad mix and Native American ancestor\nA six to ten generations ago\nUm\nFish folks if Elizabeth Warren what this tells any normal rational person is that if Elizabeth Warren is in fact able to call herself Native American\nLiterally any white person in the country could credibly claim to be Native American\nFor professional purposes for the purposes of advancing oneself and therefore it would no longer even\nMatter if you call yourself Native American it would no longer make any difference if you consider yourself to be in America's everybody's every but were Native American by their standard this is\nCompletely nuts\nThis is completely nuts and the fact that Trump was able to get so in her head by calling her Pocahontas as we know he does time and time again the fact that Trump has managed to to force this incredible\nUh on for stare on on her part is just astonishing really is this is somebody that is getting in the top four or five of early support from the Democrats\nFor running for president and most of the polls that I've seen in fact as being CNN pull out where I think she came in for third or fourth place um and and\nWhen you look at this analysis when you look at what's going on here uh eat is\nAmazing to me that that anybody could read this and this is what's so crazy folks people in the media took this as evidence that she wasn't right [laughter] I mean she's she's like one one thousand Native American\nMaybe and it's not even really Native American it's based on population migration from South of the border into the United states\nSo she doesn't even ... it's not even clear that that this one one thousand or one sixty fourth or whatever it is is truly from a Native American tribes\nAnd yet people in the media was saying sushi proved that Trump is wrong Trump needs to pay up now\nWhat what\nAre they had desperate I think there's a little panic right now on the left because they realize oh my gosh Elizabeth Warren has completely clown herself here I mean it just made a complete mess of things and so there that the media has\nTo go even further and they have to somehow pretend like\nYeah that's right you prove thinks that's crazy she didn't prove anything and everyone knows it but what what else are they going to do I mean this is a this is telling us that that that pigs are flying folks I mean this is complete detachment from reality by the lips\nIs bonkers\nOn this notion even that that she has any Native American ancestry let me just give you this is from this post ah this analysis in the Boston Globe quote detecting DNA for Native Americans\nIs particularly tricky because there was an absence of Native American DNA available for comparison this is in part because Native American leaders have asked tribal members not to participate in genetic databases to make up for the ... a dearth of Native American DNA bustamante guy

mean anything is going to be considered okay here as long as it is a evidence or useful in the anti Trump cause\nI just I I've reached a kind of a new a new level here and a new degree of understanding of just where the media is taking all this stuff and and what they're willing to do and what they're willing to put the American people through a in terms of\nPropaganda and and the whys and there's no way that a normal person could have read that Boston Globe report today\nAnd come away from it with anything other than wow that is a massive mistake that Warren has made here\nAnd she's clearly not Native American she never should have claimed to be Native American there's nothing about her that justifies this notion of being Native American\nAnd yet\nYou know all I see right now on the on the front page of CNN here's a perfect example\nI see nothing in their main headlines all about the Saudi guy got which we'll talk more about your market show you later\nBut nothing about that you go down one two three four five six seven eight eight stories down the CNN front page right now and you get quote Warren's DNA never mattered Trump\nHow how is this Trump's fault in one

take the money [laughter]\nWhat I'm saying is if they ask a enlisting specifically asking voting for the wall we should let them go they need to think that so I think she may think she's on the wall and they don't ask me and let them think that\nAnd if they don't ask let them think that that's what the rule is now for the Democratic party even the center for American Progress sending out don't talk about immigration Maxine Waters admitting that she's being told don't talk about impeachment just shut up about it we we know we know we're going to do but we're not going to\nWe're not going to help people the truth before an election that's Claire McCaskill and and people on her staff people just can't know that she wants a semi automatic rifle ban and that\nThat of course she would vote yes on gun bans of course she supports the semi automatic rifle ban\nYou know she's quiet on guns because she has a bunch of Republican voters but secretly she says she supports say hey gun control group\nYou know what our staff is saying well we'll wait till after the election to bring up Trump impeachment to voters get over it we can't do it now we got a line now\nWith you know three weeks Twenty one days election they why would we ever tell people the truth people just can't know\nMcCaskill and Obama essentially the same views on everything wow now the people in Missouri I Hope you're paying close attention but it's bigger than that a project Vera tosses got this undercover video they got the undercover video of the week before about former governor of Tennessee Bredesen\nMarsha Blackburn is now up by fourteen points\nBecause on that tape it's the same line he'll he'll do the right thing when he gets there of course we don't agree with everything Trump says no not at all do what ... what we're saying we vote for cabinet of course he wouldn't vote for Kavanaugh\nI mean this is all part of a wide campaign propaganda campaign and it's all about power and it's being exposed at a very high level I mean this is really you know seeing people how they really are is should be so enlightening to the people a tendency in Missouri\nA James O'Keefe is with us She's the founder of project Vera toss exposing the senators I you know I watch this and I'm just like what a bunch of liars\nThat's all I think when I see those great job\nYeah Sean this is a pattern you know we really the Tennessee won the Tennessee Senate candidate rather than you know responded by bumbling and bumbling his words caught red handed these are all of a staffer Sean inside Claire McCaskill's office they're all saying essentially the same thing when it comes to Obama\nGun control impeachment they're all saying that we have to do one thing before the election and do another thing afterwards some of that audio is a little hard to hear but\nOne of the most powerful pieces which when the sky Glenn Winfrey one of McCaskill staffers explains to our journalist when we asked so what do we tell the moderates ... after we did the impeachment because we're going to happen mislead them\nAnd the guy goes will tell them get over it\nAnd that's the that's the ... it's the next arose field organizer tells us he says a quote people just can't know unquote than the cast on Obama had the same views now I confronted Nick on the street yesterday with a microphone Nick why don't you why don't you tell the truth\nAnd of course the reason is and this is true in Missouri it's true in Tennessee is true in North Dakota\nOh how nice red state Democrats they have to lie to the voters to get elected it it's a necessary condition so all we're doing is exposing\nYou don't want you know what you're going to say just agree with that point they don't have the lie they have to lie if they want to win\nAnd ... it's a question of whether or not they will put aside any any sense of decency honor honesty and embrace any level of truth and they won't and that's the point and you know I keep hearing the everybody on this showing on TV\nIf you look the houses and play the senators and play if you vote for any Democrat but in the house you're voting for polo see\nIt'd be a vote for Claire McCaskill or Bredesen or a high camp or cinema or Donnelly or Bill Nelson you're voting for Schumer because that's who's going to own them in control them that's what they're going to vote to be their leader\nWell you know and and Sean and some of these states like Missouri in particular the pro life Democrats and pro gun Democrats used to be a thing decades ago misery with the stalwart when it came to those things but that's a shrinking\nGroup of people and and people like Claire McCaskill half state in order to when they have to or they think they have to mislead\nAnd again this is a Greek chorus have staffer the staffers are not necessarily villainous I suppose there is on us because they're going along with it but they're just telling the truth so it's very very interesting to see British and after we played those tapes on your radio last week British and talk to local media this is the kind of the Senate candidate he told all the local media stations\nWell al these ... these young guys were caught and kind of misled staffers who while they don't work for me when in fact they did he apologized so it's going to be\nVery uh by the way that was a lie to the first thing is that well they're they're just college kids no they weren't they actually work for him\nAnd the guy I Apologize this guy brown who is the Democratic spokesperson for the British in campaign he actually apologize to the media can you believe that Sean apologized\nFor misleading people without our videos so it's very interesting to see how McCaskill's going to respond now this guy Josh Hawley the Senate candidate that's running against a McCaskill has responded he's tweeted out this video um he's jumping all over it so the question is really interesting thing is because\nWe're going to get him on the program and later this week I mean we're basically following the work you're doing you know one of the question is going to ask but go ahead finish your thought\nWell I was going to say that McCaskill has in the video it's she says of course I'd vote on a ban some type of gun ban and we asked her staff or what type of\nAnd is that he said semi automatic rifles now this is an issue that nobody wants to talk about in Missouri particularly Claire McCaskill so we're hoping that she gives a clear unequivocal answer about what her positions are\nOn the gun issue and that's going to be very interesting if we can somehow get her to speak on the record publicly about this now that we've caught her red handed well\nThat was an all of us here on the Sean Hannity show we love the dollar

one\nDoctor you keep your doctor you keep your plan oh now the one thing that the Democrats are trying to do and talk about is health care which is somewhat bizarre to me because that is not exactly worked out for anybody\nWhat we have is you know the the the AC a which is the Obamacare what you've lost with the AC a as people with preexisting conditions have been paying more yep higher premiums and they were paying before\nMany lost the doctors that they loved taxing Americans who chose not to use it which by the way the individual mandate would tax the president has gotten rid of the ... rid of that taxing companies who choose not to elect to pay for what your neighbor needs it was one big\nRedistribution scheme\nNow if you deal with direct primary care direct access to doctors\nAnd we've talked about health savings accounts that we also talked about atlas MD Dr Josh ... and Dr Lee s gross this model now has been duplicated around the country and what happens is there's no pre existing conditions prejudice at all\nIf you can afford a cell phone you can pretty much afford a\nA direct access to your doctor no insurance no problem you pay for what you need fifty dollars a month for an adult ten dollars a month per child\nThey negotiate directly with the pharmaceuticals so they have Ninety to Ninety five percent reduction if you have high blood pressure if you have a cholesterol problem you walk out of the doctor's office with the medicine\nAnd we're searching for deals where we have tons of Christmas fiesta hotline than to sixty percent off even cancer shop bid on Birmingham\nEverything you can ever imagine all in one option guns they Haitians stop packages concert tickets item for the home and more it's our data on brimming hand Christmas action going on

countless applications that soon 'cause they're really tiny a team at Vanderbilt University who discovered the blue pretty\n[noise]\n[noise] [noise] [noise] All right we can put you back for\nBusy phones Nina is in San Francisco a cast a vote and you know Hi how are you glad you called\nMe for taking my car and I'm going\nOn and he can in California and unfortunately in around ... he is crazy people I'm just wondering what are we going to electric cake that California I got one gathering in that dark I mean I was living in San Francisco when he became a San Francisco and he can ruin that city\nWas an eye you have a great Republican candidates out there John Cox he's a great businessman his his problem is simple math and sort of like New York city although it's happened in New York City is even happened in New Jersey Chris Christie Christie Todd Whitman\nUm and and then all the other occasions Tom Kaine is another example where Republicans were elected after Democrats make a mess I guarantee you that Cox could wind now that the sanctuary state of California wants to put up a sign in say free health care\nFor everybody in the world it's a sign you're basically our governor saying illegal or legal doesn't matter resident nonresident doesn't matter we're going to give you free health care\nNow if the average California is that is packed that Thirteen and a half percent statewide on income if you're OK with that good luck to you because it is unsustainable it will bankrupt your state there's\nMy prediction but if people want to experiment with is that you know what am I I'm not there to tell people\nYet and I agree with you and they had on counted on where the family thinking gotta get out of California can't afford to stay taxes and the ... yeah\nI mean it's unbelievable look why do you think there's a mass migration out of New York and New Jersey\nAnd Illinois to states like Florida Texas in the Carolinas wire Californians all going in Texas you know what what uh Democrats on what they're hoping for that California demographic shift so that the people that ruin California and left might do the same thing to Texas\nSo unbelievable which is what the beta Rourke has been all about from the beginning\nAnyway you know good luck um I Would say John Cox would be a great start and that was done in the world they'll tell you that on election night three ... three weeks from tonight it will take a break we'll come back eight hundred nine four one showing his art toll free telephone number you want to be a part of the program all gets a lot more of

actually matters that's why I'm listening the names of the specific house races that mattered ten a night\nSo that people can tune in and literally see we've also put up an interactive map on Hannity outcome that people can use\nAnd you also see it Christian cinema is imploding out in Arizona\nProject very toss with the tape that they release the Claire McCaskill is devastating that she's hiding what she's running on to that same happened to governor governor Bredesen and Tennessee have Heidi Heitkamp was already down by double digits Joe Donnelly is in big trouble\nUh we now see Heller was very important seed in Nevada he's now a by seven in the latest poll the only state I'm really worried about right now is Florida and Rick Scott just has done an amazing job for the people of Florida\nWell yeah and then the hurricane obviously that that was devastating but but the response to hurricane I remember that benefit there in the last year where we're Scott has really shown if you remember Shawn the two thousand twelve election\nRight here in Jersey uh that's where Hurricane Sandy hit and then President Obama had the advantage of\nActing like a commander in chief and going to the devastation while Mitt Romney is basically left helpless and they say that that hurricane may have tipped the scales back to Obama's member Romney at all the momentum in the world are going into that storm so yeah look a Jim Messina who was speaking of President Obama two thousand twelve he was the campaign manager\nFor a Mr Obama at that time and he said yesterday said why did Senator Warren after do her announcement with our DNA now he goes why can't Democrats ever stay focused and I think this Elizabeth Warren\nRevelation or lack there of will only hurt the party further because I don't see how you could ever say many media outlets by the way Shawn said that this was definitive proof right I'll give you literally the headlines\nA fence around that she's Ninety six percent European I mean at that one one thousand twenty four she has perhaps maybe Native American ancestry of some type I mean but it is it but her she literally personally changed herself\nTo minority status when that you pan and then at Harvard that she was billed as the first minority female professor there a Native American heritage that the Cherokee Nation has spoken out and said this is just outrageous they're out there outrage by it\nAnd that was a turning point right when they when they came out and said this is wrong this is inappropriate this is a mockery then we're going to say is attacking was with Warren is it still conservatives or is it actually Cherokee Nation but I mean that that the headlines yesterday Associated Press Warren DNA shows\nI have Native American heritage a CNN Elizabeth Warren releases DNA tests with strong evidence of Native American ancestry ABC News Elizabeth Warren relief reveals proof of Native American ancestry again what proof this so backfired on her ...\nNation got involved in and all the mockery that that ensued from there this is going to follow or I Know people think that she is a front runner but the fact that she lied about our heritage to advance her career I could see the signs are already at Trump rallies in twenty twenty with\nOne one thousand twenty four just written and that's it because now this defines her and this is not something you shake very easily and suddenly she's kind of morphed into Hillary Clinton where you\nCan't really trust what she says and then on top of that she has no real economic message at outside of you didn't do that so yeah sure him to see who the Democrats settle on ... and and twenty twenty because I think the left wing of the party has taken over and that's not the way you'd be President Trump\nOne of the things that I've been pointing out I don't know if you had a chance to look at the center for American Progress and there was a group formed by none other than\nJohn Podesta but they're running their reelection now ... very revealing the Maxine Waters says they keep telling me not to say it I keep saying I'm not a lot but I'm going to keep saying it anyway meaning impeach forty five\nSo they're hiding their agenda we learned that in this project beret ... tape with Claire McCaskill in her own words also\nBut now we know that they're being told directly not to talk about their immigration and all you know a sanctuary attacks packs a punch says the four page memorandum [laughter] I'm like yeah OK and anyway the New York times were obtained a copy of it and Democrats and strategies to prepare the memos that\nThe Democrat you spend as little time as possible ever talking about immigration itself pivot\nTo more fruitful issues like health care and taxation it's very difficult to win on immigration so nobody's talking about what they really are going to do their super Democrats too when they have to pretty much lie misrepresent\nCon be quiet about what it is they want to do how they govern\nAnd and the types of agenda items they really have\nThat's not an enviable position to be and I mean ... all the criticism Donald Trump takes he's pretty authentic he made promises and he keeps them\nThat's the thing I mean when you look at the record right everybody focuses on the rhetoric of the president too much right you look at the results and it's a completely different ballgame any president would kill to have a GDP above four percent unemployment below\nFour percent right there's something like seven point six million job openings that was that was reported by CNBC today I think in the country that's incredible when you're Ninety eight percent of the ISIS caliphate\nEvaporated in Iraq and Syria when North Korea is no longer lobbing missile over Japan threatening Guam and the United states these are all very substantial victories the trade deal he just did with Canada and Mexico I'm not sure leading here I'm Talking about the pillars\nOf the presidency in terms of accomplishments Trump is winning right now he won with Kavanaugh as well even that CNN did a\nA segment last week John Avalon where he says the president is on a winning streak and the polls are showing it he's back around forty four percent forty five percent among registered voters member\nOf al ... was the most accurate and twenty sixteen has them at fifty one\nRight fifty one percent everything is trending upwards at the wrong time for Democrats when you go into this election because to your point they have no message like they had no message and twenty sixteen I don't know what Hillary Clinton's platform was outside of that guy is bad but for me so I can be the first woman president and I I Would say the same about Mitt Romney two thousand twelve I I think back I Can't\nRemember what his platform was but I remember Joe Biden had bin Laden is dead and GM is alive that's easy to remember and it's a it was good enough right who was it will make America great again or keep\nAmerica great again the Trump could run on his record and Democrats just go with personal attacks like they have a if it's going to be a long long election you know you're going to hear about how Trump's in trouble like you did in two thousand sixteen but\nAgain a in till they have a message in ... Michigan Pennsylvania Wisconsin to win over those voters that see jobs coming back and companies coming back I unless they put up a centrist fiery centrist candidate to have a lot of problems on\nThe one poll that shocks me the most the latest one out of Wisconsin had Scott Walker who I think that a phenomenal job in the state of Wisconsin and now he's always had notoriously close elections he's always had all of these groups and millions and millions of dollars pouring in from outside of Wisconsin that he's had to deal with\nI'm not sure if the polls accurate but it has him down and that surprises me but I think especially when you look at the Senate I I could see the Republicans again with three weeks away I don't have a crystal ball\nI always tell everybody play like you're behind and you're losing and you've got you got to make up ground and anything can happen between now and election day and Twenty one days but\nYou know I don't see Heidi Heitkamp making a recovery I think a Christian seminar is falling apart in Arizona I see a surge of just the right time for Dean Heller in Nevada which will help him\nUm I I look at the other races Donnelly now is beginning to fall back in Indiana Marsha Blackburn is emerging in Tennessee thank goodness Claire McCaskill I Believe this tape is absolutely going to help to feed her or if the people in Missouri if this is widely disseminated 'cause it's outrageous\nAnd the only Democrat that might be safer at this point seems to be Joe mansion in the Senate\nYeah and and the Senate in order to win that back you had to go through this narrow paths if you're a Democrat through Arizona red state Texas Red state tendency red standing\nBeside the way that he rep I'm going to he's up by eight in the latest poll I'm actually going to be down during a town hall with them this weekend around the Houston area I'll I'll give up that announcement later in the week\nOh there you go yeah and and remember ... better or got more money than any cat on my gosh are eight million dollars and he's tattered already has a twenty twenty presidential candidate you know\nI I think we'll probably be twenty to twenty five candidates and that's not an exaggeration because Republicans in Eighteen but yeah that would have been a very big symbolic victory of ... somehow could've unseated cruise but that's going in the right direction for Cruz as well so the Senate you gotta think they're probably gonna pick up three or four seats\nAnd now I Would have told you two months ago and like I don't see how Democrats don't win twenty three seats to win back the house and given the history Eighteen or the last twenty midterms I have gone against the party in power by an average of something like thirty three seats old bottle of sixty three seats in two thousand ten\nSo I was thinking you know I ... I Can't see that not happening now I I think it's a toss up it's fifty fifty that the Republicans keep the house and if that happens after all this negative press that President Trump has received the Republicans have received to overcome that and keep all three branches oh my goodness\nBut I Will tell you I think back then you had two things the fact that they have no agenda\nIs part of it the second thing is is that they're catering to a mob mentality and we saw that in the cabinet hearings and we have seen a post Kavanaugh hearings\nAnd you know when you say as Maxine Waters did about cabinet members and high ranking officials in our government you create a crowd and you you follow them into department stores and gas stations in grocery stores and you tell them\nThey're ... they're not want to hear any more anywhere anymore I'm like that's the party because they're saying that\nFor a media perspective it's funny because then you have even some anchors on CNN that are saying you know the people that chased Ted Cruz and his wife out of a Washington restaurant right they're not a mob and you can't say the word\nMob not allowed to say the words mob All right stay right there will continue Joe ... he is the media reporter on the hill or will come back also the stormy stormy networks are a little bit quiet except for the president's tweet we'll get into that when we get back eight hundred nine four one show on your calls in the final half hour\nThose videos or ... it is it they're not telling Maxine Waters pet said they keep telling me not to say it then you read the center for American Progress don't talk about immigration because if you're ... you're not going to win with by telling people the truth about what you believe\nIt's it's sad that this is what it takes for them to win it had that Hillary Clinton had the cheap Bernie Sanders to get the nomination and that she tried to use the phony Russian tough the a\n... and then had all of our deep state friends lying to the American people with unverified uncorroborated Russian bought and paid for lives this is who they are there's nothing that they're running on that tells me oh if you elect us we're going to create jobs by doing this\nWhat Trump said how we create jobs by giving us the largest tax cut and eliminating burdensome regulation and opening up bad ... building pipelines and saving the coal industry those are saving jobs\nSo you know the ... look it's I'm I'm just telling everybody three weeks from tonight you're going to turn on your TV set and you're gonna watch the coverage and you're either going to be you know maybe maybe it'll be a mixed bag maybe the Republicans gained a couple seats in the Senate when maybe they lose the house you lose the house\nThen all you're gonna see for two years is never ending non stop obsessive compulsive Trump paint and investigations and possible impeachment that's the agenda that's it\nThere's nothing to improve the lives of the American people money though that there was a lot of states\n[noise] the Democrats rely on people of low information they rely on propaganda and putting things out there and come easy that's the way it is\nAnd then what we want you to know about it it's called their Franklin Stein event and you can save hundreds of\nHow you can save hundreds on liberties customer say\nHey you can save hundreds on
