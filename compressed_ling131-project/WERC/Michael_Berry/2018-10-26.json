vote doesn't affect my feeling about Trump for the Republican Party or anything else that has nothing to do all the safety threat this is one very very stupid and ah and agree just an\nEvil jerk\nI wanted to use another word but we're on radio or who is going to spend the rest of his life in prison\nIt's just a question of how soon we put him through that process but the Doug bombs that have been found so far no could they have gone off could they have detonated under any circumstances\nThere was a press conference today with the NYPD in fact one of my uh some of my former colleagues were named in the press conference I had a bit of nostalgia but they talked\nAbout how the bombs that haven't gone off and kept getting asked the question by the press are they real bombs or the ... the YPG is going to have to\nSay you have to treat these as real threats because just imagine for a moment that the largest police department the country's as no these are these are\n... and then the next suspicious packages that goes out whether it's by the same person or not but look similar person opens it up and goes well I Know it's a dog and then we have a tragedy\nSomeone loses limbs site maybe dogs from one of these pipe bombs or the NYPD can't take that risk not yet\nCan't say that these bombs wouldn't have gone off under any circumstances but I'm here to tell you that I think\nThat is increasingly likely to be the case\nAnd if that is in fact what's going on here let's just take a step back I Know I'm not supposed to said I Know I'm not supposed to go there but then again\nI actually professionally did this on like Ninety percent of the clowns going on MSNBC and CNN to talk about it\nAnd in the past when they've tried to tell me if those places ... and it's not real when it comes to terrorism or they have tended to get stuck slapped rather hard here's what I see\nIf you were trying to come up with a means to change the entire national conversation away from Kavanaugh

much like the idea that the Democrat Party is effectively an open borders party\nPrivileges certain people from certain places of the world getting around the rest of the immigration system because it benefits the Democrats electoral prospects they don't like that\nAnd so if you wanted to switch that narrative if that was the purpose it has been master fully achieved here now\nIs in fact possible some would even say probable I'm I'm not quite there yet I Need I Need more evidence is it possible problem this is one incredibly stupid reckless and a ... and really her doing whatever\nSide he thinks he's on doing tremendous damage to it is it possible that this is somebody who wears a mock a hat and and loves Trump so much they thought that the way to the way to show support was to violate hundreds of federal statutes threaten people terrified people and in the process put himself in a sure fire\nA position to be spending the rest of his life in federal prison is that possible absolutely that's possible I'm not discounting that at all we may find out that that is the case\nHowever am I willing to discount am I willing to push aside that\nIf this was in fact somebody whose purpose was to change the conversation right before the midterms I don't think anybody believes this is a coincidence in terms of the timing\nIf the purpose was ... was to push aside conversations that were damaging for the Democrats and in the process\nMake the anti Trump media seem sympathetic and give them something to talk about that might sway some moderate to their side just in time the election would this be a successful strategy yes I Am talking about a false flag strategy\nI'm not saying it happened I'm saying would these things all be true if this were a false black\nAnswers obviously yes so that's why I'm unwilling to just discount this out of hand and that's why I I refuse to take the position that\nWell because the left has already started not just to blame the right for this but to blame the president of the United states for this\nThat's where I think we have to draw a very hard and fast line the Democrats have created not alone but primarily predominantly\nThey have created this vicious toxic political environment\nThey have never thought for one moment there was anything decent are acceptable about Trump they wanted to remove him from office I even had an author on impeachment on my on my TV show or in the week you said yes this is the first time ever that there's been impeachment talk for a\nPresident who had not even been sworn in\nThey have a mass delusion problem they're having a collective nervous breakdown in slow motion over Trump and his movement\nAnd that's why things have become so tense and so nasty and so vicious so would one

you know show hunted killed jobs she'll put back in regulations and guess what they're going to try to impeach the president so\nYou've really got just over a week\nTo try to stop policy and the Democrats from winning and the Republicans really need to have a laser focus on that and run a very very hard contrast campaign and the worst thing is right now in Ninety percent of the story I think Ninety percent of the congressional districts that are competitive\nThe Democrats are raising the Republicans and it's not by little amounts it's by big amounts so you have a congressional race where the Democrats are spending a other Republican two million to one million in in Virginia\nTen were Barbara concerts running for reelection people were saying all your polls were wrong because you have a point that had\nAll the Democrats last friday put in for a million dollars in the last two weeks versus are two million between the Republican or groups in the center of town I mean Congress on contract so the Democrats are playing for keeps and the Republicans need to have that\nLooks like the Democrats have just seeded the Senate than in other words they're putting all their money into house races just to get the one chamber absolutely so let's say that that that what you're saying is true if the Democrats if Locy become speaker and the Republicans hold on to the Senate and they pick up seats in the Senate so that would sort of be a split decision by I guess any measure right\nIt's a split decision except that the Democrats will have a focus they will control the house committees that are going to change\nTo think of think of the intelligence committee and set of newness running it\nYou'll have Adam Schiff gets what's gonna happen with the with the with all these investigations et cetera guess what's going to happen with the Judiciary Committee and their their there'll be relentless investigations of President Trump that he won't get anything done in the last two years and you know that talk about they'll go\nThey'll go check his taxes the leak all this stuff and he'll drive economy down one of the things that that you know us\nPollsters we get calls before the elections from hedge fund guys for major Wall Street guys what are you seeing in the in the election all you want to know why the market's been going down the last month because they're seen that the Democrats could take the house and they know what that means to the economy the economy will stall out\nWhat do you think don't shown to you in the same area you said is getting very tight also\nI think John's analysis is exactly right I think the Democrats I actually wouldn't might even be a little bit more cautious I see between twenty five and thirty see I think that um\nAnd if they get twenty three seats that means they win the house\nThat that is correct time could jak thing they\nAre saying the Democrats could win by little as two seats\nYeah I Am saying that I said on your air or the other night it would be two to four I'm In the same range I think John's analysis is very very rare\nAnd I think he is right to say that the Democrats are mobilized and focus on the um on the house exclusion of the Senate but the amount of money that's being spent on really the thirty races I think Sean butter on your website cannot be underestimated and\nYou know mid term elections tend to be referenda on the president and the incumbent party and there's one little dirty secret it's\nNot so much from Trump that is at risk if the Republicans in the house and Senate will have much lower ratings than the president and it is that is the soft underbelly of the Republican Party\nAt one of the weaknesses as it relates also to the Republican House is there's so many retirements what are their forty by a separate retirements are incumbents and name recognition for a lot of people and a lot of these races is negligible zero it takes years to build up name recognition in a district John\nAbsolutely and by the way that that top thirty most important races that you put on your website\nThose are critical seats that the Republicans really need to win and and the dog is it is I mean granted the Democrats should be listening to him but fortunately for us they don't listen to him too much for one Democrat that does listen to them is former Mayor Bloomberg in New York City\nWas a big superPAC and it's putting the resources into electing Democrats in the house now that he's gone back to being a registered Democrat and the Democrats really\nDug understands that they they\nThey're very smart they really understand how to how to win races and how to take power and the Republicans need to wake up I mean those of us who are older I remembered delivering a survey that Haley Barbour helped pay for Nineteen Ninety four and September that have we have the generic Republicans up\nSeven and that was to the house leadership and there was a soon to be Speaker Gingrich with Bob Michael I was presenting the numbers to him saying you're going to be the next speaker and\nWe just need to not compromise on Clinton care well Haley Barbour forward ten million dollars to help when more seats and win that election the Republicans are raising record some say the orange she has out raised a has out raise the uh uh Democrats their National Committee to the one\nThe ... that money needs to find his way into the into these top thirty races that you've outlined where the Democrats are outspending us virtually two to one and all those races this week and you've got to be able to put money into those races weather's digital LEDs a\nTV ads even nationally and saying stop below sea\nWe've got to have an equal voice with the Democrats\nAnd uh uh ... they've really they really are focused in on trying to take over the house and it's and it's their their shot at power\nWell they're shot a power but remember you know those that have been saying the investigations into the deep state and I don't believe that's true because we have Senate committees that are just as capable of doing that as well and similarly if the Republicans were able to build their majority\nIn the Senate any legislation that Nancy Pelosi and company want to pass\nThat is going to be against what the Republicans won the Senate is never going to get through it'll die there and we'll have divided government but I think you're most right in the fact that it's going to be\nBasically two more years like we've had and that is endless you know ridiculous absurd obscene investigations show trials by Adam Schiff Maxine Waters Gerald Gerald Nadler and company and in other words\nIt's the progress will will slow down dramatically a there is also the hope that Republicans in the lame duck session could actually get in there and passed the funding for the border wall maybe repeal and replace Obamacare in the meantime\nLuck I think Sean that if as John and I think folks that are suggesting that more likely than not the Democrats win the house what we are looking at with almost great certain date is ... come gridlock for two years\nI make a slightly different on a book on the patriots first before but I Know John is certainly you're shot I just hope we stop demonizing doing what Maxine Waters say\nI think she's gaming society doesn't pay his taxes he's an idiot Colin Powell said it best he's a national disaster he's an embarrassment to this country it makes me so angry that this country has gotten to this point that this pool disposal has wound up where he has I'd like to punch him in the face\nI guess I'm not supposed to talk about the John\nI Know it but you don't want to let some people are hoping that\nAfter this election it all goes away it's not going to go away if what this is about is Donald Trump is a historic president and the region and he's a historic president is he's not from the establishment he beat the Republican establishment he beat the national establishment he's there he's not\nHe's not only draining the swamp but he's a threat to their very existence so it's going to happen is\nThe presidential race is going to start right after the election on November ... where the Democrats are going to put up a big deal to people who are going to be all at the president and if they get the house and Nancy Pelosi the speaker\nIt's all about beating Donald Trump's so this race November six is not just about control the Congress it's really about\nThe what the Democrats are doing to get rid of Donald Trump what the establishment is

early voting the panhandle is crucial to the entire state of Florida you have two very tight races you got the sand is running for governor and you got rich got running for senator\nAnd if the people that have been displaced can't get back and vote that's going to be problematic for dissent distance gotten any chance they have a winning\nWell that's what I'm calling to urge mop fill up and do you get out and vote a chart boat Governor Scott needs are but they're hoping that will be too busy doing recovery tend to get out\nWell in Florida early voting is ongoing so that means you can go any time between as I understand it now and election day um I Know it's hard especially for people some people have lost their everything they lost their entire home they'd been relocated\nAnd they don't have a chance to change their voter registration probably so that means that up to go back to where they live in or they can get an absentee ballot I don't think it's too late for that\nTo eleven days but you'd have to check in with your local elections office\nYes that's correct I saw it on the news the other day about that gave out still\nLaying courage everybody to get out and vote yeah just call your local\nElections office have them send you an absentee ballot if you're not there if you can get back in and vote obviously you know Rick Scott won both races only by one percent I mean Gillum is now up which would does it scares the daylights out of me based on you know his agenda\nAnyway I Hope the un all our best to our friends in the panhandle we know you've been through a lot

things like\nHow 'bout sanctuary for illegal alien criminals about giving Medicare to people who are here illegally and when we see this as low as ... as a group of thousands of illegal heading towards our border\nBeen listening to the Democrats promising a benefit some jobs that should go to the American people [noise]\nYou know even Daryl I so who's retiring his district I think it's the forty ninth and southern orange and northern coastal la San Diego area that that is that in trouble or is that coming back\nI'm afraid that's coming back to her as as a uh well I make sure that I'm afraid that the candidate I and our kids in trouble there but you know what counts as not poll beforehand was counts as a poll on election day and\nA white man heart out to oppose tax increases in California's immigration sanctuary law but the state right\nWing right [noise] well no what it is it's it's frankly a just a personal issue on her and her campaign and the Democrats certainly know how to use personal issues they know how to use name calling\nThing that they they basically ... every time you disagree with one of them you you end up racist or not fear and this is what are the way at least I Believe the two people who are\nA bit off maybe they're Frank psychologically the rangers somebody but when they hear the left wing calling us Nazis and calling us racist and ... and and having people like I Am watching than others\nPublicly saying that we should be a timid dated them be Acosta while we're eating in a restaurant the Democrats never complain about that and it gives these nut cases a an an idea\nHow's Duncan hunters district looking I Know they went after him and his wife personally but he seems to be holding back\nUm his opposition is struggling to get any traction at one time Obama campaign worker he seems to be holding his lead in his district right that's right the ... congressional district in in San Diego in riverside county\nWell Duncan Hunter is a is a treasure and his people know that and a\nA day or he he had some trouble or his treasure was not keeping the books right and got him in trouble I understand my treasure by the way for ... years

card and all these bills come in for these trip abroad and I am I'm assuming she knows about it I just wanted to thank you for then Sean no problem\n[laughter] I\nGot you got their full with that but he but he sold it on there how about Republican incumbent Jeff Denham a former state senator air force\nAttorneys in a pretty tight raised with Josh Harder um that's more in the Central Valley area how's that race\nGo ... my we're all empire is is like like Dennis than again such a fantastic congressman for his own people just watched out for them I got I have a couple of disagreements with him but the fact is I Know is\nEnergetic and will step forward and he will argue the case for his people\nAny time so it is and although he was being outspent I'm sure I look I'm being outspent by six or seven to one\nAnd let me know Bloomberg another four million dollars and the last review the campaign all of us we're facing now but when the public knows where we are\nLike er with Duncan Hunter they know drunk or hotter as they're known done um they they they know us personally and they know where I work trying to return to protect them we speak for them\nAnd the other people were just calling names and joined the liberal left line\nAll right well for those in Southern California all the seats that we're talking about ISIS old seat Duncan Hunter seat obviously the case of Dana Rohrabacher I mean these have been strong solid conservative voices now in your case\nOr what for a couple of decades now in Congress and you're one of the few people that don't want to stay there are actually you know keep your promises and work hard for the people in your district so I just wanted to look let us know if we can help at all as you go through the\nSoil you you are you are Sean and we all have to remember if we lose control the house that's ... ... mile lecture maimed the Democrats will grind our country to a halt there will be gridlock there will be all sorts\nOf attempts to disrupt the president from getting anything done and we don't want to you don't want to or just how presidents for\nPresidency any more than ... collectors already done\nAll right thanks so much for being with us Dana Rohrabacher eight hundred dying for one Sean toll free telephone number by the way some angel families those families that have had loved ones killed by illegal immigrants in the country they are actually planning to go down proactively to the border to have to meet the caravan should they make it\nThat far a let's get tore a busy phones will talk to them a let's say Hi to Donna is in Frederick Marilyn Donna Hi how are you glad you called eleven days away\nHi Shaun yeah can't wait to get out there and vote and I've got several people up in my mind and keeping pat ... we have to get out there this is such a a referendum against the socialists and I've got to say in the event state\nYou know these devices that never detonated you know I call them I guess suspicious device is because we don't really know if they actually bombs but\nIt got me to make sure that that's been confirmed as they when they said they had powder I'm assuming there was some type of gun powder\nOr some type of explosive powder and then had shrapnel in it like a lot of chard of glass and you know we've got to get to know a little bit more about this guy short of the van that had a CNN sucks picture on it in a picture of Donald Trump it doesn't mean a thing and\nYou know by the way I remember when I when Bernie Sanders when one of his supporters shot up that baseball field I said at the time boy if this I'm not blaming Bernie nobody should blame Bernie Sanders he's not responsible for what one does and I said but boy if it was some supporter of Trump or any Republican oh they'd blame everybody\nWe know what I mean I'm not going to do what the left does here\nBernie Sanders is not responsible for what one of his stupid supporters have to say but this most Bernie Sanders supporters are not violent and not out there trying to kill Republicans and Bernie said he was sick and by the entire\nYou know anti GOP massacre here and I believe him\nWell it's a different tact than you hear from the media today right\nRight and you know what what concerns me and thank you for correcting me about the update on the um that bomb threats what concerned about is as he mentioned the van with all this stickers okay perhaps it is somebody from the far right but\nI'm noticing what I'm hearing is the the sticky jury as far as how they were placed how they with no you know issue with the the van itself but the other thing I thought about was William Clyde Allen who\nThreaten people with rice and a couple of weeks ago and he was arrested and I'm starting to question could there be a connection between those individuals could there be more than one person involved in this whole\nScenario that's been going on for as you well know months because the Trump family was threatened as well\nAs it and I've gone through a lot of this it's not fun and I don't talk about it a lot of ... I've I've shared about one percent of the things that I've dealt with throughout my career and frankly I don't think anybody wants to hear it and it's sadly is a part of being in the public eye and having strong political views it's on it really is unfortunate\nUm but that's why I was I think\nWhat we should be able to be able to do so you know without fear of any type of retribution and apparently that's not how it's going to work but you know look it's let's wait and see I Am getting mixed messages all over the place on this man this guy this background we have to find\nOut if there were accomplices here we were just beginning to put it together or people can assume what they want but as we have always done is we're not going to rush to judgment at all in this program and we're going to wait and see and when we know the truth will pass it on to you or we can yeah well we ... we don't know\nYeah the truth matters and China I Want to say one other thing to do with respect to the invasion what concerns me about that and it's not really getting recorded much is how many people\nAre sick and we have children dying from early on like illnesses now so what talking and bring and that's another\nIssue I you know I'm concerned about\nYou know well look we got we always got to stay on top of all these diseases and stay ahead of it and thank God we have some brilliant scientists and doctors that work endlessly out long hours every day to to save us\nAll right we've got to take a break hey listen I Will tell you that my pillow changed my life\nIt just works I Love it I Can't be without it I fall asleep faster I I stay asleep longer\nNow my pillows out Dunn themselves they have taken what they do for your head and your neck and sleeping and they've added to your entire asleep experience by creating the my pillow mattress copper you put it on top of your mattress\nHigher placed on highway one fifty and Hoover November sixth through the eight attendance is

saying\nLet's get back to our busy phones eight hundred nine four one Sean is our toll free telephone number you want to be a part of the program Jim is in Nebraska hey Jim do you feel like I Do that I felt conned supporting Ben Sasse and and I think ... the people in Nebraska um how do you feel about do you live there\nYeah I'm not real happy with that when he was campaigning he\nYou know if I remember correctly you know Ted Cruz came out was campaigning with him in a ... maybe even Sarah pale and I don't remember for sure but uh everything he sounded like everything that he believed in was exactly what Donald Trump is doing his very best to try to accomplish and it seems like\nWell if he had his way we wouldn't have any success that we've had the last two years but because he was never Trump or and\nYou know now he writes a book any devotes twenty pages of is failing book against me and you know lo and behold nobody wants to buy as book as I predicted and I just think it's amazing because when he was running he was begging us to put them on the air as often as we could and we even put an audio out of him praising me\nAt the almost daily so I guess\nYou know he says now I'm Bad for America but I was pretty good for Ben Sasse in America at the time that he wanted to use these airwaves every day to get his message out\nYeah and I'll tell you at least in my district which encompasses about a three quarters of the west end of the state of Nebraska I'm that's Adrian ... district I'm Ben Sasse is not real popular right at the moment I'll just put it that way\nYeah well look I I personally feel like on a level it doesn't happen to me ... very often he said everything that I thought would would make a great senator and lead the great people the ... and all I've seen since ... you know a guy go to Washington get full of themselves\nVery arrogant ... are very angry guy with a very quick temporary confronted me once but anyway I'll give you the last word go ahead what's what else on your mind well\nI'm with the package\nBombs devices I think this is kind of um something that a showing in the media and some on the left have kind of been wanting to happen um with their insightful language or Cory Booker telling people to get in Congress many spaces\nI'm Nancy Pelosi she comes out and she says if there is a collateral damage on the side of those who are against us well then so be it um in Brock Obama himself when he was telling a people to kill there to get in their families in Britain spaces\nAnd let them know what about\nAll I got to run here but live and let you go thank you so much for your call eight hundred nine four one Sean is our number if you want to be a part of the program quick break right back uh well continue a lot more news to get to straight ahead\n\n\nMocks his I enjoy the odds of federal authorities arrested a supporter of President Trump in Florida who's accused of sending explosive devices through the mail to prominent

[noise]\nRight I mean liberals crazy [laughter]\nThree hours a day every day Sean Hannity show is back on the air\nUp spoken twice in the last two days to my counterpart\nForeign secretary been a great we trust Mexico's leaders know what the best steps are to resolve the situation and we urge timely action on their part [noise]\nThe United states also has a message for those who are currently part of this caravan or any caravan which follows you will not be successful in getting into the United states illegally no matter what\nA repeat the chairman will not cross our southern border illegally under any circumstances if you stick to come here go through the normal refugee process if you apply for refugee status a permanent solution as possible and Mexico or in a third country\nBut I can tell you with certainty we're determined that illegal entry into the United states from this caravan will not be possible\nWhen our country is assaulted by thousands and thousands of people marching and they all do we say we're going to go into the guns you\nCan't do that would allow [noise] it's unfair\nTo you but it's also unfair to thousands and thousands of people that have gone through a legal process someone waiting on line ten years [noise] everything is perfect and they don't get in but other people just march right and it will not happen you watch\nHeard about the angel families um and with the caravan still marching towards our southern border well angel families now are getting involved in fighting back you know over the years I've had it's a very tough but I'm very proud to know\nAnd have gotten to know families that have dealt with the worst\nAnd that is losing children and you've heard about these angel families where kids are there are killed by illegal immigrants and I've gotten to know many of these families and I've been out on the road with them when I was doing town halls would then candidate Trump\nAnd they've been on this radio program many times many bent on my TV show\nAnd one such father is a guy that I have so much respect for his name is Steve run back and his son was grant run a back\nThis is a great kid imagined that she's working overnight at a convenience store just because you know he wants to work and and get money for school and doing all the things that good kids do and an illegal immigrant\nYou know comes in once a pack of cigarettes he apparently couldn't get it fast enough and he murdered this whether it was Twenty one years old at the time I mean just a horrible story now anyway Steve and others have announced the launch of the ... Institute angel families\nThat are headed to confront the caravan at the border and they're announcing the Ronald back Institute of politically active think tank in honor of his son grant who was fatally shot in the face in Mesa, Arizona three years ago\nOne of the so called dreamers a member of the ... a ... a cartel grandfather also co founder of Courtland Sykes or building a team of policy experts for the Institute and we welcome Steve\nRonald back back to the program sir welcome back you know how I feel\nAbout all you've been through my thoughts my prayers were always with you\nThanks Sean thanks for having me how you doing today\nI'm I'm doing good but watching this caravan and you know I Know cage Stanley's case some we know lower ... case in your case and then we become friends and Mr Mendoza his case and you know I've come to honor and respect you and your families I don't know how you ever\nRecover fully when you when you lose a child like this but you've decided to take pro proactive measures here tell me what you're doing\nWell there are back to Institute is a politically active\nThey take that means we're going to care for a few years we're going to confront this caravan and the issue of the caravan for going through you know the threat at our nation's border and showing that I've talked to for the fish is a threat this shows\nOne of the biggest problems for national security as our southern or we have you know we have a sovereign nation to have a sovereign nation you need three things you need borders you have your way to secure the border and you need a central government\nWell we got out of the three we've got a structural government we've got a way to secure if if we do not have secure borders of the southern for\nYou know let me play for you we have a list of crimes that I'm guaranteeing many in our audience and even though we've talked about it so often\nDon't even know crimes perpetrated by illegal immigrants against innocent families now when I went down to the border and was briefed with then governor Rick Perry and I've been down there Thirteen times I was shocked to learn and a seven year period in Texas alone\nOr when people are busy with watching this situation if smoking mirrors ... they're going to go to these parts of order they don't have any protection they don't have a wall they don't have a ... offense to speak up and they're going to flooding of the country\nBut we saw the fence the main thing at the southern border of Mexico where they just knock that down in in charge through\nI don't think that's going to be allowed to happen here I'm sure there are contingency plans being made right now and I would imagine barriers are part of that plan and I would imagine there's many troops unnecessary to stop the invasion of the United states by people that are not willing to follow the laws that we have set out on immigration\nThe really sad thing is that we have other silence on the left\nAnd and even they almost outward support for people that want to violate our laws I guess that's what we've been watching unfolding was sanctuary cities and states and\nYou know here we have even criminal aliens I mean in the case of of your son grant or how long was the murder of your son in jail before he was let out and not handed over to ice\nWas shot it actually the grant never served a day in jail or prison for his his prior conviction\nIn San ... never served a day and and you see this all the time with a lot of these illegal immigrants they played it down or they use their status or you know their children they use their children I mean I've got an anchor babies I don't have anybody to take care of them you know they use this all the time and\nIf you really want to talk about child separation edits and its finality um and the president was the one that fixed it even though it existed in the Obama and Bush years you're experiencing child separation forever there's no hope your son was murdered ... we can't bring him back from the dead\nNo shot him and it's like people I spend Christmas we put up a Christmas tree on graves grave I spent just birthdays and most of the other holidays we spend with him at his great I mean we we don't\nThat's the only way we have to be with him\nObviously you know anybody who believes in God and believes in ... she is with us all the time ... you need a place to go visit and that's likely place\nAnd you have all these angel families that that is what they do this is what they have we're never going to say that again the illegals that are bringing their children are using other children and screaming about separation\nThey're going to get to see their children to get there going to be reunited by law within seven to twelve day that's by law\nI don't know I I just want to thank you for what you're doing your you know I listen to your when your strength and and obviously you're trying to prevent this from happening for we're really asking for nobody is against immigration we just want it to be legal\nWe want to be able to vet the people that come into this country they've got to be able to take care of themselves and we want to know that they have the best interests of this country and love of this country that\nWe have and I'm not going to be a burden or a threat to any of our our citizens that are here\nAnd we don't have control of it now but anyway I'm Steve thank you for being with us our thoughts and prayers always with you sir you're great American and uh I I really pray for you and your family as I Know how hard
