it's kind of like good weren't went on the pile up the yet the healthcare immigration pact or my opponent is a clerk you left off and so we're putting the word out but it's like you said you're pouring billions in because they\nKnow they're going after you and Derek ... big time in our junior right\nRight no it's it's a it's a battle and that there there is is that my opponent the resist\nI should really doesn't have a platform it All right now and so she's just running out in the resistance and out and do vote and that that's why I think I think the people especially after the Supreme Court ... Hillary yesterday and all the folks chime in on the left\nI think the er the voters in Virginia or darker to write that\nLook I think we've been putting a pen specific raises a night um congressman Jordan you know I mean the California Arizona Mayo loving Utah Colorado is a number of seats there there was an if people want the full list look we've identified that\nPop Seventy seats we put it up on the Hannity dot com oh so that people can check\nAnd make sure that that\nIf their congressmen or a woman is in a tough race that\nThey get out to the polls what do you think's going to happen in twenty six days congressman drug\nI think we're going to win I think we got great candidates like Dave Brat who were fighting the because if the American people elected us to fight for so I think we're going to win and I think the way you phrase it ups on his way you've been doing it\nHow radical the left is I'd like to say it this way there there that that left today is that they apply Capra Nick when he respects the flag they embrace Governor Cuomo when he says America was never got great material and Maxine Waters when she says go out and harassed anyone who supports the president and we saw that double down on that whole mindset double down on yesterday with what Clinton in older set about Republican\nWhat are you ... ... they're going after Sarah Sanders and Pam Bondi and secretary Nielsen\nYeah I it just it just how radical the left at today's modern Democrat Party today's party of the Web has taken most extreme positions in history raise your taxes abolish ice never secure the border continue to socialized medicine and the ... the president and you contrast that with what the president under his leadership we've accomplished\nList is going on but we did this the other day but they could buy the taxes cut ... regulations reduced the economy going or quaint two percent lowest unemployment if years ... out of the Iran deal the embassies in Jerusalem we've got a new NAFTA deal the ... the ... the north Korea and we got to get guys\nOn the United States Supreme court that's an amazing record and we've been up that way and twenty six days we will win and keep the majority and continue to be able to do the things to make\nAmerica why don't you know some of these candidates they can't string two sentences together that they have no idea why they're running for office when you can communicate\nThis is a nationalized election and we got to understand that and go out and get that kind of message they read understand that he's out campaigning on the good things that happen with conservative leadership and his leadership uh that's how we have to run these campaigns and if we do I think we keep the majority\nLet me ask you a question now Fox has confirmed\nThat the deputy attorney general Rod Rosenstein enacting FBI directed his after the firing a coma Andrew McCabe and Robert Mueller all met on a weekend day after Mueller's investigation started up and in that meeting Rosenstein and the and McCabe or\nBoth detailing reasons why the other one needs to recuse themselves or the Russia investigation as as the hell are sitting there watching all this go on to knowing that well I guess I'm In charge of the whole thing what do you make of that uh they brought\nYou know I just go back to the way your frame that you always got a dot com it's all like ... Iran over its like specific but in your intro Rosenstein said we have to follow the constitution for the people because we need oversight to follow the evidence using reason\nAnd now he woke up in front of the people right say he's not just saying no to Jim Jordan and members of oversight committee saying no to the American people and he when he's just that in your remarks that the job and the role of the constitution is to give the people oversight\nUsing evidence that reason so he he's thumbing his nose at U.S Congress and if we don't hold strong that precedent is not good and I'll let him go on with the so\nYeah it's not so ... you're exactly right both the cave and Rosenstein ... this is interesting that both actually right Andy McCabe should have been recused from any type of oversight over the Mueller investigation because of his involvement with his wife with\nHis his conflict when his wife was running for office and he was supporting your so that's the disqualify him Rosenstein is right about that but in the caves right about Rosenstein Rosenstein wrote a memo\nFor why Kobe should be fired one of the things Miller is looking into was there obstruction of justice into the firing of calling me you've gotta be kidding me so that guy's gonna oversee this so they both had complex and so that that sort of the funny thing is to argue with each other I'm like you're both right neither one of you should be involved in this special counsel any type of oversight\nIt really is not only do you ... everyone who steps in your home you can just settle for any pain company called five star painting today for your professional on time free estimate\nInterior and give me your whole house payments on even outside ... so you can concentrate on some things that fall

Jordan I liked Dave Brat I like all these guys but after a while you just find that they're they're they're all talking no actually\nThat's not true I mean do you think of everything that we have gotten we've been able to peel the onion to the point where we've exposed at all of this happened they listed in every document we have gotten this because we had to pull teeth to get everything I mean we we are getting their hope you see that\nYou've given it to him on a platter but they will act on it\nFor well it's not Jordan and it's not brat and it's not meadows but it is some of the

great books that he's written actually now the over I was watching on the Fox news channel has an ad out there\nIt is now the number one best selling history ... series in history and this tells a powerful story and one that I think we really need to always be aware of and that is that evil does exist\nI talked about this for years it's very hard for good people or genuinely good people people trying to be good people to understand their wrapped their arms around the fact that how is it possible\nThat you know communism fascism in in this case that he was writing about not the ... in the last century a hundred million humans souls destroyed\nNow I couldn't put the book down as it tells the entire story of the\nPost war manhunt for these Nazi war criminals that even takes us to modern

people now and how they change from the Obama years what did they offering besides I hate Donald Trump\nWon like we had we care about in any case we care that\nI we got a bad line again have been the Jonathan what is it\nYou know something that you just said a second ago about how long ago George Bush was\nIn office and they're still talking about this what I what I hear you saying when I don't hear Daniel saying or any liberals for that matter is the fact that\nWe're here and now and there's things that have to be fixed now we can reflect on the past eight years because it just occurred and we're still suffering from that but we we have rhetoric in Washington DC\nThat is not trying to fix anything and in fact it's as if they are trying the Democratic party is trying to crush or the will of the American people so they can go after the constitution get rid of the electoral college change the number of Supreme Court justices ridiculous stuff like that and it's\nHow do you become a party that doesn't even believe in simple due process the constitution presumption of innocence how you know how how do you become a party that is now noted for\nYou you know people in your party

constitution it's shocking\nHow do you run on the idea that I Want you know the tax cuts the largest in history putting a thousand two thousand dollars and and the average family's pocket in this

only thing I Would say is that when Newt Gingrich came to power every member was right after the the Clinton care fiasco they tried to do socialized medicine didn't work out the Republicans when they took power Clinton was smart enough and I think through the advice of people like Dick Morris and others\nTo move to more to the center right\nAnd we were able to get to a balanced budget it was one the Republicans put together they finally got Bill Clinton assign it and it worked but it was more at a political necessity than any\nAny principles that that he held deeply liberalism is a failed law
