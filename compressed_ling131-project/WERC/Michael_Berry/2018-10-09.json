O. J. face consequences\nRegarding fights that well he signed the final buys a warrant himself and then when he's talking about the rule of law speaking up for truth and Jim Jordan blasting Rod Rosenstein uh conduct now the president met yesterday on air force one apparently had a meeting not a lot of details about what went on in the meeting\nWith Rod Rosenstein there was talk about well he might be fired after it had been discovered that he was talking about well you want me to wear a wire\nAround the president and his answer was you know at least has the spin was well I was just saying that you wouldn't want me to wear a wire around the president and it was all in the tone and the cadence of what he said we have three articles in front of me right now one by Katherine heritage at Fox one by Sarah Carter won by John Solomon\nSolomon's article goes on former FBI lawyer plot to record removed Trump was not a joke and John Solomon let me read from the article don't tell for FBI general council member James Baker\nHe was one of those that resigned that those infamous discussions\nAbout secretly recording president Donald Trump and using the tapes to remove him for office where a joke he apparently doesn't believe it and he yelled quite the vantage point as he was on the inside of the FBI bureaus leadership and may have twenty Seventeen when the discussions occurred and Baker told Congress last week\nThat his boss than acting FBI Director Andrew McCabe remember ... cave and Lisa Page both took notes of the meeting and McCabe was saying yeah Rod Rosenstein had in fact said this\nAnyway now James Baker is saying and Andrew McCabe is saying that in fact they were dead serious about about the idea\nOf Sarah surreptitiously recording the forty fifth president using the evidence to make the case that Trump should be removed from office according to every source now and all three articles and Baker told lawmakers that he wasn't in the meeting that McCabe had\nWith the deputy attorney general Rod Rosenstein in which the subject came up but he had first hand conversations with McCain and the FBI lawyer that\nWas assigned to a ... page about the issue so Baker talk to both of the un quote as far as Baker was concerned this was a real plan being discussed set a source directly familiar with the congressional investigation it was no laughing matter to the FBI or member then you can go back to what was the insurance policy to remove Trump\nIs five months now into his presidency is it just before the appointment of the special counsel\nAs soon as Justin ... at that time frame around the media elite strategy that was occurring anyway so it goes on word of bakers testimony now is surface just days before Rosenstein said to be interviewed and private by the\nHouse Judiciary committee lawmakers that's supposed to happen Thursday of this week and the New York times first reported allegations that Rosenstein the number two at the department of justice has tried to downplay his role in all of this in his office suggested that\nHe thought the discussion was a joke that Rosenstein never gave in order to carry out any such plot\nAnd he doesn't believe the Trump should be removed from office but making those statements through a spokesperson is a bit different than having Rosenstein himself face Congress answer the questions under the penalty of a felony if lawmakers think he's lying and bakers account lawmakers this month clearly complicates already complicated picture\nAs it relates to Rod Rosenstein before Congress assuming he shows up for Thursday's interview but even more so Baker story ladies' Baron extraordinary conversation and we go on from there and now we're going to really take our time with this issue today and\nWe're going to now begin to put the pieces of the puzzle together because what this is where laying out here are the top people the the upper echelon remember twenty five people have either been demoted fired or have left the FBI the OJ in their\nUpper ranks here and James Baker is one of them and Andrew McCabe at least a page of both corroborating what apparently now James Baker is set about Rod Rosenstein anyway John Solomon ease but an investigative reporter is what the hell\nBreak Jarrett Fox News legal analyst\nAnd of course the seller of the number one book the Russia hoax thank you all for being with us I'm John let's just I Want to also put this in context where people because it gets complicated\nWe've got a first start with the timeline the timeline is may twenty Seventeen well that's when Robert Mueller is getting appointed by Rod Rosenstein just before that we had people like ... and Peter Struck talking about uh media leaks strategy\nThat had to do with the ... well it now appears that that was all being league for the purposes and again ... ... was was the ... recycled in different news outlets\nFor the purpose of initiating the special counsel so would get appointed that we're discovering that they're even talking about surreptitiously taping the president of the United states so that they can remove him from office this sounds like a cool to me\nWell if there's one other event that occurs and that may timeframe that really I think you're a shockwave for this conversation and that was the termination of James\nComey's the FBI Director of it all out all this Russia investigation to go on and we know now after market may still have anywhere from ... ah proving any form of collusion with Russia and nine months out of James Kobe's let this go on for nine months\nHe's let two agents who have an anti Trump a virus read that investigation he get fired and what's the natural reaction of all those who've been supporting dreams come Iraq the roses or a McCain\nAnd a stroke page it's hey maybe we can remove this guy rather we can't prove that he gets something wrong with Russia maybe we can prove confident in what will record him and uh and maybe try to take 'em out through the recording and the twenty Fifth Amendment this is not what the FBI with ... through I'm record talking about history book\nLays out a real possibility that this was a soft correct look at this we have yet to getting a crime here that in fact they can't find a crime by a pay\nAs well at least ... pages testimony just to be clear she said they they had found nothing and nine months leading up to the point\nThat's right so they switch gears right maybe we can remove them other than me and and this conversation is so extraordinary ...\nIt says that drama the FBI the twenty Fifth Amendment never envision the FBI being involved in it she got the FBI and the deputy attorney general or allegedly our conversation he says it's a joke\nThey say they're dead serious about it and they believe he was dead serious about it and no matter which way it comes down is just another example of how far down the road the FBI\nWas beyond its core mission which is to investigate crimes stop counterintelligence\nAnd again this has nothing to do with rank and file agents at all this this is a group of rogue power hungry upper echelon management types and if anything they took the the cases away from the field offices purposely so that they can involved themselves in these nefarious activities that's why\nIt really does explain a Greg Jarrett why every FBI guy I Know is so angry about this because they know was ripped out of their hands\nAnd this and all of them say that if this was them they know they get fired\nThat's right and in fact I interviewed former top officials that the FBI who are angry at people like James Comey Andrew McCabe James Baker Lisa Page\nPeters struck for ruining the reputation the good name of the FBI I wrote a column recently that said Rosenstein action\nIn an attempt to deposed the sitting president United States\nIs the equivalent of an attempted coup not a bloody violent coups what's known and John refer to it a moment

recommended the special counsel Robert Mueller number three is also the guy that signed the fourth financial advisor warrant\nOther words the third renewal application on Carter Page a Trump campaign associates\nWell now we have information corroborated and confirmed by three separate high ranking FBI ideal Jay sources including a James Baker who is resigned and Lisa Page and Andrew McCabe that is now under criminal investigation all corroborating that Rod Rosenstein\nHimself was discussing wearing a wire to ... secretly recorded conversations with President Trump and the hope she said something that they could use and then both the twenty Fifth Amendment and remove him from power Andrew McCabe telling that in and confirming that along with Lisa Page\nAnd go into the office of the

that we're following is\nWe as a pretty stunning revelation since it directly contradicts what the Justice Department and the FBI officials have said in sworn testimony but\nJames Baker also telling Congress last week member of the law firms Perkins Kuwait\nThat's where Hillary's campaign that's where the DNC funneled money so it would look like a legal expense when in fact it was anything but and then they hired fusion GPS and research firm that went out and got hired by the name of Christopher Steele and he used as Russian sources to put together\nA series of papers they become known as the ... same dossier that was never corroborated uh verify but used as a buys a warrant application the bulk of information to get a buys a warrant to spy on a Trump campaign associates and it gets worse than that it was used even though that\nInformation was not corroborated it was disseminated on all levels of government to propagandize on line to the American people in the lead up to a

Nunes saying on Sunday Now you have one of the top lawyers for the Democrats and the Clinton campaign\nWas feeding information directly to the top lawyer at the FBI so it appears the FBI and the Justice Department we're all doing the Clinton campaign's bidding and applying for Pfizer warrants\nAnd permission to snoop on the Trump campaign communications John Solomon and Greg Jared continue with us anything I'm saying here that is wrong Greg Garrett\nYou've got a hundred percent correct there was never any Trump Russia collusion the FBI and the D O D J knew it there was Hillary Clinton Russian\nCollusion two people are on her payroll the British by Christopher Steele who compose is a totally fabricated phony document\nBased on supposed Russian sources and providing it to the FBI and the de OJ so they can launch the investigation and spy on the Trump campaign and now a second person on the Hillary Clinton payroll Michael Saltsman or who is passing it along\nComputer storage

car insurance for gasoline you don't have home owners insurance for lawn care insurance just for the big things and we've tried to ensure everything top down and that's led to the last eight to ten years of\nInsurance premiums that have doubled or tripled when we need to do is insured less which is how every other insurance product works the key to that is means doctors have to make more of the services they provide affordable\nAnd they can if they cut out the middleman and streamline than a simple\nMath and how big is your practice how many patients do you have in your facility in atlas MD and Wichita\nIn Wichita we have five doctors and over thirty two hundred patients\nUnbelievable and your age and you give concierge care at all I could pick up a phone and I'm getting a doctor at three in the morning that it's going to answer my call\nYou do you have and I could go down and see somebody at three AM in the morning\nIf you need stitches ... it's an emergency you know a lot of history and phone calls or chest pain which we might send the ER but a lot of times the kid who's sick and a mom who's worried and\nUm you of if you can avoid the ER you can avoid a thousand or two thousand dollar bill that's how you get health care health insurance is a card in your wallet health care is access to your doctor yeah\nAll right and then how many other practices around the country have you been able to to provide your model that they have duplicated how you you've been out and about on a champion of this for a long time\nYet we've helped over five hundred and fifty doctors convert to this model in the last few years but there's about a thousand total there in forty eight states every state except north and South Dakota right now but we have one about to launch in North Dakota [noise]\nUm and then it's even gotten a little bit international so um this is a a sound tried and true model\nNow and what do you do Dr grows in terms of your president of duck ah docks were patient care foundation you know now that we have alternatives that are working real life experiences seems to me that we ought to be able to duplicate it a lot more than we are\nAbsolutely a so doctor patient care foundation is a physician or on health policy because doctors never seemed to be at the table when they were having these important conversations about health care\nSo we put traditions are getting back to the table to have these conversations\nPersonally I I also have a primary care practice much like that lets them here in southwest Florida how the practice of any health are plus when he was you know why are we using insurance to pay for health are for basic primary care services\nAll it does is create obstacles to access and care you know ... ... ... ... points as Dr Josh and we're seeing patients come to us\nFrom all over the state of Florida and even from outside of the country\nWe're seeing some inbound medical tourism are and what we're finding is that you know not not the same thing got about health insurance we're just using it wrong and you know when somebody is you know place twice the amount of money for a service because they just are health insurance\nWondering ensuring is using insurance drives up the cost of the other products so an MRI cash price for us is two hundred and twenty dollars while using your your commercial insurance you know we go through all the the hoops ticket it authorized\nYour co pays five hundred dollars or so we we see this time and again the more people are are coming out of pocket to pay for health health or I'll let you signed up to ... more insurance seems to be becoming an optical\nI'm an ... solution so you know I'm pleased to see that you know we're shifting the conversation from a coverage for everyone I'm Talking about reducing the cost of health care\nI think that the real close enough I was about to testify on us some help committee on the ...\nWould it be a better idea I mean I'm watching for example they have this race out in California everybody's shock gather news and who is now offering free health care for everybody\nIt whether you're a taxpayer whether you're in the ... the state legally or illegally everybody's got to get free health care well I basically put a sign that says come to California but you get sick\nUm because people are going to go there now what's interesting to me is that a Republican is within striking distance and that gubernatorial race out in California because instinctively people no we can't afford to pay\nFor every illegal immigrant in the country are but the reality is is that if I Lived in Wichita, Kansas I Would be a part of atlas empty and I would be your patient\nAdopt ... because I I think it's the best deal I liked the idea of being able to call my doctor whenever I'm sick or if I have a kid that sick every parent wants the ability to do that and your preserved for service provides it for fifty bucks a month now how much is the average in Wichita, Kansas catastrophic plan of it for the big things heart attack\nA accident or cancer how much we one of those plans cost\nAbout five hundred dollars a family five hundred dollars for a year or a month\nA month or so and the current rates closer to you know a thousand twelve hundred a across the nation people are paying more for health insurance each month and they're paying for their mortgage if the Trump tax cuts only put a hundred dollars\nPer household per month in and they're being credited with the economic boom of your four point two percent GDP\nIf we fix health insurance we could put five hundred dollars back in the pocket of every household or the real ... and the the politician there has in California is to send them an originality\nJust throwing more money at the problem has never fixed it\nThe what we're doing is Dr Lee and ourselves and and a thousand other physicians is is innovating and saying how do we get Mets cheaper how do we make it so patients don't have co pays how do we provide stitches for no cost because they're so affordable\nI'm actually looking at ways it's fundamentally fixing the system that's what we need not just promises of more spending\nWay and if I could add add to that just a a ... you know as far as the cost of care is the biggest thing that people ask us is how can I just get major medical you know we\nWe can afford what what services the direct Parma care practices are providing but we just need something catastrophic well Obama Care made that illegal ah so something ... just brought\n... get access to these major medical plan it was called ... short term medical plans and some would argue that these are actually true insurance they don't cover anything except the major medical expenses they're Seventy five dollars a month or\nWhat it is this can be implemented easily city by city town by town we can duplicate the model it already does take care of individuals with preexisting conditions if somebody wants to sign up for outlets MD and they have a preexisting condition or Dr ... denied them service\nEverybody's welcome everybody is priced the same just based on age um we know we're going to work harder for some patients but we're also going to not have to work as hard for other patients and we don't want to know judged by their illness\nHow did you get to who directly negotiate these prices with these pharmaceutical companies\nBoy I Wish I could say was because we're so darn good at it um that the truth is it's so much more simple than that\nAt a doctor's in forty four states are allowed to work directly with pharmaceutical wholesalers so just like you can go to Costco and get something for much cheaper because you pay a membership we\nDo the same thing and we're able to\nGet the you know the actual cost of medicine might be a ten dollars for a thousand pills and because we don't have a staff of seven people per physician fighting insurance\nBut the wholesale\nCost of that medicine is six dollars so we're inflating the whole system with paperwork and ... you need to streamline and in ... and innovate just like Silicon Valley does with anything else\nHow does this go for all the other cancers that are out there leukemia and about you know prostate cancer lung cancer\nSo shortly after a peace will come to us from out of the country was five or ...\nOr or or certainly one of the Caribbean would cost or a hundred thousand dollars she called us all six months these uh uh as we did her surgery her her imaging every state or ... or ... thousand dollars low so that's a Ninety thousand dollar savings\nAt a hundred thousand dollars a conversational she's going to die for ...\nA ... dollar plus dollars that's or go to the church raise raise money takes tail\nOut and you know considering that most people out of pocket expenses now for health insurance plans that will let them thousand dollars per year what are we ensuring when that once in a lifetime catastrophic adults can be treated mature for less than ten dollars bingo\nUnbelievable well look I Hope everybody will pay attention because in twenty eight days Americans are going to go to the polls in Obamacare won't work and we know the left and the Democrats want to keep it in a I applaud\nYou guys for what you're doing and the fact that you've been able to duplicate the model around the country speaks volumes about what your real mission is and that is saving people's lives and it's very inspiring thank you both\nThanks on we'll\nTalk more about it and the day is
