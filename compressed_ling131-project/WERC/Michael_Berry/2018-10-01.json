breaking news eight hundred nine four one showing us a toll free telephone number you want to be a part of the program well what we're supposed to be last week a limited in scope and done very quickly is now evolved into Democratic senators\nOh the FBI must investigate all three credible allegations of sexual assault against judge Brett Kavanaugh\nBy the way why didn't they ask judge Kavanaugh when they had the opportunity last week if they don't want to expand the scope now the interesting thing about this email is well they're not putting out a list of we got to interview this one and this one and this one and this one and this one including\nThat anonymous person in this anonymous person that they're literally trying to tell the FBI had to do their job and we found out this weekend emails were ten late last week by a friend of the left wing attorney that's representing professor for the one that ...\nAnd believe Paula Jones and supported Al Franken anyway but a friend of hers last week a you remembered Dianne Feinstein recommended this attorney cats Deborah cats for professional forward\nAnd of course while she was meeting Dianne Feinstein with Brett Kavanaugh anyway it turns out that they are now soliciting members of the Georgetown Prep community for information and searching for additional women who accused\nSupreme Court nominee judge Brett Kavanaugh of impropriety this is what you would call a witch hunt this is now a we don't have enough so let's see let's let's go out and solicited people\nAnd see if we can find people that are willing to say something horrible about Brett Kavanaugh because maybe that's the way we'll be able to stop the nomination we got delayed like we wanted now we've got to be able to get everything that we want Newt Gingrich has a great question is there even one Democrat decent enough or disgusted enough to end this cabinet travesty\nAnd he joins us now Sarah how are you welcome back to the program\nI'm doing well but I was very struck this morning by Byron ... column in which he points out that the Democrats having decided that sex may not work are now looking at whether or not Kevin all might have been an accurate in describing how much he drank so they're spreading a wider\nAnd frankly in an age when Justice Ginsburg was very political and some attacks on President Trump\nThe Democrats are trotting out judicial temperament of this whole thing is is this character assassination it is I think tremendously bad for the country uh and it is it tells us who they are I mean I think the key to the election this fall\nIs which America do you want to be do you really want to be an America\nWhere somebody could live a decent life for thirty five years have two lovely daughter is a good marriage and then get smeared on ending Lee was totally uncorroborated sauces that that really the America we want to become\nYou know the judge was honest as could be said I like beer I drink beer I drink beer then sometimes I drink too much beer\nHe denied ever blacking out I mean the accusation that somebody could observe some but well he had the blackout that night um I was a bartender when I was Seventeen and Eighteen years old and I've seen a lot of drunk people in my life\nAnd I couldn't tell you whether or not they remembered the incident the next day and it wouldn't be me in the position of saying that\nBut what they're doing is they're moving the bar this is what you're saying the goalposts now are being literally moved every second every hour of every day and now that we have people working on behalf of the Dianne Feinstein\nRecommend the lord lawyer Deborah cats and sending out letters saying ah we we need more people um it sounds like they never want this to end and I don't think there is going to be a Democrat to answer your question that's going to be decent enough or disgusted enough to end it\nWell let me try to be very clear from it because I'm I'm frankly very disappointed in the judiciary Republicans up just denying reality fact is\nThis has nothing to do with traditional government this has nothing to do with the Senate this has nothing to do frankly with judge how\nThis is about a militant left wing group willing to lie assassin H meaner cheat I mean when you when you have\nWhen you have a mob that goes into a restaurant to harass Sen Cruz when you have to women [noise] who break into a an elevator to harass or senator over and over and over again but you have on the left his willingness to break the rules\nTo get what they want\nAnd I think that it's a very serious problem\nYou know it it does raise a lot of questions because at this point I don't think we're going to go back to high school years you know when people talk and I watched a lot of there's this weekend you know two commentators actually saying this is Sean Hannity could have given the speech\nI'm thinking okay um how is one supposed to act when they're falsely accused of literally drugging women and boys lined up or halls all over the course of course of many weekends\nAs the boys can then take their chance that gang raping women and being a participant in that\nI don't know what the significant or normal reaction would be for me if you're innocent it would be righteous anger and indignation that that to me would be the normal human response of you're innocent\nRight well let me let me in a plane historian from it because I spent the weekend thinking about what we're living through\nWhen you know Cory Booker says you're complicit with evil if you support Kavanaugh deceiving example you're getting you know when one Blumenthal who is the president was pointing out\nThis terrible record of overtly publicly lying about having served in Vietnam when he didn't know suddenly he's lecturing us on the importance of honesty and integrity [noise]\nAs I thought about it I went back and found a the following quote from Abraham Lincoln which he gave at Cooper Union in New York City and Eighteen sixty\nSpeaking about the defenders of slavery who are prepared to destroy the union\nHe says quote your purpose than plainly stated\nHis the you will destroy the government unless you be allowed to construe and enforce the constitution as you please\nOn all points in dispute between you and us you will rule or ruin and all events close quote I the reason I brought that option is I really believe that's where we are I think on the left you know people like Maxine Waters who remember if they get a majority she chairs the committee\nMachine not some random back bench not take she's a senior member of the Democratic party leadership and she has publicly saying that people you go out and find members of the Trump Administration you harass them and the stores you harass them at the gas station you harass them at at the at a restaurant what kind of country is that\nWell they're telling everybody to do it now they're out on a fishing expedition in what they promised last week which would be limited in scope\nAnd you know at an extra day to expedite the timeframe is now you know they're expanding it out even longer longer longer which means what we've all suspected they just they just want to stop this no matter\nHow they end up doing it I'm like when you are but the point is\nI think you're right but I also think that there's there's got to be a choice that was made here by the American people because if you can smear and lie and slander and bludgeon a guy like Brett Kavanaugh and go on these fishing expeditions and you're not even hiding what it is\nNobody is ever going to want to serve\nAny capacity in\nGovernment ever or not we want\nPeople should remember when you get to the total attorney and history of the left if they can do to count and all they can do it to you that can do it to your daughter they can do it to your son\nI mean this is what happened to the Duke lacrosse team a total liar total fabrication Trent over a year is a cloud over these young men who had done nothing and so you turn around and the left is is very adept at this they believe in bowling they believe in intimidation\nThey they don't think the truth matters what matters is power and I think people need to understand this election\nIs a choice about which America we're going to become it's much better choice suggest the president this was literally about are we going to reward people who are this destructive and who are willing to cripple their own country in order to get power or are we going to repudiate them\nAnd insist on people frankly are getting us results I mean if you think of this is an election of results versus resistance look at today's news about Canada and Mexico once again the president as a breakthrough once again something is being done to create more jobs in America\nCrazy people who are all when they're just not Sean Hannity leaves me on news radio ... it was just the future of our country or WBRC

all important midterm elections\nAre my friend and colleague from the Fox news channel is with us Tucker Carlson got a brand new book out by the way it's called ship a fool's now was selfish ruling class is bringing America to the brink of revolution\nUm are we really getting to the brink of a revolution and in this sense I mean look it's only happened three times in the last hundred years where a party wins the White House power in the White House and they don't have losses in the next\nMidterm election year the last time was right after nine eleven two thousand and one George Bush was

appreciate it you know cross fire was a defining show in the history of political debate in the country and and Pat Buchanan and breathing in all those original guys there was an amazing show it it's funny\nYeah so I can empathize with I'm Brett Kavanaugh was one of those middle school nerds that you know it was probably watching those shows them the doing of things that people want to block now but I'm\nIn any event I think there's a silver lining potentially till the FBI investigation a number one first over conservatives we have a moral office if we if we do detect that there's something wrong that he should be thrown overboard that's number one is that without being said but I don't that's not going to be found that being said\nIt's an opportunity for the Republicans to investigate further in turn the lands on the Democrats and some of their dirty tricks and use the power not that anybody should be abusing that power but the FBI should use the power to investigate everything that's going on here\nAnd potentially witness was being coaxed July people being put forward to sign false affidavits there's obviously a lot of that funny business going on I don't think Democrats

Fox News leader on the Senate says they will vote on the president's choice but to frame court at the end of the week\nAnyway well Deborah Katz is the one that well she didn't really believe Paula Jones and she did take Al Franken side\nAnd you know as you you just got to watch this\nIt there's no end to this now they are not going to stop until they get a no vote on Brecht capital that's just this this should not surprise anybody and Jeff Flake is now in Massachusetts today trying to run for president thinking he's going to which by the way the way to do it you don't like Trump go beat him\nIn thirty six days Democrats they'll make their case and they're going to ask you to give the house of representatives to Nancy Pelosi and the Senate Democrats to Chuck Schumer if that's\nWhat you want on election night in thirty six days and you want to turn on the TV and find out the results it'd be a stay home well you'll get the government you deserve we always do\nYou want all progress that we have now achieved and two years to stop that will happen too but all the senators saying well no no no we got to limit the scope it it's got to be very quick expeditious and just have the FBI do this that's not what they ...\nOf her intended they want this to drag on through the mid term elections\nIn the hope that Donald Trump doesn't get to make is pretty court nomination anyway joining us now is Carrie Severino she's the chief counsel policy director for the Judicial Crisis network a welcome back to the program as well as predicted the bar has shifted\nAnd now the Democrats won an extensive FBI investigation but from my standpoint as it relates to professor Ford there's really only for people that need to be interviewed and I would assume by now all four of them probably we're\n... I'm sure they were it was easy to find people because they already had been interviewed\nBy the Senate Judiciary committee look the the the goalpost are moving faster than the speed of light here it's it's very difficult to ... to believe that any of these people\nUm it it can take themselves seriously they said it's going to be four days a week and now they're going to hire an artificial that time you know they were saying the FBI the gold standard there impartial\nThere you know she works at that at every Democrat that it's now they're going up the Trump is evil puppet master controlling the FBI they're actually going to be this horrible partisan organization\nYou know it it it it is um it would be laughable if it wasn't a man's lifelong reputation here on the line\n[noise] take your mind that are doing two weeks ago as far as everybody else knew Brett Kavanaugh had an impeccable reputation that is now that's gone forever you know re Donovan famously one said after being investigated for a year and a half where do I go to get my good name back mhm well in this case\nI I don't think Brett Kavanaugh will ever get to the ... and many many ways I mean Clarence Thomas will forever be remembered because of the last minute accusations of Anita Hill\nYeah it it it's very discouraging although I have to say I I Do get some on that you know someone who clerked for Justice Thomas and knows the why he he you know there are certain ... ... people who are going to just simply use that as their excuse is counted but there was this couch them because they disagree with them anyway [noise]\nUm and he is someone who it does ... incredible amount of respect\nOn the bench judge Kavanaugh is a kind of person where even when he was on the DC circuit as a lower court judge\nThe Supreme Court said it saw him as someone to really take seriously you know more than a dozen times they spoke to fourteen different times they've found now they've indicated his opinion they had a huge amount of respect for him\nI don't think that's going to change I think um they are not going to be watching this with the same knee jerk or part is in response as I Hope that that that we're seeing some some of these people are ... but but it\nYou know the parents to draw to reputation now\nIf you read James ... New York times piece that he came out with the ... to me it's absolutely sunny and the things that he's saying because\nWhile the up back in the middle of it when we handled the Hillary Clinton email investigation while he was running an exoneration himself prior to the real investigation which didn't happen until three days before he publicly exonerated her um but then he goes on to trash the president at length\nAnd then he talks about FBI agents are experts which they are and interviewing people and quickly dispatching leads to their colleagues around the world to follow up with additional interviews\nAnd they will confront people with testimony and other accounts and you know yes the alleged incident occurred thirty six years ago but FBI agents no time has little to do with memory um which I found a little strange um and then you know for example everybody remembers if it rained on their wedding day\nUh I don't think that's a political in that particular sense maybe to somebody who is traumatized by could see that but for somebody that's not traumatized maybe not\nOnce they start interviewing every witness knows the consequences he says is one thing to have your lawyer submitted statement on your behalf it's very different thing to sit across from two FBI special agents and answer their relentless questions\nOf course the bureau won't have subpoena power only the ability to knock on doors and ask questions most people will speak to them that there is what he says refusal to do so is its own kind of statement\nNow I Want to just address that because my FBI friends my friends in the in the bureau special agents have all said to me never ever talk to the FBI unless you have a lawyer ever and I'm like why I'm somebody who loves the FBI\nI don't love the upper brass under Khomeini and the cave instructing page but the FBI is is the FBI people I Know the fault of the people and I said I've course I'd want to help him he goes no\nAnd then they say look what happened to General Flynn General Flynn is accused of lying to the FBI and the up here I didn't think he was willing to them and it's just it's dumb to ever talk to any law enforcement without a lawyer that's what all my law enforcement people friends say because it's a crime if you lie to the FBI let's say you said\nSomething in the Senate Judiciary investigation and it doesn't exactly match up you could be charged with a crime of lying to the FBI it's ridiculous\nAnd you know the the irony that says if you look at his company's coming MO right now is just to try to destroy Trump with everything he can and his mother another section in that play book but the irony is the exact same federal law provision\nThat says it's a crime to to lie the FBI is the one that says it's a crime to lie to the Senate as their with their investigators it's not just you know a similar penalty is exactly the same statutory violation so that's just not they've been kind of pretending there's that that I guess playing a little bit on people's images maybe from the movies\nOf what the FBI guys to say that this is somehow it's going to be a separate different thing what they're really doing here is there going down the same list to people the Senate Judiciary committee has already talks to\nThey're getting the same statement in some cases they might get exactly the same thing because the FBI can't as a as as comic that can't force them to talk to them\nEspecially if all you know as\nI don't remember that I wasn't there they they could be dealing with taking the same exact statement from the same lawyers for the same the same individuals that that's ... that that is all we can no ... just because of the nature of this old investigation so the FBI isn't going to find anything to hear that there there's my protection\nUnder that morality IRA and that they don't have any other thing\nThey've already moved on I guess the ... and and that's the one that came out in the New Yorker piece and you know ... that's the one we're even the New York times that said they attempted\nTo interview over the course of a week several dozen people they couldn't find a link a one to corroborate her story and then saying the mist Ramirez\nContacted former your classmates asking them if they were called the incident and told some of them that she could not be certain Mr cabin all was the one who exposed themselves which at that point tells me you know what are they investigating here\nIf she's asked for the other ... she's telling other people she doesn't\nKnow what do they investigated\nThe more shocking thing is even right and it's you know right before\nThis whole um ... most recent face exploded I think it was the morning on of the vote she actually her lawyer telling people\nShe's not even still share it with him she said why puppet he was in the room [laughter] I'm positive he adjusted his hands but everything that so but I but I Can't say for certain get hit it sounds so if even after talking to her lawyers for six days to kind of work up\nA her memory that she didn't have when she initially talked to the to the New York New York or because they also said she couldn't say for sure he was there when they initially talked to her I I I mean ... or even count as a credible allegation to the you know what go\nFor the FBI could talk to her um they'll they'll get their statement and I think if you look at the people if they're\nLiving in a whole new wins and they don't make any recommendations they're just going to give very handover the information\nThat's it the the three ... and and maybe we'll get those thrilled to we've been waiting for thrilled to forever as it relates to Bruce or and and Christopher Steele and and what was said

President Obama not being a citizen I thought that itself is disqualified\nUh view cannot do that and then talked about John McCain in a derogatory way and then talk to about a Mexicans in a
