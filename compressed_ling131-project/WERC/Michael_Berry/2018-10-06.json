to vote tomorrow on the confirmation of Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh who's after the Supreme Court appears to be assured after two more senators say they'll vote to confirm the judge\nIn government classes and law classes how to give a winning argument it just was ethic but\nWhat made it even more important when you watched it on TV and I'm sure we're going to hear the numbers are massive\nThere were two women prominently featured behind Susan Collins now so often we hear that the Republican Party is a party of a bunch of old white guys\nWere you at three women featured you couldn't see I'm\nJoni Ernst shoes off to the side but she was up there too\nBut you had Susan Collins front and center in a very professional look I think she got a new hair cut too I'm sure she did you know oh it's all about image it's all about optics Susan Susan Collins up there and on one side Shelley Moore Capito of West Virginia Republican senator\nTo the other side Cindy Hyde Smith a senator from Mississippi right behind her so now you have this moment where we as conservatives have had the tar beaten out of us for the last three weeks\nBeing accused of being just the worst people in the world the party that does not understand women\nAnd you have a woman delivering the knockout punch a woman who is known to be pro choice\nSo now you have someone that other women especially boy that was ... that argument that judge Kavanaugh is going to a destroy roe v Wade you have a pro choice women standing in front of\nThe world talking about how Kavanaugh can't do it that in fact that\nThe people that the um the Democrats who are worried about tearing apart ruby ... years ago not only did they not do it they wrote the argument against overturning roe v wait\nSo you have brilliantly staged brilliantly written\nDelivered for an audience that would then turn it into prime time response so after all of the theater this week after all the surface like atmosphere for the last eight days in Washington DC you ended with an epic finish\nSo bravo to you GOP bravo to you\nAnd to the what was it five hundred plus protestors arrested today I think I'm not sure\nI think Spartacus got arrested today\nI'm not sure I think that that would make sense for him because that would be a good campaign commercial for a twenty twenty presidents he hopes for ah\nFor Cory Booker or should we call them sugar as I talked to\nGuys last night I found the or your books from some of the\nAngry Democrats on the Judiciary Committee started going through their senior year books to say gee what was the new year book\nCory Booker had his nickname sugar\nAnd I don't know about you but I Lived in the New York New Jersey metro area where Cory Booker lived and went to school in those years in the late eighties and\nA book or we called a cocaine was referred to as sugar so why were you sugar senator\nIs there something you need to tell us and also the guy who said he had um\nGroped a young woman at the age of Fifteen in the article he wrote called a stealing second or something like that\nA book or a also had his senior quote was let's go all the way so Cory Booker has some ... to do but he may be got arrested today it's not really an arrest as we saw with Amy Schumer yesterday\nIt's kind of like being scurried off to get your picture taken and then somebody pays fifty bucks you get a ticket and you go home or you go back to the protests\nBut there is so much to get to today so much I'm\nJust so happy about this and we will dig into it but I Want to remember what sparked all of this and it was Donald Trump nominating Mr Kavanaugh judge Kavanaugh\nAnd on the day when that happened Chris Matthews the elder statesmen and MSNBC you have to wonder how much longer he's going to continue\nIn his role a Chris Matthews was on the air talking about revenge and I tell you all of this all of this anger towards anything Donald Trump does towards any nominee he brings forward\nAll of this resistance an obstruction which started the day after Trump was elected\nIt's a dangerous thing for the Democrats it said\nWhen you go out and develop all of your missions in life based on revenge they tell you to dig two\nGraves because you're going to be joining whoever you think you're going to take down remember this from June twenty eighth this year Chris Matthews on MSNBC following the announcement of the Supreme Court pick from President Trump\nSays this time for vengeance for what happened two years ago and if they don't read the vengeance now with four and a half weeks for that wants to go before the election they will not look very strong to their face and I think there'll be under attack\nYeah yeah that was a good plan wasn't it wasn't a Chris Matthews if you don't if you don't go after vengeance and he's talking about Merrick Garland he was talking about Hillary's loss\nOr I'll I'll tell you to talk about backfiring because the way the shrill arguments came out without facts which was a hundred and eighty degrees from what Susan Collins delivered today they sounded like\nA bunch of people especially when you hear the chanting the chanting the nonstop shrill chanting it just great and great and great\nNow I I'd like to say this is a a a good sign for the midterms but a month in political terms is an eternity\nIt's an absolute eternity so I have sort of a plan that I think the GOP should lay out in advance of the midterms that will keep the interests of those of us who are conservatives who wants to try and save\nThe house although it's a really tough tough event to try and pull off\nTo save the house when the president or out of the other part when you know what happens when you get the house and the Senate and the presidency and the very next election the midterms\nHistory tells us it always balances out and the voters will get power back to the other party\nSo for the GOP to retain the house would be a little bit of a miracle but I have a plan and that will share with you I also want to hear your thoughts on today if you have any thoughts on that it's friday let's have some fun\nAnd I have a really ridiculous questions for you I Know the other day I asked\nA question about what's the what was the scariest movie of all time and a lot of you came up with great answers well today I reached maximum anger\nAt the worst jangle ever\nAnd I know you've heard jingles it doesn't have to be a current jingle it can be an old commercial jingle one is the worst jingle ever you know it's an ear worm it sticks in your ear I'm going to give you money you want to call in with yours and you can sing it or you can ... you can say however you want\nBut when I hear one age seven seven times for kids I Won a stab my radio\nOne age seven having cards for kids and then they say donate your car today they don't say donate your car today they say donate your and what the hell is done neck\nAll right that's my crazy

date to Susan Collins or yesterday if you've been listening to\nPresident Trump in his speeches at these campaign rallies he is brought up specifically\nHow he wants to make sure the pre existing
