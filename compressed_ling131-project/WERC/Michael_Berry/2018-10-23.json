I should add with she did with pardon me a\nSuited with an FBI agents da ... ... ah people from all these different federal immigrations and Customs Enforcement all these different agencies roasted together because stopped them come on my radar would also be on their radar and we worked together as a fusion center that's what I was doing that's my ... and of course also it\nOn the federal counterterrorism side in particular\nBut we understand that there's a lot of crossover law enforcement\nWill somebody who is a drug dealer who's also illegal alien is\nCausing problems for the law and multiple ways and one law enforcement agencies should support the other law enforcement agencies legitimate law enforcement function would give them is telling you without telling you is that he prefers lawlessness because it is politically advantageous\nYou won't say it but just address was right to push him on this one and this then goes to a a refrain that you heard a lot from a lap and I really hope\nBecomes a huge problem for them in the in the midterms which is remember when\nI used that was the thing that they were\nChanting all summer not reform ice not\nChange the law or change the policy at the border so that we could have a more efficient way to transfer people so that they are with their children or they're at least close to their children know they'll be reunited ... it wasn't have serious adult conversation about this it was about lash ice\nIf they get through our southern border we're going to protect our border and people on the other side of the border of Mexico would precipitate some type of confrontation people get hurt if we had a wall we wouldn't have that problem\nGetting a little scary out there we don't want that we don't want anybody getting hurt here\nAnyway you know by the way somebody wrote me do you think four thousand Hondurans suddenly just decided to march thirty five hundred miles towards our border right before the midterms with

adamantly against illegal immigration even half a staff employee illegal immigrants\nCome up to west Chester showed is that they can Nassau County stand in the street foreigners in Brooklyn or the Bronx [laughter] you're going to see people waiting to get picked up to go do yard work in construction work and domestic for you know ... this is not a problem that the people who are coming\nInto the country are solely responsible for the winter is coming if we in for them to work my\nWill keep families together\nAnd it will include a path\nTo citizenship a number of immigrants added to the labor force every year as a magnitude not seen in this country for over a century if this huge influx of mostly most co workers provide some benefits the economy as a whole it also friends to the press further the wages of blue collar Americans and puts a strain on an already overburdened safety net immigrants\nAre the principal or even wages haven't gone up there are those immigrants' rights community who have argued passionately that we should simply provide those were illegal we would legal status\nAt least ignore the laws on the books and put an end to deportation until we have better loss but I Believe such an indiscriminate approach would be both on wives and unfair\nIt was suggested I was thinking about coming here legally that there will be no repercussions for such a decision and this could lead to a surge in more\nIllegal immigration right amazing how they sound just like Donald Trump joining us now former\nSpeaker of the house author of the best seller Trump's America the truth about our nation's great comeback us Newt Gingrich is with us or how are you\nI'm I'm doing great and I'm an Omaha today for the Republican Party of Nebraska and I you know I'm very very optimistic about how this election is shaping up\nWell I'm Glad you there do me a favor I think uh one of the biggest mistakes I made in my life in terms of supporting somebody disappoints\nIs a guy by the name of Ben Sasse Ben Sasse had his way Hillary Clinton\nWould have been of the president the last two years she would have made the two Supreme Court appointments none of the bureau bureaucracy would have been removed we'd have open borders we would have Obamacare on steroids\nUm but he was never Trump or now is blasting made a new book trying to get me to talk about it so that he can sell copies when he hasn't passed a single piece of legislation with his own name on it alone that he sponsored\nSorry it's personal point\n[laughter] get that's personal but you know the fact is\nThe never Trump or his are a fossilized group [noise] that are less and less relevant I mean it was every passing month the president's support from the Republican Party goes up uh I Know this this extraordinary rally in Texas um [noise]\nI don't know of anybody in American history who attracted as many people to as many different rallies as Trump has this year\nI was just an astonishing achievement and I think it bodes very well for the impact that he's going to have on both this year's election and\nOn two on two thousand twenty\nWell let's talk about what do we do about this caravan [noise] you know they're ... by foot they make it in what three weeks three and a half weeks\nBut one thing that I think we both agree on is that I don't want a crisis precipitated at the border but goes Mexico is allowing this caravan to march through their entire country\nAnd we have no choice but to guard our borders because it's our sovereign land I wear a nation of laws and I don't ... and in the process the\nPeople on that side of the border that are not respecting our laws could they could precipitate a crisis where innocent people get hurt and I don't want that to happen right is that better\nSo so now you understand psychologically\nWhat Abraham Lincoln and went through between Eighteen fifty eight\nAnd a the spring of Eighteen sixty one and he says again and again you know we do not have to fight this ... this was you know you aren't going to choose I said I'm not going to choose on I'm going to defend the constitution and do my duty but I'm not choosing to fight\nBut if you give me no choice I won't have no choice and I think this this is I think\nOne of the great test that President Trump is going to face because\nHe he when he talks about a person the other day he doesn't want anyone hurt he feels this very deeply\nOn the other hand he has sworn to protect the United states he has sworn to uphold our borders and and I tweeted this morning says it hit me this morning that if the president is serious\nThe Mexicans only have two choices they can deal with the caravans now in southern Mexico for when the president blocks from entering the United states\nThey can deal with them and northern Mexico and if you ask yourself with this simple question if they literally can't get across the border they're stuck in northern Mexico\nWell and I think our our position ought to be that Mexico to decide whether they want us to deal with them now he wants to deal with them when they returned back to the border but under no circumstances\nShould we accept them in Sydney powers done some brilliant legal work on the fact that the president has the authority\nTo block aliens that he deemed should the national threatened always got to say it doesn't have to defend his decision to say I deemed to be unacceptable for national security reasons and they're blocked\nIn all likelihood I don't think it's going to get to that point my guess is at some point because of the economic connection that Mexico needs with the United states that they're gonna have to step in here somehow turn this caravan around how they do that I don't know\nBut the reality is I Know by the way and I do have compassion I understand people in\nIn Central America El Salvador Guatemala Nicaragua or that they want a better life but this is not the way to do we have a process by which we have an immigration system and we're a sovereign country you don't get to ... you know create a crowd and rush the border\nAnd my fear is if they get to the border that we could be a potential outcome that's not going to be good for the people if we had the wall Mr Speaker built this wouldn't be an option for them if we had the wall we will\nBut I have that would be no risk of anybody getting hurt on either side\nThere's just so totally left wing and unacceptable and so I keep looking around at these patterns and I think what you're seeing is a remarkable moment where the ... for example\nWhen we were talking about ten days ago you and I were that this was a race between jobs and march well if you look at the pictures coming out of Mexico right now you couldn't get a better picture of a mob and will you watch the Democrats\nTo ask you can you can you stay for another five minutes I Want to really get into this more deeply out of there because it's the two important wherever fourteen days out of an election two weeks from today you'll be voting and two weeks from tonight you'll be turning on your television sets and you're either going to have\nGreat news all the way around maybe it's going to be split decision or you're gonna have horrible news\nAnd you get to decide ultimately what that news is going to be this is where your vote actually matters this election counts and you've been shocked the world again and I'm confident that that can happen that can be the outcome I quit break more Newt Gingrich on the other side and later pastor Darrell Scott David Limbaugh much more\n\nJang ... Middle Eastern terrorists in that migrants caravan President Trump saying\nThat could very well may and if you look at a I have very good information that's very good information\nDemocrats in ... he has no proof and accused him of fear mongering for political benefit I head of the terms vice president Mike Pence noting\nJust inconceivable that there was not individuals or from the middle east as part of this rowing\n... the number of caravan migrants now about seven thousand heading north from southern Mexico President Trump says the U.S military will make sure that none of the migrants make it across the U.S border Asian and European markets dragging our market's down\n[noise] without ending the day down nearly one twenty six west down five hundred [noise]\nGoing\n\nOld inspires illusions forum merry go this is Sean Hannity show\nI twenty five 'til the top of the hour we've asked to Newt Gingrich to stay with us I Want you to really go into a longer explanation us said Kavanaugh caravan are going to be the defining issues in the next fourteen days people will vote fourteen days from now I Would add to that a caravan Kavanaugh\nThe mobs we now you saw it happen to Kevin McCarthy is house it through a Boulder through the window I'm at so they did to Henry Kissinger you saw what they did the Mitch McConnell this is just in the last two days and it's happening everywhere and I would also add that if Americans like\nWhat has happened over the last two years in spite of Obama laughing leak claiming credit for it yesterday if they want the successor to continue the economic growth to continue the prosperity to continue I think this becomes a classical choice election but I I think all of those things hopefully will factor into people's decisions\n[noise] well I think that's right um and I think that that in a sense\nOf the whole question of what kind of country do you want to become clear on the left that you now have\nSort of a brown shirt Nineteen thirties to a total of cherry an attitude a that they are willing to use force\nOr they openly said they're willing to use force it with a former attorney general saying when Republicans go low kick them all you have various democratic leaders saying it's OK to harass people ah and drive them out of public life\nOr you know and remember that Maxine Waters is not a trivial person she would share\nFor their banking and financial services committee if they get control the house show of the significant people are saying these things\nAre building on on a sense of\nA rage in a sense of the illegitimacy of of the modern of American government which left passionately believes uh I I think that you're right that that's a factor the reason I I pick Kavanaugh caravans as the as the central moment\nIs these aren't historical events them into Kavanaugh fight wasn't just politics it was historic we're we're going to get\nA solid conservative on the Supreme Court or what are we going to be mayor and character assassinated and lied and manipulated and browbeat and into backing down but that was that was a historic moment do have an effect with X forty or fifty years\nA similarly this caravan whether it's seven thousand people or the Mexican newspapers rightness or you have to fourteen thousand\nIf this Carol there and can get into the United states how big is the next caravan and the ... hour then after that I mean it's not like it's a one time event here the entire world is watching to see whether or not we have the guts to protect the United states of America from an invasion\nOr and if we don't trust me it will be a lot of people willing to come\nWell I think I Know exactly where they're going to head to straight to California the sanctuary stayed and get the free health care the Gavin Newsom as is offering to provide for them that's where I'd go\nWell and remember because we we we shouldn't have to have a showdown but this there's no such thing as a ...\nTo ... you have to decide to your state can in fact you impose on the federal government activities which it cannot possibly imposed and at some point we're gonna have a big collusion with ... century stage beers or a fundamental violation of the constitution\nWell I think that this is I I Do agree with you um I have a pretty good feeling about the Senate I think that\nThe way events in our in the debate has moved I think there's been a dramatic shift for certainly the cabinet case you know it's amazing to watch how the you know the other news channels are covering the president's speech last night\nOr the ... they're actually fake news CNN actually says president wise tries to gin up division\nAnd they've never covered what Maxine Waters has been saying\nThey've never covered a single thing of her saying you know create a crowd followed them in a grocery stores followed them in the department stores gas stations and you tell them they're not want to hear anywhere anymore or what's happened to Pam Bondi or secretary Nielsen of Sarah Sanders a Ted Cruz and now Mitch McConnell and Henry Kissinger and\nYou know obviously\nThis is the the mob mentality is coming from the left nor do I see Mr Speaker\nNor can I say or\nOr elaborate on any one\nIssue or program they're offering\nThat will help the lives of the American people not one that's not what

I Would I ran into\nUm what's his name Blumenthal the Connecticut Senator\nAnd when I was in Washington ... during the Capitol hearing said he was a total jackass during those hearings is coming out of where I was going in and I said center Sean Hannity how are you we had a very cordial conversation\nIf he was sitting at a table I Would never I might go over and say you know send a drink over you know I might just because I disagreed vehemently with um I don't feel I have a right to tell them you don't belong here\nHe has a different point of view than I Do what we get to settle out at the ballot box I\nHave a fear and when I say it was ... I'm getting myself that one of these people might walk up to me in a restaurant my fear is that my response would go viral\n[laughter]\nThat's my fear I mean I'm asked myself how would I have other ways than other man of the ... that's why we have a fear I'm like yeah I'm going to stand up for that only me the old me will come out and then if I'm with my wife told me would come out and then it will go by what my response would go by but I think they pick and choose the targets that is exactly\nWell maybe but you know I listened I train five days a week an hour and a half maybe the martial arts and they know this well it's a it's it's not going to stop crazy people but I got to tell you something I Will walk away I Will do everything I can do to walk away\nI Do part of martial arts all the arch that I practice we ... we bow out if we're doing weapons training we show great respect it we're doing grappling or or outright full contact we do it with respect we respect the tap we were ... you know we're not there to kill each other we're there to make each other better\nI'm so there's a certain discipline David associated with that and but most people age don't know how to defend themselves and be they're\nGoing to react like past caught then they're going to get pissed and somebody's going to get hurt\nI couldn't agree more and it is a danger for people in the public square and especially people who hold themselves out as Christians whether you're a pastor or you have a Christian themed blackout you really gotta be careful at it but we do anyway we need to be civil and and when some people on Twitter ... and our other interaction\nBut I don't think that means we don't fight I don't think I mean we don't uh ... communicate our ideas as passionately and as intensely as the left that it just means we don't have to get his dirtiest\nYeah well I look I don't know I I we just had Newt Gingrich on and pastor what he was saying is between Cavanaugh I mean all these American\nValues that have have served us so well due process presumption of innocence and then you see that there was no core operation any of these charges\nIf the Democrats really cared about the issue they'd be going after Keith Ellison right now demanding an FBI investigation of and Cory Booker will be having an FBI investigation and Claire McCaskill's husband would be having an FBI investigation and Bill Clinton would be in jail for the rest of his life\nBut they're obviously playing politics with with very important issue so the hypocrisy is there but between Kavanaugh the mobs\nThe caravan that's happening and the fact that we've had on parallel economic success fourteen state record for states record low unemployment record low unemployment for African Americans Hispanic Americans Asian Americans women in the workplace are vets record low unemployment youth unemployment lowest ever\nI I'm hoping that people factor that in in fourteen days when they vote or if they vote early\nI think the man on the street will factor it in I don't think the people on the street are stupid Democrat or Republican then that stupid the party leaders are stupid you know but the man on the street they're able to see this process that they know that Kavanaugh was that whole cabinet issue was a sham they see the hypocrisy of the left on full display\nThey know that this a caravan is not simply a random occurrence that you know a a all these unconnected people just randomly deciding to all walk thousands of miles to America to look for better jobs they can see the orchestrated now some people are going to vote the party regarding this but the others say listen I'm tired of this\nBecause all of the nonsense seems to be coming from the left\nAnd the very behavior that they pretended to criticize they've put it on steroids and I am the lady so you know they said well we don't like the some of the ... with the president during the campaign but you have to say that I have it to another level and you're you're ...\nYou're you're out of Cleveland, Ohio okay you're a an African American conservative you took a lot of heat for supporting Donald Trump out at the results are in\nAnd we're seeing all of these jobs being created for the people look at a picture over there that's the forgotten men and women of America that's what that's what twenty six team was about for me the Thirteen million more Americans on food stamps the eight million more in poverty after Obama's eight years\nNow we've got four million jobs created eight million fewer people in poverty and on food stamps we have four hundred thousand manufacturing jobs that Obama sober never coming back\nWhile the president get credit when you break down votes demographically with the black community because they're never doing better they've never done better\nThank God he's going to get the votes you know a ... in the Bible nicotine was came to Jesus button night and there are a lot of ... diem is and they say listen we see what Trump is doing we embrace with Trump is doing is not what they told us that waking up and you know if they say is thirty six percent approval rating\nAt twenty or thirty percent to the fifty six six six percent believe me his messages recurring tell him as a message that lives within the black community I come\nFrom a traditional democratic family years voted party forever blacked it in my family and our sphere are now so ... to it that they're either going to not vote at all which is which is really go for what we're doing with the conservative movement or they're going to vote\nWith us because they're starting to see that this is a charade here you know the media constantly bright and President Trump for no reason they've been doing it all day today CNN blacks used to go and get their news from CNN the politics from CNN and MSNBC they're starting to see\nWe got to get in the trenches we got to figure this out so we're getting a bunch of calls from people saying hey\nWhat's going on houses going how's Trump doing this how can we help on this particular side he's going to get on the ... the black vote than any other Republican president I'll throw this today\nBut if if we all believe in in God the father Jesus is okay and I think all of us here do if we believe that we all believe one thing and that predicated on that he created every man woman and child on this earth we agree with that right okay yeah so in that sense where\nBrothers and sisters we're all Americans to right and if we really believe that in every human soul God put some talent some ability\nAnd our goal is to to create an environment where that that talent that natural talent flourishes ... the word or\nEducation from the Latin isn't do could aid to bring forth from within\nThat tells you the God put it there our job is to put enough sunlight and water on something make it grow and help people and that's what I see Trump's doing and it and it's now hitting the forgotten men and women David that's a great story of the two years of Trump so far\n[noise] yeah yes and and we want to get back what Trump is trying to do when he says I Want to make America great again he means to restore its founding principles is Judeo Christian founding principles which is based on the idea that we're all created in God's image and that's why we had an alien Abul lights it flows from that but I think the leftist\nAuthoritarian by nature their economic coercion can lead to political coercion and that's where they are and I I think the left as losing it because they don't have any ideas that worked and I don't have any proposal so they're frustrated and they resort\nTo identity politics and changing the rules and this identity politics dividing people on the basis of race and gender is\nEvery four to four years at the same thing rich versus poor versus young black versus white or run up against a racist sexist massage in this Tacoma ... Lama foe but they weren't dirty air water and they want to kill children and grandma throw over the cliff\nBut also they also hold eyes up to ... yeah and then one of the polar ice cap to melt [laughter]\nSean they want to change the rules they want to abolish the electoral college they want to pack the Supreme Court they abuse executive authority they want to abuse the impeachment process just impeached trunk and count area even though there is\nWith Rachel you can lock your interest rate while you shop for a new home so afraid to go up you don't have to worry and here's the best part if rates go down you get the lower rate with ratio we really have you covered\nYou're more reasons why you want to work with America's largest mortgage lender\nFor eight years in a row now JD power

have a last name right ... ... ... okay and David lumber or David will give you thirty seconds by the last word thoughts today what's gonna happen and fourteen days\nI I actually think that we stay off the um the so called blue what blue way that we might even retain the house and\nWe're certainly going to pick up seats in the Senate We're gonna come close we don't win the house the need to keep it and I think as the pastor Scott ... said\nWell there's so many a minority voters out there who are going to come around the Trump expand that opportunity he's not a racist he's opening opportunities for all people including black\nAnd I'm telling ya liberals can't stand this Kanye and the other people who were defecting from their plantation can't stand it this is exciting stuff it's uplifting we need to go on a positive message nationalize that these last two\nWeek how how great would it be weaker transform cities like Detroit Cleveland elsewhere where every person that lives in this country has a nice beautiful house in a safe neighborhood a nice car truck that they can afford to vacations take their kids to do is anyone there seven and be miserable uh but\nBut they want to take their kids go out to eat and not have to worry about a pastor I mean we all want the same things but it's it's this is universal listed humanity\nYes it is I really believe these next fourteen days is going to be critical for messaging as long as I mentioned in stays consistent also I think that you know they're the script in the Bible says this is no weapon formed against these shell prosper\nI Believe some of these weapons that they formed against this nation I'm not going to be able to possibly even with this caravan I think is back firing I think that a lot of Americans share the same concerns about those caravans regardless of political party this year the same concerns that the Republican Party or share\nRight good to see you both curry and we've got to let you go

call it the military wants to care of ants close our thoughts is Jessica Rosenthal Matthew Ginsberg Jake all at the Honduran solidarity network says the current time during president who's last election was disputed came up with a story to the U.S couldn't blame him for the caravan\nAnd so they're going to say oh well it's Venezuela to get the Trump Administration to focus on somebody that
