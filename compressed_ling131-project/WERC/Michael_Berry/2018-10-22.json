I think we're going to be fine ah but yeah we're ... we fit in South Carolina last friday so we're all over the place\nYou only get interesting to watch the states like California Southern California it's six important house seats that could be the the ... the balance of power in the house\nMinnesota has important races Ohio does Michigan does Pennsylvania and New York and New Jersey do\nYeah no I think in the end of Sean when you look at the radical positions the leftist take I Would argue the most extreme positions in American history where they you know they applied captured equate this respects the flag they Iran\nGovernor Cuomo when he said America was never that great and they they embrace it Maxine Waters when she got harassed anybody support our president\nContracts that vision for where they want to take the country\nAs we've talked about before with what the president has accomplished at Twenty one month with his leadership in this country taxes regulations down economy growing it for ... percent lowest unemployment forty years course each and cabin on the court\nOut of the Iran deal embassy in Jerusalem it on and on we could go so those are the competing visions those are the kind that's the contrast\nI think when American step back and look they're going to pick Republicans or we're going to keep the majority in the house\nBetween no due process for Kavanaugh no presumption of innocence for Kavanaugh these core values that have served as well as a country and then you've got this lawless caravan and I I don't hear a single Democrat saying we've got to stop\nWhat is it looks like an invasion fourteen thousand people just want to run across the border maybe more\nAnd if that happens what's gonna happen after that it's like a party that is basically given up on the rule of law unconstitutional then the values that have served do so well over these many years\nExactly right or the most extreme positions ... got closer with his comic you got\nFrom Secretary Clinton said oh yeah we'll get civil again once we have power that's not really supposed to be this rate nation and like you said before it's sort of tough to avoid the immigration issue when you've got this caravan merging north thousands and thousands of people um I think the president's right when he's talking about you're not going to get your foreign aid if this if this has gotta get get you\nAnd talking about putting hooks on the border putting troops on the border putting National Guard in order to make sure\nThat we saw what happened last friday in Mexico at their border and then the fence was busted and people come running across now it's almost like we're headed towards a major\nHuman confrontation here people that don't affect our laws and sovereignty and a president that are saying you must respect our laws and sovereignty um no I I think Democrats are like in the back of their heads hoping this happens so oh maybe something bad will happen and Trump will look bad and we can blame him as someone gets hurt\nYeah you you never know I Hope I Hope not I'm not yeah\nSame here but I Will tell you want on Saturday I had a a person from Honduras\nWho came here legally and when that lady comment is that a Republican event Saturday morning in our home town in Urbana, Ohio she came up to me and she said I'm sick of this kind of stuff she gives it the right way she came here legally came here because she loves this great nation wanted to start her goals and dreams in this great nation\nThat's the part that upsets me the most when you see this kind of thing happened and the and the possible political implications\nAnd and motivations behind these things\nThat's what bothers me the most and I think it is\nCommon sense Americans say look this is not how it's supposed to work you want to come to this country and you're a legitimate asylum seeker that's one thing but when eighty percent of the people who show up at our border claiming assign um aren't legitimate or asylum seekers that's a problem and we know that's probably what this this group is is mostly about as well\nWe also have this issue of the mob that no Democrat seems willing to come from either I mean you know we saw what we watched Ted Cruz and his wife get out of a restaurant by an angry left wing mob we watch that happen a Pam Bondi at a movie theater we watch that happen a secretary Nielsen we watch that happen to Sarah Sanders\nA we saw Mitch McConnell go through those are the airport and then this weekend that happened a again a let me play a little of the McConnell confrontation and then you have the liberal media you know literally and then we have now Henry Kissinger was shouted down and listen to some of those [noise]\n\n\nI'm a proud of being [noise]\n[laughter] [noise]\n\n[noise]\nI got a Ninety two year old man who served his country it's a you know it's unbelievable you know what the names of what's her name Maxine Waters you you clear the crowd you confront them you do you tell them they're not wanted anywhere anymore Mitch McConnell Leo country\nYou know then we have you know Eric Holder kick them Hillary you can't be civil with somebody you disagree with\nNo this is this is as wrong as it gets this is not how not on a decent people or so\nThe ... and and it is you know with the part that bothers me the most Sean is Dennis Kucinich is a good friend of mine and he is as far left as I Am now is actually a lovely guy\nHe's a wonderful guy he's a friend and he would never act that he will debate the idea that he will show up and have a robust debate like we're supposed to win this great nation but he would never left\nSo um coupled with the president's success ... is is there a base out there that we're not hearing from the polls are picking up yet\nI think that's very likely I mean we haven't necessarily seen it we haven't really polled but when you anecdotally around talking with folks you sense that you feel that that people are in fact moving a in that direction and and were outraged by what they all happen to a judge capital\nAnd what are the your house members it Freedom Caucus guys how's Dave Brat doing it now we're going to actually talk to Scott Perry at the last half hour how are those guys doing it 'cause they're and they're doing for instance\nThey are they're doing great but I'll I'll give you the best examples rod blow up he was down like ten twelve point three weeks ago he's now got within one point that's what's happening because our guys are working hard good candidates working hard on the American people are waking up to the ridiculous positions that left let's take this country to\nRide Jim Jordan thanks for being with us when we come back we'll we'll check in with

balance of power in Congress or in sixteen days this is it Fifteen days till election day\nOr a newly redistricted congressional district can in the state of Pennsylvania and on November the sixty three term incumbent isn't a fight to keep that dream alive is going head to head with a liberal Democrat\nGeorge Scott for this newly drawn district in\nPerry won the last three terms in Congress by no fewer than twenty five percentage points but now because of uh Pennsylvania Supreme Court decision\nThey decided read do you draw that state's congressional map as a district that has a chance of flipping and as Perry has said he knows the people the fourth district I grew up with them so when the district was we redrawing it was heartbreaking\nAnd that's the hand you're dealt and ah anyway a congressman Scott Perry is with us She's also a Freedom Caucus member and I wanted to give you an opportunity they really tried to screw you in this redistricting didn't they\nYeah Shaun thanks for having me on they have out this read the book they want it to flip as many seats in Pennsylvania as they can\nAnd they drew the district to make it or to make it much more difficult for somebody especially somebody like me who is the Freedom Caucus member a to win and not just the you know you've kind of highlighted some of the things er during the course the big thing they're doing which are not just doing it to me you know and talking to all your friends whether Jim mark Louis Gates' whoever\nUh it's the same playbook which is which actually is kind of absurd when you think about it and that's this this whole thing about pre existing conditions and healthcare a show on you know they're the ones that screwed up our healthcare system and and passed Obamacare and uh you know you know a\nTwenty five you're going to say twenty five hundred dollars keep your plan to keep your doctor all that stuff all lives right\nAnd now they're blaming us for medicine it up um we try to repeal it of course you know what happened with John McCain put what thumbs down but you know Sean when we fought the original Freedom Caucus in particular fought that original bill\nOut of a you know the ... the replacement bill for Obamacare because if you remember we're going to vote to repeal Obamacare and immediately repay replace it the original bill that deal with preexisting conditions among other things\nThe Mark Meadows Jim Jordan the whole crew you know wouldn't talk to the president talked or leadership it said you know we can't support this you can't have insurance companies denying people with preexisting conditions that we we got that right\nIn the bill that we finally passed yet they're running this play book all across the country because they don't have anything else that we broke healthcare\nWell let's all hardly they tried to fix it well\nMillions of Americans now they lost their doctors their plans and they're paying a lot more that's number one number two you know the big lie is will Republicans didn't support preexisting conditions of course they did that was part of the plan I Know because you're right because I remember that very specific battle\nAnd in the insistence by people like Mark meadows yourself and others to get that in the bill that was passed ultimately in the house on top of that the individual mandate is gone and I mean it all all Obamacare

create\nUnequal outcome so you know bad society uh even though it sounds great on paper all of your ideas when they make contact with reality or disaster for a country a person a citizen then you've

I Would imagine that your polls are going to go higher\nShon well it it's unbelievable every single day a new part of her radical passed in her mocking Arizona and their extremism on so many issues as being on earth\nBut the Arizona local media is protecting her a and making excuses for her and so the only way that filters down his shows like yours are us turning it into a TV ad\nAh the fact that she's still hanging in there is really ridiculous so out of step with Arizona values and American values you rattled off a number of uh a number of things that would have a Senate candidate B. disqualifying in the past\nBut here we are way down to the wire over eighty percent or around eighty percent of people will vote early over half have already voted and so we need to make sure that the messages out about her radical out of step past\nThis qualifying statement you know compared to me serving twenty six years in the military and defending our freedoms that are way of life\nWhat did you do in the military I Know well you served abroad post nine eleven correct\nYes sir I was a a ten pilot I was just fortunate to be the first woman in us history to fly a fighter jet and combat uh and then the first to command a fighter squadron in combat I've had six deployments to the middle east and Afghanistan\nA hundred and twenty five combat hours in a tan ward hog again saving American lives on the ground and defending our way of life it was absolutely honor of my life to be able to serve\nYou know when you hear curse than send them to say oh it's okay at that point what I Believe it was two thousand and three that oh it's okay if Americans want to join our enemies the ... nearly died\nA son when I when we heard this I I couldn't believe it I mean I was deployed on nine eleven or the Taliban harbored al ... who came and killed three thousand Americans sense then with them and their affiliates they've killed thousands of American troops\nTo include you know truthful I was deployed over there I've told this story before but we would at Bagram Air force base when I was a commander\nOr we would you know we would get out there as soon as we heard a firefight was going on and we'd be overhead to protect them in our a ten but often times uh you know the ... the the firefights happened before we could get there and Americans lost their lives and as we would\nWe would line up on a taxi way as the cat the flag draped casket would come through and there's ... there's a silence there and everyone is leading giving our final salute to these American heroes\nWho perished over there fighting the Taliban and their affiliates\nAnd for her to be able to say that she's OK with an American going to join the Taliban to fight against us I mean that in and of itself should have had her suspend her campaign and Arizona and should make a different choice to not vote for years and said this is really personal for\nBoarded our belt thirty eight billion dollars including building a wall yes or\nWould you vote to repeal Obamacare the both of John McCain decided to change his mind on\nWell San I did vote to repeal and replace Obamacare on that House bill I'm getting my asking for it right now because it's being misconstrued either Democrats they're trying to uh you know invoke fear in people in that family\nMember wait a minute I Know Arizona didn't how many Arizona's lost their plans lost their doctors and are paying infinitely higher rates because of Obamacare\nYes Obamacare failed in Arizona there's only one choice and fourteen if ... there's no choice people lost their health care coverage we had people right now a tree that the conditions you can't get access to health insurance because of the failures of Obamacare\nSo I work hard to make sure that we were moving away from that and and towards something that gives them our choice for people\nMore flexibility at the state level more free market get the federal government you know to not be doing that one size fits all top down penalty taxes and mandate it's failed and so we you know I voted yes again I've got millions of dollars attacking me right now misconstrue ing that vote\nI I voted to protect people with preexisting conditions oh that's good intentions but their policies are wrong we need more conservative policies to bring the cost down and provide more options for people to get access to insurance\nOr Martha McSally a really a rock star a hero who served their country and an important race for the Republicans as they not only want to maintain control of the U.S Senate but also to build their majority in the Senate that'll make votes for Supreme Court justice was a lot easier\nOn up against a very radical leftists in the name of Chris and send them a thank you so much a Martha McSally for all you've done for your country and and the positions you take and ah you should win this race\nFar and wide when the people of Arizona fully understand the record the background and the radical views of Christ and send them a thank you for being with us Martha McSally\nThanks hon appreciate you signing a flashlight on that in an advocacy and if people want to how they can go to Nick Sally for Senate dot com you need your support and help and donations and weaken my next thing thanks so much\nThank you rod as in Florida crushed view on the Sean Hannity show how are you ride\nA yes or legislation on the show dedicated listener concerns my concern is the Supreme Court list that the person that\nThat actually a presented when he was on trial is okay and the reason why my concern is is is because you're close is already a put the news out there that they do smear campaigns\nAnd they've done a ... they want us to have the transparency and so we've given transparent like open up our playbook so they can actually investigate every person on that list so whoever President Trump actually nominates they've already got a team investigating that specific person to attack on a smear campaign well\nThat's all you get from the Democrats that their only play book that's all they have that one on one one or two one oh three one oh five one oh nine that this is it you know and you know it's interesting to watch the Democrats now are trying to urge caution on blue wave and temper expectations they're scared to death\nBecause after all the mobs and after what they did with Kavanaugh and what we see with the caravan and we see the ... now that that it is getting into focus what eight years of Obama was like versus two years of Trump\nThe American
