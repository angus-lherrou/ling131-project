teaching in schools now in some of these departments in women's studies women and gender studies we called the bags\nAt Amherst College where I went I took a wax\nClass that was interesting uh it was actually Islamic constructions of gender so I took a class on a women's in gender studies class on Islam who wants to guess how critical\nOf of the Islamic faith the women's in gender studies professors willing to be the answer is not really at all summer how women are treated better according to the class in Pakistan and they are in America I don't know how we got there but that's that's how that's how they thought\nYou know the burqa freeze women they would say I know this is the stuff that I was subjected to college radicalized me as a conservative in a sense of being a radical conservative just means that\nYou know you like celebrating the fourth of July and have read the constitution it and it ... and it matters to you\nI'm that's being a radical conservative you know somebody who ... who believes the constitution says what it says and that we all have the same rights and we don't change the law based on whether we like or don't like somebody and that makes you ... in today's day and age that makes you a radical conservative according to the left\nBut college was certainly a process radicalization for me in that way but the grieving studies departments\nAre churning out millions of young people who really think that they\nHave something where someone to blame for all of their frustrations and shortcomings in life that there's there's some reason\nSome reason that is not of their own making are not up there on doing that their life is disappointing that they're not as successful or not as respect your not as loved or whatever the problem may be and it has nothing to do with either\nOne part of growing up I found very important one part of the wisdom of age is just understanding that you know it's it's hard that everybody is carrying a heavy load that everybody is waging their own battle that it's difficult for them\nAnd it's not supposed to be easy I mean I I as somebody said to me once\nOr a writer colleague of mine writer friends said you know whoever told the your your job you're I think he was quoting someone I don't know who but whoever told told you that your goal is to be happy life [laughter] and it's an interesting way of like the difference in being virtuous and being good and being happy\nHappy is conditional right happy can come and go\nVirtue goodness decency honor those constants those are all in your control\nAnd to change our perception of happiness such that it's not everything's going great I'm comfortable I'm respected I Love dime revered I Am you know all those things and have it more focused around who am I

being additive\nA they don't but they won't teach that at school instead what they want to teach you\nOn college campuses and what the media reinforces now when we're adults is that there are extra colonel reasons for your frustrations\nAs an American and those external region reasons now invariably how to do with white males some some out white males around the ultimate ... we we are\nPublic enemy number one in America and there's a lot of us so obviously a lot of enemies we are the bad guys based on this underlying media narrative and once you start to put it in those terms once you were willing to speak about it in an open way you're not saying oh gosh I Can't really know that is true\nThen much of what we've seen here with the whole Kavanaugh debacle and I say that about the\nProcess it's as any do you listen to show knows I was as fired up about Kavanaugh's I'd been about any anything um in defense of cap and all and then\nIn absolute opposition to this obvious mirror effort by the left and I did everything I could I mean I was reaching out\nIt wasn't just normal day of the office for the buck man with Kavanaugh I was reaching out to colleagues across media how do we get the word out we need to make this we need to make this point we need to refute this nonsense and you know we were doing everything they were all bunch of us doing everything we could to\nThey declined the answer again I Can't speak to specific hypothetical or that point Rand Paul cut the FBI Director off and said the answer is yes\nAnd as this time with ray was drawing to a close he spoke about the potential abused within the ... system and Rand Paul is absolutely right he said you've had people bringing their politics to work\nThe concern of us who want more control over what you do and how you look at data is as James Madison said men are not angels that's why we have the constitution that's why we asked you to get a warrant\nThe information you gathered in foreign database is not constitutional and the sense that had gathered with no bar there is no war there is no constitutional mattered to that data\nAnd yet you're going to use it\nOn a domestic crime\nThat has been our complaint for years and years and years and I got to admit\nAfter nine eleven I thought it was a great idea never having any any belief that it was possible as naive as I guess I was\nThat we would have government officials at the top upper echelons within the intel community the FBI and the de OJ\nThat would literally be weaponized sing the powerful tools of intelligence that we give them to protect we the people\nAnd I never in my lifetime thought that a political candidate him put together a flimsy dot CA with Russian sources and it becomes the basis for Pfizer Warren application but not one for\nThe original application in three subsequent applications and that the bulk of the information was bought and paid for by one political candidate to use against another candidate\nAnd that it was never verified it corroborated but still presented to a ... court and they purposely don't tell the ... the court judges\nThat the other candidate paid for this and that they never verified it bites wearing you know we'll get into this you know with chairman Mark Meadows the Freedom Caucus and Jim Jordan later I mean think about that\nThis is what we do we have a constitution for a reason there's a reason why you need a warrant there's a reason why you have to present credible evidence to a court to get a warrant the bar is even higher when it comes to a Pfizer surveillance warrant\nAnd what has happened here is the single biggest abuse of power corruption scandal ever\nNow we've got three people on record saying that Rod Rosenstein well he has a plan hatched to surreptitiously record the president the hopes that they can invoke the twenty Fifth Amendment and he won't even testify under oath says no Congress's letting we got to let him get away

David they get a ... a warrant signed by a career law enforcement person\nSwearing that what you are presenting to the court is true and that you know it to be true and affirmed it to be true well\nThat didn't work out with the third renewal by the application in the case of Carter Page a which is the fourth buys a warrant issued but the fourth one that was signed was signed by Rod Rosenstein\nAnd we all know that the bulk of information that was put in the ... and ...\nWell that was based on the pony Clinton bought and paid for dot CA that not even Christopher Steele stands by to this day and that was never verified never corroborated and has turned out to be mostly debunked which is among the many other conflicts that Rod Rosenstein has of course\nHe's the one that recommended firing Jim call me he's the one that signed the visor warrants he's the one that appointed Mueller and now he was scheduled to appear tomorrow under oath and a two sources now telling Fox News at this hour\nThat Rod Rosenstein scheduled the parents before the house Judiciary Committee is at an impasse\nOver the terms of the testimony\nAnd he doesn't wanna have a transcribed interview under oath which is the standard for congressional taskforce interviews\nAnd those closed the Rosenstein and say well he prefers a meeting or briefing with the house Judiciary Committee chairman and other lawmakers where there's no paper trail where there's no under oath part of the question is why would he be afraid to go under oath\nWell here to weigh in on this and much more\nUh as the impasse continues Mark Meadows is the Freedom Caucus chairman and congressman Jim Jordan of Ohio also a Freedom Caucus member a and by the way would be in this House Judiciary committee I'll interview of Rod Rosenstein um we also have learned in the last\nThree days Mark Meadows I'll start with you that\nWe now know that Lisa Page\nAndrew McCabe the deputy FBI directors under criminal investigation leaves the page who is out at the FBI James Baker the top attorney the FBI they all are telling the same story that Rod Rosenstein said that he wanted to surreptitiously record the president of the United states\nIn the hopes of being able to get him to say something that would allow them to invoke the twenty Fifth Amendment so we there's a lot of questions were Rod Rosenstein at this moment\nWell there are a lot of questions I think probably the bigger question is why would Rod Rosenstein\nOr not be prepared to come to Congress tomorrow to clear his name\nAnd I think the reason for that is there there are a credible witness is you know your lead in had Rod Rosenstein voice saying well you know the needs to be facts and we have the rule of law well we're willing to to consider him innocent until proven guilty\nHim not coming tomorrow indicates a that there is real credibility with these witnesses that suggested that he not only wanted to tape the president but he wanted to use those tapes a to effectively have a ... D O D J who on the president of the United states\nWell he met with the president apparently earlier this week and blue on air force one does anyone know what the result of that meeting was\nWell I think the biggest thing is uh Shaun is is a let's don't read too much into a flight on air force one\nAnd I think it's the president trying to be reasonable and hear rod side of the story I think the president has been extremely measured I tell you who's not measured at this particular point\nAnd more on the latest why won't Rod Rosenstein answer these questions under oath and want to talk about your\nWhole security protecting your family that simply ... security the best home security system on the market even said by the net PC Magazine the wire cutter is their top picks for home security and there's a good reason when they started on this program they're only five employees\nWell now there's over a thousand and millions of Americans you simply say home security will make them great\nWell number one you don't have to cut into every wallets wireless system at the latest greatest best technology comprehensive protection for your home round the clock professional monitoring police dispatch you also get protection from intruders buyers leaks busted pipes and simply said it even worse\nDuring a power outage or down why pie even if a burglary matches your key pet\nThat the system is simple and easy to use it's incredibly intuitive and by the way there's no hidden fees no contract know installation fees that just go to simply say Hannity dot com today and you're going to say ten percent\nProtect your home protect your family simply said Hannity dot com will take a quick break come back we'll continue also more coverage of hurricane Michael pounding the panhandle\n[noise]\nFind our roundup it actually you do not want to miss it as they do vinyl our free for all those Sean Hannity show\nFox News twice an hour every hour depend on news radio nine sixty that what you we are sea\nAnd Brandt so there's this guy didn't Jordan he's a healthy guy he's a dad of six and he works as a guide in Alaska and he goes to the doctor a true story goes to the doctor and he's diagnosed with cancer stage four\nAnd here's the thing he had switched earlier for medical insurance to medical care where Christians share each other's medical bills so the question for Jordan and his wife Jenny was is this actually going to work our medical bills\nExceeded a hundred and sixty thousand dollars met his share members shared all our bells\nAnd it was about more than just the money to this is a real community\nMedicare is is a family a group of people that stick with you because the hardest times of your life I just don't know how I could have done it without measure\nIt's so worth looking into there is the reason is growing so fast so if you want to find out more here is a number for you\nEight five five Ninety four Bible at eight five five nine four B.

Birmingham future growth projects and for our community CEOs you should know from I hardly the aisle\n\nWe can get you a\nCongressman Jim Jordan and congressman mark\nMeadows All right so the next step then is what I mean do I do I need to give out the numbers are Trey Gowdy is office and chairman Goodlatte its office and say call these men and demand that they subpoenaed under oath Rod Rosenstein ... well I don't know why that would be any hesitation\nConsidering that he is up to his eyeballs and everything the firing of calling me the appointment of Robert Mueller the signing of the third buys a warrant and three people now saying that he's talking about taping the president of the United states in the context of possibly invoking the twenty Fifth Amendment what else do we need to get a subpoena for somebody\nWell hopefully I I Would I Would not encourage giving out anybody's phone number and you're great at holding people accountable but here's what I Would say\nIs the fact that you're covering it you're listening interest and the people that are truly tune in on a regular basis to listen to you they need to make sure their member of Congress feels the heat and understands how important it is but the other part of that is is Gemini or are trying to work today\nOr to to stress the importance of why transparency and and the fact that the deputy attorney general much caught me at\nA bus raises right in and say this is what I did and this is what I didn't do anything shy of that\nUh really uh would would be an indictment on his credibility\nYeah what about the president now talked about the classifying and releasing the un redacted by the applications especially pages ten through twelve Seventeen through thirty for the final buys a warrant the one that Rod Rosenstein sign have either have you seen that particular Pfizer application\nI have not uh Shaun we need to see that we need to see the notes to take an after every time Bruce or goes in and talks with the FBI remember Mr or told us\nThat after each conversation he had with\nGlenn Simpson and Chris deal he would then\nContact present the FBI and he would sit down with them and they would take notes we want to see all those notes of all those conversations we know they're at least twelve adults\nSo the so called real too as we need to see those and remember when the president first talked about classifying what we all asking to do this three weeks ago he talked about any communications from Andy McCabe Lisa Page all those documents as well\nThat would include the McCain number so we we need all that information\nAnd again if you're ... find that reading your debt talks about how our great system of justice works\nKey to that is transparency give us the information that we need to see it more importantly the American people need to see\nWell do you want to call chairman Gowdy it's too old to two to five six zero three zero be polite please do oh two two to five six oh three oh a chairman Goodlatte is too old to two to five\nFifty four thirty one too old to two to five fifty four thirty one we'll put them up on Hannity dot com and again be respectful but I think with all that's going on and they should demand that he testify under oath\nOr thank you so much congressman Mark Meadows thinking congressman Jim Jordan and we appreciate your push for the truth we need to get to the bottom of the [noise]\nAll right we've got to take a break when we come back we've got a lot more to come dam bond Geno ... more on this also the latest on this hurricane that his

Fox News the worst of hurricane Michael has already passed Florida governor Rick Scott worn knock it out on the roads until\nYeah a listen the old tactics of the past with the Republican Party which you're intimately familiar with where\nDemocrats lobby political grenade right onto the field usually some kind of a you go through the list every night on Fox or you know a racist besides just you know the the phobic ... kind of stuff these identity politics and he's the Republicans would scatter\nWell they tried a new one with Kavanaugh they try to really disgusting one this rapist line which is one of the most important things I've ever seen in politics and for the first time shot in a long time\nWe had a president in the White House who said we're not going to back down and cabinet we're not going to let you back then I work in the back you up\nAnd we won one and that when I Believe is really just and this is not a scientific sample I don't want to oversell it but based on me just driving around in my town which is a fifty fifty Republican Democrat county Martin County Florida\nRepublicans could not be more ecstatic that we finally have a warrior and a fighter in the White House who is not going to leave the battlefield when that identity politics or disgusting label or comes in from the Democratic party and I think it's really a spice up the Republican base and I think we may have a we may have a a decent the election day\nWell I'm not sure I Can't read the tea leaves um I think it all comes down in these midterm elections always comes down to turn out and if people are motivated or like the Rasmussen poll says uh than it would happen I'm looking at the numbers that Republicans are more mad about the cabinet controversy than Democrats\nAre in a more determined to vote and the upcoming elections uses a dramatic twenty five points shift in just the last six weeks Greg Jarrett so that would give hope to me and hopefully the American people that\nSomehow the Republicans can bucked the trend and and maintain power in the house and maybe pick up some Senate seats which I think are a distinct possibility\nWell I think you're right the only question is with twenty seven days remaining or does this trend that Republicans are motivated and energized devote\nHave legs will it last over the course of the next four weeks\nUm and you know we just don't know that but you're right the polling data does show that and I you know I think that there is a general anger among both men and women across America that this was a process\nOf the confirmation hearing that was a mass amount of fairness and the presumption of innocence and due process and that absent some corroborating evidence from a thirty six year old claim\nYou really can't ruin somebody's career and their lives and you know the reputation a ... that they've built up in the goodwill and their families reputation\nSure I mean I Do think that there is a feeling across America that a lot of this is unfair now there are liberals and the media which is redundant uh who are show rabbit that they don't care about furnish stay just care about\nTheir own political agenda however misplaced in wrong it may be\nAnd so you're never going to change their minds there is no reasoning with on reasonable people so we'll just have to wait and see it's up to the Republican Party I think and and the candidates and indeed President Trump to maintain the momentum going forward over the next twenty seven days\nThe hell out of great article today about what their agenda is and they the Democrats have big plans none of which will help the country or they want to shore up Obamacare which has been nothing short of a disaster for the American people\nThey want war Dodd Frank financial rules to protect quote dreamers and the integrity of elections in other words they want massive amnesty they want to aggressively probe any single thing they can they want this country locked down into endless investigation\nAnd likely the impeachment of Donald Trump\nThey you know Republicans celebrate the passage of the biggest tax cutting history they refer to as crumbs\nAnd they're saying it's time to take the crumbs back I guess the crumbs or the most delicious part of the meal um so all of this is in jeopardy dam bond you know I don't see a waning in people's enthusiasm now I think they have they went so far in the cabin okay some frankly in the last two years what we have witnessed split the\nAnd you chronicled lives in your new book\nYou know the the attempted sabotage of the president I think they see the fundamental unfairness and nothing they stand for is going to help the average American have a better life\nRight and so on the media and Greg just nailed it by the way that you know the media and the Democrats ... ... it's it's it's symbiotic guy I mean it it's a host and and a parasite at this point\nThey're the same thing they have ... up this rage ... not all of them but many of 'em against Donald Trump to such an intense for me to think about the things showing that have come out I mean new lows in politics\nDonald Trump's Supreme Court nominee called the rapists Donald Trump called the treat treat guilty of treason a crime and literally punishable by death that's not hyperbolic he'd been he's been called trees is they ginned up the base so much on that here's the problem the Democrats have created for themselves in the election\nThat in order to seem like the more anti Trump candidate to get that money in those volunteers for your twenty twenty presidential campaign or to get that money in the midterms what do you have to do you have to oppose the trader you have to oppose the train rapist or whatever sick name they call the capital\nSo that that's what's leading to this psycho pathology on the left\nAnd I agree I I don't see this waning and I do see Republican voters saying listen\nWhen is enough enough you attack this this this American patriot and cabinet if you try to take down the Trump Administration weaponize and the government when is enough enough and I think they're going to show up I Hope I pray they do\nWell what do you think about Hillary's endorsement of ah the incitement of getting\nAnd people's faith and you can't be civil suit basically calling for instability you you can't really civil with the political party that wants to destroy what you stand for what you care about and then the other comments made by people like Maxine Waters and others getting their base\nFollow him into a grocery store is following the gas stations confront them chase them out of restaurants which we have seen going on and on a on a regular basis\nFor Republicans it is absolutely wonderful you know they ought to send an early Christmas gift to Hillary Clinton Michael ... Maxine Waters Jerry Adler Nancy Pelosi many of those individuals are calling for\nA the investigation and teach men to Brett Kavanaugh which Americans realize you is wrong and preposterous I could have certainly explain how in a legal basis\nImpeachment is not possible uh for Brett Kavanaugh but the more that the toxic individuals and all of the ones I mentioned\nEspecially Hillary Clinton are toxic uh the more that\nOnly drives Republican voters to the polls to make sure that these people are are not ah in positions of power and will not be able to ruin the accomplishments\nOf Donald Trump which have been incredible you know in the course of two years he's accomplished more than Brock Obama did in eight years the greatest level of American economic growth and prosperity in modern American history and that is not\nJust made up I mean the statistics demonstrate that and so if Americans want to maintain that prosperity 'em and add money to their wallets into private\nOr from government officials who loved just squander hard earned money from American taxpayers are their choices easy\nWell I did like Kevin McCarthy introduced which has a bill to fully fund the Trump border wall\nA the president has already spent about what three three and a half billion dollars he needs about twenty three billion dollars more to get the job done and I think that is certainly one of the big issues that Americans would be motivated to go out and vote for and the other I think\nYou know the president rightly said he couldn't make as many as four more Supreme Court appointments\nThat is a massive issue at this point at it it's a tipping point for the courts you know if you think of the age in the health of some of the justices um ... there's no doubt there will be vacancies in the in years to come in the near future\n... and don't forget showing that the circuits in the district court the Supreme Court gets all of the attention you know it's the sexy story the highest court in the land quite obviously\nBut his Greg can tell your most of these cases that are ... importance to American businesses American individuals' moms and dads out there are settled that the circuit court level they don't even make it to the Supreme Court and Trump already has\nWas uh twenty six appointees to the circuit courts and there's a couple of more are getting ready to to be confirmed as well so this is a really big deal now um we have of course the Ginsburg seat or you know that that could come open if Trump wins reelection it may come open I ... and I say that Sean\nI'm worried I mean I mean it I'm actually worried what will happen to the country if that seat if it gets very decides to step down I mean look what we just witnessed would cabinet can you imagine what's going to happen if that seat comes open as a potential six three conservative majority on the court\nI mean it is genuinely frightens me at a at a again that's not melodramatic I worry for my kids what will happen I quit\nWhich is kinda Bogle somewhere in the country or overseas\nWherever our young servicemen and women are deployed to the U.S will be there\n\nNews I'm rich Dennison hurricane Michael inflicting heavy damage after making landfall this afternoon on the Florida Panhandle officials say a green borough man died when a tree crashed through the roof of his home it was Rick Scott urging those who didn't evacuated to remain sheltered as the storm moves northeastern knock it out on the roads\nUntil you're told to just say we need the roads to be open for first responders and search and rescue to do their jobs and save lives the core of\nMichael is pushing through southeastern Alabama and south western Georgia tonight President Trump is in Erie, Pennsylvania holding another campaign rally tonight for Republicans they started out the rally commenting about the hurricane\nOur thoughts of our entire nation to everyone in the ...\nThe president says FEMA and other federal agencies are prepared to help those affected by the\nStorm [noise] this is Fox News [noise]\n\nBit by bit find Bob cars with the discovery filed new advances in science and engineering from the national Science Foundation [noise]\nAh the Internet over ... over a billion things connected by twenty\nTwenty twenty billion wireless wearables medical devices beautiful smart houses in city technologies will be sharing data on\nIt's a holiday for\nHer [noise] big barrel law to fish [noise] the new technology developed by MIT researchers could socked the hackers\nRight now one of our protections as a method called frequency hopping in which each packet of data center on a random unique radio frequency channel so hackers can't pinned down any one packet problem is hopping large packages just low enough to let them pull off an attack so the\nM.

everything predicted as we talked earlier in the program today has come true this is a bad bad storm it's they are now in the middle of it\nAnd uh it's more devastating than we even thought it could be\nWell we had it going to as a category for my company from Sunday and as a matter of fact I I Know my dad used to always say to me the if you have to tell somebody said something you must not set it loud enough but not everybody hears things a few days away so it was actually a that we put it out publicly with a patriot post\nWhich is a conservative blog I Do a Monday morning telling people that it's going to be but look here's the thing with this storm folks\nThe first thing is this is not climate change or any evidence of it okay so you get to see this coming it could see the whole pattern come back at you know we talk is Sean ... on the sixteenth of September I said I'll I'll be seen you get an October probably because of the Gulf War\nRight now you said it right on the show I Know\nYeah right right on the show and you could see the pattern setting up\nEverything got together and that's why you see that every once in a while but let me put it in perspective I guess is the worst storm ever hit between mobile camp I that I can find on records\nOkay now you know when the ten thousand years ago something hit worse so we're not sugarcoat that but on the other hand it's not because of your educate All right this is what nature is capable of doing and you could see this pattern setting up\nPretty far in advance it's also one of only a handful of storms the last twenty five years\nIncluding Harvey by the way that hit at its peak Andrew did that ... that I was in at its peak when it came into Florida which we're getting off the most of these hurricane to we've been blessed and not like the thirties forties and fifties that hit on their peak now as far as the storm it's it it made landfall\nAs a borderline category five I'm ... and when it's all done they may call it a category five I'm not sure they go out to go in and look at the damage\nBut there's a lot more left to this storm folks because even though it's weakening hurricane force winds are going to go all the way in the central Georgia that that'd be ... to one Seventy five but they're going to be ... to eighty Ninety a hundred miles an hour\nAtlanta you will escaped the worst of it but\nI guess it's probably going to come right over Augusta very close to Columbia South Carolina just north of pay a bill by this time tomorrow when we're talking and then we'll move off the mid Atlantic Coast
