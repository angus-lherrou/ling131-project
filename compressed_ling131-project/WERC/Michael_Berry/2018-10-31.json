McDaniel which raises are the closest\nIs by virtue of natural law and national law a citizen of the United states this will not of course include person born in the United states who are foreigners\nAliens who belong to the families of ambassadors or foreign ministers accredited to the government of the United states but will include every\nOther class of persons that's right notch foreigners okay this is\nDifferent than do people who are permanent residents who are green card holders there are no longer foreigners they may not old citizenship but they're not consider foreigners for the purposes of this discussion but it is very clear should be very clear that it was never the intention\nOf um the ... of the\nPeople who are drafting this of the senator back in Eighteen sixty six Jacob how for example who was who was talking about this amendment and they were dropping some and\nIt was never there intention that this would extend to people who are in the United states illegally and now this is where we get into some complexity and some difficulty because for quite a while now\nIt has been treated as such and this is where we get the anchor baby phenomenon right if you come into America and you have a child\nThe law has been the way that the federal government has interpreted the laws that we have on the books is that you have a citizen now or you have citizenship so if you come into America you have a child that child as a citizen\nThis has led to some open it outright scams of the system most notably with the citizenship or you know or a birth tourism or citizenship are scams that are on\nAnd there have been all stories on this where in California particularly you have people from East Asia who will fly to California and stay in a specific hotel and\nAnd the whole purpose of this is that the they're when they're you know nine months pregnant so that they give birth here that with a child that citizenship in this country and they can then go back to let's say mainland China or wherever and then when they want to go to college or they want to you know moved to the states when they're older they already have citizenship\nWell gee that's that's a pretty that's pretty sweet deal isn't it but citizenship is not supposed\nTo be a commodity that people can just sort of snacks for themselves whenever they want they're supposed to be more to it than that and we obviously can tell that it's a scam when people are showing up here and just having a child and then leaving but all of it as a citizen right all but this person's a citizen people say ... what about military what about um bachelor's abroad yeah\nThey're on official government business\nAnd there are brought on behalf of the United states\nSo it's obvious that there should be and has been an exception for people under those circumstances\nI'm but illegal aliens\nThis by the way it goes right to the heart of of what the what the Democrats have been not just allowing good encouraging now for decades which is people violate our laws and then they benefit from that violation of law and they are a combination of emotional appeal and political pressure\nOverrides an actual plane interpretation of what the statutes are and it's unfair to the American people our government is supposed to be putting our interests ahead of the interest of those and the rest of the world who just want to be here\nAnd that means enforcing what yes I understand on a philosophical level who's a citizen of what country who's born in ... in one country or another that's all it's unfair but life is unfair and nation states are inherently somewhat\nArbitrary system just like the lines on a map at separate them are generally arbitrary yes some of them have geographic boundaries but a lot of the time it's just okay well that's where the line that's where the line is and if there is no government enforcement of that than the line ceases to exist if there is no government enforcement of laws around immigration\nThan those laws in effect ceased to exist\nAnd then you keep working back from this and you find yourself saying whoa whoa whoa hold on a second here\nWhat your jak rats really what the Democrats really want and what do they believe the fourteenth amendment says and and they clearly believe that and and ... it's not just believe that it's also desire\nOr that anyone who comes to this country and has an anchor baby a we'll have that person who citizen because then that makes it a that makes it much much more likely\nThat later on that person will be able to sponsor all that's right you get to sponsor family family reunification right\nSo if you if you come let's say from Honduras because that's in the news a lot right now if you come from ... to the United states\nYou're waiting to find out if you get asylum you have a ... maybe a five year lag you have a baby in America but you're you're not in the country in any permanent status you around the country even really legally you're going through a process to determine your legality if you\nHave that child\nIn America and then you go back to Honduras let's just say theoretically you could have\nFamily reunification migration a chain migration to bring interest the family and so all the news have one kid in America I Know you're already at the front of the line when it comes to the immigration system we have so think about the it's not just the incentive for that one child that's the incentive for the entire family now\nYou know the the uh what was it the er I'm trying to remember the name of the group but I Do I can tell you the\nCenter for Immigration Studies there you go\nAbout a fifth\nPeople out of prison and you know there there were some good stuff that was done here I can I can say that the conversation I think the conversation Trump had with Tonya was interesting just one is spectacle but two there were some points made that were worthwhile\nBut you know what this is why conservatives and we we always seem to remember this we have heroic ideas and ideals we do not really have heroes [noise]\n\nNews I'm rich Dennison President Trump getting some pushback from Democrats and Republicans over his comments that he could end the birthright citizenship by executive\nOrder the issue with birthright citizenship came up early in the twenties sixteen campaign Donald Trump bed and Jeb Bush both highlighting the problem of what they called anchor babies and taking sharp criticism\nFor it functions John Roberts at the White House former vice president Joe Biden blasting the Trump administration's moral leadership\n[noise] horses have terrorized\nFor their political beliefs for color and our skin\nOr their religion Biden's comments coming while campaigning today for Democrats in Wisconsin President Trump and the first lady were in Pittsburgh today paying respects to the victims of Saturday's deadly synagogue shooting\n[noise] this is Fox News [noise]\nTen current and legs your dream home can finally become a reality and I recommend during a model home like I did during my search\nWhen I walked in a new

L. dot com B. R. C. [noise]\nHe's holding the line for America bug that is that\nThe more people see Democrats inaction before this midterm coming up in a week the better by the way\nYou you keep having these little moments that pop up or you go oh wow okay so that Democrat who is positioning himself or herself as you know somewhat of a moderate on some of these issues and a person who work with the other side may be\nYou know very very I anti Trump obviously almost all the Democrats have to take this very anti Trump position but\nYeah there's some people that are at least making a you know going through the\nMotions of being not completely insane leftist but then you see what ends up happening or you see what happens with the candidates you see what happens with the supporters uh you know\n... Andrew Gillum is an example of somebody who I I don't know how you\nCan think he's a good idea for the state of Florida I mean I we've played it on this show and the ... election I think\nIs probably going to get more national attention than any other election and his mentor but Gillum guy with a lot of people focused on obviously he's a young telegenic African American and you know so and and the state of Florida politically\nIs a kind of Lynch pins state for anybody in twenty twenty and that's why you know when you when you look at this and you try and assess\nThe conversation around this race you've got to remember that it's not just even about this it's about\nHow it sets up the the future for the Democrat Party\nAnd you know there's going to kill him though we've we've talked ... or we've talked about before on the show doesn't know how we pay for some of these programs doesn't know how he would uh actually improve health care is really what it comes down to is a lot of these politicians they they talk of the game about how they're going to get more health care to people really ... they're gonna raise\nTaxes and expand Medicaid that's all it's going to be raised taxes expand Medicaid and Medicaid\nHealth outcomes are really poor and you're not going to get better health care outcomes just by having more state dollars thrown into programs\nYou know we we've seen this with schools you can spend a lot of money on schools and have them be bad you can spend a whole lot ... a lot less money on schools and have them be good but the lid answer is always just more money for schools\nThat's more money more money and when you look and pull it apart\nYou actually get into the nuts and bolts of what's happening in our education system which you see is the money isn't going to the kids it's not even one of the teachers it's going to these bureaucrats administrators the teaching system what do you thing happens with the state\nState paid for medical systems a tremendous amount of waste and abuse so I mean give them it's just a bad idea but you also get a sense he's kind of a it's kind of a nasty guy um you know he's very very willing to uh say whatever he thinks he has to say about the opposition which I guess it's true of all Democrats these days but it play fourteen\nTo the fact is is how the given too much harbor or to racism is enough over\nThe anti Semite or he himself when he became the Republican nominee went on Fox News said to the voters afloat and that's a monkey the state of price\nRace has been an issue from the very beginning or in this campaign that because I introduced is having my grandmother used to have the same [noise]\nBecause you get dirty but he actually like [noise]\nDoesn't want to do was to drag me into the gutter yeah but\nBecause they can survive getting dirty I Can't survive\nNow let me just take a moment does stand back with you and just admire what what happened there\nThat is a rhetorical technique known as predator rich the veteran CEO is I could talk about how my opponent is a\nComplete moron who would be nowhere without his family money but I'm not going to do that\nIt is doing the thing that you say you will not do as a form of attack and a a\nPredator rich CEO in this case is on full display he says well you know the scientists said monkey it up by the state and he's clearly saying just just as a racist that's what that is with any but then he immediately switched to\nBudge I don't want to play dirty and wrestle with pigs so I won't do that\nOr the the classic cynical technique of politicians and it's\nRight there on display for you from uh from Guillaume or who I Would notice that my understanding is Tallahassee he's got a lot of problems city which is not surprising at all\nBut speaking of the supporters of the left by like this was during a moment of silence for Pittsburgh victims Marsha Blackburn had a had a rally and she called for a moment of silence for the victims in Pittsburgh\nWe've got to take care of our American family first and that only enriches us to help others as well and we're the most generous country on earth\nAs I said so many times has been no country on the face of this earth that has accumulated more power and abused it last and used it more for the advancement of humankind around the world paying the price for freedom\nIn so many different ways than the United states so much at stake here eight hundred nine four one showing us a toll free telephone number we'll check in with some of the other\nYou know tipping point races throughout the day Newt Gingrich is going to join us while he's going to stay the hour and we're going to take calls in the second half hour the next hour get his take sees a little more optimistic to me I just don't know but I have a feeling there's always this question Donald Trump is changed all the rules in politics\nI don't think a lot of Trump supporters are going to be telling pollsters they're going to the polls I don't think they're going to take the call and if they find out as opposed to they're going to hang up\nBecause that's what I Would do but I've never gotten any such call

adding a deck to no one could contractors why don't you just ask comb advisor home what\nAnd many other Israeli leaders Ron ... is a personal friend of mine and it's pretty outrageous that this is that they feel justified in making any incendiary comment they want\nWell that that's right and I think that's part of what we're going to trust them as election because the American people like and Kevin secrets and what's really happening in the country\nAnd the American people I Believe are prepared to work a party and the movement which has the courage to try to save the country that strength quote and so um I Believe the next Tuesday working on a great deal\nAbout the nature of America well to learn I think that a billionaire liberals can't buy elections\nOr because the media and people just shrug off the rack and say that's not true I don't believe\nWhy are you so confident in the election now I feel pretty good about the Senate but you know I'm always I guess because I'm Irish but I always uh going into elections I always tell people it's really up to them\nThat's the case this election midterms we have a headwind against us historically speaking only three times in the last hundred years as the party in power in the White House\nOr been able to gain seats it looks like will gain them in the Senate but then we've got you know at least thirty thirty five house races mostly Republicans on defense too close to call\nI think that's right yeah how are we using um you know will come from very wise that would be\nVery vivid gamer and can be rebel a starting about two thousand and with the Tea Party movement and rebelled earlier when Ronald Reagan on them at the con critically Monica a value in many ways created clump then we didn't for them\nThat rebellion and resolve is you now have states like North Dakota Montana\nUm jury a West Virginia where there is a huge base that we believe that they're involved in a college unless it causes more than just everyday politics and I think it's it's just fascinating to watch because I think\nThe media doesn't get it show up my my newsletter it'll come up tomorrow basically search\nOn the fact that there is no or you can if you're talking about the ... ah the Mitch\nMcConnell Donald Trump's team is gonna be in control center and people going to say well so I don't like every judge for the next few years would have been blocked by Sherman\nAbout that all of them work when Donald she's been historic an amazing would have come to a halt the minute the Democrats control the Senate so just in terms of judge this is a very consequential election and I look at item after item after item\nAnd I see that we're going to be in the Senate and my guess is we're somewhere between plus three and a number I don't have the courage to say 'cause it's too high now but I can see the\nWay they view ever not had the courage to speak your mind that just is not true while you're listening but look I'm urging people to be cautious and and act like you're behind because I think we shouldn't take anything for granted\nLike I Believe that Marsha Blackburn is going to win I Believe that ... going to win and Missouri I Believe Heidi Heitkamp is done I Believe that Braun is going to win as long as people don't vote libertarian in ... Indiana I Believe Dean Heller will hang on\nAnd and God help us of Christ in cinema wins in Arizona the woman who thinks it's okay to join the Taliban for Americans to join the Taliban after nine eleven and every other bizarre thing she said about the people of Arizona which he calls the meth lab of democracy and the people are crazy\nUm so I I'm just hoping it happens that way and then on the outside you got tester on the bubble even I'm Joe Manchin on a bubble in West Virginia and Bob Menendez on a bubble\nYeah and I actually look at the different levels you have there is one of the parents are you on the state where the Democrats should be safe because his personal\nSkills uh when the Senate Ethics committee on a bipartisan unanimous majority find him guilty of a whole range of things and some very very unsavory rumors that were built around all of that now so he says he's now in such bad shape\nThey'll to having to pour millions of dollars that they like to go somewhere else and help them get back into New Jersey is barbecue can I'm really really good candidates who is a great to see you know I'm very pharmaceutical company understands healthcare\nCan help develop sound practical working alternative to government run health care and um\nShe didn't have many well between his own bringing people out to vote\nAnd the campaign convincing Democrats than there are so sick of\nMenendez or they just stay home that many actually saved three or four house seats in New Jersey that's the kind of dynamic where I frankly I Can't figure out of my own head when you go from state to state to state\nOr how these things are involving right now 'cause they're they're very ... very much in the air and there are I think ... no no one should assume\nThat this was over one of the date and stay home and then they feel about run out and voted which you have to have to end up not by election day do not do anything else to a day to vote it's that serious\nLet me let me ask you this because let's go with real clear politics than they have to wonder written for the number of house seats that they think are safe for the Democrats and about one Ninety nine for the Republicans or work with the Republicans have in the majority all of those toss ups\nPut them on defense than you did have forty five retirements for the Republicans that's a big number in any election year\nUm the house is what I'm most worried about and you know the thought of Nancy Pelosi being speaker elect and then speaker of the house once again is a pretty frightening thought um\nWhere do you see the house going\nWell not functionally ah I I my personal range is due to the bottom of about two oh one which would mean below sea ... Hyman round two twenty thirty which would mean that Kevin McCarthy and couldn't get to speak and um\nAnd I can't I mean all honestly I've always been standard fishing I Can't give you a more accurate number I Can't say to you\nKnow I Can't either when I really can't I mean and I think now and and look the conventional wisdom is Republicans will hold the Senate pick up seats there and let them see below sea what when the house\nUm that's not a great case scenario but that would be sort of like a split decision by the American people also say one other thing is you know some House Republicans have earned the wrath of their voters but\nIt's really not about them it's about stopping an agenda that we know is going to be about impeachment and lives investigation raising taxes they want their crumbs back\nA sanctuary cities open borders eliminating ice and keeping Obamacare\nNot anyone who does not bode has effectively voted for her and she should be no one should kids themselves\nIf you want to have Nancy Pelosi\nAnd then you'll have to house and people like congresswoman waters in charge of the financial church history but you just said the phrase\nIt tells you how crazy their party it's how how could you then again she was one lady she's not somebody I Want to have watching over banks in our financial services um she go down unless you think of\nAnybody who says I'm tired of it all you don't like them or I should sort of a I'm not going to not voting affect a half a vote for Nancy closer to be speaking [noise] um I think that's\nGood yeah I'm Still a ... there were four hundred and thirty five members of Congress all of them are up for reelection\nAnd every race is important and the idea is no this is the either stay home or you vote for the Democrat you're pretty much voting for ... the the same in the Senate races\nYou know you vote for John tester you vote for Claire McCaskill you vote for Christ in cinema you vote for Bill Nelson you vote for reticent in Tennessee\nYou're you're voting for sure and I know that it's probably not the way these red state Democrats or the red state Republicans look at it but in truth and in reality that's how they're going to vote that's who they are going to vote to be their leader\nI just tell everybody you run into some of the claims you're a moderate Democrat ... say I'm a moderate Democrat in the house of of course and went on from that she was you know and I sort of have to do that fine\nTo treat them throw up if they said you oh I'm really kind of a moderate Democrat email I got to vote for him were\nDefeat them I mean who's giving out here\nAnd I think uh we have every evidence because Israel change sport 'cause the radicals in the Democratic party is in control of your body that their leadership is just utterly unacceptable and that I think we have an obligation to uh\nTo feed them and the waiter to treat them as to make sure you have\nUm listen I got to tell you that's the main thing let me play for use some of the more recent comedy played Joe Scarborough and Don Lemon and ... and this is what is representative of the news media today\nFor the official rules and to instantly lock in your free chance to win that's defense to eight seven to two but here's the best part we're giving away up to\nTwenty four guns every single day it could be twenty ... twenty four a our fifteenth you'll never know if you don't check it out right now just take out your phone\nAnd text defend D E F E N D to eight seven to two to can you imagine doing something so easy echoed winning so much I'm Talking about thousands and thousands of dollars in ... but you must hurry because today's expensive got disappears at midnight with only a few hours left you'll have to act back\nThey got your phone and text defense to eight seven to two two it's so easy fast in one hundred percent free just text defend to eight seven to two two you can't win if you don't enter so text defense to eight seven to two two right now\nA small business owners know it's hard to generate leads and get new customers hey it's J.

Mr Speaker out about it argue from moderate Democrats or I think it is one party one voice leanings solidly socialist left\nVersus those that believe in our constitutional republic limited government greater freedom less government intrusion into our lives I think that is the fundamental disagreement\nLegislature vision of two hundred Americans you know there there are America's one in which we don't teach American history we don't want to be American or will not proud of the flight motion so you could count on emotional leave the star Spangled Banner\nAh and ah you know we're just one more normal country though to be subordinate or to the un and national regrets\nDuring their own because we're the wealthiest country in the world we're only seeing huge amounts of money to coax a because

basically undermining America for the purpose of variety on a\nLot at stake I think the most you know if you're barely pay close attention the Democrats stand for nothing except painting Trump wanting

party game\nBy the way only takes thirty minutes to play everybody all ages can play it it's simple to learn nor the game is going to bring families together like what's in waitress\nI've been talking

real memories are created by the way you can get which is an waiters this week target is running a a special you buy a game or two you can get what's in wages for free\nIt's the with waiters party

com\nI harsh radio see six o'clock\nRallying Republican dye leads to the camera Fox News President Trump in Florida this hour the first nominee campaign blitz and the final days before the midterm\nIt was the first time in eighty years since FDR ran for president did we had a Democrat nominee for president when Orange County and so the Democrats think we're vulnerable and that's why they have zero zero in on us\nWell this was really interesting because most Republicans you don't think California races being that important\nBut now it's become crucial in terms of in a we've identified all of these races on our website Hannity dot com\nUm that they're really focused in in which means it could be a very late night or early morning before we eventually get to know who controls the house\nOr come next January and it could be Nancy Pelosi there was a real threat and I think a real possibility I Would say the fact that you have two hundred and four save democratic seats a hundred and Ninety nine safe Republican seats and all these thirty some odd toss ups\nAre are Republicans on defense that means they pretty much have to run the table and that's why they're spending all those money\nI'm can ... exactly\nYeah so tell us about you know what are the issues there do you think the people in your district the forty fifth district of California are paying attention and are are being influenced by the money in the negative ads\n[noise] yeah it's a real clear choice in this race I mean you have\nUm a a district where people want to continue to this America for work I mean we had the lowest an appointment at forty nine years that you know in orange county it's the lowest unemployment it it Nineteen years people have more money in their paycheck uh people are able to get jobs\nConsumer confidence is that we are really moving this country in the right direction that the choices clear do you want to continue living uh America forward or do you want to go back\nTo the Obama era too where are you at overregulation where you had high taxes you had government in your life and I think it's a clear choice in what we're seeing right now on the early returns\nOr is that the Republicans are just as energized as the Democrats are and in fact in my district\nWe have over ... fourteen point advantage on me after the the return over the Democrats so we aren't seeing this so called blue wave that you hear about we see that our voters are just as an energized\nWell I think it look if you look at the Senate Republicans have decided advantage and a lot of these races where they're red states that support Trump by big margins\nBut the houses just harder to figure and I don't know if people fully completely understand that there are a lot of headwinds history runs against the party in power they have forty five retirements that's the case for example Darrell ISIS seat\nUm and I you know I'm assuming with gerrymandering and and the legislature out there in California they do everything they could possibly do to maximize the number of democratic seats from the state\nAnd uh so it makes a particularly hard for people like yourself that have done a good job and want to do a good job\nOr state and in your district but uh you know you're fighting against the state that has a Thirteen and a half percent income tax with a democratic governor of that or democratic lieutenant governor running for governor who wants to free health care for anybody whether you're a California resident or not whether you're a citizen or not\nIt's a very challenging environment and to be from California and representing California either or for reasons why we need to make sure our voters get out and vote so that we don't lose any Republican seats we have fourteen members of Congress right now and the Democrats have thirty nine\nAnd sell it is really really important that we hold our seats we got to turn the state around and you're absolutely right I mean the liberal policies that cannot Sacramento Jerry Brown and now possibly gather news that\nUh it it's getting more and more for double to live in the state and we need to have it get to the point where that pendulum swing back and I'm going to continue to fight for my constituents that can can you to fight for Californians until we\nOne of the problems is that you will ever have swinging back is people are so fed up with the regulations and hide taxation of states like California and New York\nIllinois and New Jersey is they are leaving and they're taking their money with them and you know my only fear is when they go to Texas or Florida or the Carolinas or maybe a lot of a lot of cases Nevada\nOr that they leave the liberal policies with them when they leave and and don't bring the failed policies that they voted for in their states because if you look at it I mean it's become unsustainable for young people in California they can't afford to buy a first home they can't afford the high rate of taxes unless like you were in Silicon valley making crazy money\nYou're absolutely right and you know one one hope I have is that Supreme Court decision Janice versus asked me where you know if you're a member of the union you no longer have to pay your is the union's control Sacramento and if we're allowed to have a couple of election cycles\nWe may start to see that money go out of the hands of that and the unions that may give us a fighting chance at some point in the future and the state of California\nWell I got to tell you something there is a fighting chance I Wish you the best out there I Hope people are paying attention Southern California\nYou now have and this is the headline which I think it's pretty scary Michael Bloomberg spending millions for California Democrats in in tight races and one other article came out said literally spending ... million dollars just on Southern California so\nUh we wish you all the best is is Mimi Walters California's forty fifth district\nA and I wish you the best on election day and Dana Rohrabacher and all these other Republicans in Southern California these races all will tip the balance of power\nAnd if you vote for anybody that's a Democrat out there if you swayed by these ads you're pretty much voting for below sea hope the people in those districts to understand that so anyway thanks for being with us\nThank you so much\nOr I Hope it works out for you\nIt's not fun running for office who wants to run for office these days are All right let's get to our phones or we have so much going on today six days on election day let's go to Mary is in upstate New York Mary Hi how are you glad you called well New York's on the verge of re electing Cuomo and what\nWas done a thing for upstate New York and the fact that Pennsylvania takes all of the natural gas from New York and they are allowed to frack and you see the economy booming on the other side of the border and here we could be literally creating wealth beyond our wildest expectations pretty sad\nVery sad you know what's going on and I\nI I'm In that business as well for me that's ridiculous I I was talking to you a few years ago and matter of fact it was five years ago today on health care as a situation because when they rolled out before to CARE Act became affordable\nFor no one that I Know I've especially myself um I told you that and my husband had gotten kicked off my plan and um I take extra and I'm getting less coverage and there's hats that I've had 'em\nThat are no longer covered and yesterday I had to sit down to do my two thousand Nineteen elections went up yet again and less coverage getting gang for tests and things that used to be covered and just I Want everybody to get out there and vote\nBecause we need to continue on our past\nAnd and and get rid of the Affordable CARE Act and uh you know overhaul of that\nUm and yeah I agree with you on that fracking point as well but I actually was just calling to talk about the health care\nWell I've got to tell you right now uh it's everybody that is now on the Democratic side they're running on oh we're going to fix health care we're gonna ...\nI'm like you're the same idiots that gave us Obamacare keep your doctor keep their plans have less and fundamental it's been a failure and the fact that was true none of it was true was one of the biggest lives that were told them perpetrated on the American people\nUh but anyway Mary thank you I I Wish the people in upstate New York would get the prosperity that they deserve it can be done to

I approve this message because you're going to college a lot when you don't care who gets the credit\nI that as a Dino Rossi add twenty five now to the top of the hour running for office Washington state's eighth district in\nWell he's kind of familiar with uh how dirty politics can be fighting for the people of Washington state which is you know fairly liberal and a lot of ways like oh California it's its neighbor and Oregon its neighbor\nAnyway he was a certified governor elect twice in two thousand and four than a King County literally discovered brand new balance\nThat broke overwhelmingly for the Democrat\nAnd they counted them despite the fact that it was clear in that case at least my reading of it that some felons and then that will do both people that actually voted and King County is a lecture and control systems have been sloppy\nBut you had you know groups like move on and others you know paying for a recount other ballads and they found enough new votes\nThat were not counted to\nA well not conducted the voters to swing the election is that pretty accurate what happened to you know\nI actually think county had more votes than voters and that they've they've flipped it by a hundred and twenty nine votes at a two point eight million vote\nSlow down there how did you have more votes than voters and it'd be counted\nThat's what we questioned as well and the the the Democrat appoint a judge this year I'm a decided that we were gonna have to prove how those votes were actually cast\nWell why wouldn't you just use a little calculators they have this number of voters and the number of votes and they don't add up and that that would be well election fraud\n[noise] yeah well he called it sloppy what he called it and then group against us\nLet's talk about the eighth district out there in Washington state and a ... you know how do you view the race that you're in because you're on our list of toss ups and that will tip the balance of power in six days\nWell this is one of those twenty three seats that Hillary Clinton won in two thousand sixteen that are Republican currently hold from Nancy Pelosi thinks that they're half way back to the speakership\nAnd this has been the most expensive house race in America at this point I think she spent more money against me than any other person in America\nAt Bloomberg wearing you know another two or three million dollars and this last week as well um you don't many cultures are normally additive Therese John and I'm proud of mine\nWell you know I mean the same thing we were talking earlier maybe waters are Walter season California's forty fifth district but I think there's that Michael Bloomberg the former mayor of New Yorkers spending some nine million dollars alone in Southern California and how much of they poured into the race of negative ads against you\n[laughter] it's been it's been ... about two to one at this point no they're not ... to to wander the good news people know and so you know the lives that they tell really aren't getting the narrative\nBut we're all male and state every all ballots have been out for a ... for a week and a half now and so every day's election day every day is election day I got the most left wing opponent I've ever had\nA you know she she woke up the day after Hillary law and decided that she needed to be a member of Congress and marched in more angry protests Seattle increase in the district\nElection year because you know I'm sitting there looking yet let's see uh\nUh Cuyahoga County and Palm Beach county and the panhandle and southwest Florida and I can figure out usually Broward County all these important counties whether or not Republicans are going to win or lose now there's a little tougher because of\nThe different congressional races my guess is it's going to be late into the morning before we can ascertain who can maintain control of the house\nIn large part because California matters Southern California we've been featuring the seven important races there on our list on Hannity dot com the thirty most important racist Seventy total important\nRaces although there are all important and I'm just not sure people understand what a Speaker Pelosi\nMeans to heartbeat away and you have a woman who says we have to pass the bill to find out what's in it yeah that's what you went running your country then by all means staying home listen at the end of the day will deal with whatever it is\nWe are going to rage there well you can rage away as long as it's not against me I don't really care I'm going to be so mad at Republicans that they don't go out and vote well\nVery very sad\nThat we found so she's already picked out the drapes she got this thing covered\nUm I'm not so sure I'd want one of the unknown factor is with the greatest hope for Republicans in my opinion\nIs that it absolutely there is an unknown Trump factor all bets are off 'cause I don't think Trump supporters of the type of people are going to answer anybody's call for any poll ever I don't I've been with calls me I never get called for a poll and\nPolls you know I look at them I Know the conventional wisdom is I read real clear politics every day you know Nate Silver as as an eighty five percent Democrats take the house\nUh but I also know that they got it wrong and two thousand for two thousand and fourteen and two thousand and sixteen and not the only did they get it wrong they did it in a colossal spectacular way\nSo I'm just saying to the American people don't be swayed by polls don't be dispirited if you think you can't win assume that you're behind and go out there on the field that's why we play the game\nAnd you know sometimes your favorite team wins and sometimes your favorite team loses I didn't particularly enjoy election nights and two thousand\nAnd eight yeah because you can't tell you cannot complain if you don't vote so go out and vote I Can't complain because I'm basically my talking about you everybody knows you vote [noise] has nothing to do with the voting I said oh we can do is informed people [noise]\nEverything to do with the voting no it has everything to do with every but my my vote is meaningless in New York for the most part [noise]\nNow we know we're in a blue state so we do the best we can do boating I don't know every year we do our civic duty\nAnd but I Am saying look look at where it's important look at what states presidents do whatever the he's not doing eight states going to Lebanon rally blitz California Florida Iowa Ohio we all need you go do and you know at the end\nFor example we sucked up Obama for eight years it wasn't good for the country will we would suck up a Nancy Pelosi as speaker one more time but I'd rather not I'd rather keep the progress that we've made the last two years going keep the momentum going\nUm but we'll deal with it either way um there are three possible outcomes total victory split decision house and Senate
