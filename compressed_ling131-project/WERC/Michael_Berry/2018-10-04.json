I saw how to another sworn declaration today that a person was at parties in the eighties where there was drinking insects and and knew the cabinet was that these parties\nI mean at what point are we just put it in high school drinking and socializing\nOr in some kind of weird public trial here ... there there is no names there's no allegations of specific criminality\nOh yeah I Know I I I'll swear I'll swear testimony out that I went to a party a long time ago and there are people who are drinking and having premarital sex and that was happening\nOkay that's not ... you can't just prove that you're not gonna get in trouble for perjury and also doesn't prove anything they have an easy thing is alive should keep I keep running into they should be ashamed but are they have no shame and they view this as an end justifies the means to a situation and that's why I Want to remind everybody right now\nWe've got to keep our eye and the ball here\nThis has never been this has never been about getting to the truth this delay is not about getting to the truth it's not about being fair to Kavanaugh or even respecting the process in any meaningful sense\nThis has been do anything to get the Democrats' way that's what this is\nAnd I'm concerned we've got a lot of time is going to pass\nBetween now and friday there was a lot of room for them to come up with something and you've seen the narrative shift oh the FBI investigation is in Folsom enough they haven't done enough um you've seen that happen but there's another component to this to\nThis is where I'm most concerned as to how I could see a vote failing or the Senate not having the votes one or the other\nAnd that is this notion now that the only way\nThat we can come back from this brink of partisan a base is if Kavanaugh becomes the sacrificial lamb\nIf Kavanaugh is the one who has to get swept aside here so that we can bring the country back together you see so that we can heal the nation\nI Want to slap myself as I say that but\nCrushed me that resonates with people like flake Collins and Murkowski and you could see today some of them at least jockeying around this issue a little bit trying to

morning that will pave the way for Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh's confirmation\n\n\nYeah I think it was a great Senate candidate for Arizona served her her country was incredible honor and distinction and and Dean Heller in Nevada and Rick Scott in Florida but these numbers today are interesting as President Trump's approval rating is now matched his all time high at fifty percent\nAnd more importantly we've got a raspy is simple that says\nWell the latest survey fifty six percent of likely voters agree with judge Kavanaugh's statement to the Senate Judiciary committee friday of last week that his confirmation hearings had become a quote national disgrace\nThat it raises questions about what impact this might have on the midterm elections in thirty three days because mid term election polling is getting more definitive the enthusiasm gap is as close to almost two dead even hold and you see Republicans and important Senate races now in a dead heat\nIn all of these states that are red states where we're Democrats where Trump is won by fairly big margins\nI'm like I'm going to go further I think when we see that moment when judge Kavanaugh becomes justice capping off and we see that first time when he is sitting in the Supreme Court\nI think a large part of the left is just going to collapse and morale they have done everything they could they went all out they lied they meet your it everything you can imagine and they lost\nAnd I think that the morale effect on the left is going to be substantial Chuck Schumer strategy failed and the fact is that he and the process\nYou may well have crippled his party for a generation a good friend of mine called and said you know there's one team out there trying to build things they're called Republicans\nAnd there's one team out there trying to destroy things they're called Democrats and he said to me I just don't think people are Americans are going to vote for the destroyers and I thought that was a pretty good way to capture what we're living through\nI've often said and then we've been friends going back since Nineteen Ninety maybe even a little before that and I've often said you can predict this with certainty every two and four years that identity politics\nYou know as rich versus poor old versus young\nBlack versus white whatever the vista nature of politics they can bring up comes up every election year but they have now son to a new low you know I knew this was not going to be a difficult job for the FBI and the case of professor Ford there was no place there was no time there was no location there's no place for the FBI to visit\nIt took to look for anything for ... that might exist\nAnd the only for people that they could really talked to the poor people professor Ford mentioned\nThat she remembered being at this this so called party when the alleged event happened\nAnd she identified one person that was supposed to be a I Witness to the assault and the eye witness said that did not happen and the other people do not remember any such party is this and then the question is do we believe in the presumption of innocence\nOr we just got a jump the gun and say guilt by association Cory Booker is that something spectacular yesterday and he goes well there's enough allegations out there I mean you just you got to kind of believe it and they're not qualified based on allegations\nWell look let's be clear Cory Booker sadly somebody who I used to think that a real future as a reformer or it's just sort of the Cade I mean I don't know whether it's because he wants to run for president\nOr what but he's just kind of Kate into almost making a mockery of himself me he talks about any of Spartacus moment which is a sign of such stunning historical ignorance that has a history teacher I founded painful um he he makes comments like that I mean here people should know that if allegations destroy you\nUh then the whole process\nOf the rule of law collapses over totally and it's sad to watch something like that\nYou know I think could have been a positive constructive force and who's now frankly\nAre becoming almost a caricature of himself\nIs certainly a lot

is\nWill they all go out and vote to protect the progress that has been made in the last two years even maybe if they don't particularly like their individual Republican congressmen or maybe think they're weak or maybe don't even know their name is\nWhy do you just put your finger on the key question of this election I have as you know\nI've been involved in many many campaigns are actually going all the way back to Nineteen sixty and [noise] one of the ... one of the lessons I learned was I don't care about the polls show me the three sinks I Want to see the first real votes\nI Want to see who cares enough to show up and vote\nBecause that changes everything is you know we just won a\nA sixty three percent Hispanic district in a special election for the state Senate in Texas right down along the border and this we had a candidate who got lost by twenty points four years ago came back in the special in one um\nAnd is the first Hispanic Republican state senator or in Texas and that's because people were energized enough to turn out so I Would say to everybody in our audience\nWho this is going to come down to isn't holding it isn't conversation at the coffee shop who cares enough to get an absentee ballot who cares enough to show up and vote\nAnd if our side does show up in both I think this could be one of the most historic elections that you and I've ever covered living together for lots of elections I have a hunch this one could turn into something that we would rush to oil behind\nThe scenes I got to give you a lot of credit because I remember speaking with you you probably forget it the day before\nYou became speaker the houses in Nineteen Ninety four and I remember talking to you that day and the day of the election and and you are surrounded by a group of people in Joe Gaylord and you actually shared with me the information you had and you said it was absolutely true that for the first time in forty years Republicans would take over the house\nI think you and I were two of the few people willing to go out on a limb and said yeah Donald Trump as a real shot of winning this election and\nAnd people laughed at us at the time and I I Believe that them and and we proved out to be right we also the both of us predicted Obama would be an abysmal failure as president based on a very rigid ideology that he seemed to be indoctrinated

don't want to play this game and people are starting to get on the same bandwagon I Do think it's going to have a huge outcome and the election I think that people are going to say they're tired of

her story number one\nNumber two or own words that she was a ... they'd quickly had gaps in her memory and the fact that we now know that you know so many different things that we didn't know before and that this Ramirez was actually out there soliciting information from her fellow yelled classmates the New York times reported that because she quote couldn't remember\nThen in the case of Julie

the cooperation because I'm not ... I and I'm not the one who was investigating this right and we talked about this last week wait a minute when everybody was talking to it\nWas a full and fair investigation getting married at twenty cooperating witnesses to the I think now and the FBI did\nKnow skews me every main person that was mentioned in the case of professor Ford and the case of miss for me or as the New York times tried to corroborated they spent an entire week interviewed dozens of people\nAnd then she herself was calling around to other yell classmate saying I don't I don't remember do you remember I'm not sure if it was him that exposed themselves and then we all watched Julie sweat Nick\nFalter shift and backtrack from her original allegation which was gang raping and systematic drug gang of women so\nCould you have any crop rotation for any of these incidents at all\nI'm not saying they need to take actions that I don't expect that you went extinct and I did\nAnd all you're following of the ... you can't find any cooperation either can you as a matter of fact we're getting just the opposite occur operation people are saying those they don't recall those stories at all that it or that happened that way at all\nThe charges are college or in that scene on at the last twenty four hours at camp out at the judges drinking on a on a ...

I also have to leave that the FBI should have been allowed to do a full and fair and ... and that is why you're going to see on the left a huge outcry and I understand that this is energizing the geology hey\nI Know there's a talking point what was on a second\nI Want you interview looking in the case of professor Ford before people she identified were at the party and none of the four have any recollection of the event and the one eye witness says it didn't happen\nWhat else are they supposed to do is we don't know where it happened we don't know when it happened we don't know the location she doesn't know how she got there got home from their what else did the FBI to do they had already given sworn statements under the penalty of a felony\nAnd all they did is reiterate those statements that the FBI what else could they possibly do Danielle in that case\nAnd being on the opposite side of if ... if the FBI just\nTo see what else can they pass certainly do knowing the facts as we know that we don't know where we don't know when we don't know huh\nOK okay two things to say that she doesn't run into where I where and when exactly it's not necessarily\nDon't you know you're you're trying to what you're trying to change the look follow\nThe bounds of the ... if there's four people that were eyewitnesses but we don't know where we don't know when we don't know how she got there we don't know how she got home we don't even know the house which you mentioned four people were there they for people under penalty of felony all said that didn't happen the way she said\nOne

corroborate the stories of this\nThat's what they did they got what they wanted and it never ever gonna be enough All right back to our phones as we say Hi first Brandon is in Colorado Brandon Hi how are you glad you called and welcome to the Sean Hannity show\nHey thanks Sean I grew up and spent most of my life in Arizona where my family's still is and I'm I'm actually a distant relative of Jeff Flake and I do think he is a decent man and I think he has a\nA good heart but I really feel like he's getting played here by the Democrats and the left and I just really really hope that uh that you'll make the right decision tomorrow or Saturday it sounds\nSounds like after his comments today that that's more likely but uh it's just you know I I Know there's a reason he's not running for reelection and it's just hard to see a see good people leave to Washington and come back a few years later and and not be able to really recognize that I feel like that happened with McCain and I feel like it's kind of happening with just as well\nI think the most shocking statement that he may was on sixty minutes when he when he actually admitted\nWhen asked if he would be voting this way if he had to face the voters he had ... ... vote lead not um and I'm like oh so you're you're only stand on your principles when\nWhen you have to face the voters but that's not how you really feel it

Biden said it would not going to offer recommendations\nAnd they're not going to offer opinions here and all they are going to do is give you a straight data and that's what was given and everybody seems pleased by that his comments Susan Collins comments seemed to satisfy them no corroboration of any of these claims as we've been claiming\nAnd as we've been telling you and so the allegations have been problematic from the start\nYou know assuming assuming for a second here judge Kavanaugh where to get confirmed we we have got to have a deep analysis in this country over where we want to go forward\nIn terms of going forward because if we allow this to happen to good people it it's it is so it's so dark um I was having a conversation with a friend of mine who's religious\nAnd we were discussing you know look at the ten commandments why is one of the ten commandments\n... shall not their falls witness against the neighbor because it's devastating for the rest of Brett Kavanaugh's life\nPeople know that this is what he's been accused of and yet in spite of the fact there's been no corroboration shifting stories and\nA media hysteria that's ... that's why\nTo the extent that people can literally destroy other people with a new window falls uncorroborated claims a shocking to me they did it to Robert Bork they did it to Clarence Thomas they've been doing it to Brett Kavanaugh they do it to Republicans conservatives every two and four years they're racist or sexist\nThey want grandma to die all these things that they've come out as a matter of of course because
