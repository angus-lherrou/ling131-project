{"month": "10", "state": "AL", "station": "WERC", "content": "But the deciding factor should not be are you within walking distance of America that's not how our immigration system is supposed to work\nWe have laws we have laws that are in place specifically so that we do not have people show up\nAnd just stay\nWe didn't have those yes we would open borders state the Democrat\nSo are planning to demagogue this issue they are going to use this to try and get their base fired up they're going to try to use that\nAnd is very likely that these individuals who are going to show up at the border will end up in the interior of the United states\nAh they will be processed but if they claim asylum if they turn themselves in and they\nClaim asylum they are going to get a hearing the hearing will be delayed so you'll have another another wave and another wave\nWhat happens when you have a law that is not enforced what happens\nWhen the state has decided their actions that are bad but there are no consequences for that bad behavior what we're seeing this happen right now\nIt is so very easy for Democrats particularly well off connected coastal elite Democrats who don't compete with illegal immigrants for jobs who don't have to worry about illegal immigrants uh and draining resources from\nOver already overcrowded public schools public schools that are attended by Americans of all ethnic backgrounds of all religions\nThey don't have to worry about that doesn't affect them\nIn fact they view it as nothing but win win by being essentially for open borders from Latin America at least in this country the Democrats get to feel morally superior\nThey get to achieve power and perhaps\nEven eventually defeat the Republican Party for ever by\nChanging the demographics of this country such that there'll be a majority of voters built in for always and and forever for the foreseeable future at least who vote Democrat\nBecause they know that immigrants particularly the ... the people well [laughter] illegal immigrants they're not supposed to vote for them but who really knows what's\nHappening there uh but but immigrants in general uh tend to vote Democrat and people who come to the country and have a greater need for all kinds of government services are obviously going to vote for the party of the government the party of the state and state isn't that the Democrats\nNow why is it a bad thing for the president to say enough stop we can't keep doing this the answers ... it's not\nBut they won't ever tell you the Democrats the media when they set up this problem they won't act like there are two sides to it they're not going to present this as hey\nWe understand is very difficult problem uh this is how we come down on this and we would like the president to take the following actions no they want to point fingers and scream racist and they want photos of crying children being separated from parents they want photos of\nPeople looking hopeless and indigent being told by immigrations and Customs Enforcement or being told by border patrol\nIn this case you know you're you're now going to be taken into custody and they hope\nTo make this an emotional issue if it's really that emotional Ford them why don't they just make the case that the imagery makes for them which is well I guess we should just taken everyone and everybody everybody who has\nBeen waiting in line for years has been going through the legal process and it was respected our laws are many people who are still waiting to get into this country and whoever respected our laws along I I guess they're just Trump's they don't have you and MSNBC CNN New York times the Washington Post in their corner so they don't count\n\nThis is very very destructive and it's also ultimately an issue of sovereignty\nIf the United states cannot determine who comes here under what circumstances than it is just a matter of time before the United states ceases to exist as a policy we will be a different country different political union if we don't control who comes in who goes\nYou cannot have open borders and the welfare state I think the answers are really the truth is you can't have open borders and state\nYou have something else I don't know what it is no other country in the world allows there's no other country in the world takes in a million people and makes them legal and God Bless them welcome to America legal citizens year in and you're at a million a year I'm Sorry legal permanent residents and citizens a million a year\nSo a lot every year working in a million through our legal process and when when Trump says\nWell for security purposes we're gonna take refugees Middle East down from think something like fifty thousand to thirty thousand oh my gosh he's like a tell all the ... he's a monster\nWill hold on a second we're already taking in a million a year are we allowed to discuss\nThat number changing can the number only go in one direction can only get larger\nThis is also why yes we do need a wall 'cause it's not realistic to expect the president's gonna keep having first of all we have a Democrat president going to do anything and if we have Trump even in office for if we're lucky\nThe next six years to try and stem the tide of recurrent migrant marches to the border is just not realistic by sending additional forces by dealing with this on a one off basis you need a permanent barrier you need a wall Democrats don't want to do because\nWal first off would prove its utility very quickly and then they'd all look foolish or wells don't work no I'm pretty sure walls work\nYou know if you're if you're going to walk on your neighbors' property and there's nothing there that's pretty easy for going to walk her neighbors' property and has a ten foot cement wall things just got a little harder you may think twice about walking onto their property trespass it right this couldn't be any more straightforward but they say oh walls don't work it works in San Diego San Diego sector of the border\nFence they're absolutely works so why wouldn't workouts where all they don't have any good answers for you\nThey just don't want it to get built because once it's built we can see that it works and once we see that it works\nAnd they're they can't do very much about it I don't think they're going to be successful with you know break the wall down\nThis is one area where Trump has an on lucky has an unfulfilled promise now as to who's behind this march\nAnd who's\nPulling the strings here I Know there's a lot of theories out there I Know I I don't know\nBut I Do know that this is not a coincidence that you have the largest of these migrants caravans that I that I Know of\nJust a couple of weeks before the midterm elections on the way the border this allows the media to play the emotional manipulation game this allows them to forget about the fact that the economy is incredibly strong to forget about the fact that all their\nPredictions about economic calamity because of Trump and all the things that they've said twenty Fifth Amendment\nHe has to be removed 'cause he's crazy Russia collusion that the mainstream media has wasted over a year of the American people's time\nOn this fantasy that Trump colluded with Russia worse than a fantasy minute it's a plot it's a plot that was\nPut into motion by anti Trump elements in our own government to undermine the president I'd states they wasted a year of our time on this year and a half of our times\nIt's insane is absolutely insane but\nThey can get enough people at the border looking sad and looking hopeless take lots of photos of lots of videos and then talk about how heartless Trump is for enforcing the law that was the law in the books during the Obama administration about how the safety of all involved and also\nYes as a deterrent you separate people from their children at the border you should reunite them but this is the process that they have had\nAnd if they do this again I Know the Trump administration's changed the way that they're going to do it because the outcry originally but if there's any separation whatsoever even a temporary separation I mean even a matter of hours we're going to be told that it's heartless it's cruel it's you know it's evil it's a it's a Nazi concentration camps\nAll over again I'm not making that up people were saying

Eighteen days away from these all important midterm elections\nAnd what do we see we see that Brett ascend has now been exposed this week in Tennessee as somebody that is purposely lying to the people in Tennessee the same with Claire McCaskill we say that Christ in cinema is falling apart I mean literally\n... you know she she says oh it's fine to be a sign that join you know radicals um and the Taliban actually said it wasn't by the way this is the meth capital of the world Arizona oh by the way you're crazy and she has anti war rallies while her opponent Republican Martha make Sally\nIs that we're fighting for a country that's not playing well very very well right now in the state of Arizona and you see that Heidi Heitkamp totally out of touch with the people of North Dakota so seems a lot of pickups are in the making there for the Senate for the Republicans\nTight race though in Florida both for governor in for Rick Scott is always there was an amazing job for the people of Florida are anyway joining us to analyze where we are Eighteen days out is our good friends welcome back to the program John McLaughlin Doug shown pollsters both of them\nJohn Eighteen days out what do you see happening\nOf well the the house is still in play and the Republicans are a without a doubt are fighting back to have gotten more aggressive but still it needs to do a lot more and and what's really amazing to me is the focus of\nYou know you're exposing the Democrats and what their agenda is all the time\nBut the focus of the Republicans really needs to be to expose Nancy Pelosi and what she intends to do I think you played a clip earlier about humor in the Senate and he wasn't very specific about whether they're going up in the polls because the Republicans post Kavanaugh uh have have really done a lot better in a in a\nIn the polls that have come up I mean when you're talking about uh Arizona ... now hit by a little in Tennessee Republicans leading now decisively a sort of ... so the\n... the Democrat opportunities to pick on the Senate looked like they are going off the table and on the other hand it looks like the Republicans are ahead in Missouri they're they're they're running close races and in Montana Indiana\nA West Virginia I mean even in New Jersey uh it's it's turning into a competitor\nWas really looking like New Jersey might be a dog fight for Bob Menendez and the people in New Jersey of had it with him and you know now that his association with this Chilean Epstein guy\nUh that has now become an absolute verbal war between ... and his Republican opponent of opponent and now showing up at the polls are dug show where do you stand Eighteen days out\nWell I think we're America stands and John and you are right\nOn fortunately I might add is that the Senate has moved pretty decisively Republican I don't think that New Jersey will go all the way because it is a operationally democratic state but the other states you cite showing I think are moving in with I think are the wrong direction I\nStill have a chance to pull out in Nevada and Arizona but both of those have deteriorated above it from my perspective and the last\nWeek and I think Arizona in particular but Dean Heller was in a very tight race for reelection the Republican he was ... it was a to point raised a week ago Donald Trump goes in and now he's up by seven and I saw the crowds when I was out there was massive but the crowd outside was even bigger than the one inside\nWell look at it yeah I was gonna say I I've seen the same numbers John please go ahead\nThen sent an absolutely I mean the president is motivating his base and and the Republicans need to embrace up because a nationally when he won he had sixty three million voters and when the the uh uh\nUh when the terms occur we only get Ninety million people usually out might be a little more this time but it won't be as big as the hundred and thirty nine million who showed up in a twenty six team\nSo if you can get to sixty three million Trump voters motivated that they're coming out again which the Kavanaugh hearings did and it appears to have backfired\nParticular Senator Schumer and the and the Democrats in the Senate or if you can motivate those Republicans to come out\nThose Trump voters those independents and Democrats are supporting them they have a very good shot at getting Senate seats and it's probably the only shot they have of winning the house that that in going after Nancy Pelosi the idea of stopping Nancy Pelosi the most popular\nFor let me tell you what I'm saying I Am radio and TV if you vote I don't care what congressional district here and there were four hundred and thirty five congressional districts in this country in any of those districts\nIf you vote for any Democrat you're voting for pillow see if you stay home it's a half a vote for below sea and the same in the Senate if you're going to vote for tester and McCaskill and send them on against Dean Heller and Donnelly and you're going to vote for you know breath and it was just a phony fraud to the people of\nGetting caught on tape being it uh and and not put more Marsha Blackburn in you know you'll get the government you deserve but you're really electing and voting for Schumer because they're gonna they're gonna tow the line with pillows the in the house into the line with Schumer in the Senate that's\nYou know and what do we know that they want they want to impeach the president they want endless investigations\nThey want to raise taxes they're actually saying that they're hiding the impeachment begging Maxine Waters not to say it anymore John Podesta Center for American Progress and saying all Democrats should not talk about immigration for for this they want to open borders sanctuary cities\nSanctuary states that elimination of ice and they want to keep Obamacare that's not that that didn't work for eight years dug and\nWhy why do we lose holding a bit of a leading Indiana is saying oh keep ice you say go the wall and he's saying oh impeachment which\nWhen he was the only reason he surviving and not down by five or six now is because you've got a libertarian in that race that is polling at nine percent you take a libertarian out at the Joe Donnelly is history in Indiana\nSo I wouldn't be so sure on but he is running where Democrats may to be in the center and if we were a centrist party rather than a leftist party with new leadership from top to bottom I think we'd be doing a lot better I think you're probably agree with that Sean\nIs it possible the Democrats hold on to below sea and Schumer how was it ... it is a phenomenon\n... ... all one word answers on those money\nSo you know raising enough money yeah\nSheila that's what it's all about and and and\nAnd he's absolutely right because Shawn that when we asked in September and a national holiday there were ... when we ask voters if the Democrats took over Congress do you want to ask you close your speaker done only twenty three percent of all voters said yes fifty six percent said no\nBut then when we asked them about the fact that you know if you know the chapter that these candidates are accepting millions of dollars to to raise them for their campaigns from Nancy Pelosi or or will they owe their votes to her fifty percent agreed with
