location she can't remember an exact date or a place not\nHe's struggling to know the year in the case of missed Ramirez she's calling other fellow\nStudents from back in the day she's asking them if they remember because she's not sure she remembers a in the case of Julie sweat neck who who made the you know change her story well Brett Kavanaugh gave out red solo cups and he was near the punch bowl and I saw him in a hall maybe not lined up in a hall ...\nWhich is very different from the these sworn affidavit that they had originally laid out the week before I mean you ... if you look at that but in the prosecutor's office what are they going to say\nWell are they going to say a these are all frivolous accusations but uh as far as we know regarding doctor for that one nine or ten witnesses interviewed and people are going to say well there were so many more who didn't weren't interview it's not the number of interviews\nIt's the what they have to say and if it's all cumulative you don't if you don't count the witnesses\nAnd but I think some of those other people as I say now I'm going to want to have their twenty four hours in the sun or you know in the in the same and they're going to want to go to the national Enquirer or something like that but there are no criminal there no criminal cases are no civil case is a good man was confirmed he's now a justice and we need to move on\nLet's talk about the news that we are pretty confident as coming out this week um let me just say this very up to sleep I can that if a top ranking FBI official war to confirm that\nThere was an orchestrated effort among the upper echelon within the the OJ and the FBI to go\nAfter Donald Trump or retribution for the firing of James Comey what would that mean Greg Jarrett\nIt would mean that this was all a hoax the Russia hopes and it wasn't Trump Russia collusion\nAnd that would mean Greg Garrett was right from the get go but yeah I\n... and and yes and the latest information only corroborate the thesis of the book there there wasn't Trump Russia collusion but there was Hillary Clinton Russia collusion she had on her payroll British spy\nA who is using Russian sources and now we've learned a through the interview behind closed doors if James Baker the top uh FBI lawyer\nThey documents were being passed to him from Hillary Clinton lawyer and the ... lawyer\nOr to you know this is astonishing information uh and in fact we've also learned that you know this was part of the vice a warrant to spy on the Trump campaign none of it\nWas corroborated and federal regulations are very clear you may not submit the Fisk\nInformation and evidence that is on corroborated and yet that is precisely what they did and so I agree with you when these documents are classified and the inspector general has it has had enough time to look at them and decide I think they will be explosive\nIs there any way that Rod Rosenstein who signed the fourth buys a warrant we know the basis of bulk of the information in the ... the application John was the unverified\nAre uncorroborated dot CA the political document that Hillary paid for I mean how is it possible that they passed for those that I mean that was and he has to be held accountable for that\nWell let's wait and see when the documents that declassified but the answer to your question does of course uh we talk about the president does not above the law and he's not but certainly knew there was the deputy attorney general but ah I see one thing a little bit differently and maybe we're going to segue into this and that is everything you're talking about\nShould be thoroughly investigated but I think it's separate from what the more people are doing and I think that the Mueller investigation can conclude by showing independently that the president was just not involved in any wrongdoing\nAnd it doesn't have to be one or the ... and not necessarily linked\nWould they would he have an obligation to this is what frustrates me I think that the the mandate was so broad that we ended up going into people's\nYou know main bank loan applications from years gone by to me is just ridiculous the considering where it was supposed to start and where it was supposed to go\nOr would it not lead to an important issue especially of Russian lives were paid for and disseminated to the American people to purposely lied to them before an election and worse than that used to use them five buys applications to spy on an opposition party candidate and then use later to destroy a presidential\nOr a president who was duly elected\nWell a hundred percent and if those things have verified the people involved should be held responsible criminally but I'm saying that the bowler investigation and of itself can conclude\nDevastating to the news media saying Trump's mentally ill\nCreate a\nNew thing that they're trying to pull in a world of insanity will buy your Crump anymore

Christopher Steele and we now know Christopher Steele was bundling information trying to get it to the special counsel Robert Mueller and his team and Andrew Weissmann and Andrew Weissmann knew all about this a leaker Im south anyway here's Bob Goodlatte telling us two weeks ago what does it about\nA we have been very very concerned about the lack of production of some doctors we've gotten a lot of documents and access to more than a million documents for the department of justice from but some of the keys documents including the so called McCabe memos which could very directly bear upon this question of\nA war with Rod Rosenstein doing in that meeting\nA immediately prior to the appointment of Robert Mueller as special counsel\nAnd are these allegations that are in the New York times actually prove a I think that can be a lot of life can be shutdown that gift the documents would've been requesting for quite some time are made public\nSo as a result of that this week I if they're not produced by tomorrow or Tuesday and this week\nWe are going to issue a subpoena or to the Justice Department that expands upon the subpoena we issued earlier this year and include McKay memos\nAnd some other documents that have been requested by us but not far not produce including Peters trucks personnel file some of the struck page a tax ah\nThe ah the the roof or three oh one and some other things All right so joining us now in Studio we welcome back to the man that's in the middle of all of this\nAnd I said do you know what the news is tomorrow you getting bits and pieces of information about what's happened there there there we\nHave people that know that were there that understand that in fact I'm a lot of this was a plan and a scheme of not only a media strategy league strategy but uh to take out a duly elected president\nI'm hearing a lot of big hints coming Sean but similar to the situation where the DNC paid for a lot of lives about me I'm careful to not jump to any conclusions until the real facts around the table so but I I agree what I'm hearing is can be really big\nYou know when all of this I mean to get for Pfizer warrants against you you would think that you must be a really bad guy and now that you've discovered how they obtain this information obtained these warrants against you um you've never been indicted so I guess you're not a threat to the country\nUm I've since learned through previous interviews that when you would go to Russia where your work brought you that you often would be debriefed by our intelligence community and you had a good relationship with them correct absolutely Sean yup yup a bit by intelligence CIA up the guy's absolutely and other intel\nCommunity people for decades yes for decades and I assume they liked you and trust that you\nAbsolutely you know and we would sometimes disagree on things in terms of our various assessments similar to any international relations or security discussions that I Would have back in the Pentagon et cetera but that's you know an honest debate\nRight but okay but they wanted it was never a time where you you met with anybody that wanted you to spy on your country that you love no but I again I'm happy to share\nInsights and ideas just like I Do you know used to at New York university when my students yeah but what we're pretty open guy\nBut so anybody I guess that would regularly go to Russia because they are a hospital regime\nAt and they've been hostile to the United states um we do know that in fact that who does have a network of of\nTheir own deep stayed operatives that are trying to create chaos in America by using social media and et cetera that you don't doubt that\nWell in terms of creating chaos in America if you compare everything that the Russians did versus\nWhat the what the DNC did with their lives and millions of dollars they spent on that you talked about election interference particularly their conspiracy with the deep state you know the OJ FBI CIA now that we're learning all these details much much worse than anything Russia dead at the DNC ever\nGet away with never handing over their computers to the FBI um I don't think I'd get that consideration an option and no one's going to hire a room people what was it like when when did you first know that you were being spied on\nWell I started a I had some hints about it you know people I Know in Washington mentioned it in September of twenty sixteen right around the same time when I started getting phone calls from the New York times CNN Washington Post about these DNC funded lies\nAnd they mentioned to me that there were a Democrat hired operatives\nWorking in Washington who we're paying for these ah these operations and you know soon thereafter dies I found out about the you know the hacking of my emails and wiretapping of my uh\nAnd this is a first happened in August so you found out pretty early\nYeah and actually I ...
