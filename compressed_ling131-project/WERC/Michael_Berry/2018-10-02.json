Tennessee continue to support for Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh Fox is the rabbit board has more line\nAt least the President Trump told supporters in Johnson City the only thing standing between judge Kavanaugh and the Supreme Court is obstruction from the left\nToday today we had\nA the Monday after all the Sunday shows\nAnd I look forward to what happens on the Sunday shows because we can get a couple of things\nIn our minds if you watch the Sunday talk shows meaning meet the press and ABC's This week and Fox News Sunday and even the thing over at CBS that nobody watches and Jake Tapper you can kind of get an idea\nThe talking points are from both sides of the pile\nAnd yesterday Lindsey Graham was doing ... duty getting out there making what I Would consider a primer Fisher case against the Democrats and exposing what they have done the despicable approach they took on trying to block judge Kavanaugh at all costs\nSo I'm a I'm Amazed amazed at what I saw I Lindsey Graham just lifted my heart last week when he made that statement saying what a weasel the Democratic side\nThey all had turned into and how they treated judge Kavanaugh and if you watched the Sunday talk shows I was going to say that it was the greatest episode of meet the press\nEver but I don't know if anybody will get the joke\nYesterday was the single best episode of meet the press that I have ever seen no nobody well it wasn't on last week because uh the Ryder Cup\nMatch the golf match preempted it so that's why was the single greatest episode ever\nBut the the terminology that has shown up in the language of the left when it comes to blocking judge Kavanaugh now let's go over some of the arguments that they have a brought up to block Kavanaugh one of those arguments was\nWell he's going to ah he's going to overturn roe overturn roe v way\nThat was the first one they said we can't have that she's going to overturn roe v weight and then after the meetings\nWith judge Kavanaugh and some of the testimony it seems like you know maybe he's not going to come in with a judicial prejudice and and look to overturn roe v white so they they shifted gears and then suddenly\nAt the end of the hearing process they came up with is accuser and the anonymous accuser that Dianne Feinstein at Santa for six weeks\nAnd so we said wait a minute we're going to question his character from thirty six years ago on we then discovered how many holes there were in the story of professor Ford and then over the weekend after the testimony and I was in DC last week I saw a buck\nOn Thursday we ran into each other to book party for a friend of ours\nI was in D.C to cover the or the hearing and the protests\nAnd then last week when they look like despite all the obstruction than deflection and and all the moves that were being made by the left that judge Kavanaugh was going to push through and we would still have this week long investigation which everybody knew\nEverybody and the dog knew that the Democrats who were going to\nComplain that week was not enough\nThey started shifting the narrative and listen to your friends\nListen to your friends on the left who are saying they're using the phrase the wrong temperament to be a Supreme Court justice he has the wrong temperament\nThis is being said by virtually every single one of the pundits it's being said by the senators the or the Congress people on the left and are bringing it up\nAnd you will hear the parrots from the left on Facebook and Twitter bringing it up he's the wrong temperament and SNL which will get into\nThat so now when after Kavanaugh and ... and everyone's saying he was yelling I'm Sorry he wasn't yelling if that's what you call the yelling you're ignorant and let's not forget a week and a half ago when a judge Kavanaugh was interviewed on Fox News they said oh he's too robotic\nHe's he doesn't have a motion and then when it comes out in defends himself and his family he's called too emotional he doesn't have the right temperament\nThey're even now playing the card if a woman had done what judge Kavanaugh dead\nShe'd be called hysterical and not the good hysterical you know the the crazy hysterical will get into that a little bit but it got to check in with one of the buck family on the phone from Alabama Solomon checking in this evening Solomon welcome to the bucks section and show how are you\nDoing fabulous I'm Glad you're there but now a move the country forward\nOh God Bless you thank you what what part of Alabama my friend\nWell I'm In

fall one vote short\nBecause now the the Democrats\nAnd the senator from Hawaii that once meant to shut up is now asking that they investigated nice throwing incident from Nineteen eighty four and I'm thinking if this is what it now has come down to because the three big cases they want investigated in every case there's no ... operation at all\nNone and and multiple changes in stories\nAt least two of the three cases and yet this this goes on and the lander and the I mean I just described a story about what Julie sweating it was claiming and now she has backtracked\nI don't even know why NBC whatever run an interview like this but they did run it even saying that well she gave us for names to investigate one's dead and the other one has no idea who she is\nAnd the other two people never got back to us so they can't corroborate any of this but they have they can and the lawyer keeps saying they can but she backtrack center story at what point does a man\nYou know how to Brett Kavanaugh to quote you know infamously radon of anyone saying how\nI get my good name back or famously saying you know how does this go off a civil discourse in this country\n... ... okay you know I find it particularly appalling that some of these never Trump hers and are these questions and then the entire democratic leftist apparatus had the audacity\nTo make all these charges in slander and and destroy a Kavanaugh and his family\nAnd have the audacity to suggest that he shouldn't stand up and defend himself and that his dealings with passion indicate\nThat he doesn't have the requisite judicial temperament this are on the United States Supreme court ... hair is righteous indignation his his to our a rant which was totally justifiable than necessary in fact to preserve his position\nRight to they compare that to the twelve years on the vents when he had exemplary judicial temperament which is universally acclaimed I find their uh I find their analysis\nAbsurd on its face and shouldn't even be taken seriously this guy has grand judicial camera I Would hate to have that kind of\nInvestment guy I how was somebody supposed how was somebody supposed to act if they're accused of being a serial gang rapist who drug drug young girls as a matter of course on weekends in high school how I mean what is the proper response he's supposed to go there and the guys I just didn't do that\nYeah Pete in ...\nWho were falsely accused react exactly the way that Brett Kavanaugh did ah when you're agreed you sleep wrong\nYou're angry and he expressed the appropriate to righteous indignation of an innocent man uh but the most important thing he said was I don't question that ah\nChristine Blasey Ford was it some time and at some place sexually assaulted it just wasn't me\nSo he's he's not calling her a liar or what is essentially doing is saying she is mistaken for a variety of reasons she may have conflated to different or individuals\nOr she may be projecting based on you know some uh for some reason that we don't understand a but this was a man who sounded like he was being falsely accused into can damn him for being angry is to ignore human emotion\nOver the garden\nAt ... ... and contrast that with his response on the market in the column interview and I was watching that very concerned I thought he was a flat aspect he was a very much to restrain and I said to myself\nAnd robotic if he doesn't quit holding himself that nobody's gonna blade and then I'm telling you nobody would've believed him if he had done that same thing but he finally somebody a coach them by ... somebody told him quit holding back\nOr he told himself and he was masterful because no matter how many people said why she was ... she was initially bleed well she was credible they they believe that a ... in multiples when he testified in he totally indicated itself it was a mashable report because I think it was thought that it\nBut what ... where does it go from here because um I have no I mean Jeff snowflake is Jeff snowflake who knows what he's running for president now and and headed up the Massachusetts New Hampshire I guess he thinks he's going to beat Donald Trump I I don't think this guy could get Fifteen votes at this point\nThen you have what Susan Collins we have no idea where she's coming down on this although she rightly said was Dianne Feinstein did is unfair to everybody in the process and then you've got Lisa Murkowski I mean she was a a no vote when she was needed on numerous occasions\nYou know I to me there's only one to answer the answer is thirty five days from now and that's when the American people have an opportunity to add more senators from West Virginia from Indiana from North Dakota from Missouri from Florida\nI'm from Arizona Nevada\nAnd but until then you know I don't know what happens I have no faith\nThat anybody really gives a rip that this man's life as been bludgeoned his family has been bludgeoned then there's there's no corroborating evidence for any of it\nBut I think we have to wait to see what happens or in the FBI's report if the investigation finds nope plausible evidence against Kavanaugh this will not only helped to restore his reputation and solidify the integrity of the United States Supreme court at large\nBut it will also give a valid reason\nTo senators like Murkowski and Collins a and Jeff Flake and somebody like Joe mansion and and perhaps a couple of others are who are Democrats to vote in favor of cabinet but I find it amazing to me or that we're holding Kavanaugh\nTo an unfair a standard of his behavior in high school and college as alleged I doubt very many Democrats in the United States Senate could could meet that standard and some of these allegations Julie sweat Nick\nAre preposterous on their faces you point out she's now backtracking NBC issued a statement\nSaying that we can't confirm any of what she's saying and in fact she's deviated now from her sworn affidavit or in her most recent interview with NBC News so you know that\nA claim what do you think are the view which again this statement only come out a week prior and multiple mold I mean she backtracked dramatically on very key points\nAnd when you think of the seriousness of drug in girls in gang raping them and how she well he was near the punch bowl and while he wasn't lined up for the I saw him in the hall and\nNobody else I mean she was saying this was done as a matter of course on weekends at the time we believe that no girl that was raped\nNo boys that saw the drug gang of girls ever told the teacher a parent a law enforcement officer nobody told them\nI find that go ahead Greg answer that you're still no no go ahead David\nWell I I I find that again absurd on its face as you said this is I Do uh the the sweating like while the other sweating allegations that just doesn't hold true and I think following up on what you said\nAnd it doesn't comport with human nature just wouldn't have happened that way but it was truly right there would have been held up eight after one and it for sure after multiple times just doesn't hold true but in response to something you said earlier\nWhat we do taking this in the mid term\nIf the FBI I'm something really damning which I truly that nothing will change the fact that the Democrats have acted in bad day\nEither way and the people know that what they've done is way except that I and ... and I think that the public is is outraged and I think they're going to punish the Democrat and in the mid term what I Do think though is we'd be much better off with a victory\nAnd and the Democrats having acted the way they had then a loss in them having acted the way they have because what Trump stands for is fighting and ultimately winning and we we always blame our losses\nIn the Senate on these ... these are moderates in these questions and the traders I don't wanna say trader literally track with these people who don't have any guts are actually liberals and Republican clothing\nAnd it's true that we still have to win so we we can't give up this fight we got to take it to them and we got to win this fight and blame them anyway in the midterms\nCreate a\nNew thing that they're trying to pour in a world of insanity will buy your crap anymore you get a little laity\nCrazy people who are

lawyer\nSo once it was all out there the fact that NBC has reported this is probably a good corrective or at least where you can see what I think what it was a parent to a lot of people are ... there was nothing to this story\nUm and when she offered a witnesses who could corroborate the stories you just played a one had no idea who she was\nAnother was deceased and to others didn't answer the phone so I'm since the story is already out there and has already gotten it's damage it is a good thing to knock it out\nAll right so let's go through all three cases that the the Democrats now want to expand the investigation they they never wanted a limited investigation they want to know fledged investigation is now being the seventh\nFrom every indication at all I'm reading though that the FBI is moving expeditiously and it seems like they're very close to probably completing their work\nBut if we start with professor Ford professor Ford claimed that these four people were at the party nobody remembers any such party that she describes and the one person that was supposedly was an eye witness\nTo the alleged abuse in her case um was mark judge and he said absolutely it didn't happen and then if you look at the ... if you look at the ... case this was in the New Yorker\nWell the New York times couldn't print the story and and they actually brought up the fact that after calling

Capitol and uh I assume it's going to happen at some point this week we have any any timetable idea\nProbably don't know yet but uh I think that's correct as so here with the agreement or with our colleagues\nAnd Chris Coons was never part of the agreement he's a Democrat from Delaware L like risk but he was never part of this agreement\nWhat compromise has been reached for Chris Coons he is voting no he's asking for the investigation to continue around whether or not he's been honest about his drinking habits to Chris Coons is a non factor here Lisa Murkowski Susan Collins Jeff Flake expressed a desire for the FBI\nTo talk to the witnesses around the Ford allegation and Mr ... and the fall and incredibly incredible lead within a week I think the FBI is about finished everybody can look that report for themselves and said this changed anything I Hope we don't move the goalpost Geoff oh did you sing committee\nWith the understanding that he wanted to see what the FBI found about these accusations and hopefully get this done this week\nAll right let's talk about this agreement because it was supposed to be limited in scope and now it is expanded out further we now see the\n... ah your your colleague on the Senate Judiciary committee the great senator from the state of Hawaii who wants men by the way to sit down and shut up yeah which was a pretty outrageous statement but anyway a senator Hirono now is saying she wants to know the FBI\nInvestigation into the quote I throwing report yeah yeah\nThat's where we're at our so my dad owns a bar\nAnd so are throwing I says like a good day in a bar so uh the bottom line is that solve a bunch of BS and she's not part of the agreement she voted and she's the one that said the goal was to delay\nOr the hearing long enough to get into the mid term soon and I have a Democrat replace\nA Justice Kennedy in twenty twenty she said that not one media outlet fed ask her what did you mean but they're agreement I just outlined it was a the three witnesses that Dr Ford named mess for ... or any a credible leads within that world of FBI will follow 'em and that's it and we're going to vote this week\nOkay let's talk a little bit about your on the program last night on on Hannity and I thought you dropped a huge bomb shell and I was asking you look I have no idea how Jeff lakes going to end up voting in this\nI have no idea what Lisa Murkowski is going to do I have no idea what Susan Collins is going to do or they are your colleagues maybe you have some more insight than I have but\nTo me they're the ones that met privately with Joe Manchin and they decided on this course now that it's an FBI investigation but\nRight close to be limited in scope is now\nExpanded out into other allegations but it'd be a fall one vote short you up with a pretty interesting and thoughtful idea that I kind of like\n[noise] well I think we've got the votes and then some but here's the question does the Republican Party abandon Brett Kavanaugh do we legitimize\nThe way he was treated if the Senate is it forty nine what I Would like to see happen is to appeal the verdict of the Senate and the November election\nAnd take it to some of the states and see if the people in those states agree with their senator about Brett Kavanaugh the swap\nWould abandon Kevin ... the traditional way of doing business is if he fell one vote short just pull the plug\nHe's never quit I don't want to quit on him so I think Trump might be different I think Trump would say listen this man it's been abused I'm not given up on hand less have an election to see if the vote in the Senate really represented the Trump states were Democrats a rain\nWell I mean this is the thing I mean we have people like Joe Donnelly he's a no he said already Claire McCaskill's know already as a matter of fact yes most Democrats wouldn't know no matter who Donald Trump ... they've already against ... yeah All right so now what is going to happen to Bill Nelson of Florida and Joe Manchin and\nHeidi Heitkamp and Joe Donnelly and\nWell a smart question Martha mix Sally is a great candidate for the Republicans in Arizona most served their country with honor and distinction I Hope she wins um we certainly could use a win out in Nevada or do you think this impacts the race and do you actually think you're going to get the votes and why do you think you get the votes\nWell number one I think we're going to get the votes because Jeff voted in committee yes I don't believe the FBI is going to find anything a relevant to this limited investigation that would show that\nThat are ... for its claims are more credible and that there's anything new about Brett Kavanaugh in terms of the investigation I Would hope they would stay consistent with this vote I think the other two Collins and Murkowski or friends they're warning death the to check the committee's homework I get that\nThat will be done here shortly but you're asking the hypothetical\nI Can't imagine how we would explain to the Republican Party that we gave up on Brett Kavanaugh because for one vote short when a lot of the states that led to that vote being short Trump won I Do not believe North Dakota once a highly had camp to vote no\nI don't agree with you\nI Am so this is why you have an election appeal the verdict of the Senate if we have to to the people of of the country in November\nLet me ask you if you'd spoken to the reds they Trump state Democrats that are up for reelection if you talk to any of\nThem doing it right now\nUh so you mean you're you're communicating Hannah I'm not sure if they're all Hannity listeners and viewers beyond that\nI doubt if they're lifting I think we're fine but here's the dilemma that you that this process has put us in this is about the teacher the judiciary\nThe states couldn't be higher is about the reputation of one of the finest man I Know it's about who would come forward after this debacle is about sending a tone and the standard that will destroy the ... and eat the Senate alive\nSo I Know President Trump pretty well I think we've got the votes and then some but I think he's a different kind of politician that he wouldn't let the system get off the hook that\nIf we had to as a last resort where one vote short let's say hypothetically we would take this issue to the ballot box in about thirty something days thirty five we can\nI find that extra vote that way we would have a good nominee or have the lights salvaged have a process uh saved and the people finally get to speak up here I think we're fine but you asked me a question and I thought about this yesterday\nSaid if Brett Kavanaugh is on the ballot in some of these states I think it changes the election you see in North Dakota there's a poll out today the number one issue in North Dakota is I'm Brett Kavanaugh's nomination is far ahead of anything else sixty to twenty eight people in North Dakota North Dakota support Brett Kavanaugh\nOh it's fascinating to me that the Democratic leadership is showing no support or comprehension or understanding of what their colleagues from states that are not New York and California have to go through in terms of reelection but the reality is\nThat I Would even argue that if they do vote for cabinet oh it's only an election year conversion and they're only doing it because if they don't the people in their state will throw him out but they'll probably go right back to being a party line vote would Schumer at the end of the\nDay [laughter] [laughter] well you know I'm I'm not a psychologist or political scientist I don't care is like you know I'm a Baptist I don't care how you find Jesus as long as you do you know if you can figure out that Brett Kavanaugh is highly qualified and these accusations have crumbled\nAre good for you and now here's the point this has become the most despicable thing I've seen in Washington and as saying a lot it changed the face of the judiciary forever if we condone it so it's not a complicated issue for me if we follow vote short\nOr less take this to the ballot box and see what happens\nLet me ask you about this whole process now we've gone through and and I do think the Republicans and you know I'm pretty honest broker I'm pretty critical of Republicans when they're wrong I Do think that they they have handled this with the seriousness the charge deserves\nA them ... [noise] yes no I think they handled it properly because these are serious allegations but she identified and and look I won't go through the ... the entire\nWe don't need to we don't need to re try this case I made I don't mind you've made up your mind there five accusations that have are are are not verified or just made up not true outrageous so it's not about Cabot all\nBut to have on them is that this is the environment we live in senator and I warn those audience on radio and TV every two and four years\nIf you're a Republican or conservative and you're running for office you're going to be called a racist or sexist appoint a massage the homophobic Xena ...
