the notion that this is an attack\nOn an independent press okay well he would write for the Washington Post but Saudi Arabia doesn't have an independent press at\nAll not not even a little bit okay there there is not an independent presence out here people say oh buckets been getting a little better news yeah whatever\nTurkey doesn't have an independent press in fact the country workers Shelby was from what we see from what we believe murdered is one of the worst in the world when it comes to press freedom not Saudi Arabia turkey bad when it comes to press beer freedom\nSo when we say it's an attack on a free press yeah we live in a world where the free press is the exception not the rule lotta countries have all kinds of constraints on what can be printed what can be said what can be shared\nLots of countries\nAnd even countries that you think of as having a free press maybe some of the western European states for example they have\nRestrictions based on you know hate crime

believe that he might have been taken out and body pieces not sure that they wouldn't take the watch at that point but before leaving reality Pompeo told reporters at the Saudi leaders made no exception and on who they would hold accountable\nAnyway so now according to the British newspapers are saying Turkish official Turkish officials have a recording of blah blah blah and that had to pack up and down the apple watch and you have some of the other people saying it's highly unlikely to show that you could have broadcast signal from his apple watches it was too far for Bluetooth

agree with me that all signs point to the Saudis assassinating murdering this guy in a a barbaric way that's what I'm thinking\nYou know the ruin in warfare or report from the battlefield must be questions or I think this man is that\nWhether or not these audio tapes exist is another question but it's absolutely certain that this individual was caught between two nations that wants to dominate the Sunni Muslim world\nThat's the new often I'm an avid wand regime of turkey and the price of Islam Saudi Arabia and this man was caught in the middle\nHowever however this isn't the fake news we've got to be accurate this man was a journalist wasn't in America that trying to spin it was a foreign national read them and it was a common faith that you wrote commentary\nAnd he has a long decades long history of factor the Muslim Brotherhood and there's also related to the figures Arab um see a lot of the ... century ... so all of these things are total statement for factual\nWhat do you think a missed the hop and it's been a while my ah my friend Dan is good to have you back I Know this has been your life and your business for so many years\nUm my gut is pretty clear on this uh I think this man was murders and the most evil Bruce Bruce brutal way possible\nAnd I think that the president as wise knowing that we're going to get to the truth no there's no doubt we'll go and we're going to have the truth rushing to that point is not smart in my opinion\nYeah I I agree with you uh look there's a lot of evidence that we have already we nailed it Fifteen Saudis\nTraveled on the Gulf

into a box assuming that I Believe\nThat the Saudis are involved and whether it goes straight to the top I don't know the crown prince says denying it I'm kind of having a hard time buying that myself but\nKnowing that they're a very different country but\nNow it gets complicated because also the Saudis the Egyptians Jordanians the Israelis the United states the Emirates they're all fighting against the Iranian had you had money in the region and their quest for nuclear weapons and the instability that would cause the entire world\nUm I Know everybody Dr Gorka would like to say that okay we're cutting off all ties with Saudi Arabia were done where this with that\nUm I think there's there will be consequences severe\nConsequences the president said um but it gets a little rough or what do you do if you're also trying to battle another enemy I mean the United states did partner with our arch enemy is the former Soviet Union to defeat or not the Islam in World War two\nYeah absolutely I mean you you don't make perfect the enemy of the good\nGeopolitics as like politics itself domestically it is the author of the possible ... the um over the perfect I'm On the truth is wrong we have

but you're absolutely right this is talk of eight\nI Wish we would've leverage did in the last eight years when Obama was president without knowing that gays and lesbians or killed were routinely and

[noise]\n\n[noise]\nAnd it was mostly we have at the top of the hour James\nO'Keefe his latest undercover video by Claire McCaskill it's even worse than what we thought yesterday you know think about his negotiations with little rocket man and my fire and fury my button is bigger than yours or negotiating that NATO fair share when we pay Seventy two cents of every dollar for defense\nMostly of our Western European allies or\n... you know demanding better more fair trade deals with our Western European partners with Canada with Mexico people don't understand is if you don't threaten to pull out of a deal\nAnd you don't threaten terrorists you're never gonna get the deal and nobody ever thought in the past ... asked for these things and the fact that he not only does it then wins\nThen the American workers all across the country doing better and that that's what brings us to this election and I'm thinking I don't see any good ideas from the Democratic party that's going to improve the lives of Americans make us more prosperous secure I don't care but I Want I Want this country must first\nHe also did something that the mainstream media is not reporting\nOn the twenty fifth of July\nThe declaration of a cease fire in Europe was absolutely brilliant Sean because he was able to\nGet pressure on China from Europe he's affective Lee and people are really reporting is pretty joined forces with the Europeans the Europeans also have these trade issues and he's treated ... grievances with China\nAnd so what the president did is rather than fighting a war to directions you declare cease fire in Europe he knows he has to deal with them but they're applying maximum\nPressure on China and I'm going to make a prediction right if you're on your radio show ... owned by me back I think you get to trade deals with China before you get a shot and if not by the end of the year it's a very early in\nThe ... let me tell you why because when he did when he applied these sanctions and tariffs on China China what happened there economy took a thirty five percent dive\nSo that would tell me by now they're probably and I don't know for sure but I'm assuming they're banging on his door begging that they can get those back\nOf course yeah seven percent hit to the currency thirty five percent it to the stock market\nAnd their their economies grinding down and uh we know about China is they need to create twenty five million jobs that you're\nJust to break even shot and so uh if if if the locomotion of growth and progress is stalled uh it'll be cataclysmic for that political system so I Believe they will be at the table or maybe they don't get it done at the G ... which is at the end of November but I bet you they get it out shortly thereafter\nOr because we both know the president's personality he's hitting very very core of but he's a very fair guy and he'll hit the intersection of fairness with the Chinese government are and what is best for the American working families so\nUh and that's why it was all ... and by the way you know I was ... doing a lot of traveling around the country I was in Detroit last night I spoke three or four hundred people\nI'm Down here in Miami Today and the whisper rate is up you know that whisper rate we saw it on people that they don't like Trump but then they pull you aside as his day Sean by the way I happen to really like\nOtherwise isn't that what this group there is an intensity of his supporters and there are people that will never tell anybody who that they support them but they're standing back up that ... listen I get it I Love it a All right so we're going to have you\nBack next week I'm you wrote the book it's I'm reading it now it's phenomenal us pulled from the blue collar

Mike\nUnless they do go deep deep deep down into like finance which most people just you are right and like the people that do that or are we was going to revolve for anywhere else we are\nRight now so yeah so you are and so it keeps them keep the Planned Parenthood name off of the training but we still get to know\nI I Love\nI Love I Love it's great when it works for [laughter]\nSo\nI'm Still trying to wrap my head around that that a shame ECOWAS talking about them and then I Planned Parenthood won't donate to us oh understanding why I don't get\nI think the thing with like Obama not endorsing any red state Democrats it's still like it does not Democrat is it coming off to like Dallas man yeah I think it's like a topic that's like not too far left to try to get the ... voters\nPublished do not support and more and right yeah yeah one of like not not like\nThe other means of support and get the money they just don't directly get the money from there like\nA basically we're still going to protect\nAm I trying to tell you one hundred percent we I I mean these are the kind of you to that I don't think I could work for class she doesn't mind how many how many of the big deal for me to\nRichardson tells our journalists to Planned Parenthood goes through quote other means to support and give the money unquote\nOr why are so\nYeah so I didn't know that name as hot as hell just on [noise] but we want where like they are abortion I mean yeah so and like\nI Know she gets a lot of money from wanting less I'm just like that and guns are my two biggest issues yeah no I think she has stayed pretty strong on them just like the name brands\nAre joining us now he is the head of project beret toss a project ... the founder and the c._e._o. James O'Keefe you know you are hated by people because of what you do you they I'm ... I mean I've talked to people on the left they you drive the nuts\nI mean you give them fits of fury that I thought only I could do\nIs try to see things just auditor discussed and I think one of the things that they're ceding most about that what they're most\nHating right now is the fact that both Claire McCaskill and Phil Bredesen neither Senate candidates one of them as the United States Senate or had been forced to respond to these you know all over the local media coverage you mean it's it's it's critical mass in Tennessee in Missouri their their their local TV stations are calling me\nAnd the D.C journals do not want to talk about this in fact I just got to have like a Washington Post he's tweeting at me and he's and he's saying well you know she's been public about her some of these position I said what about other things she's saying here but she hasn't been public about so they they very much hate Sean for good reason\nWell listen I when you expose fraud what this is now exposed as something that I've been pointing out for a while we have Maxine Waters on tape saying they keep telling me not to say it and Everytime they tell me I'm going to say it anyway impeach forty five impeach forty five\nThen we see the center for American Progress warning every single Democrat running for all of us don't talk about immigration we know we know we won't open borders and eliminate ice but don't tell the people the truth about what you're really gonna do don't tell them what you have is a massive\nFraud propaganda light campaigning being perpetrated by a party that has lost any sense of moderation that has no agenda that they're willing to talk about the ... that is a really scary\nScenario for the country and for people that ... that's the only way they can win is ally and ... who they are\nThat's what the stories about these red state Democrats have been on your show now uh this is the fourth or third third video between Tennessee in in Missouri\nAnd one of the staffers agrees that McCaskill quote essentially has to lie to get elected and this is not just one staffer these are staffers throughout her office hiding\nHiding and masking the source of contributions one staffer says it's acting beautiful it's great when it works for us not against us to take the money ... indirect means\nIn order to I guess appeal to moderates as a front page New York times story today about how these pro life pro gun Democrats are shrinking\nConstituency in Missouri the Democratic party have voted these people out but McCaskill still have to appear moderate so that she can get elected so it's it is a truism that in order to get elected in a state of Missouri are kind of see you basically have to mislead voters to get elected as a Democrat and that's what these stories and cover\nYou know the thing is to me um I think we the American people had it when\nThe Democratic party a band in any sense of due process under the law equal application under our laws you know immediately I Believe her but they also said the minute the cabin all was announced we are going to oppose them any way by any means necessary\nAnd then went all the the the allegations are getting more severe more severe and everyone's saying well I Believe her not even want to hear from judge Kavanaugh presumption of innocence at all and when corroborating so-called corroborating stories fell apart they still didn't care\nAnd I think the American people are watching that we have a story out today\nWhere you've got these ads are his middle class of vendors attacking to Minnesota GOP candidates are assaulted one is a woman a name as state representative Sarah Anderson punch by an anarchist trying to stop him\nFrom taking her campaign side\nI mean this this is now the Democratic party and you're exposing it and the ... and yeah you're going to be hated but I think ... shining a light on truth I thought this was the stuff that sixty minutes used to do\nWell undercover McCaskill statement McCaskill Claire McCaskill issued a videotape state which is unbelievable and they play a little bit on your show last night and she said that now that I quoted she says well it started with Josh Hawley arrested her opponent would be part of fraudulent embedding someone in my campaign first of all I categorically unequivocally deny\nThat he does not work for me he does not work with me I've never spoken to any of these candidates I stay\nAway from candidates I investigate candidates but she is one on TV Sean Claire McCaskill just falsely stated that Josh was involved in is the attorney general Missouri was involved in this and then she says three times I committed fraud will will buy what recording the people being honest that's brought\nIn their own their own their own or it's not\nMy words I'm not the one who said quote get over it this is a direct quote for staffers next to roast about how she's going to impeach trumpet you can tell the moderates to get over it after she gets elected that's their words and she's calling me a fraud stir for telling the truth to the American people it's the job of investigative reporting\nTo expose the truth\nAnd and I think she didn't have to respond to her response because it's filled with lies and innuendo an accusation\nI'm just glad that you were able to get all of this out than before the election um why do I suspect that there's probably going to be more tape other candidates well I have known you now what for a decade or more\nThat's right yeah I mean ... you know am I Am oh a pun intended Missouri now you know my ... next\nTo release the candidate of the time he gets to the United states senators and their candidates opposing them responding to our investigative work we're lying in their responses were sort of using the ... tactics against the ... to get the reaction and use the reaction in the reaction to the reaction\nWe have two reactions now and we're going to the next state will be releasing another video early next week and a very very a battleground state [noise] same theme Sean ... they have to lie and then once they get elected to the new deal bait and switch through\nAnd do what they actually intend to do and it's it's just on videotapes not my word stopped my claims are not giving you unsubstantiated\nNot a lot of people watch it to themselves and they can decide people are pretty smart um oh James O'Keefe is with us founder and the c._e._o. project very tossed dot com and\nThe videos are up there and you can check 'em out yourself a boat Claire McCaskill and her staff and they'll British ... and his staff and now he's telling us there's more to come we'll come back we'll take a quick break we'll come back and continue eight hundred nine four one Sean auto free telephone number will make a quick stop\nA there is an opponent for Pocahontas Elizabeth Warren Jeffs deal and uh does that that that race now need re evaluation by the people of Massachusetts will get to that\nAnd your calls a eight hundred nine four one shown as a number will continue\n[noise]\nGay and partying and investigating the stories that mattered EU\nAmerica now with ... this evening is seven on news radio Nineteen sixty W we are see\n[noise] [noise] well if the school staff are saying that it would have to actually lie to get elected and his staff are saying this in the aftermath contributions acting beautiful take the money and directly at the moderates don't know\nIt's it's just more of the same Sean in other states other staffers other candidates for Senate it mating and once they get elected in the Senate than they can do the things they can't talk about and this is not a left right issue it's not my allegation it's their words\nThese videos having an enormous impact Sean ... the thing and misery you need to know is that they don't want to talk about these things this is so damaging that did that she sang band semi automatic rifles in Missouri it's so Danny\nI ... I think that's damning but the worst part of this to me is they will say they'll purposely manipulate and lie to the very people they want to represent I mean we have a similar situation I Know you're not involved in this but with with Christ in cinema out in Arizona oh\nNo I'm not involved in it and um [laughter] and maybe one of the states coming um\nWell let me ask you have to be involved in Nevada are you involved in Montana you involved in North Dakota and Indiana are you involved in Florida are you involved in\nAll states you just mentioned except one [laughter] well we we got a lot coming shot and in fairness to the stories you want to get the local media is covering them and and that's really critical because nobody outside of these states votes in those states\nFor the local media is covering it the candidates are reacting Claire is reacting I'm getting calls right now my phone from local TV stations so it's it's going to be a very big couple of weeks Sean\nWell thank you for sharing it with us thank you for what you're doing I frankly think you're you're performing a great service for the people in the states but\nThere's I don't think they understand\nWhat a spectacular conniving level these people are lying and and misrepresenting who they really are and I think it's Iowa opening and thank you for doing it and thanks for taking the heat on the other side of the joys due to James O'Keefe project baritone dot com you thank you\nMy project ... dot com Hannity dot com oh All right so I didn't think my friends my pillow would ever be able to outdo themselves or they've created the my pillow mattress copper\nAnd what you do is you put it on top of your mattress and it's like you're floating on the air and yes it helps you sleep better it is the greatest invention I've ever had on top of my pillow itself\nNow it has three layer designed one is my pillow phone for their support transitional fall to help relieve pressure points and also the ultra saw patented temperature regulating cover you lay on the show like wow I don't want to move I Want to sleep\nAnyway comes with a ten year warranty you're going to love my pillows topper ... it comes to the ten year warranty is washable ... made in the usa backed by Mike sixty they unconditional money back guarantee\nAnd right now because you listen to the show you're going to say thirty percent it's going to change your life just use the ... when you go to my pillow dot com you say thirty percent called eight hundred nine one nine six zero nine zero and Mike is also going to throw into standard my pillows absolutely free\nNow when you add the mattress popper pillows it's habit my pillow dot com eight hundred nine\nOne nine six zero nine zero promo called Hannity take a break we'll come back is there a shot that Elizabeth Warren could lose her Senate seat in Massachusetts that's next\n\nFarsi dynasty Rapaport\nSecretary of state Mike Pompeo returning to Washington After visiting turkey and Saudi Arabia to learn more about the disappearance of journalists ...\nHe walked into this Johnny constantly ... two weeks ago and never reemerged the secretary says he's giving the Saudi and Turkish government space to complete their investigations before the U.S decides on its response\nBoxers Richardson at the state department Turkish authorities believe ... is dead the Saudis denying knowing what happened to him a caravan of Honduran migrants pressing on toward the U.S despite President Trump's threat to cancel aid to Honduras last night the\nPresident expanded that threat to include El Salvador and Guatemala saying if this caravan is allowed to travel to their country\nQuote all us payments to them will stop currently the U.

George W. Bush\nUm when Elizabeth Warren talked about the criminal justice system being racist front at that time she got so many people angry there's a lot of families out there that care about community safety in here she is insulting law enforcement so this is a different race and I think most people are expecting and I think now that she's made it very clear that she wants to run for the White House and twenty twenty\nUp but uh I I Will tell you that that's pretty popular TV for a lot of people and there's a lot of fun and I think you know the fact that he's talking about positive results and that we're better off than we were two years ago it's a pretty good message why would the media want that when they were in the\nPockets of people that the slant solidly Democrats solidly socialist left\nAbsolutely I totally agree with you I think I think that would I think I'm doing that would be would bring people out of the woodwork though because people people would watch it addressed the nation just an idea\nWell I think it's a good one I like it and maybe should just do it on cable because you know everyone forgets out this was the most surprised remember Linda when we're battling you know that weirdo pervert late night host what's his name Jimmy Kimmel\nAnd I've heard of Howard Stern talking about it I Know that he's friends with Jimmy Kimmel and his wife he battling Hannity Hannity's on cable you know Jimmy is on a network ... panda they probably wants to be on a network that I've always known stern is a genius when it comes to media I ...
