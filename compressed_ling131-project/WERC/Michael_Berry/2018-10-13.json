Fox News pastor Andrew Brunson the American legion of house arrest in Turkey now in Germany President Trump talked about his release at a rally near Cincinnati earlier tonight\nAnd turns out it was a reminder of what we face on the left but I think that the Kavanaugh debacle for the left was really just\nIn a sense the last straw that has pushed them over the edge but they were already heading in that direction and these these symptoms of the mass delusional leftist that are manifesting themselves with these mad a masters\nIn these mobs coming together and screaming and yelling and this mob mentality\nAnd on and the really\nThe lack of ability on the media's part just set the narrative the way they want you in the air rage which comes out now more on there I think it's because they realize Trump is winning\nHe still winning they haven't been able to take him out of office with this Russia collusion investigation nonsense\nThey haven't been able to sing came with Republicans or you know anybody who's persuadable anybody who's open minded about this with all the different allegations of the twenty Fifth Amendment and uh the investigations of his\nFinances I mean the New York times did I think it was a twelve thousand word essay on Trump's taxes stretching back to his father's taxpaying practices in the seventies\nI think there's some stuff about him in the sixties in there I mean that they they went way way deep into was and I read this piece I thought to myself this is this is kind of like the scene and John Nash showed that John Nash hasn't a Beautiful Mind when he's got all the crazy riding on all this stuff all the formulas in the wall and you and then you realize oh\nThis person has a problem the media has a problem\nCrump maybe has caused it but they're the ones with the problem\nThey are no longer objective in all of this and now it looks very likely that the Republicans are going to keep the Senate and they have a fighting chance and people are saying it's a twenty five percent chance I'm telling you I think it's more like fifty fifty right now that the GOP can hold the house\nAnd what will liberal save them and they really going to all of a sudden you know to discover that oh Russia manipulated this election true is that going to be the play it might be but I don't think they have any real belief that will that will stick to that will work\nWhat do they tell themselves now I Know that they comfort themselves with the constant refrain of Trump is a racist Trump is a is a a sexist sexual assault or a a traitor a crazy person all these they say all these things but what do they tell themselves\nAbout the politics of this country when the president that they say is the worst president of all time which is a pretty common thing you hook you'll hear on the left the worst president while time unfit for office should be removed from office\nBecause of his his temperament and his judgment in the way that he is doing his job they say he should be removed for that reason\nAnd it turns out he was doing a really good shop economy is kicking butt\nAnd I'm here in for a lot of people who know and this is their life's work has studied is that even though there's this sense right now oh maybe we have what Greenspan would have called irrational exuberance of oh my gosh things are so great they're just gonna keep getting better and better\nSome people have that a lot of people have the oh it must get worse it must get work will get worse but they've been saying that as you get worse last Eighteen months and it has it\nSo what do they tell themselves what did they come away with\nAnd this then brings me to the outrage mobs anti ... and the uh\nYou know the the the women's march ... creatures in the anti Kavanaugh hordes than the the stalkers because that's really what we're talking about these stalkers\nWho are activists that try to find Republicans to harass them to frighten them to scare them although we had a Republican who put a block slap on some hallway stalkers today we'll get to him later\nBig high five\nBut this is increasingly looking like the last is going to have to live and Trump's America for many many years to come and I don't know how they're going to to handle that I don't know how they're going to deal with this is why I've been so worried recently about the possibility of real violence\nBecause they've already gone to the mat they've already taken the dial to eleven they are doing everything everything conceivable\nIn terms of propaganda and organizing and media effort and they're doing everything they can just stop this political movement that Trump is a part of from from reaching its its intended goals\nFrom doing what it has set out to do from the beginning and they can't stop it\nAnd I think that what set in with many of them is it's not just a a panic but also a sense of helplessness\nIn the last must be telling themselves we thought we were going to get this guy gone with the ... we thought we were going to get this guy gone with any number of different ploys and if we couldn't at least get I'm gone at least we could we could stop him and have you know Americans turn on him and his base turn on him\nAnd the opposite is happening I\nAm more confident in this president and what he's doing and his yes his message as well as his policies with each passing month what does that mean for the left how do they try to rebound from this how do they try to come up with some counter narrative\nI don't hear it yet all I hear as rage annoys an anger and if this continues on if they don't have any real counterpoint to counter punch for what Trump is doing\nI worry about what their next move will be because I noticed it will not be rational and it will not be in the best interests of this country that we know for sure\nI I tend to think that we could be facing some kind of October surprise along the lines of what they did with cabin on the very end of that nomination process\nIt's not enough that they don't have anything they'll manufacture something they will create whole claw some means of trying to take take the the Trump Administration down a few notches at least enough\nThat they have a successful mid term election I Can't tell you I Know what it is I don't\nBut I get the feeling that they must be cooking something up because they they never give you any sense despite the economy as strong as it is despite all the different things you could point you that that has happened last Eighteen months just
