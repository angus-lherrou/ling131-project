I think it will get worse before it gets better because I think we're going to keep losing and I think\nThat they they are so alienated from most Americans that all they have left is this kind of a new electric violence\nA which in the end I think turns people off it's it's it's it's it's also a little scary because it says Steve ... proved when he was shot um [noise]\nYou know if you're conservative and you're in public life there's a certain danger level now that is totally on American and that comes entirely from the left\nYou know the thing is that's missing and and you figure it out I mean I watch the whole process when you became speaker it didn't happen overnight it started with a series of\nVideotapes about running to transform America and it was called renewing American civilization when did you first put those tapes out\nWe first began working on it in uh Ninety two and did the first wave of tapes in Ninety three and then the second wave after I was ...\nAnd it was all based on ideas culminating in a contract with America and I I think people forget because\nYou know we've had waves of conservatives maybe if you want to start with Gary Barry Goldwater that's one it\nWasn't successful but it was the beginning Reagan's victory in Nineteen eighty and then subsequently in eighty four that was another big victory and and obviously the Republicans taken over Congress for the first time in forty years with your contract and I'd argue Donald Trump is the fourth leg\nAnd that is a I ... everything he is doing in terms of governance is conservative even even threatened trade wars they're not\nThey're not materialized because that's never been as attention his intention to for better trade deals freer fairer deals\nYou know I think look I I think he has the fourth a cycle if you will of moving back from a left wing America and we've been gaining momentum and gaining clarity\nAnd there's often tell people you know we didn't have Leonard Leo and the federalist society with so many good\nSolid conservative lawyers that we could fill up all these judicial appointments uh and that that's just a huge advantage and they're all grows out of\nWhat is now if you go back to Goldwater of fifty four year movement um but I think it's also coming to a crisis because\nTrump so clearly articulate each a pro American pro work ethic pro patriotism policy that he drives the left crazy\nAnd I think as a result the left which has gotten more extreme they haven't modulated they haven't come back to the center they've decided that their job is to beat up and intimidate those of us who disagree with him and and the and I think that just further isolate some\nSo their agenda is pretty clear they get back the house they wanna teach men they want the crumbs back the largest tax cutting history which is obviously having a big impact on the economy we you know all the record unemployment numbers the varying demographic groups that are doing better than they've ever done\nUm they also want open borders but John Podesta said don't talk about immigration they want to eliminate ice they want to keep Obamacare\nI'm an endless investigation I Would add to that I don't hear one positive thing that's going to create one job or make this country one bit safer not nothing that they're running on just that and we hate Trump that's it\nWell I think that's right and that's partly because if they tried to tell us honestly what they stand for there will be defeated so badly that they just they know that they can't afford to be honest but but I think I mentioned the send your TV show last night I think that we're about to be a magic moment\nIn American history and I think the two words that captured in my mind our cabin all and caravan I think Kevin all the way they treated him of the viciousness the smears\nThe character assassination the childish behavior by US Senators in Senate meetings\nI think all that came together to really re galvanized conservatives and I think this caravan coming up from Guatemala should be a major focus of Republicans for the next couple of weeks\nBecause it makes clear\nThe argument about whether or not we have a right to be a sovereign country or whether in the Feinstein below sea San Francisco Democrat tradition we have an obligation to open up our border to anybody who can get finance\nAnd remember these three thousand people I agree with Laura Ingraham is asking the question who's paying for this these three thousand people probably cost Twenty one million dollars to move\nFrom Guatemala highly four thousand people now grown to ... bike among and us border crossings but you know Nancy Pelosi actually said we are not funding the border wall\nAnd that just as it seems to be an appendage to Donald Trump manhood I mean you know imagine anything similar said about any woman by any Republican or conservative\nI mean it's outrageous the double standard and then so flagrant but you know we're we're already have paid between healthcare education criminal justice we've already paid trillions of dollars for people that didn't respect our laws and sovereign states costs the American people\nA fortune and by the way the people of California and now we're going to be paying for their health care for free no questions asked\nBy the way we have in Georgia a democratic nominee for governor Stacey Abrams a who are clearly favors allowing illegal immigrants to vote a says that she doesn't want to draw any distinction\nBetween the people who are American citizens and people who came here illegally um and that's that's sort of typical Gavin Newsom candidate for governor of California\nWho openly says he wants to have government run health care and make it available to every illegal immigrant who can get to California I mean\nThe Democratic party is becoming the party of the galaxy the party of breaking go all the point you made earlier and a party which believes that can't win was legal American votes and so it's got to try to find some way to turn around the system and it's an amazing thing to watch develop\nOr we're going to get Newt Gingrich has predicted Nineteen days till election day I'll also his take on the show gave it looks like murder and who's responsible and how the president should handle this ah as it involves ...\nTo beat Nazi is that's right and I think sometimes you just said you know we have taken steps against Russia in concert with the British\nOver killing ... trying to poison several people but we didn't we didn't go for sure I think we may have to take significant steps here and sanctions some people and block some people from coming to the U.S and I think frankly a crown prince had better clean this up or he will not be allowed back in the U.S for a long time\nI missed the speaker thank you for being with us we got to take a break by David shown and Carter Page will join us as the deep state gate gets a little deeper eh my buddy Steve do see we're going to get a lot of your calls and we have the other news of the day and what do we do about the caravan Nineteen days out of election day\nWe're in Palm Beach Florida

he understood took place in that meeting between Andrew McCabe and Rod Rosenstein where Mr Rosenstein talked about actually recording the president of the United states so he needs to come in and answer questions and like I said if it takes a subpoena that's exactly what should be a shoo\n[noise] so you you were in a deposition with with James Baker the first one and you're going to end with him this upcoming Thursday what do you want to get from James Baker this week\nWell first of all remember who said this is this is the FBI chief counsel all kinds of things flow through him so when he
