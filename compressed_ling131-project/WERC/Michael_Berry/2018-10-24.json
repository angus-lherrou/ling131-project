confrontation because he couldn't take it ... it would be good for people on both sides\nIt'll encourage people to follow our laws of respect our country and our borders and our sovereignty and at that point people go through the process legally and I'm not saying that we don't let people in from other countries I don't really care where you come from you know you got to show you were able to

little bit more between how long they held her over\nAnd the sad thing is and she was in isolation she was alone we couldn't talk to her even it was just horrible for her\nAnd she was cordoned off we went to the hospital they wouldn't let us and we couldn't see her because they didn't know if it was anthrax right than what was that if it was ...\nI mean as with all my heart I Can't stand CNN's reporting I think it's fake news but I I feel sorry for the people over CNN Today I've lived through this\nAnd I and Linda on a scale of one to ten the anthrax incident being a one how many tens of we had in the course of my career that you know about\nI mean you know we got ten death threats today via letter yeah\nBut I mean and it's just a horrible thing there was one particular person at another

through and tried to get my best advice\nI mean this person was upset had to leave their house they had young kids this person you know how to family and you know it's it's hard\nIt's unfortunately

responsible by immediate that trying to exploit it for political gain when it is a serious significant threat that was it well the president says fake news are they are fake news no truth is ... words are very different than actions\nJust like Bernie Sanders says incendiary things to that ... that was incendiary to me I just but you know he's not responsible because not that supports him it's

anymore [noise] [noise] and now\nToday the media is quite as well let's talk Radio's fault it's Fox News's Paul this is Trump's fault\nNo it would be you know the rhetoric on the left and all these incidents I don't hear a single person speak out ever\n... you know here's a fact nobody right now knows anything about who's responsible for and whether or not these are actual bombs that's not even been confirmed yet [noise]\nMaybe they meant to look like bombs maybe it's the white powder was meant to look like rice and or or some type of other\nYou know poison we don't know yet we knew we knew know three weeks ago rice and letters were sent to President Trump\nSecretary of defense Mattis FBI Director re CIA director Gina Haspel that we know anyway former NYPD Commissioner a Bernie ... book by the way is phenomenal\nThe grave above the graves commissioner of the police department of New York I call him ...\nA dam bond Gino former Secret Service agent his best selling book is out now it's called Spygate welcome both of you to the program today the president condemning whoever is responsible for sending these items and even then he's getting criticized you know you would think listening to the media that it was him who sent them\nAnd meanwhile they've been silent with all these public confrontations Bernie look\nI've lived in New York a long time um it's been a while I don't get mail anymore but I've had the white powder scare I had a an assistant a mind quarantine for about nine hours while they were testing out whether anthrax spores were in the package it turned out thankfully that was not the case we saw that a lot after nine eleven\n[noise] you know was shown in this kind of reminds me of that because the after nine eleven I think it was the first month anniversary a after nine eleven we actually got anthrax or at city hall\nWe got it at a V. C. N. D. C. I remember get a call from Tom Brokaw laws producers I'm In and this is what that reminds me of however uh people have to keep in mind right now we don't know if these packages these devices are real\nUm you don't know who sent them what the purpose was um we're going to hear about a lot of false alarms and the next two days perhaps\nUm but I Would and and I think Dan may agree with me here [noise] I Would predict given that they found these devices and they got them without that they that\nUh I predict they're going to have somebody they're going to have a target suspect with the next two or three days\nWhat makes you think that Bernie\n[noise] well ... when you detonate the stuff but you know you blow to pieces it's harder to collect the evidence that you could\nSend who uh who runs ... a machine right so now you have a package itself or the mail or the the stamps were writing the device looms side they're going to break this stuff down wherever how long\nIt took to find the Unabomber I remember that case\nYeah but you know what Sean times are different times of different technologies get for new mailing list of those different areas and there are so many packages loose who's a distance of benefit to law enforcement right now\nIn other words they have more packages and and look on the surface it would look like the ... gene okay it's going to Democrats it's going to a liberal CNN that might people might think well this might be right off the top of their head that first suspect would be well might be some\nRadical conservative but we don't know that we don't know anything right now\nNo and and there's\nA lot of the way I wouldn't even call them they wouldn't be a conservative they'd be an anarchist if they were\nYeah I mean this is going to be condemned as it should be by everybody I mean no one is set devices a note on one with a straight face acceptable in polite conversation incentive vices violence on public officials and anyone who does\nUm is a moron and Savage I think there's a period full stop there but with regard to the Unabomber thing show and you're right it it it takes them a long time but remember what the Unabomber he was a little more tactically of strategically devious he would send those bombs and it'd be an extended period of time between each one where he actually developed\nA new kind of a you know let's say ways to put those in construct those bombs together is very difficult with this\nThey're basically you know ... nations whoever this was you may have done this so it's got to be really hard for them not to have left behind in any of these multiple devices any clues but there's a part of me that believes Sean that\nThis person or persons um wanted to be caught I mean some of the stuff is amateurish Sean I'll give you a quick example I mean one of these devices sent the CNN was addressed to John Brennan\nWho does it work at the end I mean it's hard to figure out you just go to the Internet and you could figure out to John Brennan and then you know and it'd be the comet he's not a CNN 'cause sure if this is just basic stuff I mean I think about it if you were a enough of the Savage in an animal to want to hurt someone or hurt someone in the mail processing facility\nYou think you do like basic homework like that so it's very amateurish the construction of it um from my experience and this is amateurish as well and\nYou know I agree with the a former commissioner that's I I think it'll be a matter of a few days before someone or or a group of people are caught I Hope they are but\nEverybody hopes they are um and you know usually these things come\nIn rapid succession a commissioner and I would expect that that might be the case here although it seems to slow down so down at least for today\nWell listen you started on Monday was Soros right when you add a number of these things come in today we'll see what happens to borrow\nA like I said we're also going to hear a lot of false alarms in the aftermath of the anthrax attacks in New York City when you got ... just in New York city\nThere were hundreds and hundreds of false waters of the next two weeks so we'll hear about that but um you know I I agree with that I think within a couple of days um they're going to have a target or at least you know somebody they're looking at because there's just way too much here\nUm that's been captured\nWhen you first be looking for some radical fringe we\nOften after these for example school shootings find that people telegraph what they're going to do ahead of time and I've got to assume here that maybe that would be the case as well that this was some type of radical extremists that that maybe doesn't like certain politicians or it could have been Harris I mean you just don't know right\nNow given the right one your your analysis of the school shooting is absolutely correct the secret service did an exhaustive study on that Sean and that is exactly what they discovered\nThat a lot of these people engage them this targeted violence even political violence political assassination that's why the secret service ironically\nGot into analyzing school shootings through the national threat assessment center they found very similar patterns of behavior that telegraphing which you just described directly so\nSo it wouldn't surprise me again given what I see based I got an avid obviously haven't analyze these devices but having seen what the press is put out and what's in the media they seem to be a very amateurish devices as that\nAhead Greg real quick oh hey Sean great cast to listen to the big big honor um I was blessed enough to go to the rally\nOut here in Houston and it was just amazing to hear President Trump speaking person a skinny so much hope because my sister brought my little nephew and a Thirteen year old kid hung on every single word that a President Trump had to say and joining read about that\nBecause you get to see the energy

covered these cases as attorney general and in last word to Sean Spicer I blew through this myself I Know how tough this can be on on these people and their families it's horrible and the president said he will spare no resources to find the people responsible\nBut I ... I mean Shawn you've been covering extensively for a long time now that that that the right has been targeted and I think it's appalling what any American would any citizen when any person feels threatened attacked potential violence and I think we've got to stop and and the reaction as you pointed out correctly is is amazing low priced but denouncing the\nAction for a long time the less needs to come to the table and agreed all well it's got to stop\nGotta let it go there thank you Sean Spicer good luck on election day Thirteen Days for Kris Kobach to be the next governor of Kansas thank you both for being with us\nIn other words she's purposely lying again to the people of North Dakota\nStaffers saying she's acting moderate only to get votes\nAnd high camp staffers want people to think that she's for the wall and she's not for the wall and saying that if there is a blue wave show move left and saying that their staff are saying Trump will be impeached if the Democrats win the Senate but of course he's not saying any of this publicly listen to an election\nOr if\nThere was only\nWorkers [noise]\n\nDifferent for her but\nShe doesn't want to run but she was\nWe're up to her for her [noise]\nShe wants to get elected when you're making really liberal yeah she's ... now it's just like sit on\nFrom the world\nI don't like that you took them bomb a poster that oh\nThat was that's my that's my favorite pictures that\n\nWhen you have\nPatton yang I'm hearing okay\nWhy\nNot yell at\nMe now\nAn end to a campaign for it's either\nA wine I\nFrom what I can tell it's back to you know ... it's a very\nRepublican I had my like I said yeah it's like\n\n\nA lightning long he\nHe wasn't actually\nYeah this is the same same thing with a with\nClaire McCaskill enemy and now we're just trying to do [noise] you know because it makes people fall out here\nSo don't say she I supported the wall just like the fact that we're paying for something or whatever the on the ground saying\nOkay because I just add there's something or yeah or like making people go she doesn't support the wall and the other day I don't know you know for that so I don't say that she doesn't\nWant them the time is\nThat people don't really understand this is my head and then\nHe like they're going to look at me while I\nWas right on the wall or what have you on the wall or\nNo she do vote against the wall [noise]\n\n\n[noise]\nYou know for\nMe anyway you weigh in\nOn the [noise] [noise]\n\nAnd then she'll be able to what's going\nOn in the city [noise] and what do they want to be like I don't know\nThe amazing this is now number three British send the phony fake bony fraud wire hypocrite from Tennessee you got Claire McCaskill the pony lying hypocrite manipulate ... trying to manipulate the voters in Missouri and Heidi Heitkamp will be a super liberal\nBut she's not going to tell you that until after the election anyway project very toss it CEO founder James O'Keefe strikes again how are\nYou [noise] hey Sean great to be with you and yeah this is number three it's it's more of the sameness Heidi Heitkamp director and her Washington DC campaign office\nOr speaking candidly about when she gets elected she's going to go really hard left she'll be quote super liberal unquote at that point so he's describing the bait and switch that once again the red state Democrats have to do in the battleground states the elected\nWhat's so amazing is the consistency here is that is that they are telling their staff one thing they're saying things privately that they'll never say publicly\nIn the hopes that they came basically lie to bamboozled whatever term you want to use the voters in their state in the case of Brett is an even calling the people of Tennessee ignorant in the hopes that they'll get that seat\nAnd then they'll they'll be a a basically a Chuck Schumer senator for that state\nYeah just so that your listeners if you haven't seen every video a there's a video in Missouri we did where were they were talking about Obama's using Claire McCaskill's views and the staffer says Obama and the ... have the same using everything but quote people just can't know that\nWell in this video this video released last night on your show Sean there's this another guy Gordon is his name he's the staffer\nAnd Heidi Heitkamp Fargo North Dakota campaign office and we and we see an Obama poster in the office there's a big one of those uh Obama looks like the messiah on the wall this big poster\nBut then they took it down right before the press came so we asked why did you take your toaster down and the staffer says well because the presses here\nAnd and we take it down and when the press comes is what Heidi Heitkamp staff say so it's more it's basically the same thing in each of these red states they have to mislead they have to moderate voters and play to the progressive base well we just have them on tape saying it we all know that Heidi is is liberal but\nShe's going to be settled liberate once you get selected that her staffers are emphasizing it here and they also say that she's not going to run again so because that's what Jesse Overton says in the studio quote she doesn't want to run again social just do good work while she can which means that she'll do the things that she can't talk about right now\nIt's just so revealing but I I think this is really this is not an accident that you're getting very similar responses and every place you have now gone\nI mean these are three big huge massive Senate races and you have caught three major Senate candidates all admitting that they ... they're lying to the people of their state to get elected\nBut I Would argue that it ... represents the entirety of the Democratic party we now know what goes Maxine Waters told us that her party's older they don't want me to say it they want me to stop saying it but I'm not going to stop saying it impeach forty five ... well that's good\nIt's ... it's particularly true in these red states there's a there's a kind of a story here that we found that were confirming suspicion is that ... that's what we do it very costly confirms suspicions\nAnd we've always known this to be true but my point is just have integrity\nDoes it it's not really a left or right thing\nI was at this first them and conference with all these big hon chosen media\nWho were ... you know very cheering and and ... and I just have integrity this is about just doing what you say you're going to I think it's more pronounced in red states with these Democrats running because they have to lie to the moderates they have to woo the moderates and that and they could only make one choice once but it did not have a choice\nIt's lying is this a purposeful misinformation propaganda campaign 'cause they have no intention of doing what they say they're going to do they have a very different agenda the people working for them know that they have a very different agenda\nAnd so they're really just lying manipulating I mean it is the worst of the worst in terms of politics\nBecause there was an open contempt hatred and a feeling of superiority that Claire McCaskill has that bill Brett isn't hasn't Heidi Heitkamp as towards the people of their state Penn well they\nDo it so hateful Sean that Claire McCaskill has asked for a special prosecutor to look into me he asked her opponent Josh Hawley who's the attorney general I've never met Josh I yeah I don't I don't he doesn't work for me I never talked to anybody in his staff but McCaskill ask to be a special prosecutor to investigate project their ties\nTo investigate hair on camera speaking her own words are there any restrictions in the state of Missouri about filming people\nNone none at it it it her way back to the attorney general asking for me to be investigated is like someone telling you not to go on the radio and talk it's it's it's it's it's perfectly legal for me to do what I Do in Missouri they're just Pennsylvania I Can't do it Illinois I Can't do it\nBut thirty eight states I can record people as long as I'm In the room with them and I'm reporting and it and let me say something else Sean if it's wrong for me to go Under Cover and record these folks\nThen how wrong is it for them to mislead the voters if it's ... it's not fraud for me to record people but it's certainly approaches fraud for her to misrepresent in such an awful way\nAnd and thank you Claire McCaskill for doing that and asking for me to be prosecuted because now every TV station in Missouri every single one has covered these videos and I think the same things that happen in North Dakota this week\nPretty handy around the house but now that I had kids I don't want to spend my Saturday installing a toilet or fixing an air conditioner but thankfully there is ...\nHome advisor helped me find the best home pros in my area to handle any kind of project you can read

thing that's happened in New York City that's that's you know we've got to monitor the media close to here because they're not talking about violence against Democrats are but we do have a number of other states next week I I I'm Wondering if I should say the names of the states I don't know\nI think yeah I I I think you should give it a little man I\nI you know we got we got something happened in the southwest and the southeast and the thing that's remarkable about these states we've already have them we're getting a little bit more we still have undercover\nPeople in play is the ... in it
