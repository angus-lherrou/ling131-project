notion of having a very prominent wealthy black celebrity like ...\nSo friendly and familiar with the president and working with him on policy issues by the way you know you you can say this about a lot of people in a lot of different situations are we allowed to embrace that he's\nSaying things that we like and pushing ideas that we like now or do we have to say well a long time ago he he had or even you know ten years ago whenever it was he had a different perspective so would that invalidate same now that's not a standard that we hold anyone's you've never mind to a celebrity\nSo you know there's a little bit of I don't know if you'd say trust but verify but there are some applause with caution here I think in order for the look on your situation and then there's also the everybody just needs to calm the hack down our meeting was acting like\nTrump went and played ... holes with Kim Jong on which let's be honest I could probably happen sometime pretty soon but they were acting like this was some\nCrazy thing that he had ... talk to you and say oh he's profane\nThe uh profane the office of the presidency by doing this by cursing in there you know this is the same office literally V. office the oval office where Bill Clinton did a whole lot more in a way of profane stuff than have a guest who cursed\nBut there are no standards the media really applies to any there's there's no there's no truth necessary for what they say oh they just want to find ways to hate and to criticize the president and there's always ways to do that he hears a perfect example of what I'm Talking about John up Brazil\nWhom I managed to a debate a few times in ... at CNN and who was always treated with tremendous difference I mean they really love Donna Brazil at CNN\nSo I was supposed to be there to get a buck slapped if you will ... or ... ... you know what I mean fuck yet bucks left um and\nIn turn I actually managed to turn the tables on her and she told me she interrupted be once told me to stop interrupting her was a pretty amazing thing I don't know some of you may be even seen that but I was never impressed with her so she has to eat it out\nAnd she is treated out the following in response discounting members this was a I think she was she was DNC chair German and then she gave the questions to Hillary remember he got fired from CNN\nShe treated at the following an in response to this whole commenting today Kanye West has set us back one hundred and fifty five years\nWish Sojourner Truth could've met with him outside the White House and Frederick Douglass inside the oval office Brock Obama never would have become president with this crap but lets me Kanye on election day by voting for Democrats I mean the the end of that is fine if she wants to propagandize were Democrats she's totally free to do that\nBut just say that ... has set back\nUh I I guess when she says set us back I wouldn't want to put words in your mouth but I'm assuming she means the black community set us back a hundred and fifty five years\nWell this one does the math on that it seems a lot she's making a pretty pointed reference there and how is that what a reasonable rational person would say here you have\nA world famous black millionaire in the oval office embracing the president of the literally embracing I'm giving him a hug\nAnd sharing ideas with him and sharing lunch with him this is the leader of the free world this is a man talking about Trump now for Tanya probably thinks he's a leader of the free world\nAmong other things being a deity ah but there's no ... there's no way any ... normal human being could look at this and so yeah that's degrading for any group of people never mind for black Americans but this is just the oval office\nAnd I think that the way they get to this is two fold one today they hate Trump so much that they're blinded with rage about him all the time but also they don't really accept the Trump is the president they've they have\nThis is this is true about the less now and it explains a lot explains a lot of their mob mentality and the mob actions and the way that they've been willing to cast aside basic decency and decorum and to justify this behavior to themselves and to others in the media and\nIt's because they don't really think that he's the president they think that he is a fraud\nOr he is a ... an interlopers he's a pretend or to the throne if you will and so he doesn't deserve any of the respect that one would give president he doesn't deserve any of the deference to the office if not to the man himself\nAnd so if that were your perspective if you were that\nDo looted with with rage uh not disconnected from the truth then I could see how maybe you feel that ... hugging this man that they think is such a fraud in the oval office and having this very warm report is demeaning but to any normal person that's just ... it's just crazy\nThat is the most accurate way to describe it and there were some

I think without a doubt by the way one of the things you've got a notice this week you notice the market went down its up a little today but went down in the past couple of days and it was triggered by interest rates stuff but in the meantime I had some analysts telling me\nThey're afraid of the Democrats taking the house of representatives and they would want to raise taxes again they would stop Trump from doing all the good things that he's done our regulations to visit with the economy and they would want to raise taxes again\nAnd that would cost jobs that were slow down the American economy and you've got an economy now that's really growing at about four percent higher than any of the expectations and what they're really afraid of is that Nancy Pelosi could become speaker again I agree with you showing that the Republicans are going to pick up Senate seats in the Senate seats looking really good because of what happened\nWith the backlash of about the whole having a hearing in how unfair it was and you can see we had to pull this this week where I'm McCaskill was losing to Hawley the Republicans for the U.S Senate\nAnd the way that I also Joe Donnelly is now down write and write and Heidi Heitkamp is finished she's down by double digits\nRight we have polls there because of the the energy sector is so important to the state that you're seeing that you're seeing these these polls um you know people want chops\nAnd what's scary is in the last three weeks where you're going to decide is do you want the economy to keep growing or do you want do you want it to slow down your poetry to raise taxes take what you got and take away the jobs take away the pay raises\nAnd the vast majority of Americans\nDon't want to go back to that I mean we had polls in September with were Nancy Pelosi has fifty five unfavorable among all voters she has she has the fifty three percent\nUnfavorable among independent women that the independent women are going to decide this election and and they don't want to go back to the way things work before Donald Trump took over and started to drain the swamp and get things moving again for the country\nTo these house races you're talking about\nOverwhelmingly most of the ones in play Republicans those Republican incumbents or the or the Republican or a candidates in the in those open seats they're the ones who are going to vote to keep lowering taxes to keep the economy growing and basically to stop what you saw the last couple of days where\nYou know the smart money on Wall street saying hold it if she's if she's going to be speaker\nAnd they're going to oppose the president's ah ah agenda they started selling off\nI mean it'd be a disaster for the country\nDoes shown 'em I honestly don't have a feel yet for the house but I think the Senate you have to admit is looking very good for Republican pickups I think when you have thirty three races now that will that will actually tipped the balance one way or the other in the house of representatives a little too close for comfort\nBecause as somebody that knows Nancy Pelosi I think that would be a worst case scenario and we'd have endless investigations and impeachment and higher taxes and and you know it then they want to get rid of ice they won't fund a border wall et cetera it's going to be the same nonsense all over again with them\nWell I my sense is that the house is still a in democratic hands where the election today so it's getting closer or the real clear averages gone from a thirty one or thirty two seats for the Democrats to twenty six twenty seven so it's moved the same direction as the Senate races but not quite\nAs far and I would have to concede much as I Would like not to that the Senate races have moved decisively andme interaction\nKavanaugh had a lot to do with it\nYeah I Do I think they're really two realities there's the reality of the world that we live in on the east coast and west coast and the reality of the rest of the country who\nThought that a lot of what happened to him\nYeah I'm kind of like an island in the middle of that east coast I'm not the rest of the east coast I don't represent the value of a New York\nOr I've noticed which is a pretty hard core left wing state even as a Governor Cuomo does anyone want me in the state did you know that I Know but if I got I got taken it no he actually said those conservative\nThat that problem is not me and the problem stems cells are streaming service or write to\nMe was it that are closer to the extreme conservative place in the state so we noticed that it's not because it's\nSimple no one has tons within a rifle no need\nUh um right to life I'm pro Second Amendment uh and uh although I don't I'm libertarian on people's personal lives I think we ought to lead people to hell alone\nUm salt but there's no place for me in the state of New York and he said it himself when that happened I had a bunch of governors Florida Texas North Carolina South Carolina all calling and inviting me to move to the states I Want to take them up on Mr shown that would be a governor and everything you love and vote for once me out of town\nSo I Am I speaking for myself and wanted you to run as an independent for president I think had you run in Alabama one of your old\nStomping grounds Doug Jones would not be a senator and I would be happy to be part of the bipartisan committee to keep Hannity in New York or to promote Hannity\nOffice would like to run for it I think my friend John and I can\nI ... well you disabuse our friend Doug I'm very notion that I can win any office I don't even think I could win dog catcher\nNo I I I think look you're still the kid for Franklin square you're still you're still am with your working class roots and Andrew Cuomo is trying to make you move out to join because New York that's our biggest export is is the people on taxpayers of New York state\nWe send them to places like Florida and Tennessee in Texas where they have no no income tax and no state income tax and they have jobs but by the way it does hold an ad on us 'cause his client right Doug you still work for a a former mayor for New York Mike Bloomberg\nRent I heard it oh yeah yes I don't I ... I tell you you know people are speculating he might run for president but Andrew Cuomo is clearly afraid of him 'cause he's moving so far left\nChat it's unbelievable he's gonna get whiplash but\nBut I don't even think I don't think they'll make to get through Mayor Bloomberg could get through a Democratic primary these days because they're so radical\nAnd that's my point about what's going on right now the country's realizing in the next three weeks what's at stake is this is the most as Sean says the most important midterms in our lifetime because you really have a clear choice from a country that's gotten back it's got its footing back\nWhere the economy is moving while we're stronger in the world are we we we're basically the heartland is feeling that people are paying attention to them that the swamp is being put back in its place that that the average person might have something to say about how their lives are going to be gotten governed have control of their own healthcare but\nBut if Nancy Pelosi becomes the next speaker she will be the most powerful elected Democrat in the country she'll be the national face and voice of the Democratic party and that is just frightening\n'cause it let me tell you something we're not just friday is a frightening Republicans Doug shown does not want this do you do oh\nI Want democratic candidate at all levels in the house to say I will vote against her because that's the way to get votes in these marginal races absolutely going to should go period style absolutely and and does point about improving\nAsked to go to a big claim exam I wanted to make sure you know\nIn search compensation and pension exam to get the information you need for the benefits you burden on your ... claim exam\nYou by the U.S department of Veterans Affairs\n[noise]\nOffice News I'm rich Dennison President Trump not yet condemning Saudi Arabia for the suspected murder of Washington Post journalist ... go we're going to\nFind out what happened with respect to\nThe terrible situation in Turkey having to do with Saudi Arabia and the reporter the\nVisuals in Turkey say they have proof to show that he was killed inside the Saudi consulate in Istanbul up American pastor Andrew Brunson freed from turkey and now in Germany\nWhere I'll get off for a brief jak and I think he's got to be in great shape\nD.C tomorrow in most downloaded on\nPresident Trump commenting at a campaign rally tonight in Cincinnati runs who was convicted of espionage incentives to time served in Turkey today the White House says us pressure led to his release turkey is rejecting that claim\nThis is Fox News [noise]\n\nSmart ankle\nBob card to reproduce ... new advances in science and engineering from the national Science Foundation prosthetic legs were much proved\nTo users who still a major unintended stumbling block\nTo rain every she'll stare wrapper on eating ...
