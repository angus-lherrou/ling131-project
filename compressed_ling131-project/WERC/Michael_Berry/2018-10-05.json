in Washington DC covering the hearing that that took the last bits of testimony from Kavanaugh\nAnd a doctor for it I ran into bought that day and it was raining crazy in Washington DC and that's kind of where we set up this weekend felons yadda yadda yadda\nBut as I was there I stood inside the Senate office building and covered some of the protests and I asked or tried to ask Elizabeth Warren when she was going to take a DNA test\nAnd she turned and ran away wouldn't answer it got mad at me a than a Jeff Merkley of Oregon another Democrat was there and I asked him\nIf he didn't think Joe

more in taxpayer funding I think they do I think it might even be more than that Planned Parenthood gets a lot of our money gets money from me gets money from you\nAnd when I was at the protest last week a week ago Planned Parenthood it's set up camp\nOn the benches in the quad drained go inside the U.S Senate office building and they were working the room handing out free T shirts to anybody who wanted them three T shirts and they have pre printed signs\nThey also had stationary and directions on how you could write a letter to your a senator or congressman to tell them that they needed to be vocal about Kevin Oh and this is all\nYour tax dollars at work I thought I thought Planned Parenthood was all about women's health\nAnd I thought so giving away free T shirts to oppose a nominee to the Supreme Court that's that's really what's your all about it seems like we need to pull that funding back\nAnd I know some of you are going to say look Planned Parenthood does things really good things well Planned Parenthood does not do mammogram so anyone tells you as Planned Parenthood did today\nThat uh mammograms are all about breast health they might be but Planned Parenthood doesn't give mammograms they don't provide that so there's a little bit of ... there as well we\nWe have much to get into day well like I said we've got to talk about China getting inside our phones and

the Democrat leadership to just say go ahead and vote for him that way you'll look good in front of your people\nUm I I I really feel for professor Ford as a you know and and and Brett Kavanaugh because they were mistreated by the Democrats if you look at her testimony especially you know about the the question about what she was asked\nThat you know we have come to you in California the interview she basically it was like I didn't know this nobody told me this lawyers\nThat the Democrats for\nNot informed of this option they wanted they wanted her to come to DC\nAnd they even tried to tell her to say oh tell her that's attorney client privilege as she was like no I I I would've I would've entertain them coming to me and and answer their questions in California\nI think that she really did not want things to go public that she just had some recollection that she wanted to keep quiet\nAnd then the Democrats said this is something we can use to a store\nAnd she she will be I feel very badly for her obviously if you listen to her testimony something happened to Christine for something happened to her at a party\nBut she can't she can't put Brett Kavanaugh there none of the people she said were there could put in there the story changed the dates changed\nThe story about having to doorways at her house\nReally doesn't hold up because one of those entrances was made for

would give Trump sorry more\nBecause you don't win re election in toy\nWell if you base it on the economy and if we think James Carville for it's the economy stupid then yeah the the president stands a real good chance against one of the seven thousand possible democratic candidates who are being talked about to face him\nAnd this would be if Donald Trump gets one more this would be a landmark this would be total game changing in terms of moving the court to a more conservative or at the position than anyone could ever see\nSo uh I'm with you on a think cabinet gets through what what did

years we have all of those ... resources and I have fourteen states record low unemployment yeah record low unemployment for Hispanic Americans African Americans Asian Americans youth unemployment fifty five\nLow median household income its highest record ever recorded\nYou know we have the lowest unemployment rate ever recorded for Americans without even a high school diploma and veterans' unemployment is now reached its lowest rate in Twenty years\nAnd four million people off of food stamps and I can just keep on going and promises about the types of judges he put on the court and gutting endless bureaucratic\nRegulation that that literally hamstrings all businesses in America\nPromoting buying and hiring America actively promoting and asking people to come and build their factories and manufacturing centers here and creating the economic conditions\nAnd the regulatory conditions where it's possible I mean that's why all these manufacturing jobs are coming back\nOr reducing illegal immigration courts defeating ISIS\nYou know a course pulling out of that idiotic Iranian deal and little rocket man is not firing a missile over Japan every other day I say that's pretty good but with thirty two days out of the electorate a lot can happen between now and then John McLaughlin is pollster founder of McLaughlin associates\nDoug Jones is with us also a pollster author political analyst for Fox News\nOr thank you both for being with us or we can see I don't know if you want to call the cabin on balance or the\nCabinet awakening there's every single state now Claire McCaskill is down significantly and the latest poll in Missouri\nJoe Donnelly is in trouble and Indiana Heidi Heitkamp is down in eleven in her state of North Dakota or I say that Rick Scott will be the next senator from Florida and then of course Martha ... has been surging lately ah where do you think it stands at this moment John McLaughlin\n... I I think you're seeing a a definitely a cabinet effect but it's really what it is it's ... percent of the Trump voters a short you know you've done and I talked about two years ago how Trump had to bring new voters and to to win the election and we did Donald Trump ignited millions of voters who came out\nVoted in twenty sixteen that didn't vote and twenty twelve that took a pass on Mitt Romney and\nUp until this time up until the hearing last Thursday or those voters were staying home or a good portion portion of them weren't engaged and I think that's got to see that the the actual hearing in the news coverage and the character assassination the ruthless politics I think\nThe Democrats had looked at ... Chuck Schumer is a really smart strategic senator and he's the leader and he looked at that map and he said this thirty five seats up\nTwenty six or eight hours entering states that that Donald Trump won what can I Do to try to take back the majority\nAnd he probably made a calculation if we can embarrass cabinet or that the Republicans pulled him it was suppressed the Trump voters so that a good number of those sixty three million would stay home because you only get Ninety million come out in the mid term elections so they they made they hit the Republicans stuck from the president stuck with him\nAnd the Democrats were exposed these voters are now outraged that the Democrats would put such a late hit on\nAnd try to smear a good person who would remind them of their father their their their son their their their brother and said this was totally unfounded uncorroborated there's no evidence to it\nAnd they're trying to destroy this man in this family and the Republicans ... ... the Republicans and independents who supported Trump or coming back out and you're seeing them in these polls that Missouri poet McCaskill behind was appalled that we did for a for a super back she's down ... points down or you're seeing this I'm seeing this impulse every day it's\nIt's not a big explosion but what it is is ...\n... is coming back in and\nGet along really well and if the Trump voters were dying well what\nWas a huge enthusiasm gap just a month ago but less than a month ago two weeks ago two and a half weeks ago\nUm has now totally and completely evaporated and conservatives have been awakened and and by the way Doug shown the party that we saw protesting and the party that Russia's to judgment the party that doesn't believe in due process a party that doesn't believe in the presumption of innocence\nOr the need for some corroboration and the party that defended Clinton and defense Keith Ellison a I don't think they're looking too good here to the American people right now and they they're being shown to be the radical party I've been describing for some time\nWas shot I mean I don't quite know how to reply but I'll give you ...\nYou can just say I actually agree with your characterization in their handling of all of this has been pretty stupid and detrimental um to you know any sense that they have have any sense of moderation in this day and age\nWell I don't think they have any sense of moderation but what they do have is an ongoing leaving the house which right there is there's a lead to pick up the house and I think from what I see looking at the Senate races\nThey're all very very close within the margin of her and I really think to get a definitive answer will have to come back and in a week or ten days after capital is as I think we all expect\nNarrowly confirmed to see whether the effect job than you are talking about Iran is actually going to hold over time I think it really has to play out and I think there's a good chance that the protests you've seen from the Democrats them from women\nLike him or not we'll continue and will ultimately a benefit particularly in suburban congressional districts less so Senate races the Democrats\nHow's it going to play with the voter in the rest of the country not in New York D.C San Francisco and Los Angeles or or Illinois or Chicago how's it going to play with her I think of America I think it's going to tell a very differently\nI think the the real challenge is the one John raises I think that's that's right will this re engage the Trump voter I think as of today probably some evidence that that\nIs going to have it in such twenty point enthusiasm gap just a ... in sixteen days\n[noise] let's let's let's wait a week Sean and we'll see where\nThey don't think this leaves a bad taste in people's mouths what they did and said this man for support us\nAnymore than disgusting and nobody who lie to you for experimenting Arlen than things that\nYou know what they did to this man and how they bludgeoned this man and his family as as vicious and they've been with no due process and for once you know how critical am of Republicans\nThey took it with the seriousness the topic deserved they handled it properly they looked into every crevice in corner and we still have no corroboration now do we believe in the presumption of innocence or not you proud of the how the Democrats handle this\n... ... ... if if I can voiced support for you perhaps he'll\nGive me a chance to do that I went up I said this is somebody who has my own a judicial legal and philosophical differences with the judge Kavanaugh so I Would not be voted for him but I Do think showing that you are correct\nThat the way this process has played out depresses me as an American first and a Democrat second\nUm I think the process is destroying a the independence of archer just Sherrie this drawing the presumption of innocence and basically what is destroying what makes our country great so we may disagree philosophically but\nI'd like to think we stand for the same enduring values\nWasn't Lindsey Graham who in many ways showed such a profile in courage in this\nUm and even and I think the deliberate seriousness of Susan Collins\nYou know the Republican Party is made up of a varying factions that I don't see these factions really existing in the Democratic party
