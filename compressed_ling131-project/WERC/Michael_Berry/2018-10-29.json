pure evil [noise] hard to believe\nAnd frankly something that is on imaginable our nation on the world are shocked and stunned by the grief\nThis was an anti Semitic act\nYou wouldn't think this would be possible in this day and age but we just don't seem to learn from the past ... could not comprehend the grueling have and the twisted malice that could cause a person do on a leash such terrible violence during\nA baby naming ceremony this was a baby naming ceremony at ASU green house of worship on the holy day of some\nOr an hour to Sean Hannity show glad you're with us eight hundred nine four one showing toll free telephone number eight days till election day one week from a tomorrow that was the president talking\nAbout the Pittsburgh should have gone to synagogue shooter um we're letting getting to know a lot more about Robert Bowers and who he is he was a very ill and anti Semite he was a huge critic of Donald Trump\nOr in a lot of ways um and the president you know she'll keep for saying what that means maybe and we've talked about this after school shootings and after other church shootings\nWhere the president said well maybe we need to have retired police and military it's a sad state of affairs\nBut um as a line of defense but that doesn't take away from the horror and the vicious evil\nThat took place here you look at the victims I mean it is heartbreaking to see the faces of those slain for their faith was the cover of the New York post today and as you read about the the lives of these people it is one heartbreaking story after another\nAre sadly too we watched the media do what they always do and that's rushed to blame and pulling out all the stops to blame Donald Trump the Pittsburgh massacre when in fact the prime minister of Israel Ron dorm or the ambassador of all said that the president's comments were welcomed unappreciated\nOn every front um we'll get into all those says we continue rose cannon I'm the host of Clinton rows and rows um plugged in Pittsburgh, PA ugh long run to the program and David shown civil liberties attorney criminal defense attorney thank you both for being here\nUh you know how much I loved by friends in Pittsburgh rows of very very sorry or thoughts and prayers go to everybody or the fact that it's been so viciously politicized within minutes makes beat my stomach turn and those trying to cast blame against the president make this a campaign issue is just nauseating\nIt is shining you or so left in Pittsburgh as well as soon as I heard the story the news Saturday morning I mean my heart went out and I was almost afraid to hear the list of victims their names because\nThis community it's such a lovely place it's a very popular Pittsburgh neighborhood\nI go there to shop and to dying and done in fact my son told me just about a month ago that's one of the neighborhood is considering moving too so we we love that community it's a tight knit community they are very involved though in so many aspects and not just their community but the out if the surrounding communities\nAnd as it turned out you know of course I grew up with a girl whose husband was the two brothers\nThat perished on Saturday but there were so many people that have done so many great things in this community and the Pittsburgh area and it just it's heartbreaking it really is to see that this happened but as soon as I thought those things\nAnd immediately I got sick thinking that this is starting to become political and\nIt's in you can count the seconds there's an interesting side no to those little brothers to David I'm how democratic candidates increasingly turned against Israel\nAnd our mutual friend Alan Dershowitz you know I had a pretty powerful column that he put out\nLinking the the mass of good at the Democratic party's tolerance for anti Semitism most recently we saw Bill Clinton two seats down from Louis Farrakhan I'd never ever get in a room with a vicious racist anti Semite like Louis Farrakhan or picture that emerged or with ... and\nObama that was hidden from the public for eight years while he was president that existed that they had had a relationship\nUm and if you look at some of the most pro Israeli president I think we have had since the the forty eight partition plan un partition plan is ah is Donald Trump\nMore recently making Jerusalem the capital of Israel which so many other presidents have promised that never had the courage to do\nYeah any person who would suggest for a moment Donald Trump as an anti Semitic bone in his body is that of their mind look in his family et cetera but you're absolutely right and what you pointed out ... ... if you believe that words matter then it goes much further than just a President Clinton sitting in a room\nWith Mr fabric on their pictures of President Clinton President Obama Cory Booker shaking hands and smiling with Farrakhan members of Congress doing the same Linda source or another hater\nI get an honorary degree at City College an honorary doctorate is that bomb a nation what climate dizzy away just wrote a press release about some of these kinds of things I looked at this Linda ... praises\nResume or day ah terrorists to Palestinian terrorists who killed two American college students she's been praised by Christ in dealing with a brand she's been praised unfortunately by Stacey Abrams is running for Congress here in Georgia now um if words matter those things matter a great deal\nAs it should be expected when you normalize Israel bashing and the hatred of Jews it should\nAll the way that I Would put it I thought it was pretty powerful you said they can't be any tolerance for anti Semitism and I agree\nWe we have to have a zero tolerance policy President Obama meets with Farrakhan shame on him President Clinton sits on a platform with Farrakhan shame on him Keith Ellison joins Farrakhan was one of the greatest purveyor of anti Semitic hate he's right\nI'm just because he's black doesn't give him in the past four is anti Semitism and any liberal\nWas any positive association with Farrakhan as as part of the problem not the solution and you know just last week Farrakhan was making anti Semitic statements and it was only two months ago that Al Sharpton Jesse Jackson of Bill Clinton were all sitting next to each other with Farrakhan at a rate their Franklin's funeral\nI Would not go to any funeral that he was ... I'm Sorry I just you draw the line\nAnd trying to find ... here too and it's something I like your listeners to know because I I noticed a couple of headlines today on Sunday there was a letter that was published and written by eleven members of a group called bend the ark and they have a Pittsburgh affiliate\nRight here and they sent a letter to the president is blaming hand they said that you yourself called the\nMurder evil that yesterday's violence is that direct combination if he were influence\nAnd they said you're the pantry eerie ear work and your policies have\nInviting that's involved in this\nAnd that you know what was interesting is I had so many messages and phone calls\nSorry to interrupt you shine oh it isn't saying it it is it ...\nIt is them desperate trying to help the Democratic allies win elections\nI Love which at the rabbi sat rabbi Myers said that you know he's a citizen of this country and if the president wants to come here please con heat with not objecting at all to the president's visit which I appreciate and when we start focusing on this blame game which is what we do especially the the ... media\nThat then we lose sight of what really happened to you know what really happened is as we just got an anti Semite killed ... that was his goal those are the words that were true and spoken friend can't eat wanting to kill kids but we also had\nPittsburgh Police who are saying I Love these guys I Know so many of them they went rushing towards the gunfire while everyone else it of course is rushing away we had a doctor of analysts who went to care for gunshot victim and he became a victim himself\nRabbi Myers made every effort to save as many lives that they could and he regretted that he couldn't save more these are the real stories and this is the truth\nThese were not acts of the nation divided that with the ones that can read the media wants to believe that we're a nation divided but we're not we're a nation or a community like this one like any other when we're faced with adversity when we come face to face with a madman\nWe roll up our sleeves we face that evil encouraging the sacrifice and and and that is who we are as Americans and when they play the blame game on the media makes me sick because we mix with the story is what the truth is and rabbi Myers I Love what you said he said that bullet holes or to numerous to count that\nWe will rebuild because we're tree of life we've been here one hundred and fifty four years you can cut off some branches that the tree will continue to grow we will be that said that Sean is who we are and ... as a nation I Know you agree that we aren't the nation we are not invited\nHim in ... most of us are not put the blame game ... interest on gas and All right

has been out there or what should be good coverage of the president President now sending up to five thousand troops to the border\nOr a significant display of solidarity for our sovereignty our borders the rule of law as he should\nWe saw about a week ago when at the Guatemala and Mexican border that\nLet people got to the border knock down the fence charged over the police and walk right through Mexico and we now have estimates as high as fourteen thousand people maybe less somewhere in there in around that area that are trying\nTo make it to the southern border the United states and the president and the secretary of homeland security of made it perfectly clear the vice president made it perfectly clear\nThat that's not going to be allowed to happen that we're a nation of laws to turn around that to do with the right way to do with the legal way and in spite of that the marchers keep coming although the president of Mexico did make an offer for some of the migrants if they wanted would be given special consideration to\nWork in southern Mexico a but not many takers apparently according to what I read this weekend you know a lot of people have been asking well okay how did they get so organized to organize them\nAnd who's financing all of this\nUm there's been a lot of conspiracy theories that I've never believed the the only one that made any and it's not a conspiracy\nSee I I when the vice president said last week\nThat he felt that some of the leadership\nAnd Honduras was responsible for promoting the caravan and some countries from South America Venezuela particular we're we're helping a finance some of this that's the only\nBit of information that I found that was somewhat viable as a potential truth um anyway Sam Faddis is with us Sam Faddis he's a senior partner uh and former CIA operative with Thirty years of experience in conducting intelligence operations in the middle east South Asia Europe\nAnd he's worked against the most dangerous of terrorist organizations the planet has ever seen\nHas extensive first hand experience with their methodology and tactics and a welcome to the program sir glad you're with us thanks for serving your country\nThank you for having me pleasure\nWhat so you're you wrote a column midnight I haven't read the whole column ... my read of it is is you think that the vice president was probably right on the mark\nWithout question on the Mark I'm in the actually good actually a great mystery here I mean the guys that organized this are folks from my party called ... which is a Honduran Marxist Party\nA number of years ago supportive of of of the president's ... who basically tried to overthrow the constitution to make himself all presidents for life you're invested with the Venezuelan\nAnd laid out in front of God and everybody all over the Internet that our will and organizing a posting videos and pictures from the marks\nSo again no great great mystery this is the\nWork of guys allied with Venezuela Marxist and that is in effect a giant covert action campaign designed to make the American government look bad and our allies look that\nWell I may look America doesn't have much of a of a choice and and this has to be obvious to people ... and\nI'm listening and watching the comments and some people sort of associating this with ... with anti immigrant sentiment or is he in a phobia or whatever the the charges it's not true all conservatives are saying we don't care where immigrants come from the president\nTalked about a border wall with a big door and that people should respect our laws are constitutional republic\nAmerican sovereignty and come in and if you want to come in we just need to check out make sure that you don't come here with radical ideas that you have the ability to sustain yourself\nAnd don't need our help and then we can let you in and you could become a part of our family to the extent that you want to go through the process and maybe become a citizen I don't think that's too much to ask that's called the legal wet\nIt without question this doesn't have anything to do with a Smith ethnicity or anything to do with race this is yeah we're a nation of immigrants were also with nation of laws come when according to legal immigration procedures period which don't simply get to walk across the border I have always wondered\nBy the way those folks that are actively don't want to control the border why is it the only people who can walk here should be allowed to get it just added stuff if that's the principal\nOr when I'm not I don't want anybody to get hurt because America the president means what he ... and if people rush across our border being at a port of entry or along the border that has not fence and that our military is on the border the military is going to\nBe given the order to stop them now we don't want anybody hurt I don't want and I'm assuming Ninety nine point eight percent of the people coming here are coming here because they come from impoverished countries and they want a better life for themselves and their family that's my guess but nobody can vouch for every single person in that caravan\nAnd for the sake and safety of the American people we can't let that number of people rush across the border have no vetting of the people and sadly maybe amongst the fourteen thousand there's one or five people that come here with intentions to bring us harm\nI agree with you on a ... percent we don't want to hurt and also it has undoubtedly true\nThat most of these people are simply being utilized by folks hostile to the U.S stuff probably been lied to I'm again I'm told that when they get to the border will be allowed to cross on so they are being put in the in the middle of this I'm simply used\nAs human shields on on a harder on the behalf of folks hostile to the United states that is a horrible tragedy because these are mostly just average people will be used\nNow look I Will tell you that you know what I really feel sorry for people I've taken the time I think more than any other person and media in this country\nAnd I've been down to the border Thirteen times and horseback all terrain vehicle boats helicopters I've been there I've seen gang members arrested I've seen drug warehouses I've seen tunnels built um I I've been on the border spot one place in particular did have a wall of an end fencing and I can look across the fence\nAnd on the other side of Mexico I saw nothing but poverty I saw ... what we would almost describe homes built surrounding what looked like what we would describe as a junk yard even and then on the other side of the fence or you know million dollar half million dollar homes in San Diego\nAnd if I'm On that one side and all I see is poverty and and and ... I think I'd want to look across to the other side and I want to go over there as things looked dramatically different and better over here and I don't think Americans you know there were very open people\nBut we can't take in the world's population and we have to have the ability to control our borders and what we're asking is that people do it the right way\nAnd it really just keeps you know what's in our circular argument it's just what we have to do for our own safety\nWithout question of what you've just described is most of the world all of sub Saharan Africa most of South Asia most of Latin America is the argument here on the people who control the border\nThat we are supposed to allow three to four billion people move here because that is what you were actually talking about\nIf you're going to carry this to its ultimate logical conclusion\nAnd we obviously cannot do that we have to maintain control of horrible yeah\nAll right we'll really really appreciate it Sam thank you eight hundred nine for one Sean is our number you want to be a part of the program and we got to take a break right so the biggest part of off year elections mid term elections or turn out that means you showing up\nAnd this election that we have coming up well it's the most important we have seen in decades why because your savings your tax savings that's on the ballot\nThe American economy is on the ballot America's comeback is on the ballot your jobs are on the ballot your kids' future is on the ballot your wages your ... that is also on the ballot and if you're a small business owner your tax cuts are on the ballot\nAnd here's the biggest issue on the ballot who is in charge of America's future politicians bureaucrats the socialist in DC or you you want to preserve the victories of the past two years\nOld get involved this election this November and go to big choice election dot com big choice election dot com\nThey're going to make it simple for you to do your part now you can mail make calls and emails tax knock on doors help neighbors get to the polls go to a big choice election dot com because the only way we lose this year is if you don't show up\nIf you don't turn out go to big choice election dot com do your part and let's not get out worked in November big choice election dot com will come back more your phone call straight ahead eight hundred nine four one Sean toll free telephone number [noise]\nRight here and get out of a media ban room\nAnd ... goes out there remember three year old kid he picks up a pumpkin about about his size\nAnd he's really struggling to carry it and then he drops it in the road and the pumpkin roles away and then you could hear Linda saying only believe we have aren't you going to get the ... pumpkin you got to let it roll the way it goes yup [laughter]\nWhen he said yep Bye bye pumpkin\n...

nominee the Democrats are getting fed up with allies in the ... the deception or you know Hillary and all of them and\nThat's really getting sick and ... by the name Trump\nSo I think they just they just want to silence and they're going to just vote Republican\nLeaning I I Am a realist and I try to look at things as I study these numbers more than you know\nIf the election were held today I think we'd lose the house by about five seats ... if the election were held with the Senate today where we would hold Tennessee we pick up Missouri we pick up Arizona we barely holding the vodka\nI think we have a if people don't vote libertarian in Indiana will win\nIndiana and we'll win North Dakota Florida too close to call Montana too close to call West Virginia leans Democrat although the secretary of state there is now up to in the latest poll Menendez is a long shot to be beaten in New Jersey but he can be beaten\nThat's that's where my head is that today and uh well I'm trying to warn people that this was real that you know hit we have history running against us so there's only going to be one of three results on the morning after the night before\nAnd it's either going to be while the Republicans picked up seats in hold the Senate Republicans while they held on to the house and that's going to be the best case scenario or it's going to be a split decision they pick up seats in the Senate but lose the house\nOr it's going to be a disaster and that's you know speaker elect Nancy Pelosi Senate majority elect Chuck Schumer\nHillary frankly I can see any one of those three scenarios unfolding with the third one the least likely\nSo you know I'd rather go full for the gusto and win at all what are the big problems for the Republicans as they've had forty five retirements\nThat's forty five unknowns on the ballot and the Democrats you know they're getting all of this money poured into these house races because they've given up a lot on the Senate races there going all in the get the house\nAnd to really try to get in people's minds and make them understand that for the Trump agenda to continue we really do need both houses\nBut there's Nancy Pelosi as speaker\nAnd Maxine Waters is a committee chairwoman and Adam Schiff as a committee chairmen and Gerald ... is the chairman it just it's a disaster for us eight hundred dying for when Shaun are toll free telephone number [noise]\n[noise] based\nOn the News I'm rich Dennison the Trump Administration is deploying\nFifty two hundred active duty troops to harden the southern border against a group of migrants seeking asylum in the U.S\nUnits that are normally assign weapons they are in fact the point with weapons\nGeneral ... commander of us northern command and ... says more than two thousand National Guard members are providing border support operations now the migrants are in Central America and won't approach the border for at least two months\nThe White House rejecting claims President Trump's rhetoric is partially responsible for the deadly Pittsburgh synagogue shooting and a series of pipe bomb sent to critics and opponents to the president\nYou can't start putting the responsibility of individual on anybody but the individual who carries out the current White House\nPress secretary Sarah Sanders the president tweeting earlier today that the fake news media is the real\nEnemy of the people this is Fox News [noise]\n[noise]\n[noise] [noise] and\nThen the IRS scandal and then as a atrocities convinced you to you and you don't watch doggone Washington with insiders sources you need to be every day you know ...\nYou want to ...\nTo the small business back home\nCutting taxes and we I\nKnow I'm already know Stein is running for Congress to bring common sense conservative\nMike for our values were tax severe borders\nI'm already know Simon I approve this message\nGlad you're with us twenty five now till the top of the hour a there are about thirty races now we have identified actually\nLook real clear politics they have they have narrow this down to five races that they believe will be the tipping point this actually thirty races kind of like what we have but\nThey ... they have a five seat race they've got the Republicans locked in a two hundred seats they got the Democrats locked into two hundred and five seats\nAnd the remaining seats are up for grabs in other words there are toss ups in other words if we win the seats and that means that Republicans will retain the house control of the house of representatives now that would be the super when you want to go for him in the Senate is looking better but don't take anything for granted I think will have pick ups\nI think will hold Tennessee with Marsha Blackburn I think we can beat Claire McCaskill Heidi Heitkamp I think Joe Donnelly can be beaten these down in the polls I Believe that Christians dissent among could be beating as well how she was up at three in the latest polls beyond any imagination I have\nA poll has a dead heat exactly even five forty six all Nelson versus Rick Scott who's been a phenomenal governor for the great state of Florida\nRhonda Santas is coming back interesting John James Michigan is cut his\nThe leaders stabbing now in half\nAnd it's only a six point raised in Michigan where it was one twenty and so he's doing very well a lot of eyes are paying attention to the latest poll in West Virginia where mentioned is down by two\nIn New Jersey Menendez is only up by three and seeing is very weak and could be the big surprise of the night\nBoth West Virginia and New Jersey to states to watch for potential surprise is not likely but potential uh one of the house races that are on our top thirty is Marty a no Stein is a gold medal is currently serves as the chairman of the board of commissioners for Lehigh County Pennsylvania you're running for\nCongress there in the Pennsylvania seventh district filled Charlie dense empty seat and a big Trump supporter but it it's a tight race where you are you're one of the thirty that will tip the balance of power how's it going there\nAnd I'll say this shot first of all thank you for having me on the show you know out campaigning hard every single day eating every corner of this district\nI got to tell you there's a lot of motivation out there right now I think people are starting to pay attention they understand what's at stake and they went to the Democrats in November six\nWell look the issue to me are simple what we have is we know what the Democrats agenda is to impeach trumpet don't say it open borders sanctuary cities sanctuary states but don't say it keep Obamacare but don't say that either just say work for great health care for all of making some wonderful just like\nYou know keep your doctor your plan and pay less that's their agenda and they want their crumbs back\nBeyond that it's let's hide and not tell people what we really stand for because when we do we know we lose which is why all these we have now another Senate candidate will be exposing tonight\nWe've got Brett ascent in Tennessee we've got Claire McCaskill we got Heidi Heitkamp\nWill unveil another senator tonight all caught on tape all three campaigns saying that they purposely running as moderates but they plan to govern as liberals and their offices are laughing and the case of Tennessee got reticent staff calling the people in Tennessee ignorant so is your opponent out there saying what they're really going to run on what they believe in\nGod I absolutely not you know she's running as somebody she's not at the end of the day the Democrats thinks everybody hates Trump like they do [noise] you know and to me they're completely out of touch they can't see past are angry is Sean and let's not forget don't forget election night two thousand sixteen when the media had two snares out there\nOne of the best the best case if Hitler and one in the worst case of Trump won and yet Donald Trump still wants\nNow we have a president wherever the president is has a record Hillary's true colors have come out contrast that to two thousand eight where it was best case Obama and then look what happened to two thousand ten to ... mid term stink about that the voters corrected their mistake Obama last sixty three house seats and what's there to correct now\nWhat part of the Trump success story to the voters want to change give the crumbs back\nIncrease to regulate its watched jobs go back overseas see now that's that's a difference my opponent goes and talked about that they're hiding behind a bunch of smoke and mirrors and not running for really are but I think the ... the voters are a lot smarter than that right now and we're going to some some people in November six\nOr energy independence a peace through strength trust but verify securing America's borders all of the things that doesn't they hated all because Trump is doing that which they advocated for but they wanted somebody to do it in a way\nThat that that set everything the way they wanted to say it but the problem is the old establishment way of doing things get nothing done you know I agree he can be incendiary he breaks things he throws dishes and breaks them in Washington and he exposes the swamp but he fights hard\nBut we're getting the results in the benefit of that hard fight you know ... they're the type of Republicans the basically want to just sit in power in the corner and and act like they can be friends with people that are saying publicly to kick you and that don't want to be civil\nThat are running you out of restaurants and screaming at the top of their lungs at you so I you know it's it is what it is I the only thing I really want at this point I Want results\nI Want the forgotten men and women to be taken care of I Want as much prosperity as we could ever create for every American and I want to take care of Americans first and then we'll work on helping the rest of the world develop the same system in paradigm that we built that\nHas benefited our population and then I Want security in a world full of radical Islam is and people that that want to wipe America off the map and chant death to America\nI Want to make sure that we have the meanest toughest bad US military and then we can handle any threat that the world throws at us and we can do if necessary we can protect the world against evil\nWhen evil you know raises its ugly head but there's it's happened before and it's going to happen again history has proven in the meanwhile it's you know basically\nYou know temper tantrum politics of never Trump or is there there's still mad they got it wrong you know we wouldn't have to Supreme Court justices that are conservative had they had their way we wouldn't have had the tax cuts we wouldn't have the regulations to roll back\nWe wouldn't have America on a path towards energy independence\nWe wouldn't have had you know all the record numbers of jobs we currently have or the big GDP Growth we have or consumer confidence that we have that's why in eight days when people go out and vote this all matters a major question people have to ask is are you're better off than you were two years ago\nIn terms of the economy peace and prosperity Dr elections and if you want this prosperity this growth to continue if you want America to remain the leader on the world stage if you're not afraid to have a president that is willing to be a tough negotiator on your behalf\nBe a trade or NATO or Kim Jong un we didn't give anything to Kim Jong un nothing and look at what we've gotten back\nA shot at peace and denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula you know if you want a president that says he's going to respect our constitution the rule of law are our laws on borders and security and respect our sovereignty first\nAnd demand that people respect our sovereignty first then you know where to vote this year All right so in the midst of all this chaos and whining and election season\nUm you know what we have so many differences Kavanaugh caravan taxes borders energy foreign policy my guess is\nYou know what you're not getting your
