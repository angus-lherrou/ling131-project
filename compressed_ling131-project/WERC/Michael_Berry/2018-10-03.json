I think this whole thing is a complete an author I Know this is a fabrication now does she pepper and some details here or there about if she's from the area did she go to a party at some point I mean she can claim that some of this stuff might be but it's true in Vegas and certainly not true in a criminal sense\nShe went from saying in this interview that Kavanaugh spike the punch which how would that work\nHe spikes the punch everyone's drinking from that okay so he wants to get the girls drunk she sang right so you can take advantage of what that means but that means everybody's getting really drunk or high school kids it's not like the guys can be drinking this up you know is adding a little ad and a little a boost to make it a little stiffer\nOkay they're drinking punch so they can do that he can't roof the the big bowl of punch because that means you'd be roofing himself and all these guys and girls that everybody right it'd be like poisoning the only water source you have well if you drink from that you as a bad idea so her story is idiotic\nDoesn't make any sense\nFabrication that that's why that's why when you get into the details at least doctor former smart to say I don't remember I don't remember all I Know is that he did this she doesn't really remember anything other than Brett Kavanaugh did that's all she remembers\nThis woman tried to do all this other stuff but the story was too complicated is you can't keep it straight she claims that they would show up wearing their high school uniform they're Catholic school uniform to these parties no no they don't I went to a a Catholic school or private\nSchool in Manhattan we used to parties and parents were gone and we drink beer and not really kegs but you know we'd get into all kinds of booze people weren't showing up wearing their uniforms that's just weird and she added that detail to make it seem authentic but that's that's wrong that doesn't ring true\nAnother detail that came up in the course of this never mind the fact that as I as I've already said she's changed things from her sworn statement she is\nTelling details are telling us details that don't make sense she's saying that Brett Kavanaugh maybe kind of she's not sure raped her which is not something that a person who really believe they were raped\nBy this person would ever say she also graduated a few years ahead of cabinet she's in her twenties and she's going to parties at Fifteen sixteen year old high school parties no no I'm not saying it never happens with people in college don't go to the the high school parties with sophomores in high school that doesn't happen\nI was in college not long ago that would be considered strange\nAnd she's the adult these are high school can I can tell you this when I was in college I Know that every female that I was friends with that my college if they were at a party of high school kids and they thought the girls are being rude feet and raped gang raped\nThey call the police right away right away you got to remember there's a power dynamic here right a a twenty two year old has a lot more maturity and\nWould be in a much stronger position to take action or would feel much stronger position socially when the party of no Fifteen and sixteen year olds\nI coached high school soccer I was twenty two and my kids were Fifteen or sixteen and they thought I Know I was the adult and they were a bunch of kids I wasn't going out doing keg stands within the system the point is it doesn't make sense she's lying\nAnd that interview she gave was obvious it was a disaster anyone is still believes this really turned into an intelligence test\nBecause you can't J.

Wednesday and he'll be on the court\nBut to deeper underlying lesson that all of us should learn\nAbout who these people are how they operate how truly dishonest and vicious they are I Hope that that stays for very long time\nLet me ask you a thirty four days out of an election you were there as a strategist when Reagan became president\nFor the first time in forty years you ran on something and you've got the entire caucus of Republicans house and Senate to agree to nationalize an election and make promises to America you called it the contract with America and that you would you promised you would vote\nOn ten specific items in the first hundred days of what you did accomplish that task and Republican for the most part with a few bumped pickups in the road have been in power since\nUm how to Republicans now I think the anger of the bases beyond anything I've seen in recent years rightly so over what's going on with the Kavanaugh hearings and the Democrats Democrats don't have a vision for the future we had I ate horrible years of Obama\nWe've had two very successful years of President Trump what is the pitch what what should the Congress men and women and senators be saying\nWell first of all the president has done a great job he watches various trips such as Mississippi will be in Minnesota\nAnd he's laying out the case that if you want results\nOf a team called Republicans and if you weren't resistance you've got a team called Democrats and he's been laying up and and you see it in the numbers than people realize the lowest unemployment for African Americans in history lowest unemployment for Latinos a continuous economic growth\nMany good things that are happening I think the president has set the stage now to pit and spent the last five weeks\nTelling us what's coming next\nWe've got this much damage you know ...

I saw genuine\nShocking surprise and she goes well but I didn't know that but that was very nice do you if you offered that I didn't know\nThey should be referred to the D.C bar then for violation of professional world\nI I may I may very well come to conclude that eventually and I'm perfectly happy to accept that\nI can buy that and I'll tell you something that really bothers me about her story and as an old prosecutor who tried sex crimes cases here's the one thing about her story besides everything else we talked about that doesn't make any sense any victim in a situation like that goes to where people are for safety\nNow why is her story not include her going to those people\nBecause if she had done that\nIf she ... literally if if what she says occurred and if she had gone to those people get what they would have remembered it in order for her to have a story that holds up without anybody knowing about it she had to leave the house\nI don't know though and look maybe you know 'cause we're talking about we all know that there are real evil predators there are people\nThat do murder and rape innocent people there are people that will drug and rape people I eat look at the bill Cosby case\nYeah even though even though the week was proposed by senator Coons who has now like you can tell disappeared you can't find him now he's on a milk carton\nYeah no he's Michigan actually after he got everything you want what did what a Jeff Flake get out of this\nLook I I don't think anybody can predict what the FBI now pending over their findings in the cabinet probe um you know they still have not interviewed Christine Ford but I Would imagine the FBI has not doesn't need to interview Christine Ford they have\nAll of her testimony don't they she testified under oath or very long period of time no interview by the FBI is going to add a thing\nYeah well it gets very very tough and very scary but I Will say this if we lose due process if we lose the presumption of innocence if it's ... and this is not America anymore\nOr Republicans shot only from Republican yeah well if they were consistent they'd be demanding an FBI investigation into Keith Ellison a and Juanita Broderick claim of rape bum Bill Clinton because it's not that far away from the timeframe or old Bob Menendez\nWith under age ... prostitutes in the village and the tea are\nDumb but it's interesting that they don't want to investigate any of these things in their silence is deafening because it's not about the issue it's about power politics sadly as usual alright thank you both the Joe diGenova Victoria Toensing eight hundred nine four one Sean toll free telephone number will get to your calls\nComing up straight ahead Hannity tonight nine eastern on Fox News will tell you about that and more straight ahead [noise]\n\nTo continue to if they have by increasing charades Charles cancer and donors are important to us because you get the feeling that you have a team\nWhen it comes to research an advancement there's some things that only we can do because we have the resources we focus and so she doesn't\nSeem to children's research hospital finding sure dating show him\nLearn more saint Jude ...
