{"month": "10", "state": "AL", "station": "WERC", "content": "Very well done sir you are way ahead of the curve congratulations well what we teach folks is to follow a plan and we called the baby steps we think it is the shortest raped shortest route to wealth okay\nAnd a baby step one is a thousand dollar saved too is debt free but the house you've obviously done those three as an emergency fund of\nThree to six months of expenses you've obviously done that\nFor five and six you do simultaneously that's Fifteen Percent of your income going into retirement as baby steps for five is kids college doesn't apply here six is pay off I'll surely so that brings us into our question now\nThe way I look at paying off your house with a non retirement non emergency fund money which is sounds like if I heard you right you got fifty five K. and miscellaneous investments that's non retirement and not your emergency fund is that right\nOh that's correct and you oh eighty on your house did you say is that right\nYup okay and um [noise] the uh the way I look at that is if you owed\nThirty thousand bucks on your house\nWould you go borrow fifty thousand to invest it in stocks and bonds and my answer will quickly be no\nYeah and in essence if you do a column of your assets and a column of your liabilities of what your own and what you owe that's called a balance sheet you probably heard that before and uh uh the balance sheet says that those things offset so it has the same mathematical effect\nAs if you had borrowed on your home to buy the stocks\nThat I buy that if we if we don't if we don't use that money to pay down on the house now I Would not to clean out your emergency fund I Would be willing to take it down a little bit to\nThree to six months of expenses it you know twenty three thousand or twenty two thousand or whatever was might be a little sick I might pull that down to ten or something you'd be safe as a single guy making fifty with a ten thousand dollar emergency funds\nSo I'd probably pull ten or twelve Thirteen out of that and I take the fifty five throw it at the house and you know that house paid off in a year what's the house worth\nOr if they were about a hundred and ... that's not bad\nTwenty two ... only three years old with a ... four hundred and ten thousand dollar house it'd be pretty nice you know and then take and then you take that old payment you used to have and all of the freedom that you have mathematically now in your budget and you use that that fifty five will be back in twenty minutes\nYou'll be amazed how fast you can rebuild and how fast you can build investment portfolio when you don't have any payments at all and that's the reason for doing it plus here's what's kind a weird you've made really unbelievably wise decisions for twenty two years old I mean you you're just you're killing your head\nAnd a ... you know what else will happen is did you remember when you signed the mortgage\nDid you feel emotional weight uh\nYeah kind it started off with I've actually already refinanced one\nWhich I mean when did the original deal the first time and you went from debt free young debt free with money in the bank to now I got a mortgage do you remember feeling the weight on the oh that\nYeah especially when it said Thirty years and yeah\nThat's what I'm Talking about because there's more going on here than simple math there's complicated math that entails risk\nAnd and even even relational and I'm spiritual things the borrower is slaves of the window that's the way you felt Thirty years oh I Can't stand as I got to get rid of this well the same thing will happen in reverse but on the positive side of hey when you don't have any\n... no wait nothing on your shoulder it changes the way you play\nIt changes the way you do you're investing it changes the you get so I got I got so enthusiastic dude when I got free with my investing and with my generosity both that both of them went into outrageous mode very quickly and so yeah I don't get that fifty five back so freaking fast\nThat it it'll it'll it'll come back faster than in the first time you've got a lot faster it's not gonna take five years this time I'm ... but you got more income now too so that's not fair but I mean mathematically relation Lee spiritually emotionally\nWhen you're free you just do better\nAnd you make better choices and you're already making really good choices so all of that to say yes\nI Would catch all the investments that are non retirement yes I Would take that emergency fund down to about ten\nOr that doesn't quite get us there so you got a lenient out of your budget and cash flow out the rest of that thing and finish it up within you know four or five months the debt free on this whatever it is six months whatever it takes\nAnd then when the house has done than you than you if you want to build up that emergency fund a little bit fine but then kick those investments in the butt get them going again and you will prosper\nYou are on your way sir honor to talk to you very very well done\nWine is an Indianapolis Hi Wayne welcome to Dave Ramsey show\nThanks day and I just want to first say God Bless you for all the work you do it's really made a difference in my life\nWill thank you ... help today\nWell my wife and I have been a leading the life of ... for about two years now and uh we've pretty much become that for other than our student loans which we're working on and then we ended up getting a now I got pregnant with her\nFirst child in April so say we took your advice and stop putting everything toward their debt snowball and started a bank you know all of that is good\nAnd uh as of this month we we now have enough for her to take her for a month maternity leave I'm paying for you for us which is great\nAnd that but the problem is is Murphy has decided to strike a\nLast week we got a bill in the mail from our city here and they replaced and sidewalks here on our lots and or the bills for forty four hundred dollars and a with a baby on the way here and another a few months we don't have that kind of money in our cash flow to pay that off and twelve months before they put a lean on at home so\nMy question is um what would you do that in that situation that we we ... our maternity leave fun than pay that off or what do we do\nWhen somebody do\nA December the beginning of December\nOkay well the game plan that will usually out loans for folks is push paws on your total money make over your debt snowball Kobe becomes pile up the cash when baby comes pushed play again and take all that cash and throw it at your debt correct\nAs long as baby mama come home and everybody is cool but the cash is just to make sure everybody's school there is no issues and we're not it's not really for maternity leave unless you have to have it to eat with but I mean it's not um it it's so that we can use it so how much cash will be got piled up or will you have piled up by decide what what\nSeventy five hundred dollars this month and like I said she is knowing that you're wanting to take the three months off the bond with the baby on such and we can't do it on just my income alone so um that's why we were smart about this and it set that\nGold and make sure that you know so we got from now until December to continue to save right correct and what other debts do you have in your debt snowball how much I'm just about a hundred and fifty dollars a month as what we have and then um other than our car payments and you have you have actual that balances you need to pay off\nTime no not on your car and material on your phone rallies\nAnd often dollars you know got well then the four thousand will be you're that you're paying off out of this guy and then as far as set aside enough for her to the three months so you have the cash you should\nTake guys this is James child's producer of the Dave Ramsey show I'm excited to announce the we're now

now\nAnd one of the shower up to the army chief\nOf staff a drain with those\nMe what the name is again a drain that that goes into the bottom of the shower stall\nCame with a Ninety degree brass pipe\nStraight and the ABC comes up\nOn all okay into it and he put a new from Washington or write anytime\nOkay so it's like a compression fitting\nExactly and it's about an inch long and and here's my dilemma when it comes out the bath tub it was a great big hole underneath the original Plame was put in for the NFL\nThe mice were coming in and so I boxed all that and so now you basically you have to have a boxer with the rock climbing or going out to the septic system and then the shower sits on top of a on top of that\nAnd when I put the shower base in I can I'll never be able to get to the pie trap again it will be buried in that box um and\nI Can't afford to have a week in there and and so the PVC has been tested no leaks there that's all well lit up really nice my concern is that in the brain washer and and so the question I have four years this [noise]\nWhen I put that in the ... I guess I should call it out of Washington [noise] if I put some silicone seal on that gas as well and then fly it down into the drain\nAnd it goes around the b._b._c. and then I tight and then not on top of it [noise] um the one that silicone dried I should never have a leak there is what I'm thinking [noise]\nAh 'cause if I get a week on ever going to know I have a leak because I Can't get it on eat the shower vase once I put it in\nHa ha ha I wanted your thoughts on on does that make sense that um\nTell me about the ... like the clear nylon plastic ... rubber arise\nIf it's rubber ISIS the black piece of rubber it's frowned about an inch about an inch tall [noise] um and it it when you put it into the [noise]\nThe drain itself you got there compression nut and it's supposed to you know basically compressed that um but the b._b._c. can move a little bit and I had been moved a little bit I'm I'm afraid that seal is going to break 'em and then I'm going to get a leak and this is going to be all over the water's just got to go down that box I built in of actually ... out\nTime is that the end of the world I mean can you is that a cesspool if that happened\nI got it terribly ah I have to crawl and eat them all on the tear the blanket on\nOkay 'cause it's kind of the shower is kind of in the middle ... and I'm I'm a ...\nIt was like yeah take up the whole sharp pain or anything like that\nIf I could take up the whole shower pan but once I put the top half of the shower off so it's a full size to ... at the bottom happen you've got top out when I when I put that path on and I don't recall and those two together like the manufacturers said it was supposed to [noise] I'm never going to get it out [noise]\nSeeing them come from underneath\nI thought I'm going to have to come from underneath the mobile home if I ever have a week but the challenges that probably never going to know if I have\nA league right Ylan Ross right yeah right and then it might come back so one of the problems I have with the silicone and maybe I don't know your answer to this is I don't know if the silicone will compromise ...\nOkay I'm In and I don't know I wouldn't have to look into that if I put ... ... is there a way to double up to ... you\nKnow it's it's it's all designed to to work together as one drain unit you know so it's about an eighth of an inch thick you know we're pretty sure that that's about an inch cause a slide down it grips quite a bit\nI I'm also trying to think of all the times they've done plumbing whether those ... are ever failed it's usually the pipe that failed okay I'm In quite honestly a lot of times taken those washers off a re used them\nUm [noise] [noise]\nSo I guess if I were you um first of all I I really think of it sounds and you hit a leak and you didn't know it and the it rots out and everything\nYou know we don't want to do it but it's probably not the end of the world it is terrible it's you know not like space shuttle here [laughter] I mean you can get it and you can you can repair it I'd be comfortable with the ... washer\nUm I don't think I Would use the silicone unless I was released certain\nThat that wasn't going to compromise or the need for him and I'm not going to we'll compromise some types of products like that\nYeah and I I I'm I'm not certain that it won't to you and that's why I thought I'd give you call and you know if it fails five years from now that's one thing if it fails a week from now after I get the whole thing put together that would be kind of disappointed\nI Would think the NEA pretty more should be good for a while\nOkay I'll give it a shot [noise] All right good luck to you John yeah Thanksgiving", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Cathedral Church of the Advent", "city": "Birmingham", "day": "07"}
