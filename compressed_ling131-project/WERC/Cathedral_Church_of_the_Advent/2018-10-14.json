I got a Nineteen sixty vet that's rebuilt from the frame up and it's got a wonderful three twenty seven to ... do for ... dual start for barrels on it it's a beast or not but it is a project car I mean they you you know it it runs all most all the time\nBut I'm not getting in that car and and depending on it to be somewhere I have to be it's more of a fun thing to have\nIn the garage and I think that's what you're sixty four is going to be some day um but if you want to sell the Prius and moved to a different car that's just a cheap car was what you would have spent\nOn the truck motor and that kind of stuff and move into a little different vehicle there as long as you're paying cash for it it's a it's a who move up kind of a thing then I'd be okay with that if you want to do that but um but I don't think I'd let that truck get away and I want to do the project because it's a cool project but I wouldn't do it right now [noise]\nJosh is with us Josh is in Madison, Wisconsin Hi Josh how are you\n[noise] I'm good how are you do better than I deserve what's up\n[noise] so I've got a question um regarding a credit card for business trips and let me kind of explain the situation here 'cause I'm looking for someone by um my wife and I have never been through a few but we actually just recently paid off all of our debt at about two and a half weeks ago\nGreat congratulations\nThank you um I work from home with a relatively smaller company okay and they send us on business trips every once in a while and we are required basically ... you know pay for some of those business expenses during the trip\nThat money is definitely reimbursed for the company that we're going to fee pays for that but we have to kind of want that money I had the time I'm\nWe pulled out all of our credit cards except for the one of the business trips because we don't have money\nThe you know set aside to be able to pay for the un says\nI might have been much of the expenses run a month\n[noise] well I'm not I'm not traveling every single month but there I mean every time I go on a business trip it it's anywhere from a thousand two thousand dollars covering the hotel mood and then you're going to get the money directly can you get the money back within thirty days\nYeah OK correct so I mean we're we're we hang that often and obviously we're not going to using the credit card for our own personal use to\nThe animal the religion that you need to see that one time you need to ... from the ... one time with two thousand dollars in a separate ... new checking account that as a debit card on it and it's used only for one thing reimburse ...\nBusiness travel and use your money on your debit card and you pray your little company doesn't go broke and not pay you\nBack a little\nCompany you're taking a big risk\nSure you're\nYou're the bank or for the small company that is too small to even fund their own employees travel\nThat's pretty scary [noise] at some\nPoint they may go belly up and you're going to be left holding the two thousand dollar ticket in your hand that's the risk you're taking so\nLong now so the company that when you go and visit they don't\nPay you they pay your company and then your company pays you write your company goes ... they're going to take that money from that other company and pay the bills with it and you're going to be left out in the cold someday\nSure I've seen it happen I'm Thirty years or seen happen a lot\nOkay so then where does that where does that fit in with\nThat leaves you well known as up a creek because you're taking a risk for this little bitty companies that's what I'm pointing out for you know what I Would do it all with a debit card if you want to do that that's fine but at least then you're admitting that you're taking this risk I Will tell you I'm going to go back to your little bitty company and say gosh I'm Out of that\nI don't like borrowing money I don't want to borrow money anymore if you want me to take business trips why don't you give me the money to take business trips and then when they pay you back you'll get your money back ...\n... it's only two thousand dollar right\nI don't ask people to travel here with their money I got a twenty eight year old young person this trying to feed their dogs and their kids\nAnd keep their lights on and I'm going to send them out and put airline tickets on there on them know this company here pays for their airline tickets and we pay for the rental car and we pay for their hotel and their food when they travel I don't ask somebody here to travel and\nAsked them to pay for it and we pay back we just pay for it would give them a debit card we give them the cash when they leave the place you're company should do that for you and you should push 'em on it because you're taking the risk otherwise but if you don't want to change the situation you need to funded with cash build a debit card do away with the credit goes\nIs that gonna make you how that's going to make your stomach because now you're realizing there's real this is Dave Ramsey show [noise]\n\n\nHey guys this is James Giles producer of

system you know you're buying the furnace\nThe heat air and uh you got a system of Duckworth pipes that run through out the house that distribute the heat and air that you just paid for\nBut it's out of ... there doesn't get to those rooms it doesn't help much right and if that furnaces real efficient but you're losing that heated air along the highway of duct work\nIs not very efficient is\nSo that's why we've brought in Tracy Martin and she is with a company called arrows seal and you can check this out an arrow seal\nDot com but dre she helped me out what what's going on there was\nScary things or had any ill what's going on I mean you you nailed it precisely the furnace itself make the air and temperature control in the air but without the highway and you you as you put it that that

the end of it right\nYeah and if you have a ... is not going to work very well ray got old ... ... yeah so I don't know if you've got the data for this but do you mean your thoughts on it a typical home we gotta gamut of age tones out there\nUm would you say most people's duct work is compromised\nYeah actually I Do have the data and yeah and it's from the department of energy or the department of energy estimates that ... Ninety five percent of home how leaky duct work\nAnd another misconception that's out there and then you know you might hear someone say well I knew that work on your effort can delete well it's just because you put two pieces of anything together and it's prone to having you know points of leakage\nNow you may not know this in fact I Know you don't do this but when I was Seventeen years old my job was to run Duckworth and I don't think duck works installed like this anymore because what I used to have to do and I had to do it right that when we put those two foot pieces together\nWe didn't have to run little heck said screws\nAnd make sure those duck works were connected I'm not so sure that's done anywhere anymore [noise]\n[noise] yeah I mean there's there are and different approaches to the installation of growers in that day sitting at the the two ... and certain states across the country have codes now that require that for the field when it's installed tell\nWhen you were saying that Ninety five percent figure of duck works leaky in the United states first thought I had it sounds like we need new duct work at our home so we need newer technology duck works that probably help huh\nIt would ... Harris he'll help yeah\nWell it's going to go there too because well you know you're not going to run a business of Ninety five percent of the homes of leaky a duck work if we changed it you got you got fifty years to get your ghetto editorials All right so um so it's a good\nBet that every one that's listening they're not getting the efficiency of that foreign as they're not getting that heated there\nTo the places they want so what is zero seal\nThe deal is a technology that been developed about Twenty years ago and by the department of energy act really uh-huh yup down at the UC Berkeley lab mhm\nUm and it when it was developed to help make the duck system more efficient ... that the best way to put it at the uh let those tiny holes and crack and that our our typical into an adopted them mhm and and also at the at the long term\nAnd you know almost permanent type illusion and wants to do this technology\nAnd it failed at the duct work and it's guaranteed for ten years but it's been a strength tempted to last up to forty or so in those cases and as long as you're going to be in your home\nRight right so it's kind of a line or\n[noise] [noise] well kind of I I some people\nAt the temple if I look at it like kind of like six of flat in a way okay bye\nAnd to be real precise about it it doesn't actually coat the ... when it does is it find the whole okay like a balloon popping a hole in it mhm you're gonna have air escaping out of that whole right kind of pressure on different ...\nAnd our technology and able to find those holes and then the alone from the outside in\nNegative ... exactly that's exactly right yeah it was kind of sucks it in low on the ... ... is that right okay All right so ah so I had this done to my home and I I don't know when it was but I'm going to say\nThirteen Years ago and and I notice the difference immediately so if a homeowner\nFirst of all you got to find a deal that's installing that I'm assuming that you've got air soul dot com\nThere is located or their car okay so I called this company up and I say I want you to check my ... my\nFace and ours is an itself will check to see how leaky the ... that we do a before and after type comparison when they hook up the machine they can run a test to see what they\nCharge you ... you know like a blower door test for a house\nIt's a it's kind of like what's called the duct blaster tests they can learn okay I'm ... different dealers approach it differently and you know what they may or may not charge for that\nBut there's other ways Gary any you I can walk around my house you can walk around your house\nAnd just use your eyes to look for signs of duck linkage it's really it's really pretty easy to find very happy and I talked to my my mom and my sister about it and that they were able to just walk around and find evidence that oh gosh I could have what kind of evidence they find well\nUh one of the easiest of course you mentioned that right when we began to the segment here in it and why people think it's normal\nFor that that far room to be colder than the rest", "show_name": "Cathedral Church of the Advent", "year": "2018", "city": "Birmingham", "day": "14"}
