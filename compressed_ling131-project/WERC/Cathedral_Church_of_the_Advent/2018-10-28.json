I mean I assume you've got good healthcare coverage\nI Do but they won't cover it because I don't like talking about that\nI'm saying if you had a major health issue you know that that would that would eat up forty grand but it wouldn't really wouldn't I mean you to get the forty grand if you got you know the ... co pay it that's a lot that's that'd be a million dollar expense you know so it'd be very and I think you're okay at forty grand\n\nAnd if you declare that then we don't have to declare there's an emergency I'm I'm just process in this with you because I'm trying to figure out a way to do it\n[noise] okay um\nAnd if you want a super emergency fund backup later you can do that but you don't have to feel like you've violated\nA ... a principal the process to do this then\nOkay that makes me feel better is that logical to you I think so yeah I think so\nHave you got a good friends or family or past or somebody else when you and walk in with you on the just the whole process on this and the decision making and everything\nYou know not doing this in a variety of national what I've been told I don't have to worry about it but I Am [laughter] Bye bye good counsel was that what you're saying not necessarily good counsel but friends and family say oh you know the kids and\nFamilies are wary about who have been crap I'm Talking about somebody that loves you enough to look in your eyes and go really seriously what are you doing here I mean our our yes you should do this you know but it's not just a I mean if somebody really thinking this through with you not just casually over coffee going\nGood accountability good counsel in the multitude of council there's safety and that's what I'm looking for but I I don't I don't hear anything holding me back here in your situation very interesting question though very interesting situation\nThanks for calling in and we appreciate you being a listener wrote Rami is with us in Columbia South Carolina is it Rami roaming\nThrough me high romey high how can I help\nYeah I um I wanted to reach out to you I was recently called called by a kind of a a major insurance provider and they were trying to sell me on a farm insurance products so I'll let you know term insurance and uh with ability which I agreed with them that I needed\nAnd um but I don't like the prices they quoted me were rather high so I went ahead and you know reached out to one of your recommendations and whatnot and got some or some other coach there were a lot better ... and ah and reach back out to them and mentioned it to them and they had mentioned yeah well those are those are kind of like\nLetting those insurance companies aren't good their um their their ratings are high financially you want to go with the more higher expensive\nInsurance companies are going to they're going to be around in the next Twenty years you know and I'm going to show you yeah I was like oh okay um so I Need to buy so he basically described as the Mercedes of ensuring either by said if you don't want to be in like a you know a Chevy yeah so I wanted to get your thoughts on that\nWell that's an absolutely ludicrous way to solve the objection okay there are there are a financial ratings for life insurance companies if they do not meet a certain level of financial criteria the state that you're operating in will not allow them to sell insurance they're\n... they're almost broke the state will let them sell in your state\nYeah they have to make minimum criteria to just financial solvency to do that number one number two if you have term in life insurance and your term life insurance company goes broke\nUnless you're sick and can't get insurance you just go buy more insurance it's kind of like if your car is your check the financial stability of your car insurance company lord no [laughter] right now they go broke you just go get another one\nYou know if you've got a recipe and progression of goes broke you just get a different one you don't think about this progressive have the money to pay my claim\nYou know but you can look I Am best ratings of someone at the sand or insurance his website and they are all financially solvent as much as this group or that sell any of the stuff that's a that's a complete land a BS rum Rome is what it was\nOkay well that makes you feel a lot better 'cause I yeah I went ahead and went with the the less expensive option anyways it's like well I wouldn't I wouldn't do that from my family ah yeah\nYou know in order to now the al ... and by the way you called called me yeah [laughter] right right yeah that was when they call you that tells you the one thing right there but [laughter]\nTo it which is you know just\nSo that it can be angle to the come tour the leg in other words if the legs are flared out a little bit er and then an angle that little adjustable nylon nailing glide works better if you get straight legs just a straight ... fun [noise]\nOkay great man in the Home Depot Lowe's that was kind of late that's where you get\nThe ... yeah and it's only laughing because of the other day I was ... one of the a stores and I was just looking for some things for the house and I was near the\nGlide I'll [laughter] there was probably eight feet of just different glides and back in my heart and we're days there used to be about two feet and there was all different kinds of ... which is okay\nAnd so yeah yeah all hardware stores will have all kinds of choices and you may find one that you prefer more than the one I just talked about\nAlright or very good way I'd probably stick with an eye on it that way with thanks very much appreciate\nAnd you're all you're quite welcome thanks for the call at ... ... by by\nAll right again it's eight hundred and eighty two three eight to five five if you've been trying to get through and haven't been able to now is a good time lines are open again it's eight hundred eight to three to five five we've been going through our weather ... that we have on our website it scary Sullivan online dot com we've kinda taken a look\nAround the windows and around the doors and uh\nThe address those issues but there's other openings or in your house that you may not be aware of and uh one of 'em is there's a lot going on on the foundation of your oh\nI'm In really take a look at a you know on the outside above grade\nYou can always do the inside later but above grade and take a look for any types\nOf cracks in the wall themselves they always say there's more cracks on the outside then there is on the inside and if they're on the above grade there's probably some below grade too but let's address the one's above grade when you're examining the foundation and you see cracks in the foundation those can be patched up\nWith either a zip it mortar which is a neat little package mortar that can be applied to a vertical surfaces\nI'm you could also use a hydraulic\nA concrete patch a little darker and color in most cases and I'm also dries really fast but if it's above grade I don't think you really need the hydraulic patch you just need some zip it murder to cover it up also look at that ledge if you've got a brick house\nOr encountered this not long ago when I said really taken that walk around the house examining needs things keeps not only moisture out but keeps insects out and I have a an invasion of aunts\nAnd I'm sure we can always talk about using products are getting exterminator and take care of the answer but really why not take care of their entry point\nInto your home and when you're looking for a a problems when you're doing your weather ... and we just talked about cracks in the foundation take a look at the brick\nOr sometimes right on that foundation sometimes getting the binoculars out and just kind of looking at the whole field or bricks which you're looking for is cracked the brick [noise]\nA crack mortar missing mortar and that's exactly what I found which was right on the a ledger the foundation and that's where I was having the invasion of the ants coming and they're marching right through the mulch and up into the crack in\nKnow we get we solved that problem by getting in\nA some patching materials ... than solving that problem but\nThat's the type of things you're looking for a crack brick a missing mortar a cracks in foundations and get those things sealed up also you've got utility pipes you get ... phone lines electrical lines cable lines male slots all those items that I just mentioned are\nPenetration into the envelope of your home and addressing those issues with a ... keep the moisture out some parents have to do that\nAnd again whenever you're doing a like a gap between uh say gasoline is run through the foundation or phone lines or whatever [noise]\nA low expansion phone to get back into that grows and seal it up is ideal yeah you can use talking if you want in fact if you want to finish it off with talking that's fine too but I get that low expansion phone there's different types of ... high expansion low expansion if it doesn't talk about the degree of expansion\nOf the low expansion forms usually used for doors and windows so you'd just for phones for doors and windows and\nAnd that's what you'd want to use around or even the host bibs that are going through\nThe um through the foundation also take a look at the clothes dryer vent boy I'll tell you what their big gaps around those things\nAre great entry point for mice and a lot of places not far off the ground if you take that ... and you can just take your pick your hand and just see if you can shake it wobbling around I think you'll find that a lot of cases\nA ears does wobble around you can connect that to the brick or the woods citing caulk around that or again getting some low expansion foam in there and then securing that hood will seal that up and keep critters in coal there's from a going in\nWas it to my son says in the laundry room was always freezing cold and sure enough\nUm that to Dr Vince close\nMy goodness there was an inch around that entire hose that entire vent pipe and once that was sealed up and connected certainly took care of that problem\nAt our phone number is eight hundred eight two three eight to five five and a got a couple of callers and we've got a couple of lines open to take a break come

plaster you probably got issues with wood that has rounded so river friend Richard in from amateur on which you know we're talking about all the time but ah Richard got some good news Richard welcome that homeless Gary Sylvan\nHey Gary how you doing guys been busy I haven't you know it it has\nBeen busy as do all of our ... so uh uh so the ... must be getting still rotting in\nAnd out and just keep getting older it'll never stop it'll never to exactly let's talk\nA little bit about would we had a call yesterday in fact I recommended your product it was a I think one you and I talked about many times and that was a wood column I can't remember how old the house was when there was a new one or old one but\nShe had some of the wood that was rotted and there were suddenly cocked underneath it so it was hold water and it was a disaster\nAnd said you know what I Do can I mean just cannot patch it and then went yeah you can yeah yeah can you take us through that project I mean is that something a lot of us can tackle\n... yeah yeah that's something that you hear about all the time is a good rotting Page's columns and whether there's solid columns or whether they're how columns uh there's there's a there's definitely a way to fix yourself um and re manufacture different a pox the products that are ideal for making those repairs\nUm what what starts to bed with what starts to rot\nI'm rather than having to replace entire column which you do is you use are toxic products called liquid would and where he talks to patch up those bases and it's a real simple process um any of your home or can can use these products\nI'm there to to talk to them and our liquid would product of penetrating pox he would hurt her so where the would start school go bad and it gets a rod in hockey and soft right um\nWhat'd you do is you brush your way to lose crumbling materials that that that would rock creates and then you want to saturate all that or anything with law are using that liquid with product and go liquid would will penetrate in a deep into those fibers\nAnd ultimately it solidifies and heart and all that soft material hides it all back together\nAnd make some monolithic repair heartening all that would\nSo I'm so structurally it strong\nYeah absolutely absolutely the the liquid would has a ... string trading over five thousand PSI so there's a loan bearing type repair product chair this isn't just a just a a ban be it's gonna last until you sell the house this is something that's going to last\nFor generations to come and uh you know just a quick quick cover up ten product\nAnd then you'll take your ... pox and smoothed out at that point\nYeah exactly so you want to saturate those routed areas with that liquid water and then uh you actually apply what a pox while that liquid would still wet\nTacky and sticky and ... the ... ... is another part of proxy but rather than be liquid ... more like a party or filler mhm and you use that to patch and replace the missing sections of all it\nCan fill in and rebuild or anything that's missing and they can do barrel checks and cracks and splits in the woods or you can rebuild entire\nChunks of of missing materials you need to so there's really no limitation to the to the scope of or repair that you can make up something like that so\nYeah that was actually one of her concerns and I'm sure you hear this all the time and you know with the column she was getting ready to just dig all this out and she was in me whether that would be a good idea or with her column fall down basically\nAnd um go well you know ... you don't want to go all out right away I mean we\nYou know and then I went in explained kind of how the liquid would works and boy that is that the tickets for the for the call because you just can't do that with any product\nBall right right yeah there's a lot of a component products on the market that uh like I said there are there ... there are there are a quick cover up type product or they're or they're meant for interior used or something like that so you know when you're when you're making that type or repair you definitely want to make sure that you're using something structural\nUnstable or something like a two part solid a proxy liquid ...\nNo you folks at every turn him good news about these products I Know because for years or for a few years that I've been talking about that I became aware of and I know you're really involved in the restoration industry\nAnd and now reaching out to you know the D. I. white guy and it can really take care of some of these issues around their home and we were sending them ... or send the Amazon but now they can go to your local local ...\nRight exactly yeah we're we're pretty excited I'm Greta ... what a pox products or\nHave just been added to the age distribution network and uh\nUh so we're we're just trying to get the word out because a lot of the white customers um they don't necessarily understand that a lot of the stores and they apparently are hardware stores in stores um you know the the owners of those places are looking to those customers to find\nOut what type of products they need right now and now our liquor who would have ... products are available through that age distribution channel\nAnd so if you can't hide it at your local a store already a year or ... or ask your you know the the outer banks the paint manager of a local store and they can they can order those products right and they can they can get them on the shelf for yeah\nSure sure hum rape products and certainly make those projects that look a kind of overwhelming a obtainable and um you know as you just kind of walk through this is a project most people can tackle at their home\n... ... yeah exactly are we simplified the products they're they're ... years are easy to mix there say to your ... year sees are our guests\nAre nasty chemicals involved with these products um and you don't you don't have to be a pro you just have to be able to follow through simple instructions and uh\nAnd anybody can can use an and create a successful repair\nSuper so that's called liquid wouldn't wouldn't pox let me shift gears a little bit because of folks that have older homes and they hit plaster walls there always challenged", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Cathedral Church of the Advent", "city": "Birmingham", "day": "28"}
