{"month": "10", "state": "AL", "station": "WERC", "content": "You're making a little profit\nYou know get a lot\nNow it's about a thousand in mind I mean it's definitely not and all that that's a and R D ...\nKnow that your gross that's before you count like and see and major repairs that come up\nThat that's the gross cash flow the different ... and the payment so twelve thousand dollars a year minus vacancy mine is a an occasional eating an air system or a roof occasionally you're you're making a little bit of money\nBut yet you know ... yeah fire five ... five grand for ... something like that I'm On a year something like that mhm Oprah I Am right I mean some years will be better than others and that caught on a bunch of rental property shark and trying to do these things are my Dutch\nUm the uh uh in what your household income\n[noise] um we bring about a hundred and ten gross to tell you what do you own your home our primary\nUh we just heard to stay on ten months ago we\nOwe to eighty worth about three hundred\nAnd ... and so he's saying um you've got a hundred and thirty and uh fifty or so so you got a hundred and eighty if you saw both of these give or take 'em expenses that you could throw at you or to eighty\nAnd that's the thing to do your saying we're making a little money um I like rental property these are good runners I think I Want to keep it and that's the discussion on my right\n[noise] yeah 'cause my thought is on as soon as bring down we have about ten thousand dollars in and got the ... um we combined probably twelve thousand 'cause they took a we had a lot but we took a bite out of Android after that so we have any help\nYou out there now is like baby steps are very clearly defined that you do write one before you do the other you can't shorten do them or you can have your plan but you can't call them up so I won't let you guys are going to do your plan okay if you're going to my plan you'd rather check today and be free\nYeah the only reason I I was hesitant because not because you're doing airplane and you\nKnow it's just at the end of the year I'm always really tough and I feel you know a fireman\nSo it was just there in the event that um my condition that don't come through for the next three nights I'm I was afraid to liquidate at Atlantic I don't think an actor in life being a tough spot so I figure on Christmas at everything while then I Would just write the check\nMhm okay that triplets\nOkay uh uh the\nUh uh you know ... ...\nYou're not making a ton of money on these properties you don't have a ton of margin in them\nSo they could flip on your pretty quick if a ... at a minimum you know a good compromise between the two of you I'm a rental property nut I Love it I Love real estate and I want to keep 'em if you want to keep 'em in the big one that got more margin in it and more equity in it is the most appealing to me\nThe three the two hundred Ninety five over one sixty five on and so on my way one and dumped the other one\nThe fifty thousand to move the needle much but the one that only got a fifty thousand more equity you know making anything on that and that you're in gash bread on that at all and which means that it could turn upside down on ya meaning if it went vacant for three months you can be writing checks\nBy the ... money on that house\nIf you go to three months vacancy if the market softened up so you just don't have any wiggle room and that thing so it's as much a liability is is it is an asset in your situation even though technically okay so I'm probably dumping the little one as a compromise between the two of them and um\nAnd if you're going to hold the other one the new guys just got a you know we'll start working these baby steps the right way\nAnd following them through in getting the emergency fund done and get a proper emergency fund in place and and if your income as volatile enough that you need to have an additional account to cover of our income volatility to separate from your emergency fund than you could build that went up to\nAnd build your some cash position so that you're not constantly you know in the lurch back and forth when you're making good money overall but you kind of living hand to mouth anyway\nAnd that that's that's the cycle you're trying to break so good question thanks for joining us\nOpen phones a triple eight eight to five five two to five Mike is with us in San Francisco Hi Mike how are you\nDave how're you doing better than I deserve what's up\nSo I just started in October here um and I got my that's what I got my start are set so I have um with the money make over um I got an eight hundred in my emergency fund film among baby step on um the first time I'm doing a budget and and it's a mess it just seems like I just can't dial it in\n... and you only have one dollar um every dollar okay I Am and they're all going in\nA while I just feel like I I kind of make an estimate of where I what I think things are going to cough and then I just either it seems like it it goes over and then there's things that I think we're gonna have to pay for but then there's nothing really happening it stays kind of just dorm it\nYou've been doing it a whole two weeks yeah yeah\nWell that you're just takes a little while to get things are just in the first thing you would tell you is this when you're doing your every dollar budget whatever you think you're spending on food you're wrong put more in there\nBut you're always people are always spend more on food and they think they are I mean I've met people go I live on twenty five dollars a month I'm going to hold it was just no way you know I mean so whatever you think you're spending on food you're spending more\nReally quick I wanted to ask what should I invested in the financial peace university um should I get that now are kind of get it after I'm done with my thousand just put everything in their first and\nThat's up to you I mean you you can decide what you wanted to I don't want to just give it to you and then when you have to worry about it\nOh okay All right\nThat that way you can get signed up and get the every dollar plus going and that's a one year membership for that thing and then you get in the class you know you go to the non non lessons and you've got the online experience and that's going to answer a bunch of these questions as well but basically if you just visualize a yellow pad forget every dollar forget\nA budgeting and all that and just go okay here's what I make\nAt the top of the page and then every dollar\nOf my ... not every one of those dollars needs an assignment going down the page or much been Exxon food and why on utilities and Z on rent and so on down the page until every single dollar has an assignment you don't have any leftover money in your budget\nIs a great up I mean it it definitely the easiest one I've I've done other ones or in the past than this one is definitely the easiest is for\nThe Harlem the problem is is you're facing your reality it's not the app and it's not the system even it's just the first time you do a budget you suck at it\nYou know and it just takes a month and then the next month to get better really about the third month you're doing it it'll be accurate it'll take about the rhythm of about Ninety Days about three times through it and you'll go\nOh I'm not forgetting all soccer pictures and then I got this one all day on you know and we know what the food really cost and we know what the utilities really are and\nGot a few things that are fixed that are predictable I mean you're renting or more time with us fix thing we know what that is but some of these other things you're just you're taking your best guess and and it just takes a little while to get the trial and error get the course\nAre good morning um I had an eight hundred and eighty five dollar electric bill on my own\nThree months ago holy taught about eight hundred and twenty five followed by seven hundred and fifty that started analyzing everything from the pope to the bases and so forth and the south in South Carolina which will write\nA shutting [noise] over several things on the house was capsule aided [noise]\nAnd they put to a\nGood size humidifiers underneath it was about to London for a thousand square feet on that floor uh-huh and when I was analyzing shutting everything down isolated the D. humidifiers ah they were using the equivalent\nOf a hundred and thirty three dollars a month well and my\nQuestion we could go further into it if if you please but my real question is simple and easy is do you have to run these suckers twenty four seven because I'm\nA if you don't you know I can cut a Fifteen hundred dollars probably right there and then on my pool pop I can cook is hungry\nYou're right right well it's great question do middle fires are very expensive to operate a lot of people don't realize that even little tiny affordable ones\nYeah was misled I was ... when the pest control company when it was done\nThat it would have your house so playing you know ... than it is you know yeah it died in Ninety five degrees outside you shut up I don't eat there and enjoy assume you know but um I was told that the money saved from that\nAnd sledding factor would be more than it would cost to run the date humidifiers and it's actually had virtually no effect that I can notice on any of the heating or cooling\nYeah I'm so one is running twenty four hours a day what is the humidity level inside your home\nThe humidity level and shot at my home ah has traditionally and continued to be a little high ...\nOr even in areas like from one shot\nOther you know how they said today humidifiers ah the extremity on the kitchen side I'm a little higher extra extremity on the master bedroom sat on the opposite as a little higher\nDo you have any idea what the percentage is the the percentages I mean is below fifty as it above fifty or\nIt's below fifty but um I've had some pushing and went to this because uh even though I'm a figures guy the humidity humidity is not what am I right things but uh I think I've heard figures in the thirties or around forty\nWell in all honesty were really where you want to be as in the winter time if you can kick it around thirty five forty that's fine but I think it's a stretch if you can keep it below fifty in the summer I think you're doing great\nOkay well my concern though is underneath a house that was mode and every time we had the rabbit treat it right\nAnd it was probably run in Seventy percent then\nAnd and so once it was traded the um the humidity has been unbelievably low underneath a house\nOr what they do they put the plastic on the ground and help yeah yeah they totally ... so you have lemonade at all that water vapor\nWhile you're talking like a Fifteen thousand dollar deal right right and I know exactly how much ... joined I really ha negotiate if you work on it right\nBut your question is do I need to use those humid fires all the time basically\nHow could I possibly maybe once a month a run for about three days\n[noise] uh I Can't answer that because I don't know how much in flux of humidity is you've changed the environment by using vapor barriers and different things like this I tell you what I Would do\nJust totally locked and you know yeah I mean his hair free all your van ship and closed off and everything right\nSo what I Would do is I Would go in I Would buy a little like weather station it's about the size of a book\nYou can put that up in your bedroom or your hallway or wherever you want and then the sense or you just place that down into the crawl space area it's going to give you the temperature and it's going to give you the humidity and you're gonna watch it\nAnd you know maybe there is times you can turn that off if it's really really hot really humid I'd just be real curious to know and I don't think you have to answer yet what that humidity level is is there a you miss that on the humidifier\nI think underneath a house home to this but I think I heard figures like Eighteen or something like that you know\nEighteen what on the humidity or reading or whatever oh it's\nWay too low yeah you'll never needed that low\nYeah well I was told by another past guy that it might or pure hardwood floors you know if if you if it's too much\nAgain I think you wanted at fifty percent okay in the summertime below forty percent in the wintertime I Will get a sense are down there and the weather station so I could just manually monitor monitor it\nBy one of those from lows\nSure sure and then you can see what's going on and if you got it off for three days and all of a sudden that humidity level starts creeping up to fifty five sixty percent you turn it on you drive it down to maybe I don't know forty five percent ...\nUnless I'm abusing your time or\nThe pope puppets of a it's a um one and a half horse and that's eight and me and about a hundred and thirty dollars a month right and I was told by ... or ... that once the temperature of the water hits sixty five and below\nChemicals added or a moot point because it doesn't react to the\nWell maybe I I don't know that okay like that that that makes sense since it's logical for me that that that does make sense so at that point why have the filter or why of the pumpkin going Jim we got to go but monitor\nThat humidity no there's no sense in running the humidifier if you don't need it now however you got to remember when you got 'em going full blast where are you right around fifty percent so you turn them off I\nThink it's probably going to go up a little bit but the cooler it is outside and you got a big cold front coming through Florence\nWhen it gets cooler it's usually less humid and maybe it's something that you can deactivate I'm at that point ... monitor where your humanity level is All right thanks so much for the call

develop back in Nineteen fourteen by Hungarian immigrant mhm resulting second he was a master cabinet maker in her new products of is fun creations and that's when most furniture polish and cleaner was developed\nAnd really that's what makes you know sex so unique is that it's a cleaner and polish it'll take that Greece and grime off those kitchen cabinets and restore the would do its natural luster and like you said especially when they're on the handle your ... and you get the grease on your hand you're opening cabinet doors we get that build up in most ethical clean right down to the finish\nSo that grime we have is that cooking oil or what is that grime\n... or ... several things I guess huh\nExactly it's a combination it's from cooking oil from the oils in your hand um the Greece's you're cooking on and that all gets on to the cabinet and you don't have to use another uh you know use the ... other products you have to clean 'em and then go back and Paul ... ... you know
