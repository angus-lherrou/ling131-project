from the far side of the moon\nWhich I don't believe he said by the way [laughter] but um\nYou know for someone to specifically states something along those lines is is not the way to go you know\nYeah there's a story in the monster book about something you call that goal that squash and you share that with us\nWell yeah the the the ... is he's a really strange one and again it's sort of falls into one of the cats agrees the more than anything else is something that's\nSort of pops up he's not seen again I'm just kind of I'm just sort of baffles paper that there are a lot of cases like that where um you know something pops up and people who like want to know was that\nAnd then he's never seen again but this particular case is an interesting one um it ... and I pulled Nineteen sixty four and Buckley, Washington and I'm actually quite close to my ...\nOn the witness amount and I'm young man named Brian Khan failed um he sold the strange ... he was driving along the road and it was sort of humanoid with a huge wings but it was kind of Harry as well [noise] excuse me and had the shining a yellow eyes\nBut they sort of the ... the hair and go combined with the large wings um you know the the the Harry body and the wings kind of people said oh it's not you know it's not sasquatch because he's got wings but he kind of looks like\n... ... and um and for a while in Nineteen Ninety four it was actually quite big using that area and then like a lot of other these you know there's other cases he just sort of became part of the local legend and you know the areas folklore and so\n... you've got a lot of men in black stories women in black story you and I'm Talking about that before a that might be a ... year than the men in black and and then some of those cases you know they seem otherworldly just out of place\nUh you you know we we've been accustomed because of the movies or do you think that maybe there are some secret government agents but have you ever had any indications that maybe some of them are\nVery human government type operatives who are operating under the umbrella of something like a men in black trying to emulate the the real mystery and figuring they can get away with it that no one will believe the witnesses who see them\nYeah well I've got to be honest with you Georgia I'm doing five books now on on these phenomena foreign the men in black and one on the women and black and I have to say that the vast majority of all the reports I get don't send anything like you know they stepped out of the Pentagon the CIA all the FBI on and say\nI'm a you know nothing like the the concept in the movies they\nTypically are described as looking\n... you know go on and the skins why why why\nI'm I'm people talk about how vaccines have the ability to mind control the personal hypnotized them pay for the even talks about when they're in close proximity to them that they fall and sick afterwards almost like a like a soup and actually infection or something along those lines\nAnd um there are cases when the men in black and the women in black and turned up in homes right after paid for being used in wage of bullets which puts another angle to its\nUm but there's no doubt in my mind again um that's you know this is a real phenomenon but it's not like it's portrayed in the movies it's more sort of like a\nYou know like a gothic horror story mixed in with the X files you know you put those two issues together that's that's how I Would sort of describe this but many black ministry it's fall beyond you know just guys in a black suits walking\nOn you know\nI'm asking it into context sort of like with cattle mutilation is I think you know there's there's a lot of evidence that the animal relations are carried out by something other than just um um humans in helicopters that some of them are truly inexplicable and then you have a whole other wave of them that\nAre truly seem like they are humans that are carrying out the same kind of thing for whatever reasons um\nThis is sort of leading us to where we're going in the next hour to talk about your other book on the alien abduction wells but where in human agencies and that doesn't mean government agencies but humans\nOr pretend to be something paranormal get away with something that's really weird and they they do it in a way that so that there isn't a lot of serious scrutiny by people like you are people like me or or other investigators\nWell yeah I mean I think you know when you talk about the economy which is you know you've got a really weird one actually a couple of them some which are apps to explain there is a parallel with demanding black where there's\nNo doubt that in some cases I think the government agencies are responsible for them I think it's a very small gotcha great they really unexplained ones and the way it was what I think is happening on a few occasions and there is some evidence to support this\nIs the over the years agencies may actually unemployed the legend of the men in black I was amazed to cover their tracks in other words the maybe have within government you know many black to radio but I don't know what they are but it doesn't prevent them\nFrom using the legend than most have\nResumes too quiet April who who they may not want to I've been talking about cases so the government might actually not know who the men in black really are and I don't think they do fully but\nThat sort of lead us into where we're heading in the next hour we're going to talk about top secret alien abduction ... what the government doesn't want you to know that ... latest book\nUh whether or not you believe alien abductions are real the files on the elite abductions are real when I tell ya what might be going on
