{"month": "10", "state": "AL", "station": "WERC", "content": "The pay per that my new published last week is on his website we're going to be discussing this uh tonight on the show like on my news website over a coast to coast am it'll take history there there are elusive papers on the right hand side\nThe current neighbor is the one that is on the town now with your uh analysis here minute it gets a little complicated a little technical\nBut the idea behind it is actually quite simple in an allegation which is is some of the layers have a different thickness in stone and take us through bad\nYeah um when when you when you're standing in front of the pyramid and you look up the walls are you when you stand close you don't notice there's so much but when you go further away let's say you're in your hotel and you have a ... view you start noticing that there is a certain texture to the pyramid and\nUm ah the review or or who was it was very well known or ... or drop here who don't we reviewed my paper\nOr he calls the waves and I call it sort of a federal effect\nUm and so when you look at the details of that which was published by ... a hundred and fifty years ago who actually measured each individual course as a function of total height\nYou then you actually see the numbers and so there is these uh you know you you start with really thick courses and as you get to the top of the courses get thinner but every once in a while there is a jump so uh you have a much thicker course\nAnd then the thickness tapers off and then it resumes the overall trend which is a thinning trend and then you have another sudden jump in thickness and just keeps on going and going for twenty three times as far as I'm as far as I see those ... peaks like that [noise]\nUm and ah and then\nBefore each one of these jobs petri noted that uh if you calculate the surface area of course and you divide that surface area of surface area at the base\nSome of these peaks have around fraction of twenty fifth so you know one twenty fifth to twenty fifth ... so he found that there are rounds fractions of twenty fifth associated with some of these ... courses and that was it uh it was not for the interpreted what does it mean\nA it was just noted but uh it just sat there um until I took a look at it again\nNow how many layers total and in the forty two story great German how many rows\nYeah two hundred three left and probably two hundred and [noise] ah originally\nTwo hundred and ten originally is there and I have to have to immediately say there are some researchers who say the pyramid was not\nCompleted there was a they say that was there was a virtual top so it was actually ... at the top and the rest was a maybe a as fear and you know one of the most prominent researchers proposed this is Robert ... father John Paul move out and the papers on I think it's on a Robert Duvall a\nAcademia a page and it's also in cause me gloom uh his brother vote to hit and he sees in the back of the book where he explains this theory so there are some people that I think the pyramid was not coming to a peek a and of course other people say it was ... and so theoretically at least you can say two hundred and ten courses\nNow we have is there a consistency to the ... ah repeating of the ticker layers\n[noise] [noise] um [noise] ...\nDoes it every ten steps that every twelve is there some kind of ... you\nThat's a great question I I that was the first thing also I was looking for but unfortunately I unfortunately no it's not that easy it's it's kind of you know Jimmy it's kind of haphazard has to be honest with you I I'm I was just struck by when I first saw that I was just struck why did they do this\nOr because you know you were you could just you know simple mine that I thought each step they were just a applied the uh the pyramid and go you know in Egyptian the Egyptians designed to appear in its with uh something called they called this set that which is the pyramid angle\nAnd it's a you know when you walk up\nTheir case basically for each amount that you go you go a certain amount forward and that's how it could step charged a pyramid angle so I thought you know each course it should be the same amount like you're going up a staircase each step is the same\nAnd and it's not and and uh and all of a sudden you know just steps gets much thicker\nAnd chew question again there's no regularity even to the thickness so when you know it's it's completely off hazardous but of course you know I think I Know the answer it has to do with the Curie architecture it has to do with spaces\nAnd we'll get to that or after the break but what is the most amazing to me about this is that with the different layers of which there are\nA couple of dozen veteran sticker that the orientation for the pyramid that it's still ended up at the right angle on all four sides yeah a to complete the pyramid correctly without\nAny errors well that's an engineering feat that is just beyond comprehension\nWhich which to me I wanted to correct something I said in a shape to block interview I think I said that\nUh the ... to ... I'm sure a shock to and say we published a al ... was disappearing or during the twenty seventh century so I I wanted to correct that it wasn't a kid in the paper it was a star Iraq\nSo it was starting to disappear in the southern part of the country\nAnd because of that because that consolation ... it was so important to chip shows that the authors propose that therefore they began to oriented oriented monuments to another part of the of the ... or ... why the pyramid ended up in the in the north south uh orientation\nI got to jump in right there the ... coast to coast and we got to take a break my new this is ... church we'll be right back stay with us\n[noise]\nGet Daily Show updates right to your inbox for free with Gustavo newsletter sign of today's ...
