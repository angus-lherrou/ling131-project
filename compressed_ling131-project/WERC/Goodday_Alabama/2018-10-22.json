this incredible ability to mimic anything that they want with incredible strength in size and when they said that there another tribe of people\nThis community and the big foot world [noise] that is very adamant that they're an ape [noise] throws this completely off the wall and when you dig deeper in it most Native American tribes in fact probably Ninety nine percent say it's another type of people will try it\nAnd this article goes right to that point and nobody was ever written a book before tribal ever brought that out\nAnd when I when I found it [noise] I couldn't believe that nobody was talking about it and it it's stunning still that nobody wants to talk about it [noise]\nYeah I Wonder what those tribes if they're still around would say about it now\n... years later years\nWell I can I can tell you that being around tribes in the mid west in in the west like Harvey and I were it's consistent they still say that it's a type of people [noise]\nYou know the descriptions of course as you have noted that the term big what started to Nineteen fifty eight so before then people had other words for it and it and then many or most of the early clippings and stories that you've collected they call them wild man of course I guess that would fit I mean\nAre they they're humanoid shaped or out in the forest there Harry\nUm they don't know what else to call them [noise]\nSo walk for like a man walked upright and doesn't walk bent over and their knuckles aren't dragging on the ground like in a um [noise]\nIf I I always tell people I said well if it's an animal or then it's probably going to be found and it's probably going to be identified and you could probably go view and study [noise]\nAnd wild man ... that's a different sort of thing it's a different kind of topic very elusive\nAh [noise] I don't know anybody that's claimed to have studied them in the wild walking into the wilderness and found a spot and studied year after year\nSo they have intelligence that's quite a bit different than the average animal a quote unquote that you see in the woods\nAnd even the animals on the eighth gorilla et cetera side of the equation totally different ... they they act different they walk different they look different\nAnd one thing that everyone has to think about it never in North America have there been any wild ape gorilla bones found ever [noise] but [noise] we have had while or giant human bones found [noise]\nAnd that's that really makes you think [noise]\nYou know some of the descriptions any articles are are made me chuckle a little bit because the writers who have no ... but the topic of course because it's new to them they're they're explaining\nIt must have been old Fred's so and so who disappeared into the forest a couple of years ago and now he's grown here all over his body [noise]\nThat I [laughter] I traveled with you on those and I think people are scratching to bring in some rationality to an irrational observation\nUm and the parts of the country where these things are seen you know get way way below zero it snows house Fred that decided to leave his farm going to live and that type of environment\nAnd and grow hair all over his body like that a cynic long hair you mentioned in the in the clip that I was reading there from the late Seventeen hundreds you had a notation at the bottom\nThat said maybe this is what Daniel Boone saw ah I didn't see the Daniel Boone any Daniel Boone story in here other than that reference that you made that he had an encounter is a fairly famous and counter right\nThat's correct and uh I I couldn't find in our car news article about it but I saw other secondary and third level things that were written about what Daniel called I I think it was a Yahoo [noise]\nYeah [noise] and the description was pretty close and I don't know it's it sure seemed possible but again if you went into the quote unquote credible archives you're really not going to find that you have to dig really deep and and find out what\nMaybe some explores wrote about that they heard in which he encountered so\nBut again in tribal Bigfoot I've written about things where an explorer from the latter day church\nWas coming across country on a horse and he wrote in his explore notes that this thing came up to him while he's on his horse and looked him I die and actually spoke to one\nLarge hairy by ... he'd never seen before that matched the description of a wild man or a big foot and it came from the archives with ... church latter day saint church and it's in there so to say that these things happen happen ... ridiculous [noise]\nUh the first entry the oldest entry comes to us from Jacques valet you wrote about it and have a clip from September Seventeen sixteen eighty it was a reported in his book wonder in the sky a large black wild like mass\nLanded in a field releasing a huge here covered being that was seen briefly and disappeared now that's the kind of thing that will drive um big

to think I'm a mile wide and an inch deep\nI like to read about different things that could be associated with topics I'm doing research on and what I read this summer fell over and said wow I don't think anybody's ever heard of this\nAnd uh his book which was a Kickstarter project right um which kind of did the same thing with the UFO topic that I did on this big topic it was a stunner I again I
