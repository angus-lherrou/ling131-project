think that even if you are listening to this show tonight and you believe that there are aliens or ... or however you want to describe them\nThat are coming here and you think they must be good because if they weren't good they would have destroyed is already\nIf you're in charge of the military\nIf your job is to be suspicious if your job is to protect the people of your country\nThen why would you take a chance and say okay well maybe these beings are benevolent but still why don't we do what ever we can to have whatever we can muster together in place just in case\nYou needed to send ourselves because they have a change of heart or they've been deceiving them to be safe than sorry right\nWhy sure you know and and we it might be Utah file I mean you would think that it would be that if the if there are being out there that are coming here that are are so advanced that they um they they ... you know would otherwise destroy is\nAh if you know if if that was their plan but you know here's this is getting dark this is this is very dark but I honestly this is a logical point of view what if George\n... if they were going to come back here are these beings that ancient alien a theorists talk about talk about this kind of thing many times on the History Channel\nUm if they they come back and they want to enslave us again\nBecause a lot of people believe especially if you look at like Zacharias ... work and all that that they came here and modified our our genetics and our DNA to enslave us and treat us as minors for gold or whatever\nIf their goal is to come back here in ... it might be a better fate for us to commit global suicide\nIn other words and again I told you this is going to be dark\nWhat if a lot of these governments actually have some kind of plan in place where they say rather than have these beings come back\nAnd put you know callers on us and and work us like animals we hit these buttons and we just annihilate ourselves spooky but what if that's the case\nSo do stay button basically\nAnd and and that the idea is that we're not necessarily as concerned about each other as we are about the force from outside and you're going back to Ronald Reagan\nI'm I'm sure you recall that kind of eerie comment he made a one of his speeches I Believe it might've been before the un jumped in what if there was an alien threat [laughter]\nYou know what did he really mean by that you know he was he was just being facetious to try to talk to people about banning together or does he really knows something at the time\nWhen you look back at all of these people who have made deathbed confessions who are related to raw as well and um you know the whole suspicion that surrounds researchers to this day who goes snooping a little too much and digging a little too deep\nI mean there is something to this idea that we may be up against potentially\nA some visitors here if you want to call 'em visitors they call them are just as easily invaders but there may be some some ah beings\nThat we have got to do our best to defend against\nAnd they're using space time manipulating technology\nIn order to completely I'm Out maneuver anything that we can do\nAnd so once we see it possible examples like I'm perhaps presenting that maybe now we humans are experimenting with some stuff sadly enough weaponry which also may have a space time manipulating affect\nAh this could be a particularly worrisome for those beings if they say okay we made a little trade off we gave them a few little nuggets of wisdom but boy the the the the earthlings have run with it and so we need to put them back in their place\nJosh tell us about your event coming up in October this month\nYeah thank you it's it's this Saturday it's October the
