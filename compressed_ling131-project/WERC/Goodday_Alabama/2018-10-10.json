brain has no effect on the world what I found in my research is that that might not be true and I think the most compelling studies that had been controlled or once again that show very subtle effects\nAnd they were actually done a primarily at Princeton University which is interesting because I went to Princeton University and I had no idea these studies were being run\nA Dr Robert Johnson who was the former dean of engineering a rocket scientist ran a lab for nearly Thirty years running these studies and he also looked at remote viewing but he also he looked at ... which is disability for the mind that matter\nThe classic study uses random number generators that these are machines that spit out zeroes and ones and it totally random fashion so again if we look at probability overtime a random number generator will have fifty percent heroes and fifty percent one overtime\nOr what the experiment does it asks people to put their mental attention to the machine to make it produce more ones and zeroes for example and the person doesn't even have to be in the same room so they say hey I'm pleased put your mental attention to the machine and make it produce more ones and zeroes\nAgain what do we find is that there is a mall but highly statistically significant effect where it seems as though the mind is is changing the what used to be random behavior of the machines [noise]\nRandom generators picked up a some incredible responses during the tragedy of nine eleven in two thousand one\nThey did not know what the time what was happening what was going to happen what they felt something was going on because these random generators mark just went ballistic and in people people have that ability growing up\nThat's right George ... those to me or perhaps even more remarkable and this is part of the global consciousness project which which was an offshoot of the Princeton study where these machines the random number generators were set up around the world so people weren't even necessarily aware that the machines were they're\nGenerating these numbers and what the experiment yours have done is looked at the behavior of the machines around the world around

that we can look at what was happening when everyone was focusing their attention or many people are focusing their attention on the events\nWhat do we find that there was a spike\nNine eleven but in the case of nine eleven which is even more fascinating to me is that the spike happened before the plane hit the towers before the event that before the event which suggests almost a global pre

you're under an evacuation orders don't wake up and you we are seeing land\nThat they're still like category you know what they've been\nPredicted to this this could move up through Macon Georgia still as a as a as a hurricane I mean usually I mean anytime they move over land they start to weaken\nBut it could be still a category one hurricane when it moves up through central Georgia so very powerful system in recorded history we've never seen a cat or hit the Florida Panhandle so this could be the most powerful hurricane to hit the ... of the Florida Panhandle than we've ever seen\nSo ah one hundred and forty mile per hour winds it is moving to the north of Thirteen miles per hour wind gusts\nAt one sixty five and this can strengthen to one hundred and forty five miles per hour

winds but nothing of the magnitude of the center of circulation to the east of the center of circulation that's where the most powerful winds are going to be and we can see some amount or bands of rain and some\nSome guess the winds here today but the landfall as a forecast for about one being as far as our weather's concerned not too bad we get some windy conditions we've got a chance of rain but that's going to be more into this afternoon and evening\nBut um you know flooding rains here at home anticipated All right we'll have more on the track of Michael and um what it can mean to

to be the first major hurricane to hit the Florida Panhandle and Thirteen Years were praying and hoping and\nGetting ready for cash show the storm could bring winds of more than one hundred thirty miles per hour in storm surges is highest Thirteen feet\nThe storm is dangerous if you don't follow a warnings from officials this storm could kill you and you could not take it lightly\nThirty four shelters will be open across the state of Florida as more than two million people living counties ordered to evacuate what they need to do\nIs get in a safe place where wherever you are hopefully it is a safe place the storm is expected to make landfall this afternoon jumping up to a foot of rain before blows over regions still recovering from last month's Hurricane Florence\nI Know people are fatigue from for it but don't let the storm\nCatch you with your guard and despite warnings from officials some residents are choosing to ride out the storm a lot of them ...\nAnd I went out of bounds

of harm's way you can see them they're cleaning out the kennels letting up the trucks I head down to get several more dogs into inland shelters\nAnd they're not bringing those animals back here to Birmingham though because they already did that during Hurricane Florence they're still trying to find homes for those animals and really don't have any runs laugh\nThis is pretty bad situation because most of the shelters are still full from disaster relief from Florence so now this puts Florida and the Gulf Coast of Alabama at a disadvantage because the places they would normally be able to move their animals to are probably full a fourth animal so it is pretty dire\n... well the humane society as having what the big adoption event this weekend and hopefully that will open up more
