{"month": "10", "state": "AL", "station": "WERC", "content": "In in my presentations that I say this is the uh the third station the United states has man's since Nineteen fifty do you know what happened the other two stations\nAnd occasionally somebody to come up with the right answer the answer is the other two were buried by snow\nA and they leave built\nThey built this last station on stilts at seven modular buildings and they they Jack up each building every year over accumulating snow and that's where Ninety percent of the world's ice is and the south pole climate models cannot explain why the ISIS getting thicker in the south pole\nBut on that we've lost a little bit um if you add it all up but there's there's really no concern or that we're losing large amounts of ice\nIt's a ... it's incredible when these stories come out saying this huge sheets of ice falling off the shelves melting away and everything else\nYeah I mean well you know they knew I knew west\nAntarctic ice sheet but but usually what they don't mention is there are about a hundred volcanoes under that ice sheet so it is possible that west Antarctic ice sheet could melt if we have big volcanic eruptions there but uh this is not being caused by carbon dioxide it's another natural factor\nWhat about ... want renewal energy [noise] plus or minus\nYeah this hundred percent renewables thing as I was as I was mentioning the the biggest problem with the wind and solar is their intermittent and they can't ... if you're going to maintain continuity of electricity supply they can't replace traditional nuclear gas or coal\n... when you put in solar wind a you only get about ten percent of the total capacity as far as adding to the capacity of your system\nSo if you want eighty percent renewables or a hundred percent renewables you have to build a vast amount of wind and solar\nAnd people are saying batteries vast amounts of batteries so this means you you've just added a huge expense to your electricity infrastructure\nOr some of the studies\nSay that uh in California for example they were going to triple a the cost of uh their wholesale electricity\nAnd that's going to probably double or or or two and a half times or your total electricity on top so this hundred percent renewable energy sounds good uh practically it's going to be very very very expensive\nLet's talk for a moment Steve again about pollution how bad is the pollution I'll\nIt's a pretty good news story as I talk about on my book you know we talked about landfills landfills used to be a mess and now they are all modern landfills and in Europe in the U. S. are lined with a with a a waterproof barrier to keep things from leaking out they're covered with\nStuart every day to keep a a rats and other vermin or out of the way um our air is very much a a cleaner since Nineteen eighty\nAre six major air pollutants are all down at a combined Seventy percent those are the ones that I mentioned the carbon monoxide ... sulfur dioxide or water is is a is not where it ought to be but the the Great Lakes have been cleaned up many of the offshore areas have been cleaned up\nIn Europe the ... the Rhine River is making a comeback the Daniel rivers is may come back as a matter of fact the interesting thing is people say well energy use as a big problem but it's funny the nations that use the most energy per person have\nThe lowest levels of air and water pollution today and those levels are declining so this idea that using energy causing ... causes pollution really is not accurate the nations that are not able to put energy use effectively\nUm can't use it to reduce their air and water pollution and so they're they're in the worst state\nSo it's really a good news story what we need to do is get get a nations have become more wealthy and then they will start cleaning up there and start cleaning up their water and uh so it it really is a good news story a from a pollution point of view\nNot what's going on Steve because regardless what side of the fence you people are on with climate change why is it so ... or ...\nOpposed to dialogue and he this is my opinion and I appreciate yours it's screaming match is yeah yeah\nIt is kind of remarkable I have a I've spoken at a couple of universities and done a couple of debates but I get turned down about ten times to one I'm going to be up at a grand Valley State Michigan on the twenty fifth of October\nIn a little thing but it's fairly rare now that that a university will invite a climate skeptic to a climate discussion [noise] um so it has become very polarized and\nDo you get booted\nNo I've never had a disruptive situation and you know I'm always very respectful and the theory is plausible of man made climate change and that we do have a greenhouse effect\nBut over the last Thirty years the data showing that the climate models are wrong they made some assumptions which are wrong so so a natural factors dominate um and we need to go on reducing real pollutants but not not carbon dioxide\nWell she that's what's so important people really need to distinguish the difference between pollution and climate change brought on by cycles as the sun is heating up the solar system itself is warmer than it used to be\nAbsolutely there are the earth is dominated by long term cycles called them a lot of age cycles which are of\nThe tilt of earth's axis changes over time the procession of earth's axis are are they orbit around the sun changes and these are like twenty thousand to a hundred thousand year cycles they cause the ice ages then we have a medium term cycles every Fifteen hundred years or so that uh scientists believe the sun causes\nAnd those are they're they're fluctuating temperatures so we've had the medieval warm period a thousand years ago when I was very warm um the little ice age in Europe uh about five hundred years ago when they were actually burning people at the stake they thought they were witches and they were causing the cold weather\nAnd our modern warming and then we have short term cycles as well El Nino is an example in their regular cycle every three to seven years\nCycles in the Pacific cycles of the in the Atlantic so the statement climate change is real is like saying water is wet\nLet's come back in a moment Steven open up the phone lines and what people participate with you\nSign up now for ... zone or free
