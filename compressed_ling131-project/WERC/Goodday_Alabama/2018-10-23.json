O. two [noise]\nAnd if we produce them on Mars in these so called a a floor carping gases or we sometimes manufacture them on earth for use and refrigerators and air conditioning um\nThe the uh but we didn't put them in such machines instead we just released into the atmosphere and we were producing them at the same rate we're producing them on earth right now\nIn fifty years we'd warm ours by ten centigrade that's a lot okay that's an awful lot that's ten times as much as anybody is talking about global warming happening on earth and the the uh\nAnd if you warmed to Mars that much\nThat warming itself would force carbon dioxide to come out of the soil because it's been sponge to and it would out gas and it was thick in the atmosphere a lot with C. O. two which is a greenhouse gas\nAnd that would warm the planet even more so much so that the frozen water those those glaciers that we're talking about they start to melt\nThey start to flow and this is much ... fresh water in those glaciers is there is a north of Mel oceans will I bet well\nPlanet why there is in those particular glaciers probably as much as to the American Great Lakes [noise]\nUm and the the um but yes the waters on Mars that's frozen at all kinds of places would start to melt the dry rivers on Mars would start to flow the lakes and seas would start to fill up and they would also be rain\nAnd once you have that kind of planet with a thick C. O. two atmosphere liquid water rain man you can start spreading plants around\nNow if we were using that kind of plants we have on earth now which are only about one percent efficient in capturing sunlight and I'm doing photosynthesis or it would take a thousand years for them to make enough oxygen for Mars to be read the Bible\nBut if we're talking a hundred years from now it's really not too far out to assume that we can do genetic engineering of plants to make them instead of one percent efficient five percent efficient\nAnd in which case this thing could happen much much faster and um so I think Mars is going to be tariffs formed within two hundred years and my guess is it'll probably be done by ways that are more efficient than what I just described to you because they're going to be doing this with technology is we don't know about\nAnd who's going to do with what country\nThe Martians or\nThey're going to do with themselves no when we talk about competition I don't see Russia as really pushing it space program which I mean they want you lose all your stuff and they bring us back\nAh well most of the tragedy a few weeks ago with a couple a cosmopolitan an astronaut that had to abort but I see China and India is coming along strong how about you\n[noise] well uh here's the thing I'm the revolution in space flight is really going to put the question to these people I'm a I think India's gonna rise to the challenge but now China and Russia gonna both face it a real question\nWhich is are they going to allow private space launch companies my guess the Chinese will because they've seen the benefit of a of privatization in terms of their very rapid progress since they moved away from command economy\nUm but Russia\nThe the issue there is not allowing a a private space launch companies but allowing space launch companies to believe that if they got started they wouldn't get stolen by the government\nUm and ah because you know the Russian government is is basically a organized crime I mean you know Russia is not a country with an organized crime problem it's an organized crime family with a country and uh the the uh and so if if if they\nAre going to have their own space sexes and they're going to need to have them if they're going to be competitive fence to think um hold on\nAnd we're at the top of the hour we'll come back we'll talk more about this and will open up the phone lines with Robert Zubrin next on coast to coast they\nDon't know for ... or ... ... email newsletter today it goes to goes to um dot com\n\n\nI\nDon't want to see you ma'am will take a deep V. die and reservists with their lungs no worse for wear on the way down to ... get injured as their crushed in silver blood and oxygen flooding when you feel it back up\nAnd I don't know the ... issues could suffer inflammation usually response by the body's tissue damage yet the researchers found no evidence among damage him these deep divers ... protect their lungs removed potentially damaging in one of ...\nBrazilian just lengthy uncovered secret sauce they tested where the blood samples to ... to ... offered any protection from your book to\nBe if you lost your college football over\nDryland farming cat on line nine sixty we are ... dot com\nAre you'll see it's five o'clock\nGreat report coming weather oh All right you're right of way of looking good about that out the door especially coming in from sixty five thousand found no issues there I had to make your way from garden doubtful del Morris\nAnd inspire sleep dot com\nThat inspires sleep dot com [noise]\n[noise] I'm voting in the mid term elections because my ... group or one because my ancestors and to make it better for my children and all and then before me fine and linked to weaken remain free open community I'm putting in\nThe mid term elections because I Know every vote makes it didn't matter so I've I've I've found in the mid term election [noise]\nTo register to vote go to I Am a voter dot com and don't forget to vote Tuesday November six\n[noise] so have you on the news last day to register to vote in Alabama Holyoke like illness effect in silver dome children gun robbery and Hoover President Trump says he will allow China's not included in the agreement should battle of the future quarterbacks\nFrom Alabama this candidate in this part of town in the migrants on their way to the U.S Mexico border reduce the hundreds of millions of dollars in foreign aid\nIn office to stay informed on Birmingham local news leader news radio money by five we are see [noise]\nPays five eleven in the morning here on a day in October that uh it it's cool for some folks and a little bit warmer for others a call ... down to thirty nine degrees again so we're in the thirties there and not far from it we have Haley bill at forty forty one into Gadsden\nYou get on down the road though and it's a whole lot more bearable into Alabama ... fifty one fifty one of the Tuscaloosa forty nine to Birmingham ...
