I've never I mean is this there was no common sense no rationality it was just\nPolitical partisanship and the people the Republicans hated the Democrats for attacking this guy and the Democrats hated the Republicans for defending him and in installing this thing and cutting I mean this is like\nI mean and and and who's got all the guns in the world we do so so this is really [noise] I think that that social unrest and this downturn is going to top the great depression where it was more people roaming around in their cars and not having housing and no jobs and soup lines this is going to be different people\nThe the blue and the red extremes are going to blame each other for the crisis to Republicans say damn Democrats let all this debt run up and all this you know free money and stuff\nAnd the and the Democrats are and say Republicans you didn't let us stimulate on up and blah blah blah blah blah and and and they're gonna hate each other and and so I I think that's going to be the worst part of this\nThat we really and and and I really think there's a possibility that there's going to be movements in this time or in the civil war I compare there's more to the civil war on the social political level at that time the south seceded from the more industrial and urbanized north they were totally different I mean the north was blue\nThe south has read this time [noise]\nEspecially with Republicans in charge now I think there's going to be facts I think states like California or the whole west coast or the whole northeast is going to threaten to succeed from the red states because they can't agree on anything there's nothing that can be agreed on his cabinet shop thing\nWas the perfect example that no middle ground it's either red or blue you know\nAnd his argument and its argument in hatred bitterness on both sides\nAnd and even you know the Democrats are always a nice guy I Know that Democrats are jumping up and down and women you know almost assaulting you know ... senators and in the elevator and stop this ... every body yeah there's a very high tensions and\nI tell you I don't feel that here and it's another advantage to being Puerto

everybody you know I I Will do it when I can buy a condo there for a quarter of the price [laughter]\nAnd and and and and but I Want to see what happens first and and the thing about that that the next year also George's this is this is when it's gonna\nYou know it's going to happen or not it it's either starting to happen now or or the latest by my calculations with every cycle we have an everything we got her I suppose it's going to start by late next year and that's going to be a Ninety year anniversary of the greatest\nStock crash in modern history Nineteen twenty nine thirty two and that is a one of many of our cycles we cover in zero our in our news letters than Ninety year cycle is the most powerful\nFor the big us what I call you know downturns depressions and the biggest stock crashes and this has happened\nEvery Ninety years since the industrial revolution caused the greatest boom and global\nHis long you know here we have had a couple of guests on who say very similar things what you're saying the timing was off some of them said things were going to happen back last September ... won the fellow was talking about Jewish prophecy and he called it the

thousand sixteen the marketed gone sideways for you were saying you know this looks like it made that finally taught and then Trump got elected I mean we turned boys I mean when Trump had that surprised when and the markets were had a two thousand point reversal from down nine hundred to eleven hundred just overnight\nIn the end of the morning I said look this is a reversal\nThis is a tax cut coming in and all that sort of stuff this is going to extend this boom another year or two another twenty to thirty percent or more and that's what's happened but now we're on the other side of that now we've seen most of that\nI'm an we're running out of tricks I mean what can you do now and the Democrats may when the house it looks likely possibly the Senate but it's going to be much harder for Trump to push is gravy train for businesses\nIt ... is the Democrats get more control and I see the economy falling apart by two thousand twenty at the latest and that's\nNot good to win reelection I was just going to even\nI don't think Trump gets reelected and he may not even make it we're tracking Watergate on a forty five year cycle almost to the tea\nWhich would say you're about to see the special prosecutor get fired up elections early next year and\nA Trump could be in trouble by late next year so so are there were peaking now or at best Trump holds on notice after we're
