done in a in a very careful men are very logical manner\nI mean that's not what greed another problem all by itself how about the population in terms of ... men and women fifty fifty what they're buying use that to market change\nYeah you know in you know what's interesting about the market is a women right now and and I don't know why and no one's paying attention to this but women are about sixty five percent of of the people in college it's sixty five thirty five men women and in law school at Seventy thirty I mean think\nAbout it really isn't that high on that's a flip flip from Twenty years ago right\nOh yeah I said listen you want you you wanna hassle of women they'll fill you don't do it\nBut we wish you had to take into consideration is is that women are going to run things there's there's absolutely no question about that because they are going to be the most educated I mean the glass ceiling has been shattered for a long time but we're starting to see many many more women come into CEO positions\nAnd they're going to want us all excellent and was absolutely excellent ones\nAnd and uh so we're ... we're seeing a major major change in our culture Twenty years from now you won't you won't recognize a commerce you just want because it's going to be run by women\nUm what's happening with the new generation Z what's in what is that\nA generation Z was born ... being going right now is is actually a two thousand five to ... thousand twenty four\nSo in that fully there uh\nBut Gen Z is not going to be entirely different than Gen Y ... they're going to be this the same\nCyber reliant generation or they won't be as big because the number of parents that they have is is much smaller in generation X. generation X essentially is the parents of Gen Z\nA but it ... what we're watching is is is a ... a new crop of kids and and I tell folks and if you look at ... ... people say well these these ... that they complain about the new kids they complain about generation y they complain about the millennials they caught complain about the\nSame you know the kids don't want to work there they're entitled that you know there's all kinds of things that are that I'm hearing about them and I said let alone let them grow up\nAs soon as they have to feed themselves they're going to be fined or just going to be just like the hippies that everybody hated this as soon as they had to feed themselves and and and face reality I'm In my joke is they became Republicans so [noise]\n[laughter] you're gonna get blasted that\nI don't care listen it is what it is [noise]\nWhat but listen here's here's how it works zero to a hundred years old when you're a baby you want what you want you want it you want it now you don't you want it for free you're a liberal and then once you're about ten years old and you have a some possessions at the other kids don't deserve suddenly become a conservative\nSo what you have is you have conservatives at one end of the population and you have a a liberals or the other end of the population where we're gaining a liberal every eight seconds because they're coming of age to vote and we're losing their conservative every sixteen seconds because they're dying\nSo are all in all we're we're going to be a nation of liberals\nWhy can't people just hear about people whether you're a liberal or conservative who cares why can't they just do the right thing\nYeah would you tell me that makes me crazy you know this whole division that we have going on now in our country\nAnd it's horrible and it it troubles me it really does we knew not\nIt's not what we're supposed to do I mean when you have a I mean it looks it I'm I'm I'm a I'm a Republican but when you have a president day takes on a porn star in public and they have a fight on Twitter give me a break\nThat's the problem yeah\nThat's and that's part of the new technology again did anybody ever anticipate that you\nThink a Jack Dorsey what he founded Twitter not that it would be used the tools like that I don't think so\nNo that when when when you think of the mind that people in like the Eighteen hundreds there's more information in a in a single Wall Street journal and somebody would ever think about an individual would think about in the Eighteen hundreds so I I don't know is\nWhen you talk about the trends and change this is what we're losing Ken we're losing the ability to debate question discuss without people screaming at each other\nI mean those days are gone I mean I I heard a couple of people in a restaurant tonight in snow just talking about something they're screaming at each other because they didn't get ... they didn't agree with each other and in I've never seen that this bad and you\nKnow no I haven't and it it's

don't we run our our government like a business and and so we you know where you want to have these huge deficits and we won't make all these mistakes\nYou think about it I'd rather have a government that runs like a government diplomatic government or a Republican based on a constitution not one that's based on business principles we used to have that yeah we used to have that but now we have a government\nThat's essentially run on business principles and it it seems like there's there's no you know we were just taken older we've removed the rules taking away the the we've taken away the diplomacy that was necessary to be a diplomat and what what's going on with China\nChina's freaky position China right now\nThey will actually ... their their child well I Want to write how many people many children a family can help\nYeah they can really as many say want now which is the absolute positive did last thing they should've done it's it's you know I don't know why I really don't and listen I Am not that smart I'm really not in in in a few ... my wife or my kids jump they'll tell you but\nHere you have a situation where we're trying to\nHold on for a second we're already at
