I'll tell you if you have a psychic reading you should not you should not ask the person who's receiving reading\nAny questions I shouldn't say well you know it's your mother's name or anything like that why you're here you should be able to tell them that's the first test of legitimacy of what you're receiving\nThe iron ore retailer on a few days ago I heard it in the great guy and I I Believe he's got these powers who are others who are critical of him say that he's just a great magician\nAnd and I told them I ... I got to tell you if you're a magician and you're doing this would sleight of hand you've got to be the best there ever was because I said we can't see how you been those spoons\nMagically if you're a magician I Can't see the trick or you know we're we're you do the switch or anything like that ah I've looked at videos I've slowed him down a gun frame by frame you can't catch the guy I think he's the real deal\nI think he's probably the real deal ...

all these unusual strange things and they're still unusual and strange for me Joyce [laughter]\nYes I Know but you you're really amazing because I find that most people are so skeptical and you spend so much energy trying to convince people are really saying something that will really be impressed you know if I was a trick I it was a visiting a Web site last night that I thought it was terrific and\nThere there were some uh doubters who had captions over the whole thing saying this is obviously fraudulent\nAnd those are people I Believe will not allow themselves to move out of out of the third dimensional way of thinking so restrictive and limiting no into higher consciousness go into the fourth dimension fifth and beyond\nLet's all move forward and it's the people who are very mired in a monetary and ah other um financial interests are very earthy that will not leave that dimension and that's really a shame because the earth is supposed to be and growing in a consciousness of the
