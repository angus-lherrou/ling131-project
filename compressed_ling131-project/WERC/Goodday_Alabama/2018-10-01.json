Fifteen miles away twenty four hours not possible in my book\nBut I mean there's a long long list of these and why did I start to accumulate that data\nBecause in search and rescue manuals that says that a two year old should be found [noise] Ninety five percent of the time in a radius of two miles or less from the point last seen these numbers absolutely blow that to smithereens [noise] it's something search and rescue people don't want to talk about don't want to address that want to even think about\nAnd I can understand why because there's no way you could plan a search [noise] [noise] thirty miles away for\nA two year old ... just you don't have enough people to do it and you have to work for that Ninety five percent tile ... but the problem is in all these books they don't talk about the other five percent anywhere I'm probably the first person that's ever talked about it\nBut as you state [noise] how are these kids [noise] making this extraordinary distance and extraordinary heights\nWhen I go to a conference I always ask people how many people in the room or parents you know Ninety percent of people raised their hands and I said if I said okay you you're just going to set your child down in the dirt\nI'll walk away or watch the child child going to do for the next hour they said well maybe it'll crawl under Bush and go to sleep\nThe plan that dirt for a while maybe they'll run down the trail for a little bit get upset cry and then go to sleep [noise] and I said how many how many parents and your kid would run up hill nobody raised around I mean it does happen but it's pretty rare [noise]\nBut I have all these examples where the heights been achieved by these little [noise]\nOr they crossed a couple of mountain ranges or you know it's incredibly difficult terrain sometimes without any shoes on [noise] oh yeah we've got to\nMe and we talked about a two year old boy\nThat they traveled nine to twelve miles in nine hours over two mountain ranges\nAnd he was sunk face down and you know the next morning unbelievably a wife and we found that guy years later and interviewed him and he has no recollection of what happened and if his mom said we couldn't believe we found them and we couldn't believe it or why\nYou have a case in the new book ah in Southern California the Lucerne valley bill Hanks this was back in Nineteen fifty six is the child is five years old at the age of disappearance\nAnd you do the math on a bill I guess if he had walked nonstop for twenty four hours he'd have to go point six miles per hour\nBut a kid's not going to walk for twenty four hours with no food or water [noise] um it it seems just impossible [noise]\nUnless somebody picked him up for some something or someone picked him up and locked up there [noise]\n[noise] well and and the reason these cases have significant is that what you report on a child who's abducted in downtown\nAnd they're found in West Los Vegas three hours later six miles away you know I'm sure it's probable somebody put them in the car and drove from there\nBut when you're talking in the middle of the wilderness that's not happening and\nWhen you talk about this happening when the people in the party didn't see anybody never talk to anybody and when they check the trail walks and nobody else was there nobody else saw anything nobody sonic cars [noise]\nNobody else was there [noise] so how did that child make that distance in that time [noise] ...
