this evening after winning a narrow fifty to forty a confirmation vote in the Senate President Trump speaking at a rally in Topeka, Kansas praised Kavanaugh and condemn the effort to defeat him\nThe charges are upsetting\nA and and uh they're obviously they triggered an entire a national conversation about sexual assault and sexual harassment about the unequal way or the women and girls are treated in this country\nAt the same time there is as of now no contemporaneous corroborating evidence for any of the charges as far as we know we haven't seen anybody emerging say yes I remember that and that is an important part of the story as well\nThat is not just an important part of the story that is the story that is the story and I for one\nI for one we'll not condemn Ford and I will not

addicted outrage um there are lots of examples of\nOf why we should really be talking about something entirely different like we should be talking about how do we make how do we strengthen this and spread this around the world\nRight now are dialogue is America's sucks nothing is good everything is bad and that is absolutely not true in the middle chapter of the the book I I ask this question\nIs this worth saving nobody is asking this we're talking about getting rid of capitalism changing our whole system changing everything about it it doesn't work no one is asking\nThe question that must be asked first is this worth saving is America and the west good or bad\nIt can be both because people are both [noise] but is it\nOn the on the whole has it helped to more people or hurt more people are\n... we're not having that conversation we are having an now Arthur Brooks is the president of the American Enterprise Institute he's the guy who grew up in Seattle I grew up in the Seattle area um he remembers the first time he saw poverty and I think it's the first time I really saw poverty as well\nI think it was it was probably the Michael Jackson a\nThat fund raiser we are the world where we were trying to raise money for Ethiopia and we saw these kids with the bloated stomachs and the flies on their face we had never seen anything like that\nThat was a pivot point for Arthur Brooks in his life Arthur welcome to the program\nHey brother Glenn how are you very good doing month how're you doing\nI'm I'm I Am great I'm great um I I wanted to get you on because we do not to talk about\nWhat capitalism a and what this country has has done what the western way of life has done and we're just allowing it to be thrown out the window and you make compelling case because you didn't come at this with politics in mind\n[noise] no I don't you know and and a lot of the things that we're talking about today I was listening to the last segment of your great show and and you you're talking about this big war this big cultural battle that we're having in those countries or whether it's about the Kavanaugh hearings are about the Trump Administration or about capitalism and general\nThese are really kind of proxy cultural battles that we're having in in our country today it's a culture of outrage you've talked about this a lot\nUm you've done humans work on this important topic and it's important for all of us to remember we are so unbelievably blessed in this country we live in a peaceful society I mean if you're going to ... if you dare you know if you if you can stomach it\nAnd listen to people saying the most violent ghastly things to each other but but let's remember there's going to be known knocking the night it was going to be no jak booted thug nobody's going to take you off to prison God Bless this country and we have to stop taking for granted the fact that we live in a democratic peaceful society\nAnd we have to stop trashing each other all the time and having the dome proxy wars that's completely unproductive\nSo ... right now I you know the big ideas are being trashed the ideas of freedom of speech or because you know you have to have a safety the safety space all of these all this nonsense\nYeah but also capitalism itself when you saw the pictures back in the eighties of those starving Ethiopians\nIt bothered you and you actually that that set your feet on the course of trying to find out what happened to them right\nIt did I mean the fact that I'm a political conservatives today has everything to do with the fact that I share the objectives of most of my [noise] my my left wing friends and family that I care about poverty in most and I started to look for the way that you can wipe out poverty everybody listening to us clan believes\nAnd and the their their obligation and start their privilege to lift up their brothers and sisters at the margins of American society and and and society around the world what really matters is what works what system works full you sleep I became a proponent of American free enterprise system\nAs a gift to the world because I wanted to do more to help my brothers and sisters and I found that there was one system pulled people up by the billions all around the world these are big issues that we need to be talking about it in America today and how we can do this better\nThan you give me some of the stats Arthur I Know you I don't know if you have him off the top of your what\nDo ... or so from Nineteen Seventy until today you know when when you and I were\nReally little kid um that was when the world sort of open up and people started to see what was going on so I was really in the seventies when people saw that Ethiopian famine I went to India for the first time when I was Nineteen years old in Nineteen eighty three of us starving children and it was ghastly\nFrom Nineteen Seventy until today eighty percent of the world poverty has been eradicated starvation level poverty has been ever advocate no Seventy percent of Americans actually think that poverty is getting worse and the reason is because it's never\nLike front page in the New York times or any of the newspaper millions saved from poverty I mean that's not a news story you only see the things that are going wrong\nBut the truth is that two billion of our brothers and sisters have been pulled out of starvation or poverty Glenn since you and our kids and there was one thing that did that and that was democratic capitalism and that is America's export to the world\nThere I don't think you would disagree with me Arthur um that we are not using the first task of wealth of nations moral sentiments we are we uh we have we think that capitalism is just going to be good no matter\nYou know who's wielding it and and it's just going to produce wonderful things no it as Adam Smith lines out it it can produce really bad things as well yeah capitalism depends on the people who are willing ... are wielding it\nBut also uh depends on on what our goals are yeah slow and it's got up to now would you agree with that\nYeah that's well that's the problem is is not capitalism a lot of what we see today wired deals cronyism all the special stuff that's going on with powerful people in Washington DC and in every state Capitol around the country\nThat's actually not competition that's trying to shut competition down on behalf of powerful people [laughter] so so competition is good competition politics and economics and in the competition of ideas the fact is that you know the the Glenn Beck show is part of the competition of ideas and a free and democratic nation is very very important [noise]\nAnybody wants to shut down competition on behalf of powerful people is not a competitor doesn't believe in capitalism doesn't believe in democracy and doesn't believe in the free exchange of ideas to compete means to do it better than the other guy\nFairly peacefully and respectfully and to win over an audience and said that that's really what we ought to be doing and that's what we're moving away from\nOkay so Arthur I'm going to take a quick break and I want to come back with the question that I cannot find a satisfactory answer on I Am a big believer in capitalism\nHowever there is a throughout history some people like Vanderbilt et cetera et cetera they get so much money they have so much power that they are controlling things and it it just seems to spiral out of control when you have\nYou know a just a lock on this wealth and we are creating\nPeople through Google et cetera et cetera that are doing the same thing how do you balance the power how do you how do you make sure who's who can compete against Google\nHow are

saying you know socialism is great I Want what they have over in Sweden\nBut that's not what they have in Sweden isn't\nIt isn't and and by the way there are some people standing up for the bill of rights but competition guys like Glenn Beck you got a major megaphone and you're standing up for what's right and true in good the big problem is that are too many people in media and politics and entertainment in our poll campuses on the right and the last ... or ...\nOut on the fact that we have a culture of contempt in this country contempt for each other\nI mean Glen you and I we both have and everybody listening to us we love people who disagree with us politically that's fine that's a good thing I mean we all should have friends and and people that we were just really have to agree with them we should disagree strongly but we don't have to hate it when there are people that are making money and getting famous and getting powerful\nBy trying to get us to hate each other even more we should be talking about these good things that you talk about\nThe things that really bring us together and then tried to disagree in a way that the competition can actually convince other people persuade other people of our ideas but that's the big problem right now too many people are getting too rich\nBy by getting us to hate our neighbors and that's not right\nSo Arthur let's have let's have the conversation I'm I'm somebody in college and I say capitalism is evil and you know there's nothing wrong with socialism socialism is graded works in the Netherlands\nYeah I Know so I hear I hear it all the time we saw him on college campuses all the time they're waiting not to take that on is by trying to create liberal tears that's the wrong way to do it is to attack somebody's motive into say their belief system is stupid\nThat will you can never ever ever insult somebody into agreement and by the way it's an immoral thing to do because these are your brothers and sisters as well the key thing to start off with an any argument is to acknowledge the objective a moral objection to the people is to is to give voice to the fact that\nYou you want these social systems 'cause you want something more poor poor people have more equality where people have more opportunity right\nAnd get people to say yeah yeah yeah okay well let's figure out the best possible way to do it and then make the positive case for capitalism and democracy and free enterprise and entrepreneurship because it was lifted more people out of poverty in any system in human history\nIt's created a system of of equal opportunity that nobody has ever thought of in the history of humanity and say\nAnd now the problem is not that this is an equal but ... we haven't actually tried to make it as equal as possible and push it all the way out to the periphery of society let's do that together\nCan you give the arguments 'cause most I think even most conservatives fold on the the Netherlands or Sweden
