heart a it was fun but it didn't work people criticized us I think fairly pointed out where we were weak by using these journals and instead we committed to a few things going into this new project one is that we would not use paid published journals in any sense\nA secondly and by the way they don't charge like a hundred dollar they charge\nA couple of thousand ... ... it's really kind of a financial racket going on there is some big problem and I hope people continue to\nIt a secondly we decided that that um we would use the highest ranks journals within the disciplines that we're examining that we could get into so we would start at the best rental we could find for what we were doing and then work our way down if that one didn't take it would go to the next one\nAnd then thirdly we committed to being transparent about our results\nNo matter what happens so if our if we had gone crash and burn complete failure than um [noise] that would have would have been what we report it I don't think it would have gotten much attention but we would have come out and voted that we were wrong but it's it's not what happened um and uh\nEarly on in the process not just to keep us honest 'cause I think we would have kept our promise\nBut early on in the process we ended up in contact with a documentary filmmaker who is interested in the stuff already but he's been recording us for a year his name's Mike ... ... and since he's been a recording us I mean clearly what ever happened is going to come out so there it is\nOK so before we take a break a and get into what you actually got published I'm telling you about the work behind it just took a year to do what kind of time [noise] uh are you looking at\nThe easiest kind of look at what this is I had exactly five

was out there to try to emulate it\nAnd so what does what does having something published in one of these magazines mean ... what does it mean to the author and to the educational community [noise]\nSo for the author it is the absolute pinnacle of what an academic is trying to do in the research died of their career is to get papers published in well established journals of for example hype Asia is one of the journals we got a paper in and I pay ... is a\nFeminist philosophy journal was probably the highest spending so it would carry a lot of weight\nLooking at the academic community that that scholars and better than so they could take that to their university and say hey I got this many papers published\nIf people are being considered her tenure there's a research component to that depends on how the the school wants to do their tenure in process but typically seven papers spanning seven to ten years is considered the ... the basic research requirement to be

college classrooms and we have them go through some kind of a ... inventory that determines how privileged they are it recommends a thing called step forward step back game\nAs a possibility once ... privileges they are the students are ranked according to their privilege um then the more privileged few are the worst you get treated in class so the most privileged white and male students are invited to listen and learn throughout the semester which means they\nAren't allowed to speak or ask questions and class\nThey're invited to sit in the floor in chains to experience reparations and a level the the knowing field to be in a very privileged\nThe classroom learning environment and the problem that the reviewers seemed to have with this set of suggestions was that we thought there's no way this will get in\nWe have to temper it by saying we have to be compassionate to these students as we put them in the Florence Ames\nAnd they said watch it with compassion that re centers the needs of the privileged over the oppressed\nAnd there's this idea out there called the pedagogy of discomfort which means that you learn to overcome your privilege by being made uncomfortable and left to

and it would be confusing for the reader and to try to narrow it down to something a bit tighter\nAnd so on but um but the idea that they're giving students experiential reparations and asking them not to be able to speak in class or to be broken over interrupted to teach them what that feels like none of that was questioned ...\n... if this were published and they were real if this were published what what would that mean to the university system would would what does that mean [noise]\nSo ... all events is a really complicated I'm\nThere would be people who try to take this out in
