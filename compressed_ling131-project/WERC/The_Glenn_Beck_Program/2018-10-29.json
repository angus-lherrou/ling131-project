are angry Katie I asked the police department apologizes for a Facebook post they put up the Facebook post was for national school bus safety week\nThe picture it said Katie I asked the police department posted don't forget it's national school bus safety weak\nAnd the picture is of a metro bus in India\nProbably in Delhi because a lot of the people on the bus or Sikhs and Sikhs are primarily in Punjab in the state of Punjab Punjab east typically but a lot of them go to the big city of\nOf ah of Delhi the New York of of India and\nThey're all clinging to the bus summer sitting on top of the bus having been to India probably Thirteen fourteen times in my life I can tell you I've seen this this picture a hundred times I've seen this scene a hundred times the\nBuses in India did not have the capacity\nFor the number of people the country has which is a billion and they can't put more buses on the road because you can't put more vehicles on the roads they're too crowded as it is\nSo they maximize capacity\nProbably twenty percent of the people on a bus in India are actually in a seat or in the spot they're supposed to be in\nThey will clamor up on top of the bus they will hang on the side the bus they were hanging off the back of the bus they don't have the same ... safety standards we do I have seen guys that's the buses slowing down to a red light just hop off and

when you can no longer laugh most\nOf our laughter is based in things that today are offensive to someone\nWhen you're afraid to laugh which is a natural outlet for emotion when you were afraid to laugh because laughing would be a tacit endorsement of whatever was said nobody laughs nobody tries to make people laugh\nAbsent laughter the emotions you're left with or fatigue\nAnd I think that's a big part of our problem\nI think that's a big part of social media I think that's a big part of\nIt that the frustration in this society is you're allowed to be angry angers fine you can be angry ...
