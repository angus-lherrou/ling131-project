glad we ruined Brett Kavanaugh's life\nThere was a lot of that over the weekend I'm going to tell you what's going on with these individuals they're angry\nAnd it is a level of anger that they have no outlet for you have to remember with angry liberal women\n[noise]\nThey don't have a hunting trips they don't go to the range they\nDon't have outdoor activities they don't have football they don't have drinking beer with their buddies\nThey have an obsessive compulsive writing and reading Twitter's Twitter all day long layer on a forum there on the equivalent of a bulletin board all day long\nWhere each of them is screeching louder and louder and they all get sync up on every life process and allowed or one of 'em screams the next one screams louder\nYou ever seen a ... well I don't know that I've seen one I've heard of them were used to have coyotes outside her window but since the flood do you since the flood we don't have 'em any more I Wish they'd come back I like him but anyway we'd sit out back and listen to him\nWhen you hear a herd of certain animals you noticed that it seems that some are rising in intensity compared to the to the next one well that's what these sex and the city watching women do\nAnd I can paint you the profile and I bet you got one of them in your office most people do\nAnd it goes like this [noise]\nShe may have gone to a really good school are really elite school\nOr she may have gone to a state school that wasn't so good but she wishes she'd gone to the elite school and so she thinks that people who went to what are considered the elite schools are better than everyone else\nShe is someone who is perpetually unappreciated for how smart she is she's smarter than everybody else and she'll find ways to to express that\nShe has awareness of every left the cause and she's constantly seeking new ones\nWhatever that is the environment different race is a backgrounds religions issues plastics draws animals and she's she's got 'em all\nAnd she can barely keep it's a bit overwhelming frankly because at one moment she's got to worry about the dogs and then she's got to worry about the cats and then she's got to worry about the girls and\nNorthern Africa and then she's got to worry about Linda star sore and the Palestinians and then she's got to worry about blacks and cops and then she's got to worry about the illegal aliens stranded at the border and it's all a bit of will mean\nIt's it's truly she's got a minimum wage or she has to worry about um\nEven though she makes fifty sixty Seventy grand at her job she's very concerned about the minimum wage issues and then she's very very worried about women\nShe's always she's perpetually concern about women and this has really ratcheted up the last few years she is she sees everything through the lens of women who are on appreciated women who are not respected\nAnd her anger has boiled over just tired of it why doesn't she get to play football when she get to do with the boys do what does she get invited out for beers and she doesn't know it's because she's awful company to be around\nShe doesn't realize it's because everyone lives in fear that she's going to take a joke they make are some things they do out of context you can't enjoy yourself when she's around\nShe's upset at her daddy because he did not love her because her mind he wanted a boy and he probably did and she made it that much worse by just be an awful awful human being and she was probably that way her entire life her entire life and she continues to be that way\nAnd she's got some other miserable uh girls she hangs out with and maybe a gay guy\nAnd they go to bars and bitch about everything and and that doesn't mean she's not smart doesn't mean she's not creative those types end up as\nScreenwriters copy writers show producers for cold there\nAnd she has a history of riding some pretty vile nasty things really really really nasty\nThe good news is most of these types of women don't reproduce so they don't get an opportunity to raise a child as poisoned by the world as they are they don't get a chance to pollute the mind of another generation\nBut they are very aggressive\nAnd they have no empathy that is what makes them interesting is they have see roe embassy all the while crying and screaming and ... and and and angry these types of women would sleep your throat maybe they are I mean\nThey are a kind of mean an angry\nThey are emotionally and mentally unstable and I don't say that as a joke or an insult these individuals need mental health help some of them get it\nMost of them don't they self medicate um and and some of them are aware that they've got a depression by polarity a and various forms of mental illness and what they ought to do is find a hobby\nThey ought to take up those painting classes they ought to find some things that would be a productive outlet for their energy but they don't\nInstead they go back to their apartment though very alone and they see the company of their herd on this Twitter machine\nAnd they lash out and then they go you go girl they all they have this fake support false support unit around them they use alcohol and other drugs which are triggers to their mental health problems which is not good\nAnd then they they dive into an art consumed by politics which is the worst form of trigger for their emotional instability and that's why when you ask yourself\nPeople often ask don't these people have day jobs they're always at protests\nProtests are aware they gather gay that's their hunting trip\nThat's their fishing trip that's their poker night of protests is a great opportunity for them to that summer camp\nTo these ... and that's why they love it that's why they're always looking for a place to gather and scream and holler and cry and be around other people who are frankly no Joe ... not not insulting\nAs crazy as they are and when I say crazy I mean truly psychotic end of it
