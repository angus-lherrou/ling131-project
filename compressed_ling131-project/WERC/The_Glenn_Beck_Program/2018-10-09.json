technically because a state Senate race would be a race to be a state senator which should be a senator in each of those individual states in their state Capitol in their state legislature these are\nRaces that are elected state by state so not to quibble but just so we're all talking about the same thing\nThe Ted Cruz versus Beto O'Rourke raise for instance [noise] what the Democrats strategy was and it was clearly state it was to take each of these states and focus on local issues are\nThe Democrats tend to do better on localized issues\nIn states where it's purple where it's a

you listen carefully to what he says he says things like you know we have to be better we after we're all working in this together and and you know I'm here with you and and you're with me and if you look in his accomplishments it is visiting every county in the states\nBut then she did that when she was the governor of South Carolina I think she did that during the presidential election when she managed to insert herself and I think that she has shown a propensity to do that\nAs the UN ambassador [noise]\nHowever I think that Trump in his own unique way understood that she was a good face for America and his administration\nBecause she's independent she\nDoes not look like she's a puppet of him and yet she's fearless and she's fierce and it's not an easy thing to walk into the United nations where the knives are out for you\nKnowing that this president is making some of the statements he has made a bold statements to the world [noise] announcing that we're going to pursue our own national interest in it to the extent that you get in the way of that there's going to be a problem and you're going to be punished [noise]\nThe United nations is not accustomed to hearing an American president speak in this manner\nThey have not heard an American president speak in this manner [noise]\nThey've heard the soft elegant a language of flourish is\nThat the diplomats who typically occupy the White House um will use\nThe Trump doesn't speak in those tones and he doesn't speak with that message and he has managed to back it up and I think that that's probably not an easy thing for Nikki Haley I don't know that there is a there is really no speculation to speak of as to why she has resigned\n[noise]\nThe timing of this is rather odd it it appears\nHasty [noise]\nAs it does just before the midterms and I'm going to say this I Can't imagine\n[noise] well I don't\nWant to speak and then regret my words [noise] this sort of distraction [noise] this close to the midterms is not healthy it's not helpful\nAnd it's just again or that Nikki Haley is not a team player which has been my suspicion all alone [noise] [noise] I have noticed sometimes\nIn political and corporate life [noise] that there will be individuals like\nHer who [noise] are so self absorbed and got help if you have to work for one of them [noise] uh who are\nAnd I have no knowledge of how she treats her staff but I Would not be shocked if she's one of those whose abusive I've been around her type before and\nI have seen how they are everything is about them all the time [noise] everything is about them everything is about their when their wishes everything is related to what the next step up I can take\n[noise] and they are they\nAre not the types of individuals who make for good I'm number twos they're not the types of individuals who make for good teammates\nIn the sense that they make a sacrifice for the good of the organization or the group or the campaign or whatever else a it is all related to what's in it for me\nAnd I I have a I've had this conversation the number of times by people who are quite bowled over by Nikki Haley um and I\nI think that some of the reason they're bowled over by Nikki Haley is she's a non white woman\nWho is a Republican and Republicans have almost a fetish for that sort of thing they get so excited and part of that is because Republicans are so wounded when they're called racist that they grasping\nAt straws they they they go in search this panicked desperate search for a non white non mail a person who can be pushed out front and they can be the face of the Republican Party [noise]\nI think that's part of why Ben Carson's campaign ... got as much support as it did Ben Carson had absolutely positively no business none ... zero [noise] none\n... he had no business being in a conversation about who should be president none but he did and I would argue for all the wrong reasons and I know that because you didn't have to talk very long\nTo a white male Ben Carson supporter until they worked into the conversation how great it was that he's black\nOr his race should have nothing to do with it and I think that the Democrats have so beleaguered Republicans over a period of time that they've created this this sort of a natural desire to lift up from our ranks\nA non white non mail I'm\nRepublican who could be the face of the party because then the idea has always been yeah see see now you can't say were racist anymore so now you you can't say were racist anymore\nWell that's probably more than I should have revealed about Nikki Haley I Hope it's not that she has a a health crisis or some sort of a personal crisis because then I'd feel a little bit bad\nBut I still stand by the comments made I suspect it's not that I suspect that this is classic Nikki Haley if you actually look into her past and that this was an opportunity for her to get a lot of attention right before the midterms coming as it does I Hope that's not the case\nAnd so we'll see what happens but what a difference between Iran when we first game I'd like to save the day before we give and uh also if you look at North Korea there was a a deal that there was something that was a\nIt was a devastating potentially devastating problem and now the relationships are very good secretary of state Mike Pompeo had just left\nHad a great meeting also fish in China also spoke to many of the Asian leaders or went there and uh that's some good meetings but had a really very good meeting with North Korea\nAnd German Kim and we just read a lot of friends are so many other friends who also and I think the world is like you said the world is really respecting the United states again much more so they haven't done they have in many many decades we are respected again that I can tell you very much respect and again\nAnd people want to be on our side but even if you look at their votes early in the ... votes that we would normally get no votes were getting\nVery strong votes now so uh I just want to take ... and I thought this would be an appropriate way of doing it because when you write it out on a piece of paper that you know embarrassing rarely will be leaving and you say nice things people say well\nWhat's going on this is the right way to do and what do you really think so but he's done a terrific job so I felt this was an appropriate way of doing\nIt and we both liked it so\nI just wanted to say the ambassador I just wanted to say\nWhat we have a number of people it would very much like to do it it's a great position and a Nikki realized that she's a she's a she's helped make in a much better position if you want to know that they just become\nMaybe a more glamorous position than it was two years ago maybe I Wonder why but it is the benches made it a very glamorous desertion she's ready to a more important to swirl board way more important [noise]\nDesertion so we have a I can almost say many people that want to do it at a very good people and it operates I'll be talking also to Nikki about a those are the generals out of my step but we have many people that are very very much interested in\nDoing this says is also the first one was for\nKnow not only on a frustrated I think it's incredible what you're talking about North Korea it's amazing the way the media who we will continue\nThe
