Fox News the FBI is leading the investigation into today's shooting at a synagogue in Pittsburgh the left eleven people dead and six others injured including for police officers\nUm you said the same thing two thousand fourteen remember Democrats got smoked again they're Republicans fifty nine percent said they were really interested only forty eight percent of Democrats said that um and what's interesting is leading up to I Would say Brett Kavanaugh\nYou had the same type of thing playing out again in this time in favor of the Democrats it started to look a lot like two thousand six so up until ... you had sixty three percent of Democrats highest levels of interest in the election Republicans was only fifty three percent\nIs uh you know a big it's the type of gap that leads you to lose that Senate he ... and lose the house or at least makes it possible ...\nSince capital that has changed Democrats have gone up\nFrom sixty three to Seventy two percent holy cow Seventy two is the highest number for any party and all of these elections\nHowever Republicans have jumped a higher percentage point basis from fifty three to sixty eight so now we have a basically a balance\nA very close within the margin of error separation and both of those numbers sixty eight would be the second highest level of interest of all of these elections so the Democrats are Seventy two Republicans are sixty eight both of those numbers are the highest of any of these elections going back to two thousand six ... two thousand and six midterms\nI'm and I'm which is which is crazy it is a a a ... there's a level here that we don't know what's gonna happen [laughter] you know if this is like you know this is territory that has not been seen before\nAnd ... you know while you can look at the polls and you can see the polls as we've talked about over the past couple of weeks relatively for relatively pointing towards a Republican or a ... victory in the Senate where they maybe pick up a couple of seats and Republican loss in the house where they would lose a couple of decades\nUm there is a you know if you wanna look at the time to be optimistic way of looking at the house right now\nTo show you how close is if Republicans were just sweep the races they are favored in\nOkay that that it's not going to happen it never happens but just kind of generally for understanding if there would be able to sweep all of the races there favored in\n... and they revealed a when all of the races that they trailed by one point\nSo all of these races are either victories are toss ups right I mean they could go either way but if they were to sweep all of those Republicans still hold the house at two twenty two Fifteen now the problem is the idea that they're going to sweep all those races is\nWe know that's not going to happen it never happens the other thing is they will win some races where they're underdogs by more than one point they will win some place where the down by five in the polls they'll want him winning some of those races so the split is going to be important here\nBut just that gets them only to two twenty two Fifteen which is a I think they lose that's been losing ten seats from where they are now um but also a very narrow majority to the point where some conservative things could be derailed by just you know your generic moderate house member that you've never heard their name before\nUm when they decide they're going to vote against the president\nSo it's an interesting a way of looking at it\nAnd it shows that this really could go either way I mean when they say that there's about a twenty percent chance the Republicans lose the Senate and about a twenty percent chance that the Republicans when the house\nThat's the way that these models are all kind of looking at it twenty percent is one in five right um so it is very possible that one of these things could happen\nBut right now it looks like those are going to wind up getting split and then of course still has ... even though you're not gonna be able to pass the Democratic bills because they would either give each other on the turn of the house you're still going to have investigative power to have subpoena power are going to have imposed\nA nightmare it's a nightmare if if they get the house it's a nightmare okay so\nHere's here's what I found interesting in um in watching the news\nAnd watching just the flow of it have you noticed that you know places like the Atlantic and the times and the post are now starting to publish stories about\nYou know it's an uphill battle to win some of these races in the house it's an uphill battle they have changed their tone from um you know an absolute positive well we're on a blue wave to now almost laying the foundation\nOf oh\nYeah well we lost but it was you know it was really kind of a long shot anyway\nAbout I mean I that's how badly I think the Kavanaugh saying a has backfired on them\nI mean it's made the Senate basically I mean again it's just that it's one of the five chance but I mean\nThey had they had a better chance of this uh two months ago I mean they had a legitimate path to victory when Cruz was only up by three points all of these races that looked like leaning Republican we're all toss up and some of them looked like they might be leading Democrat\nThey had a chance to win the Senate before the Kavanaugh saying now I mean I think it's real real answer really going\nTo come to the independents how are the independence feeling\n... they're in an interesting group because they are not as passionate as you would expect in this environment so independence in two thousand six and two thousand ten where at fifty percent\nIndependents are almost always going to be lower in a high interest in partisans because ... gauge more like chipping away I'm the type of course a blanket rule but it's typical of and she doesn't fourteen it was down to forty percent and she doesn't eat uh Eighteen up until Kavanaugh was forty two percent\nAnd then uh the jump now to forty six percent so still that's not as high as some of the earlier elections among independents and that may just be because they're overwhelmed with them and they don't they don't like either side and they just want it makes them want to withdraw from\nPalo yeah but I Wonder 'cause I Would consider myself an independent yeah and there's no way you're going to keep me away from the polls and so I'm Wondering you know would that four percent jump was it a four percent effort to preserve four percent jump I'm I Wonder how much of that or people like me who are going to vote for\nThe Republican just because the left has gone insane right and there's a lot of independence that I ... I mean I certainly would fall into this category as well right I Am not registered member of any party nor will I ever be ... like was that being said uh you know I vote Republican\nI mean I don't vote for Democrats [laughter] so I've been for Republicans independents and libertarians libertarians they don't vote for Democrats but yeah I mean so that's never going to happen so the fact that I'm an independent you can't look at that line as\nThese are people who could go either way it anytime between these two parties that's not what that is right people who identify that way as a group that ... that's growing and has been growing for quite some time yes people are bailing out of the parties um but the parties themselves are becoming a more rigid in and were\n... could come down to the independents mhm this one could come down to because you can understand the Republicans going up you can understand if you're on the Democratic side Kavanaugh driving all those people but what's driving the independent\n[noise] yeah I mean I Would think they are discussed with what's going on right [laughter] if anything or they don't like the overall system there's one other interesting those data here Glenn if we could yeah I'm as we're talking about the caravan of of uh immigrants coming migrants whatever\nAs well which will will be illegal immigrants if they if they get it all the way up by the way who who said that was coming uh\nOh yeah there's this burger yeah it definitely we talked about among them a lot about this Huh Interesting to see the numbers among Latino voters so ah in two thousand six were coming off of the attempt at comprehensive immigration reform that fails ... Republicans very upset about that Democrats win that election relatively easily um\nA Latino at sixty two percent high interest in the election\nThat number in mid term elections has been dismal sense in ... in two thousand ten was only forty eight percent two dozen fourteen who was forty one percent very low a in two thousand uh Eighteen up until very recently or was it was at forty seven percent that number has now jumped\nIn October of two dozen Eighteen Seventy one percent from forty seven to Seventy one this year so this is a whatever the reason while they were not as high as in two thousand six for Latino voters who are and again that was a wave election for Democrats\nIt's I mean the only thing I can think of is the Guatemalan\nRefugees what else has happened I mean you did have also a fairly recently the unaccompanied minors situation where they were being quote unquote held in cages in July or August yeah but still ... relatively recently or um\nWe absolutely Iraq than can be either June all our leaders lower the temperature stay in\nAround your seatbelt\nUse news radio one oh five five so when we are the\nThis is the Fox news alerts Tom Debbie hand like Pennsylvania governor Tom Wolfe is standing by Pittsburgh\nJewish committed ... as they recover from the deadly shooting not left a loving dead\nShabaab is it time for reflection time for finding peace not providing which Pennsylvania's Jewish community as strong vibrant and resilient now's the time more than ever to come together and to support each other\nNo children were injured or killed six adults including four officers were injured President Trump addressed the tragedy before future farmers and Indianapolis today\nThis wicket act of mass murder is pure evil [noise] hard to believe and frankly some things that is on imaginable\nThe suspect forty six year old Robert ... ours is an costs today says Fox News [noise]\nThis report is brought you buy Velveeta shells and cheese\nAnd partly cloudy and cooler conditions as we go through the overnight hours about sunrise Sunday Morning will be around forty nine sunny in the afternoon on Sunday however with\nThan after five Seventy five mostly clear again Sunday night ... and the w._b.

I'm Out of the many one right we don't have a whole bunch of one right now we don't have a shared sense of what you've just said the first amendment is the beating heart of the American experiment freedom of religion freedom of the press freedom of assembly freedom of speech right of protest\nAll of those things flow from the fundamental assumptions about the dignity of three hundred and twenty million Americans which is\nWe believe a ... day we believe that our citizens are created in the image of God with eternal souls and\nWith dignity that way bigger than their policy preferences and so what's unique in our moment I think the grand tension that we as a people are not really wrestling through that is so far upstream from politics is this tension between rudeness and ruthlessness almost all of the happiness literature a few well out there\nIt's confirming stuff that wise people people who've had grandparents have known for millennia\nWhich is that happiness is actually a relatively simple equation do you have a nuclear family do you have a couple of deep friendships or do you have a local worshipping community you have a theological framework to make sense of death and suffering and forth and statistically the number one driver of happiness is do you have a meaningful vocation do you have shared work do you have co workers\nDo you think when you leave home on Monday morning\nWhen you go to do something not to make a lot of money or do you have a lot of status\nBut is there some neighbor who benefits from what I Do if those four things are true or even if three of the four true you're pretty likely to be happy and that those things are all tied to rudeness but we're living through a technological revolution that's tempting us to believe that we can be ruthless we can be place less\nAnd so a lot of what's happening as the undermining of local community and the undermining of thick relationships and the undermining of vocation or long work um ends up in a world where a lot of people are using political tribalism to fill a void of the loneliness that's actually happening in their local community and I think we need to reflect more deeply on that challenge of our time\nAll right so I'm going to take a quick break and I want to come back and talk about um the press talk about uh the new press if you will Facebook and\nWhat you write about with deep fakes um you seem to be one of the very few in Washington that really get to this ah and you're looking over the horizon and we want to talk about that we are talking to Ben Sasse\nHis new book is called them why we hate each other and how he'll [noise]\nGland that [noise]\nIt's pathetic what they've done to this guy and I think they know it and they don't care and the\nThe Democrats don't care that grace got at the time they got enough money to go out to dinner but they can't buy health care shut off now in the morning to seven AM Easter how about the guilty until proven innocent cycle we're in right now restoring sand to a world gunmen world we live in this\nUnbelievable that gray on now with the seven am eastern on the blaze [noise]\nGet Birmingham news on demand when you wanted from Alabama's largest radio news team at W.
