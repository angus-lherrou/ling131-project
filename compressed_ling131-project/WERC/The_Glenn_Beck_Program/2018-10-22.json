any particular infectious disease\nWell I I dealt with uh we didn't have it in all cases here but when you call it hit Dallas I warn the Methodist system within which I I work I'm unemployed but uh uh that we can do something to you a creator protocol to keep your patients sort of compartmentalized and they adopted that\nMore more\nCompanies offering health care you don't have to go through a marketplace where they have to set the rules for what the insurance companies can offer gift people choice over what they want to buy for their health care\nI agree\nSo let's go back to the issue of Obamacare as a governance issue and not a campaign issue there one of the last\nVotes that John McCain cast was voting against remember he did the famous thumbs down he held out of area and that was what was known as skinny repeal [laughter] and the reason for that was it was not a complete repeal of Obamacare but\nIt was a repeal of the the worst elements\nOf it go and we simply didn't get the votes to repeal it\nMcCain voted against us I think Susan Collins Collins against us right\nJust the same way that you're dealing with the Jeff Flake I'm On the Kavanaugh hearings if we can't get that swing Republican voter to cast a vote\nThan we can't repeal it but when you say that health care is the number one issue facing twenty eight percent of Americans it's important to understand\nThat is the number of Americans who say it's the most important issue you're assuming that everyone feels the way you do in that is small business owner I'm spending money that this is not a wise use of this was a disproportionate amount of money I'm spending\nOn health care and health insurance is not helping parents help do iris right right\nAnd and I understand the reverse of that though is that you had all of these Democrats including bacteria that are saying we want to fix health care to the extreme of making it you know universal or or free and I mean where we you know\nRepublicans are are almost to that point that we're ready to jump that show because it's so everything is so expensive everything is ready to jump on the show to kill agreed with the Democrats that you are you're you're almost to a point where you need\nA blanket minimum level of care just just as part of the taxes and and covering covering basic care as opposed to paying\nAll of this money and still not receiving basic care how would that help things again it's it's an African this year for the Democrat that they're promising all of these things\nKnow it's a policy issue it's you forget the campaign you're actually going to enact policies to peel back Obamacare ... it's not simply so here's here's where they get us is it\nWe'll go well hell if the government's going to run it anyway\nThen let's just go ahead and let the government running and less run it more efficiently from the government at that point they warn you down or\nAt that point it's not about winning and losing elections anymore now you take health care off the table but more important than what wins or loses elections how the issue was framed to win or lose elections\nNow you've hurt healthcare now you hurt your people and that matters\nAnd and whether you can use the fact that people's lives are worse to get them to vote for change\nIs the secondary function because you have hurt your fellow American and that can never be acceptable or we can never say take one for the team in hope we can win an election\nBecause that means that people are you go visit your relative in the hospital\n... and you see public policy at play and the doctors tell you we can't deliver health care as efficiently as effectively as we could in the longer the nurses tells you that the uh people who are long term care patients who were before and after I tell you that\nYou had to take away people's insurance\nBecause some people didn't have insurance which they just we now know they just didn't choose to buy it so you took everybody off their insurance started them over so that you could over insure them I mean look it's\nIt's a seemingly complicated issue that can be reduced to this point in order to provide insurance for people who were choosing not to buy it\nYou had to force people who were paying for insurance are ready to pay for more insurance you had to charge them for things that they'll never pay for that is why you're charging ... for for osteopathic care\nThat they themselves can't use it while you ... your charging old people for pregnancy care you know they'll never used ... what you're doing is packing on a cafeteria plan a set of requirements and cost to offset the expense over here\nI I took a southern studies course that ... and I was thinking okay this is great get some of the rich history of Mississippi and because I grew up my elementary school years of Mississippi so somewhat familiar with it and then turns out\nIt was basically a class that made me feel bad for being a white southerner
