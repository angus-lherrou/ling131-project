cliff with the rest of humanity\nI Do not believe the victim\nI Will take seriously the account of the accuser then I Will look at the facts if there was a preponderance of evidence then I Will presume\nThat person either innocent or guilty [noise] but after I've seen facts [noise] is this kind of stuff was going on this should all be in the court of law\n[noise] if you are a victim [noise]\nSociety will do nothing for you because we cannot do anything for you if you haven't gone to the police and reported it\nIf you believe that we live in a rape culture then you have a responsibility to go to the police and document everything that has been done\n[noise]\nThen we as a society need to do everything we can to make sure that justice is served not on a collective basis but judging it by the individual case\nThat is a just society that is America\n[noise] Mm [noise]\nNearly ending to that going back program [noise] one of my favorite guys or because he is he does his own homework he rolls up his sleeves he looks and he tells the truth as he finds that Peter ... is a here he's the president of government accountability Institute and a producer of a new documentary that's out called the creepy line\nAnd that is exactly the right\nName for it [laughter] it is that actually the creepy line comes from a speech that Eric Smith Schmidt the CEO of Google gave it was an interview in fact where he was asked how do you make these ethical judgments about how far you're going to go\nAnd the the interviewer actually asked Schmidt are you going to implant things in our brain and here's Schmidt's response was well we like to go right up to the creepy line but not cross it he said we're not going to plant anything in your brain at least not yet those are actually erupt Schmitz word and\nHe ... he used to I find him incredibly Frank yes he he just he says it like it is yeah it's I I've interviewed him a couple of times and it is fascinating yes because he's just\nTelling you he he doesn't sugarcoat it and I think it's his background as an engineer a and and he sort of very direct I mean one of the other things we caught him when the film was saying is that Google a house and takes very seriously its responsibility to change the values\nOf American people uh you know Google's monitor has always been there are more than just a company to make money or they have a certain ... certain world view and part of the reason that they structure of the company the way they did in which the founders always have controlling shares is that that sense of social mission is part of it\nAnd Schmidt has been always very direct about saying it yes part of our mission as a company has been to try to shape and changed the values of the United states and that sort of one of the premises of this film that it's not just about privacy is not that they're taking all this information\nGlenn they're using that information against us to try to nudge us or to move us in directions there that we wouldn't ordinarily want to go\nOkay so um so let's continue Titus all to Kavanaugh and what we've seen with the Kavanaugh case and how\nFor instance you know there's there's um a\n... there is just overwhelming uh understanding from half the country that he is absolutely guilty and she is a victim right and there's a lot of information on the other side in fact more information on the other side but you're not really seen that right\nYeah it's it's very hard because this is happening in real time right now to sort of monitor what's a Google doing but we can look at the past uh in fact one of the things we feature in the film is a study done by a Robert ... a ... a very interesting guy he's a Harvard PHD in psychology studied under BF Skinner\nOr was the former editor in chief of Psychology Today magazine and by the way and this is very relevant was a Hillary Clinton supporter and twenty sixteen\n... one of the things he did and the twenty sixteen election was he had two thousand people around the country doing Google searches are and they monitored the result the people were getting this is a very ah you know a clear academic study and and this research was peer reviewed as his other work was\nAnd what came back was that Google was systematically skewing search results in favor of Hillary Clinton they were in other words they were a suppressing negative stories about Hillary in the algorithm and they were pushing them in favor of Donald Trump\nAnd ... point was I actually supported Hillary Clinton thought she was more qualified but the bottom line is a company should not be doing this and it secret you don't know that it's going on nobody's monitoring the results are getting their assuming the results in the list that they are getting is representative of some objective standard\nGoogle is a Google is a verb but now they are not an hour and yeah it's a verb auto Google it yes well if you Google it and the end the algorithm is giving you the answer that is skewed right that's like going to a dictionary\nThat will always changed the definitions of things but as it applies to whatever's happening in the world yes that's real problem\nNo you're you're exactly right and so in the in the context of ... I mean I don't know exactly what because it's a real time but the bottom line is there is a history here of Google doing this it was it was leaked um uh a couple of weeks ago Tucker Carlson talked about five\nOr about these internal emails where you actually had Google engineer's saying hey you know what we don't like you know Trump's policy on immigration so we want to sort of a suppress certain stories\nUm this is the thing and Google does it end and here's the the the point that we try to make Glenn in this film and in general\nThe whole conversation that Google wants to have is about fake news and this debate about fake news here's here's the bottom line fake news is competitive\nIf you and I are having a disagreement about something I put up my fake news story and you say oh yeah I'm going to put my fake news story the pointed it out in the open you have combat and by the way the news doesn't really convince anybody you know if you like Hillary Clinton that fake news add that the Russians ran of Jesus and\nAnd and Hillary arm wrestling is probably not going to convince you that voted different wet I wasn't that that wasn't a real arm wrestling [laughter]\nBut you know the point is is that that's not going to convince anybody because a confirmation bias you know\nPeople tend to look for information they want what Google is doing is different because we don't know what we don't know\nThe question that we should be asking people the Google and Facebook is why will you knock make your algorithm transparent right why will you know I mean and I let me take a quick break and come back or do you have an answer their answer on why they won't make it transparent yes and it's not very\nGood and you know not not that it's not the name of the documentary is the creepy line review line dot com Peter ... with us and we have a lot to discuss because of the plant forming\nA and kind of a role in from our last conversation about\nInformation how do you know that it's true and we'll prove information will will actual information\nWill you be allowed to see or keep in the few [noise]\nClan [noise] that [noise]\nStupid Internet stuff so quick cure for free\nI got a virus smart Internet stuff\nLet's discuss it really want to do some good in America that answer some questions about your own propaganda hit out here and discuss solutions about how we really help people instead of propaganda give God I offer that he knew that come in New York how do you want to sit down at a coffee shop you want to do it all I don't care [noise]\nKavanaugh is confirmed here the pages hair I told ... all of the proceedings lined use radio ...

the creepy line and it comes from a a quote from the guy who's running the Google\nThat you know we were not going to implant things into your head but we're going to come right up to that creepy line has terrified beer from somebody who's in charge of Google\nPeter uh I I Want to I Want to talk to you about the platform me\nI Am currently say to anyone who has a conservative voice\nLet's all get on a single server let's get on to our own platform together we don't have to join business area but we have to have a protected platform because I Believe these companies are are going to the platform us one by one\nIs this what you've been doing here yeah I I think you're very smart to do that I think you're very smart to do that because\nLet's step back in first consider the power of Google and a lot of people don't realize this but it was widely reported in the guardian elsewhere in two thousand nine Google actually shut down the entire Internet for two hours on a Saturday morning they blacklisted the entire Internet\nThat shows you the the scope and size that Google ... wait a minute how it is it's it's a ... they blacklisted the entire Internet if you go to the guardian WWW yes they shut down the entire Internet a couple of years later they shut down half of Japan's Internet\nOr they said it was sort of an error that they but but the point being the size and the scope of this company is enormous and a lot of people don't realize even if they're not using it Google product somebody will say why don't use Gmail I'm not worried about Gmail that's fine\nHere's your company ... you know it may be John Smith at acme incorporated dot com but his acne incorporated email server actually a Google product\nBecause if it is golf Google is monitoring and watching what you're doing and it's part of the data collection they're doing on you a lot of news organizations in the United states use Google we we we highlight in the film for example\nRobert up sign this caller who's been critical of Google\nA link to support a Clinton supporter a Harvard PHD in psychology um Iran or did some studies and the Washington Post ran a piece about could Google swing an election this was back in twenty twelve yeah the next day\nRobert F Stein was shot out of Google he could not get on Firefox he could not get any on on any of the uh the Google products they had shut 'em out same thing happened to Jordan Peterson a University of Toronto professor\nWho had taken a position about forced speech on gender or gender pronouns the next morning when that went public he was locked out of his Gmail accounts\nAnd Google would not let him back into his Gmail account all of his emails his calendars and everything he was blocked from\nThe point being they have a lot of power and you cannot assume that Google is not going to take these actions people will say a lotta times whether a company they want to make their customers happy they are more than a traditional company they say so themselves they view themselves as a company with a mission so\nHere's what people say when when you know what I use ... well you know Google is monitoring your mail they're not reading my mail actually\nYou are both right and wrong they are not reading your mail however they are analyzing your mail because what they're doing is collecting the information on how people relate to one another how people talk to one another all for their a I\nResearch so Google isn't free right for no reason\nThat's exactly right you you are the product we say what is Google's product you are the product because they are selling information on Glenn Beck or on Peter Schweitzer or on whoever\nAnd more importantly I think they are analyzing all of it look\nLike there's that this is just the beginning let me tell ya boogie story mhm you go to Beijing there are three concentric circles of security in Beijing okay this center is the main city of Beijing how many people it
