Miller and Ken Paxton\nYeah so yeah you just I I honestly thought most of the stuff that gets can was thrown out but it currently his lawyers are trying to you know push the trial off as long as they can make it seem like a gift when he was up in Dallas for every was how he made a bunch of money you know he wasn't rich before he became a state senator rep and now he's got a bunch of money\nAnd like I Will admit that to the criminal justice system but I don't want a Democrat in there because we haven't if Paxton steps down even if he had to step down there's no reason to believe he's going to the governor would be able to appoint\nHis replacement and I can assure you I Would like that person more than whoever the Democrat alternative to Ken Paxton is right and it's just as simple as that Steve\nSteve ... today is the day of the a charge of the light brigade\nWould you like to read that or would you like me to read it\nAll that you read it because I don't even know what that is

know it it gets thrown on the doorstep are sold by the homeless people in the median that that will not be\nThat I that won't be around or they won't be much of it I remember thinking that's the dumbest thing I've ever heard why would you say something so stupid\nBut he was right and he knew it I mean they they knew they knew what was coming but what happened to newspapers is twofold\nIt's not one or the other it's both working in concert are both working simultaneously or\nThe first one is they fell out of touch with their listener base and that was the function of media generally falling out of touch with the listener base and and that is partly because of number two which is the change in technology\n[noise] [noise] I had a a chronicle editor told me years ago\nThat you have to understand that the chronicle is actually as a business major city newspapers not just a chronicle major city newspapers as a business or just a delivery mechanism the content is to get you to go pick it up\nBut what they could do that no one else could do is deliver the mail every morning to every house meaning the post office can't\nDo it like that by the way a Clapper\nHas received what is I think recorded as the twelfth package\nNow so now you're finally starting to see the U.S post office inconsistencies because some of the packages are arriving at different times\nIn a way so\n... with the change in technology\nIt was no longer so valuable to be able to get people something to their doorstep that distribution network was nothing short of amazing there was nothing else like it the post office even wasn't even that impressive ... they were distributing something\nTo every single household or close enough at a time when that was valuable\nAnd some of what they were distributing was information quote unquote news\nBut some of it was who was having a gardening sale this weekend or a home and garden sales and uh what auto dealer was taking out the biggest dad was the biggest discount on on automobiles so when you look at it like that\nAnd then you realize that that was no longer valuable when the Internet would allow you to do that but in real time it meant that newspapers lost a big source of their influence their power and and their funding back into\nThe dirty little secret in the newspaper business was all the money was made the classified ads and the green sheets and then eventually\nUh uh\nCraig's list and monster and all the different ways people exchange goods and services online real time\nMeant they didn't need the newspapers anymore so the newspapers had to try to keep up with their on with their own online presence but they were still a company that was that was run in the dark ages so now you had non tech people trying to build a tech industry [noise]\nAnd then you have occasions like the Drudge Report where Matt Drudge running his business out of his living room take stories that in the Washington Post has to put\nSeveral people on and they spend a month working a story and they put it up on their site and then Matt Drudge posted a link to that site and he gets more hits than they do he gets more hits on his website in the Washington Post New York times\nAnd Chicago Tribune and probably the next ten biggest papers combined\nAnd his staff cost him ... and a couple of slumped ... but you get the point\nHe's much bigger and much more influential\nSo as the chronicle became less and less profitable ... they they shed more and more of their writers and editors and you can see that and as that was happening the media was doing more and more left because you the people started growing in power\nWhat nobody talks about is that technology democratized America\nYou have so much more influence and that's what drives the media crazy is that left wing Facebook is just a portable by which you can tell your neighbors how you're voting in while you're voting that way you couldn't do that with the chronicle the chronicle talked to you you didn't get to talk to your neighbors not in that way\nAnd so and now they've their editorial board I don't even know who's on it anymore but their editorials are tucked behind paywalls so that nobody reads them anyway and they've skewed so far left so the short\nAnswer is no I don't know who they've indoors I Know they didn't endorse Ted Cruz because he posted about
