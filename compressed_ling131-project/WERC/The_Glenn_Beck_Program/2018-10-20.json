{"month": "10", "state": "AL", "station": "WERC", "content": "These are some moments from this past week's Alabama's morning news with ... news radio one oh five five tell you we are seeing\nThis is Alabama morning who's on Jason joining us now Congress from Bradley Byrne talking about a number of issues just to see the need to be with you here I met you in\nWashington as we as in Alabama great to see you too so we've got a bunch of things I Want to go over with you but first let's talk about the the fifty votes for the wall act or what are you doing with this what okay\nHere's the problem we've had we've actually passed the money for the wall out of the house\nBut stuck in the Senate because the Senate has the sixty votes ... yeah\nWell we've been fish around saying wait a minute we were able to get tax reform through by having this reconciliation rules that you get involved with what you do your budget\nSo my bill does is it puts the wall through that same reconciliation process so you only need fifty votes in the Senate not facility I'm On board we get we take them we instruct the committee involved\nTo come up with the money they take it from anywhere they want to check it out of mandatory spending\nBut you come up with twenty seven billion dollars that is locked away for building the wall\nOr what would sixty votes to pass what we're talking about border security is so it's having with Guatemala and all the other countries just an influx yeah caravans yeah you know the president said you know just recently look\nI'll bring our military down there but I have to yeah hum and he wants Mexico to take care of this problem you guys need to fix this all these people coming into our southern border so\nWhat do you think the possibility of getting the president's ah ah I guess which was granted by Mexico and the military I think it's much\nBetter than it was I was just in Honduras in Guatemala two weeks ago and um talk about poor people these are extremely poor people very violent place so I understand the push is pushing them out and of course the poll that sport on there is is that if they get here if they get here which is a big yeah yeah\nThen they you know talking about incredible increasing the quality of their life\nBut we just can't fix the world's problems that's not our job famous Mexico needs to stop them at the Mexican border before they even get to American more right and these people are being paid by who George Soros and all these other outlets and you know these are poor people you have a few dollars him from um and it's you know it's the best things are wrapped in their life\nLook we've got this new trade deal with Mexico we've got some good things go on with them less prevail upon them use are good offices for them to stop these people at the Mexican border which is south so that they never get to the American border that's what the president wants to I think he's smart to do it\n... Bradley Byrne about a number of issues the Kavanaugh hearing boy what a circus that was and\nI mean just off I Want to get your general thoughts on that and also\nThe push back in the violence that's an hour Upton yes against people like Ted Cruz and all Republicans that support the president and or Kavanaugh being accosted in restaurants on public I mean spit upon this whole cabinet thing really let a firecracker under both sides\nDid we saw in our office the number of calls and\nMy office dramatically increase non not in the Senate right but people are just you know you're amped up at all or somebody they know yeah so I asked my staff right we got the exact numbers of how many more calls were getting in a set of the pro or anti Kavanaugh were nine ... percent pro capping them after they mainly guys who are these women mainly women\nOkay so this whole narrative you've been getting from the national news many all women are all posed to walk and southwest Alabama right that's not true\nWell my wife's pro Kevin ... she was ... her friends pro cabin I you're right that the rhetoric from the ... the media that seems to lean left in eight the president was pushing that and it's just fake\nNews it it it is now here's here's the thing judge Kavanaugh's not some newbie\nHe's been around for a while I worked in the White House worked for Ken Starr had to go through this entire vetting process before he gone to the DC circuit court of appeals right big darned deal ... and so here yet and he's going all the way through this confirmation process and we're right down at the end and then boom\nNow the circumstances under which these things happen [noise] you you should take that into account when you're weighing or I just just real it is not rewrite\nAnd then you look at the circumstances where she says the non and misled or you know it's just there for a long time then it gets quote leaked leak legally that's what they do with these things and then she's getting this high powered law firms structure social media can she was used\n... I agree and I ... ... we're talking with congressman Bradley Byrne a I wanted to talk to you about these midterm elections that are right around the corner what do we four weeks away here now\nAnd that you're talking about the blue wave versus the red wave and who's going to show up who's more fired up and you know I I'm looking at everything that the president has done and the country is really\nOn an upward swing it economically with jobs with protection a I Can't understand how you find fault with anything this president's doing and all the Democrats seem to be offering or just resist and hate no matter what forget the fact that I'm getting more money in my paycheck forget that my family is going to be safer because he wants to protect our borders\nForget the economic growth is going to really improve my neighborhood march city\nWhat are the Democrats bring houses possibly going to be a blue wave\nI don't think it is a blue wave yeah this is a choice between results on one side and resistance on the other between people are trying to bring order back to America and people that want chaos\nThe American people don't want resistance they don't want chaos\nNow here's the big problem there to problems the first one is a national news media is against him and we can't win that fight that just the way it is they're going to be against us no matter what we do they go find a way to make the other side look good and make us look bad the second problem is if you look at how much money's being spent\nWe've got three hundred million more dollars against our democratic candidates we have against Republican candidates\nThey they've got a a an enormous amount of money over a billion dollars if they're spending to cycle [noise] we're spending seven hundred Maine which sounds like an enormous amount of money to me but it's three hundred million lessen the Democratic that more\nAnd remember it's focus so we're not saying that money in Alabama because we're a red state right so all that money is being focused into these other purple states and so some of my colleagues are being bombed by money but even with that\nOur polls not the stuff you're seeing the national news me that they're pushing their narrative right our polls are holding up now we're in some tough fights I'm not going to make light of it but our guys are fighting ... really strong fights are waging good campaigns and their polling is starting to look up in the last couple of weeks and I think it's the Kavanaugh factor\nFrom your constituents how much do you hear about health care\n[noise] and I hear about health care from people who've I've been hearing from the last five years who are dealing with the incredibly increase costs for their premiums them for their out of pocket costs for deductibles and the like and they want us to fix something\nNow what's happened with the Democrats is is there are ... Democrats even in my district become to come after me and say oh you're trying to get rid of protections for people with preexisting conditions which is not true I mean that's just a ball face law\nSo we've got to make sure that we're putting out their appropriate statement of the facts and here's what they want they want Medicare for all Medicare in its present circumstances is running out of money and you know years so they want to take a program that's running out of money\nThat our seniors are dependent upon and blow it up without any more money or the I guess they've got some planning puts more money but they're going to put an enormous amount of money into it\nIt's not going to war well you know both that ain't nothing free you know if I had heard somebody said hey free lasagna for the next three hours I'm getting in line but that ain't freeze somebody's paying for them you know so yeah I agree that the\nThe plan but it's a socialist in the left part of the Democratic party is offering about free this and free that is a total disaster at the end of that once if in fact they even ... you know him you know get that implemented\nWell what they want to do is to take the tax reform plan we did last year we cut everybody's taxes in reverse that [laughter] and then take that money and put it into a program that still won't have enough money into it to take care like I say our seniors have put their money in this program for years\nWhile Republicans really need to get something going with a plan for health care we couldn't get it done yeah first go round but I think we got to come up with some\nWe got it done in the house yeah it it just got hung up in the Senate and at the late Senator McCain\nAlright well speaking of the Senate you run for senator and I'm thinking about it are you thinking about it we don't have to make any official announcement here not quite yet and I'm not quite right but ... I'll be honest with you I've been traveling around the state I'm In Birmingham today right\nNow talking about these issues and a talking with people about my disappoint a lot of people's disappointment with senator Jones yeah I mean he voted against judge you have an aunt or his ... for Senate was for gun control he voted against the pain capable abortion bill which means he wants a\nPeople to get an abortion and even after twenty weeks I mean he doesn't match up\nWith mainstream Alabama and I don't think we need to give an alternative I Wish you the best if you decided to go that route thank you out of Bradley Byrne in our studio thank you have a good weekend right good to be with you to [noise]\nHave you like what you're hearing be listening on Monday morning when ... ... am on news radio one oh five five W we are sea\nBass he's news radio one oh five five tell you we are seeing Birmingham\nWe are seeing them over and die hard radio station the six o'clock\nHeading back home I'm ... Fox News got 'em all us as a couple of thousand times during the migrants who were part of a larger caravan hoping to eventually get to the U.S to turn around and headed back to Honduras\nLately ah you know individual scandals can change these things as well but the Republicans look like as of this moment there in really good shape to control the Senate and a really bad shape to continue their control of the house [noise]\nKind of mean [noise] I mean look at the ... dream policies that the\nLeft is looking to push in through the Democratic party\nFree health care [noise]\nSingle payer but I'm Sorry single payer health care free health care free college\nI'm a repeal the taxes they are looking for in the even bigger a infrastructure package than what Donald Trump was even a asking for\nAnd you mentioned health care Medicare for all in twenty Thirteen Bernie Sanders proposed this and gotten zero cosponsors zero he was the only one who publicly supported now the you look at the top ten CNN has a list of the top ten or ... democratic candidates which by the way it will not be enough to ... to cover the field there's going to be a lot more than I think\nUh but I mean everybody with the exception\nOf Joe Biden who I Will not be surprised at all if he comes out and does endorse Medicare for all all the big names are forward already there are many of them were cosponsors of the bill\nUh it seems to be this I mean the idea that we in two thousand ten and eleven were being called racist for suggesting what they wanted was single payer and now here they are\n... the entire field is endorsing single payer health care I think credible\nThere we were scare mongers in races for saying it yeah so I I just want to go through there's there's three stores will go through this tomorrow but I just I\nWent to ... um Cortez was out of this weekend we have to eliminate the electoral college [noise]\nYou know that is a fundamental um a a a fundamental aspect\nOf what brought the states together in the first place the state said we don't want the big states telling us what we can do and if the big states can a control everything\nWell then ...\nWhat do we have it can't be that way so we had the electoral college we are one stayed away from losing the electoral college anyway\nYou lose Texas and you have New York California and Texas the rest of the country doesn't matter\nIt will be those three states you lock those three states up and it doesn't matter anymore\nThat pretty frightening pretty frightening so now we're talking about taking apart the electoral college which would make all of the red states really pretty much in consequential [noise]\nYeah I mean it certainly would change the way the founders thought about\nThe idea of people being elected right I'm old enough to do is just just appeal to the big cities and by the way this is a this was an idea that I'm In it's not just democratic support for getting rid of the electoral college I Know Trump sports for example throwing um I I you know I'm not a big fan of the national popular vote or certainly not what our founders had in mind but uh there is a\nThere's some contingency on both sides of the aisle that actually believe this is the right way to go which I mean you can get you just basically a country run by cities that you know it'd be which ... who wants that like as a Republican is certainly don't understand why you'd want it but ... again like it shouldn't be that way\n... says you should run themselves in the cities can run whatever they want and the rural or you can do what they want\nWhy do we all have to live under somebody else's thumb I don't want to live under a farmer's thumb do farmers should make the although I'd feel better with this than the other way around no farmers should be telling what somebody in the city has to do and how to live\nThey don't understand taking any of my farmer friends to Manhattan their heads would explode within twenty five minutes\nThey would not want to live there they wouldn't understand it so why should we have the people in farms and farmland trying to dictate rules that are good for them but I also have to be applied to the city it's ridiculous\nRight and it's why the house and Senate both exist to give balance to that so that ... not one side can tell you hit it right\nYou know no it's actually it's it's it's goes further than this if you would have if you could a race to the mistake of the\nUh of the progressive under Wilson where they changed the meaning of the Senate the way they got elected yeah it it used to be that the house was the place where the people could move and move quickly so things can be passed because there was a disaster and things can be passed quickly\nThen the next the the first check on the balance of power the first check on that power\nWas to go through another body that was a lot slower the Senate people are always like parents too slow it was designed to be that way\nSo you go through another body that was much lower but it wasn't just that it was lower\nIt was also supposed to be men or women that were selected by their state legislature [noise]\nNow what would that do\nThat would make sure that those guys are beholden to their state not to the rest of the country not figures in national politics director and I shouldn't chair or what uh what's his face in New York is says shouldn't care when Hillary Clinton was under a bronco bottle was center I shouldn't care about that\nBecause they would be focused on their state and they would be making sure that the federal government would not be eating into the power\nOf their state then it goes to the president and the president\nIs only supposed to veto thing if he finds it unconstitutional now they'll say I think this is unconstitutional but I'll sign it was\nWay do they see this the opposite way you're supposed to veto it not if you don't like it if you find it unconstitutional it's unconstitutional then it would go to the Supreme Court\nWe've screwed up the balance of power so much and that's why you have this story today the United States Senate is a failed institution\nYou also have this one from Fox the case for abolishing the Supreme\nCourt [noise] and this story the constitution of the United states has failed\nOr you just arguing for king right with these the several stories in a row the mic give you the argument for a king\nRight I mean okay [noise]\nReally they failed or have we not been using them properly [noise]\nKnow it's it's like it's like going out into the woods with a a Swiss army knife and saying I've been trying to I've been trying to cut down trees and slid lumber and this Swiss army knife has failed or no you're not using it\nProperly that's not what it was meant for and I would also argue the failure park right and you're talking about ... what is basically the biggest success story in global history the United states of America the fact that it has its problems is is well documented but the idea that you'd call it a failure is patently insane insane\nAbsolutely insane All right let's go through a couple of other things how about the Portland\nMayor [noise] who the hell is Ted Wheeler and how did he ever become mayor of Portland or Portland but I ... I'm Sorry I'm Sorry\nSo you know the ... the Portland mayor refused to let the tops intervene when ... was just directing traffic\nExcuse me I couldn't anybody just get up and started directing traffic in Portland and they just didn't I just go on the street can you imagine what would have happened\nTo us in New York City if you would have started directing traffic oh my gosh you might be disappeared [noise] I mean\nEspecially it was a union job really they wouldn't be enough you'll be in the bottom of the river [laughter] what what [noise] what\nLaws do you even have in Portland now you can just go direct traffic you can break an old man's window he's driving the\nIt's like no I'm not gonna you're young wherever and they break his window and chase them down [noise]\nPolice nothing nothing [noise]\nNow I don't know if you saw the uh the mob in yes and I did use the N word gosh\nI don't know if you saw the mob in Portland but they had a a a law and order march ... showed up for the law and order march because they of course in Portland now or the law the browns shirt stuff started beating\nKicking [noise]\nBurning flags whatever [noise] that's pretty scary and the mayor ... released a statement at a press conference where he said I was appalled by what I saw in the video but I support the police's decision not to intervene how\nHow how can you how can you support that decision I I don't I mean I guess the\nThe just the idea of look this is wrong but we want to make it any worse he's trying to make it sound\nAs if um the police this is his angle for the mainstream our police can do no right but they act and they're just so they don't act and or do nothing\nThree seven four live that's eight seven seven three seven four Liz franchises are available\nVisiting angels America's Choice in senior home care ...
