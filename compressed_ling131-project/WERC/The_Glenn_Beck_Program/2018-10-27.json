highlighting the supporting the need for the support with these caravans coming in for the\nUh the border patrol there it's the support element that's the big part of this rather than putting them down there for defense needs at some level but listen if he does do this executive order it could lead to that element it could be the beginning part of that element here\nWhen you're taking a look at the same law used in the travel ban to bar foreigners from entering the U.S on national security ground so become the national security ground element of it we're looking at an entirely different levels\nRight in going into the weekend there may be more developments as they are getting closer and closer I switching gears real quick I Know you've got some friends that are being in the media that you are over at NBC was oh so what are you hearing about Megan Kelly is she'd gone or they just you know kind of put her on the bench for a minute or wherever we Adam is\nOkay so here's the the word that I've actually heard this quote in regards to somebody with a direct knowledge of the matter Meghan Kelly is quote never coming back and of course that's that's the word that we're hearing it's not the official word in there in discussions Megan Kelly and NBC and it's got great I remember at one point time she was going to be the future face\nOf NBC News ... on our ...\nYou know trying to get a deal that might give her the sixty nine million dollars that remain\nOn her multi year NBC contract so um they're having those discussions you this over the past few days where Kelly and NBC unsuccessfully trying to contain the damage from statements she made a defending the desire of white people dress up in blackface costume for Halloween which I think kind of taken out of context\nAnd use the social world that we've seen in the past couple of years of the six second clip but that said it caused some of her colleagues to go on NBC and start to condemn her her comment you Lester Holt doing it at our rogue are doing it and\nThat kind of adds to some stories we're hearing behind the scenes of the production on her show where people weren't happy working with her um and and basically what NBC did I thought they brought up a very talented individual at the table here but could never find a place of comfort for her or them in this situation I think we're seeing that play out\nAre a very good Michael by or have a great weekend thank you buddy you like what you're hearing be listening on Monday morning when GT is ... six AM on news radio one oh five five WBRC\nAlabama's morning

News I'm Jay do the weekend here got a couple of movies to take a look at new in theaters joining us now Kevin Flanagan our movie critic Kevin let's start with hunter killer a movie that is based on a book by a guy who wrote it who lives right here Don keys in Birmingham, Alabama so tell me this is a good one would Gerard Butler\nOkay when Jay ... you know I I'd like to tell you because it is it is a local guy but uh I I tell you what it is kinda hunt for Red October\nEvery other Russian uh American or movie you're going to run it so you've gotta you gotta submarine disappears American submarine we've got to go find it we've all forgot to SEAL Team that's going to one of their base\nTo kind of spy on them you got a couple of storylines that run together ultimately what happened is we discovered their defense secretary is going to have a coup\nSo to keep stability in the world we send the field and to get that the president of Russia a lot of twists while it turns\nOut that you know the filming is great you know they had the huge tank in Georgia I Would build in London\nThey filmed the dollar roof all over the place so it is your typical submarine Russian American war movie I like it but other critics or be the daylights out of it so I like your art butler I liked very open so to some great folks any comment is in this world as well\nSo this is good I like it because it's a local law for I guess everybody goes the that's\nGot all the elements I like when a movie it sounds pretty good to raise\nIt uh yeah it's a it's a stretch to God that you've seen\nAll right well I'm going to go see a just because you've got to be curious as to why some critics like in some don't so sorry and another I guess kind of a war movie this one's based on a true story of faith based movie indivisible what's this went all about\nYeah this is a drama it's a war movie as well so you got to get that fresh outta chaplain chaplain school where the army\nAnd he gets shipped off to Iraq with the team gets over there or the war is what the war is in this family is a movie about a guy struggle to keep the family together after living the realities of or he comes home and and\nUsing it they they work things out with his wife and his children and so it's kind of that sort of a jury get permanent war without a doubt but mostly you're going to just see how they can move into a family and restore so difficult that situation so I highly recommend this what this is done really well but\nWar stuff has not cheesy are cheap and the family drama is is real\nWell you know we go to the set your heart we see so many times Kevin people coming back from war scenarios and it's tough kind of coming back into civilian life after you've been through you know sometimes tour after tour of being faced with your life in danger every day you wake up and even in battle situations it's a whole different world\nThan you and I used to you know living here and when you get home\nSometimes that transition is tough so yeah it's\nIt's really tough yeah and it was it was a\nChaplain it's a it brings a whole different out of it\nYou know in in ... and we've seen this before you know with with family members that you may know friends that have lost a child you know or people coming back for more just really tough life changing since incidents where it's hard I Can't imagine making it through without a relationship with God I just don't know how people do it without him\nI don't know how to do anything without the relationship anymore J. T.\nWhere do you write for the movies and other data theater or\nIf you like what you're hearing be listening on Monday morning when ... live at six am on news radio one oh five five W we are see\n[noise]\nYou know aren't you may John's new nine grain wheat some as the perfect amount of grain three yeah it does any lesson to be green lacking anymore to be a noxious ... there's just so confident I mean it says um high quality I'm substantial\nFlavorful but I don't have to prove myself to anyone this nine green lead service practically an inspirational posting I Want to\nPossess the character in depth of this nine green weeds are you guys talking about being that ninth grade we southern again\nTry our new nine green we done do you mean we we get an author and\nFormer chief medical correspondent and salon policies are Dr Bob are not\nThe human body has billions of pain receptors block those were centers with the anesthetics found in salon ... plus and you'll have relief slump ... plus contains two anesthetics including the maximum strength lie to gain available that prescription they\nNumb aggravated nurse for effective lasting relieve parolee try one I use salon ... plus in the silver box with\nBlue way\nHe's he's news radio ... five five tell you we are see Birmingham\nWe are seeing them over and die hard radio station at six o'clock\nHeartbreak in Pittsburgh I'm Joe ... in the morning has begun in Pittsburgh after eleven people lost their lives when a man's feeling anti Semitic comments open fire to synagogue six other people were injured including for police officers the suspect other us\nIs exactly he becomes amazing they have no idea what he did they have no idea who he is but he's the rebellion guy so he becomes a symbol of her by on the left the ... don't Iran are the people on the left or exactly who these people are of course there are but that's often the leadership I'm Talking the average every person who votes they just know\nWhat's happening now isn't working that's why people listen to me when I actually talk I talk about ways of making people better I focused on something which will sound crazy I focus on happiness\nBecause our nation was built on life\nLiberty pursuit of happiness\nAnd no one talks about that I Do all the time everything I'm Talking about is to try to make people more happy or to at least allow them to pursue happiness [noise]\nSorry so tell me about that let's start there sure um we talk I talk about for example there there are many controversies that I talk about uh education\n[noise] I I have a complete revamp the education system and people just want to keep funding the same system I'm making\nHemp and the candidates legal I'd hang of it before I'm sure it started with many Haitian go in the kitchen absolutely\nOn them when talking about getting rid of all standardized testing proud of high school I Know and talking about doing that because they're testing is it unfair way of bringing teachers\nIt's an unfair way of rewarding schools and it makes kids who are ten eleven twelve years old feel stupid because they can't test well and there's no indication of success and what are we finding we're finding literally kids we we have a thirty percent rise in suicide\nHis entire nation to include children one of those reasons as family court how broken that is but another reason is there pressure to take tests and feel stupid and to be some come successful at ten eleven twelve years old\nWhy centralized testing is very good when you're in high school and sharing what you should go where your liberties are not a bad idea but ten years old why it's to keep control of what's happening in the schools I'm not okay with that\nNow you have a bit of gray hair as I Do here that means you are in school prior to Nineteen eighty and he was I\nProudly Nineteen eighty there really was a department of education I mean it existed but it was basically a repository for information about what he was ... really do anything mhm somehow everyone in in in the United states some help on how to read\nWrite survive in the world without it at a department education somehow that work somehow local school district did a good job somehow that worked out of the Internet\nYou add a technology you think the odds are worse let me give you a quick rundown of every single time\nCentralized control has made things better\nFinished [laughter] yeah right so that's not really what I Want I Want to I Want to make sure that we have some low class control and the only guy saying let teachers teach then I don't administrators because here's the problem with getting a new satellites testing you will lose about ... we will lose in New York state we will lose about four billion dollars in federal funding\nIt's a lot of money but isn't that much for us our budget is sixty billion\nSo losing four billion not into the world however we could still fix that here's the issue here\nWhen we lose at four billion we also lose something else we lose all those strings attached that for about ... and there's lots of strings which means administrators go away and then as far as what writing granted but it shows you a check and boxes all those things we have massive teacher burn out in New York state massive why\nRegulations rules checking boxes I'm the only one saying these things because I cross the entire state might say that sixty two counties across the office you to call you the full sharply by the way for you though but I Want teachers actually want to teach we actually have districts that have more minutes raiders than teachers\nThe average teacher and that's a shameful by the way you have a teacher makes about eighty thousand dollars a year in New York state and the average diminishing makes over a hundred and fifty ... ... you dump a couple of minutes raiders you hide my teachers you've given raises you bought computers all these things but I'm Still not done why in the world we have K. through twelve many K through ten\nThe last two years of high school for too many kids is Jim study hall video games and probably smoking weed ... that's all they're doing how do we know this because the first year of college for most kids is thirteenth grade it's removed because not ready for it correct so now it takes at least six years the average kid to graduate college\nWest terrible now got twenty four year old kid who's never had a job and when you say I Wonder why hasn't the work ethic\nWe've never had a job it is he's been he's been he's screwing around for eight years literally now I have people who would tell me literally Larry I Will hire anybody with a work ethic\nAt one uh ... told me said Laurie my interview process is a very simple I tell them to show up at eight o'clock I open the door if they're there they're hired\nAnd that's how bad it is for people show up at the clock in the morning it is so that's so we need to break that system that I Can't change parenting that I Can't do what kind of changes the the environment of course\nAt sixteen now instead kitchen that five choices they they take a test\nThey get high school diploma number one if colleges right for you that's amazing go to college the problem is we've been told ally and ally is\nThe only way to have success in this country is to get a great hospital plumber and then go to a great college and then sit behind a desk in for and the computer all day mhm that's a way to success not even close to the only way to success lots of people are happy doing all types of things and we should embrace that\nSo it's sixteen let's not make some decisions if I think called you write to me I go to a two year prep school to get prep school is that a biology chemistry history whatever break off to college I go to years and I make sure it's working right so that time I get into college and ready I graduate in three or four years and take advantage of internships are incubator is life is good\nI don't like that no worries I'm the super smart kid the kid who you know loves doctor I'm teasing my doctor who fan last\nTime a doctor who have to go to the gates are not sure about the new doctor do you know being a female but that's a different story\nNow okay yeah I'm so that kid who's really smart that could take the SAT right away and goes off and gets to a degree why should they be bored in school and they shouldn't be born school\nNext you don't want any of those things now where he's going to a two year trade school go to trace become a plumber carpenter whatever you want to be about mechanic an H ... guy in New York state particularly we need that desperately the average tradesmen in New York state is over fifty ... that's a problem I let my six year old I'm fifty a ... year old\nMy problem is that they should not be the average they should not be doing all the work they should be trading the youngsters and you can't find enough in the U.S is doing it's a problem so do that we don't like that could get a job\nWhy not go learn a work work ethic now is sixteen I worked at sixteen I Know lots of people imagine if they go work learn what it means to have a boss learned means when your boss says show up at eight that doesn't mean nine thirty that actually mean seven forty five learn that now at sixteen Seventeen Eighteen get some experience\nA lot of these sounds great how do you pay for New York state constitution tells me I have to pay for grades one through twelfth grade I'll pay for the last two years to I still pay for him here so I Do it I'm a marine when I got a Marine Corps I had a GI Bill they gave me X dollars and why years to use the same thing here is six team you got twenty thousand dollars seven years to use good luck\nHis ... his wife prompt she's going to happen\nA bunch of cool prep schools will pop up a bunch of great preschools papa guess how much they'll costs for two years yeah twenty thousand dollars ... well I don't know that pop up because it's guaranteed government money what banks love most\nGuaranteed government money yes they do so they will actually give loans to make this will pop up it'll be amazing\nThat is the best part when these schools pop up now spending ten thousand dollars per kid per year for these last two years the ... state spends twenty two thousand dollars per year per kid so we're saving twelve thousand dollars each twelve thousand times the four hundred thousand eleven twelve feathers is more than four billion dollars\nWe saved all of the federal funds\nWe've removed tons of administrators\nHave given teachers or a ... a better chance to actually teach we've given teachers freedom to do what they feel it's appropriate we've got rid of Common Core a we've made teenagers who are unhappy happier and this goes to the next level which is school safety\nIf you look at all the school shootings we've had while they are murders at at their core that public suicide they're unhappy kids ethnic or the unhappy kids now thinking about this lemon twelfth grade you're an eleventh twelfth grader you're in a class with everyone who wants to be there\nTo build their kid isn't there to build a case in something else the kids a bully because he doesn't want to be there that's why he's a bully but not he go someplace else your teacher lemons fourth grade this one problems almost go away why older kids wants to be there they've taught\nWas killing our children isn't guns was getting our children is lack of community lack of purpose and loneliness that's coming on kids put them in these worlds all that goes away\nI Can't go to my fellow friend the teachers have me you know build a rocket with my class\nI I Can't go she ... the the farm and he's been a fix a tractor I've got things to do I've I've purpose I meaning I don't do things like that anymore\nWe're living in a world of massive change yet massive change and when's the

just run down a couple of things um you are if you were governor of the state of New York you are dealing with the big banks ... uh and the big banks a Cuomo is pushing them around quite a bit\nEspecially when it comes to the second amendment\nA and trying to de platform ah people if you do any business with with gun manufacturers or gun dealers\nMorally on ethical for a governor to impede business period no ifs ands or buts if I don't like in the industry or like something I never said if I Want to our freedom of speech but when it comes to being governor I should have the opposite I should be the facilitator in chief\nI should be the marketer and chief not not his majesty emperor who decides these people are evil because I deem it so that's the wrong answer that's what he's doing three out of it is he's he's\nNot only doing that she's also threatening another group of business people that you'll be in trouble with the state if you do business with these\nYes absolutely and and what winds up happening more than ... more than more than often as normal thing which is the small guy gets hurt here because big business will always find a way around his edicts right they always they find a way around it but how about the guy who say for example just wants insurance forest firearm\nNow we can't get it there's no way that the individuals and there are at least four million I'm gun owners in New York state if not more widely in the insurance now\nWhen when when insurance companies won't do business in New York state anymore for any kind of firearm but that's the plan isn't it that's the problem yes and that's the unethical part that's the issue\nRight and this is you're making New York state residents criminals overnight not just that if it's a gun violation in New York state it's by default a violent felony by the fault no matter what you do\nThat's how it works in New York state you're turning millions of New Yorkers into violent felons overnight\nAnd we wonder why we have a ... if you have a gun if you if you have a firearm that is not safe act compliant say fact was passed and twenty Thirteen and they say fact said that certain aspects of a firearm make it legal or illegal ... literally what he decided\nI think this piece of plastic is evil so this piece of plastic which is now you but which by the way you purchase the day before completely totally above board you are now a violent fell in\nIt was so bad that the cops said wait a minute now we're all violent felons to I'm not joking district story they had an out revamp the law because all the cops were felons overnight yes oh the cops words that have been revamped of all because of that in other words but it now if you're retired cop what you retire when you're a felon again\nVision of them are not gritty cop\nThis and this is where we are in New York state this is horribly bad the the the answer isn't always the same thing it is all about projecting how he is helping the little guy and constantly project I care about the little guy but every single aspect he fails I'm a businessman\nIf I lost a hundred thousand customers every single year for eight years I should be fired ... that's what he's done we've lost over ... million since he descended thrown over a million ... problem leaving leaving New York state over a million over a hundred thousand every year for eight years the total was over a million look they're voting with their feet\nRyan it's yes it's so bad it is so bad that the Rick Scott the governor of Florida was teasing and said thank you Cuomo\nBecause older retirees we have are going to Florida and they are pensions that New York state residents are paying for still and these pensions now aren't being spent in New York state they being spent in Florida we really we literally writing checks to Florida every single month\nHorrible that's how bad it is yes\nSo let's take pensions do true pensions are ... it's a ticking time bomb yes there's no way to pay for it yeah you you're going to break all of the promises jak people who work their whole life and were promised ally yeah what do you do\nYou see it here in Texas with your belief for oh yeah you see it right here in Dallas Dallas you have already already happening all the time you're in New York state we are the most unionized state in the entire nation ... show
