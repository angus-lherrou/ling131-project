five W we are seeing\nThis is Alabama's morning News I'm Jay tune joining us now the talk a little bit more about our technology and all the wonders\nThat exists out there Bridget Kerry from seeing it is here Richard so or some big news with Google and some new gadgets what's happening here\nYeah JT Google just a shut off a bunch of new gadgets the other day uh probably the highlights I Would say are two of them and there are a new pixel phones\nI I don't know if you're an iPhone guy or an Android guy but in the world of Android everyone kind of look to see what Google is dealing with their pick some models I Would say they are standing out this year not because of fancy hardware I mean ah it kind of looks a little average on the outside\nBut what they're focusing on it hey they're not as expensive as the other guys they didn't hit that thousand dollar price tag mark\nAnd be they really focus on software\nUh whereas if you watch an apple event into a lot about like oh look at what the hardware can do and shiny new tool\nAnd Google is more like hey guess what you take photos we have a lot of new software for that oh do you hate getting um annoying robo calls that we have new software for that too and that software is also coming to the older pixel phones\nSo that you know Google tries to make the case of why hey you're already living with Google Apps you already have our photo apps on your phones and your mail and calendar here's how we can make your life\nBetter if you get our phone and you know and so the the screen is interesting though\nSome people are so committed neither iPhone or Google and Android it's tough to get people to ... do you think this new quality of work that they're presenting and the price point will be enough to move people from iPhones over\nI Know people who have done it uh they say it's about a two week awkward moment where you're trying to get used to wear the menus are but ah it can be done I think I mean if I look at my iPhone right now\nAh I'm not using any apple software I'm using Google Maps right I Love Google Photos I mean they they do software in a way that's actually useful so if I was to switch over into the pain point willing you know when the iPhone gets more and more expensive you start to actually question wait\nThe pixels eight hundred dollars why do we need a thousand dollar phone and we we can't wait to kind of test them out because Google took a shot at apple at during the event and said hey you know apple away here special new you know a phone that has to cameras on the back well I can do the same thing which is\nOne camera so I Would really want to take it to the lab and like really see which is a better camera right and ... is it all for\nShow right on apple side that said um the ... feature everyone's buzzing about that this is something where they can detect you're getting a robo cop and it's a problem that's getting worse for everybody a automatically the software says hey we think is robocall this spam would you like arm machine to pick up for human skin it\nWhen it does in real time on the screen you were seen taxed ally in that says that this is Google's answering service we have detected that we don't understand it we don't recognize this number\nKnew these describe while you're calling and then you can see what the person is saying translated to text in real time oh do you know this is you know a new credit card offers hanging up\nI'm of course you'd hate to not recognize a friend's number and like Google scanned them they might get offended still you know it it that this is a solution to problem that we're not seeing any other solutions in presented\nTell me about this new thing they've got to go into Google as well the whole hubbub what's\nOkay

the age of outrage\nOr how to bring our best when the world is at its worst heads that are just wrote that book welcome to the program ed how are you\nThank you thanks for having me and I think we both wrote books that outrage kind of a nice time you could talk about outright\nAnd we did and you have you found the ad that it's not necessarily an understood topic or a popular topic right now to try to diffuse it or explain what it does to us\nYou know it's interesting I see the word used more than I've ever seen before in my lifetime you know rage and outrageous in headlines of articles all the time\nBut it's when you go a little deeper and in your case talking about his relationship to addiction or in my case\nTalking about Christians might engage the age of outrage when I I don't think I think there's a lot of references to it but not a lot of okay what do we do interact I think you know damn from Georgia who who are fascinating fascinating call and\nAs you've got to walk through that with him he's clearly outraged his response would be very different than yours and I appreciate your responded\nA and mine and I think ultimately part of the challenges as Dan's response is I mean they just said I'll just say I'll just say it you know the answer response is the way a lot of people feel right I Know\nThere's a lot of built up outrage that is and it's it's you know you both on the conservative and liberal side\nAnd it's in many ways tearing our country from my concern as a Christian leader you know I'm here at the Billy Graham center\nA well my concern is is as Christians how are we going to engage in a world filled with outrage or and when sometimes where the where the cause of it sometimes where the targets of it it's it's a mix and I love your\nComments about religious liberty to I mean I I'm I'm deeply concerned about religious liberty or around the world like for you bringing that up bring in that case up even today\nBut it but I but again I I the Christians who are outraged about Starbucks cups rather than about persecution around the world and I think so we got our own issues to deal with but also it's the culture of the whole\nSo tell me because [laughter] and I don't know if you heard last hour when I was talking about ...\nAnd that we have this closing window bond Hoffert did not succeed in what he tried to do we'll though he was in the end victorious um but he didn't he didn't change the people because the people had already abandoned their Judeo Christian values they were angry they were outraged and they were they wanted political ...\nYou should not a spiritual solution uh and uh they they just went for it we have this this window on our Judeo Christian culture and our and our underpinnings they're being lost and if we don't get through that window and keep people's hearts open [noise]\nWe're going to go really a rye ...\nAnd I think ultimately this is our moment and you know not everybody we don't get to pick the moment we're born or that we live in two in every generation has face their challenges but this is our moment and it in in the book I sort of go through I have a chart in some stats we observe new statistics in each chapter\nAnd I talk about how in many ways a that Judeo Christian a consensus has been lost and now\nThe views of uh you know Christians different groups maybe a better more on the conservative side are now outside in many ways of the mainstream of society where once they were the mainstream and that's kind of lead to an accelerated\nA outrage cycle it's led to everyone's turning up the volume two eleven and ultimately I don't think that's the path that I appreciate what you said earlier when you're talking to talking to Dan is we've got to um we've got to choose a different way\nNow one of the key things as Christians are consistently choosing a different way\nAnd you know we don't need to be disabled by our cable news network or we don't need to be a shape spiritually by her social media feed I think ultimately we need to be shaped as Christians by who Christ is and Jesus was afraid to stand up I mean he was in the temple and he turned over tables\nBut he also showed this remarkable ability\nThat we can model to to build bridges with people with whom he shouldn't even be around the Samaritan woman at the well and I think ultimately we need a better path that the answer is not to\nGet like the world the answer for Christians in this age of outrage is to really follow the way of Jesus in to the world and I'm not some you know don't stand up for things don't I mean even you said\nYou fight but you fight or a you know for example or you can't war at a people\nAnd reach people at the same time and so it's a question of how you approach that and we're just we're user titled were addicted to outrage right now\nAnd I'm and I'm trying to say there's a better way for Christians to to to to do belt we even when they are the targets of the outrage and certainly but not participate in creating photo and false crises and outrage\nWell here's what's interesting to me and I pointed it out last hour if you talk politically\nWere winning I mean look at the Supreme Court but Brett Kavanaugh I don't know of any president that would have stood up for that look what happened with Israel in many ways\n... you know we're winning it's not they're not forming mobs and going out and and you know are trying to get into people's face and getting them to react or out in anger\nBecause they're winning they're doing that because they're desperate\nWe're actually making progress and somehow or another [noise]\nWe're just being swept up in their drama [noise]\nWell I think people are it it it's kind of weird that appeals to us there's a part of us I think that's why\nA you know we'll find some some some crisis on social media\nThat Christians will be very attractive to and then we find out later that wasn't true and it kind of spread around and and you know and and and I and I think that's part of the concern what is it in the U.S that draws us to outrage rather than to engage and I think there's a\nThere's a difference between the two and you know I'm so for example I'm someone who is deeply pro life you know I spoke at the march for life here in Chicago not that long ago and you know you have the kind of you know the the gold those of us in the march for life speaking up and standing for life and then you had some protest or on the side just telling us terrible people but then you had some\nSome self identified Christians yelling horrible things at them and here's what I don't want to be I Want to be in the group that saying I'm going to stand for life\nNot yelling horrible things at one another and thinking even the counter protesters who were kind of part of the march for life but left and started yelling that's the problem we look too much like them and I don't think that that's our goal if our goal and we talk about this a lot\nAnd Christians in the age of outrageous is to is to hold a biblical worldview but then to engage the world with a win some\nApproach and and and for what it's worth I mean I I've been fascinating to watch you sort of walk through that journey as well and I think it really challenged a lot of people in the way that they would think and so so so kudos to you for even writing on this subject matters\nUm I'd like to talk to you about your solutions so let me take a quick break the name of the book as Christians in the age of outrage I think it is really important\nWe cannot become that which we despise we cannot play the same game first of all just strategically you lose but also we lose who we are when Judeo Christian values are under attack and our art type has always been Moses and Jesus ...\nWe take Jesus Moses out who are we modeling ... who are we modeling who are we striving to be we cannot forget our art type back in just a second [noise]\nClan that\nTake bakers quarterbacks stresses statues much of America is getting outraged for our state\nAnd with all of the nonstop outrage coverage we're actually missing out on the stuff we shouldn't be outraged about
