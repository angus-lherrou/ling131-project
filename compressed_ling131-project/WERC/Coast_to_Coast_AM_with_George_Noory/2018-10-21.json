let's talk about Harry who d'nese um how should we practice I mean he was not just a skeptic of after death communication he was an of vowed to bunker and I don't even think that is saying it strongly enough I mean he there was almost a hatred\nOf for these people that he considered to be frauds where did that he knew why did that happen to come about\nThat that's a very interesting place to start 'em because you're absolutely right I mean he wrote two books as you mentioned and he really um\nHe um [noise] I was not just on the side he his mother died in Nineteen Thirteen and at that point he tried to get in touch with her through some psychic but he could tell they were all faking what they were doing and so um [noise]\nThat kind of got him going and so as an excellent magician he was able to replicate some of the things that these fake mediums would do\nSo he was always looking for that and actually I think this is ultimately will get got him killed because I think that the people these fake psychic\nOr talking amongst themselves and I think they want it to refer them up a little bit I don't think they wanted to kill him but I think they wanted to say back off and we don't get in your way get out of our way and I think they might have been some money to get that uh\nThat young student who had done the boxing team to punch him in the stomach which was a trick he did in public and as you know Richard he\nHe would pick someone out of the crowd pick someone like you or me you know right and he would have them come up to the stage and he would make his muscles ready and he would be ready for that but this time there's\nThis guy came backstage and Harry wasn't expecting it at all and muscles aren't from this guy really late into him and the trauma in his abdomen was so intense that um you know you had those problems and his appendix burst and this is why passed away\nRight and and had he had he gone to the doctor immediately to receive a medical uh help he probably would have lived but always the showman he the show must go on and he went on and he performed or four or five more shows and and then finally collapsed in Detroit\nYes he was doing little tiny handkerchief magic 'cause that was all he had the strength for 'em\nBut one other point I on this subject about these steak medium he would send his assistance out\nAnd they would find people and they would see the show and he would find a point in time where the show could be busted so to speak and he would even get the guy that was in control of light and on the deal and Harry would show up with a photographer from the newspaper Harry would be wearing a disguise the\nMagician would be in the middle of his you know they say on the weather would ever with a hidden string making something like this guy or whatever and the lights would come up a photographer would take a picture and\nAnd uh you know the fake medium would be totally surprised ... where are you in and say I'm Harry Houdini to pull off his mask and so these guys were very upset again\nFascinating I I had not heard the the theory that perhaps some of these a cabal of of disgruntled psychics and mediums had put this young student at McGill University up to the task of of uh\nYeah this writing on beating on Harry right into\nMy that's my own idea I haven't heard it from anyone else it seems to make sense a few phone calls hey you know I mean so I had nothing on Henry you know I mean he didn't have any kind of reason to go there or do anything right right I\n... I just wanted to ask you about briefly about a circus or Arthur Conan Doyle because they were Harry and and he were were good friends and yet\nA Doyle was a prominent spiritually so how did that how did that friendship survive as the fact that Harry was such an avowed to bunker didn't have time for spiritual is and yet he's good friend and his wife were both very much into spiritualism movement\nYes yes the spirit was movement is not exactly a defining in some kind of permanent structure you know you can't say there's a leader but a lot of people did looked at the oil as the leader of the spiritual as a matter of friendship starting in around Nineteen twenty for about two years and\nI think the friendship came about through fan just fan crossing pass and hey how are you and they enjoy the fact that they had a different perspective and they talked about it um but eventually um there was a little bit of a discord between them that got so much that they did break off their friendship\nAfter a couple of years it was the oil's wife who gave a\nGod her attention but what's really interesting is that neither ... nor Arthur Ford pursuit anymore they didn't want to pursue Arthur Ford was well aware of\nHoudini reputation and how strongly he was pushing back against the mediums and he\nDidn't taught us I gotta jump in here forgive me Thomas I got to jump in we've got a break coming up we'll come back and continue to discuss the after death communication experiment with Harry Houdini and best Houdini here's Jean night taking us into the break with do me on coast to coast am [noise]\n\n\nBut uh no\nNo no I didn't\n\nIt was radio nine sixty W we are seeing [noise]\n\n\nIf it\nGets and undergraduate degree completion programs that are entirely online these programs are convenient for working professionals and those serving in the U.S military continuing this sort of those legacy of academic excellence classes are held to the same high standard consistently named the citadel\nStill putting off a building that dream home\nNow is the perfect time to talk with us about a mortgage loan\nMany options to consider will find you the loan them right\nCall today and let's get storey\nNew developments concerning the fallout from the deaths of Washington Post journalist democracy Yogi\nLate Saturday New Zealand joining a growing list of countries condemning the death also sang it won't attend an economic summit nickname Davos of the desert south admitting friday he died during a scuffle inside their consulate in Turkey what to do next seems to be more complicated\nWe need to to con condemn started conduct in the strongest possible terms but if it if we take out so you're right and um our Ron to gain a foothold bigger foothold in liberal on in Syria and Yemen we're going to end up in the\nRepublican Senator John Kennedy President Trump continues to stand by the desert kingdom the Los Angeles Dodgers advance to the world series beating Milwaukee five one game seven they'll meet the Boston Red Sox second straight year for the Dodgers says Fox News [noise]\n[noise] mostly clear skies noticeably cooler conditions as we go through the early morning hours\nBy sunrise you were around forty one degrees Sunday later today with the highest sixty one clear tonight and colder with an overnight low ranging from thirty six to forty in sunshine back in the forecast for tomorrow\nMonday afternoon high sixty cents in in the WBRC ... weather center I'm meteorologist red hunter on your side right now\nIt's fifty three degrees at news radio nine sixty tell you we are seeing\nThe commercial airline industry is booming\nWith this level of demand the industry needs more aircraft technician we are the aviation Institute of maintenance and we trained tomorrow's technician the bureau of Labor Statistics report the average aircraft technician in the DC area makes over sixty six thousand dollars a year\nVisit trade tomorrow dot com or call eight eight eight weeks [noise]\n\n\nThe ones on the\n\nPremier networks presents coast to coast am no here's your guest host Richard ...\nSay hello on Twitter at Richard Sayre and asked why because I Love you R.

coast to coast am dot com website in Thomas's website as well infinitely mystical\nDot com or Thomas tight Thomas so let's get to the other say on a at a best his house in January of Nineteen twenty nine and a Arthur Ford is there this is the the medium would reached out to her or so so what happens [noise]\nHe was in a really bad car accident he was with his ... eyes car accident and his healing processes hated by pain killers and some of this is um morphine and he becomes addicted to more than a need for the rest of his life has morphine and alcohol problems\nAnd I think this might have affected his ability to function as a psychic and much later near the end of his life and I'm Sorry I don't have the dates on this he was involved in a very high profile said\nOn 'em with pike that's the name that comes\nTo my old James hike up yes he was up here on on I'm In Canada upon are now a Canadian and so there's another Canadian connection yeah\nYeah yeah and I think it's an I'm looking at it now Nineteen sixty seven for how a say on for pike now pike son had tragically committed suicide the year before\nNow would Ford did for this high profile say on with the did with all the secret do their own that\nYou're kind of breaking up on his Thomas ah I'm not sure if it's a cordless phone or a cell phone but maybe if you keep very still speak\nMaybe OK I'm area it's actually a voiceover IT line and sometimes it does break up is that a little better\nIt is okay\nI'm James Pike this is the ... an Episcopal bishop his son had committed suicide a\nYear earlier and now Ford is doing a say on on Canadian TV\nYes and and he does a little upfront research\nBrings it into the ... as if he's getting it in a psychic way whereas in fact he got it from the conventional way this was discovered after four died and people went through his papers and found his research preparing for the ... and that's why people say this\nSo this is another black mark against or if they're bored and it's again muddy the water so this case the Houdini case\nAs fun as it is in his exciting it is it it's not going to be the first to break through convince all the hard nose skeptics who just isn't\nRight but but okay so Ford is discredited because of the sense in Canada in Nineteen sixty seven but as you point out he had been taking morphine he had been drinking or perhaps that had damaged his a medium ... abilities does that necessarily discredited the work that he did on on the Houdini case\nYes yes that's the way I see it and it does or doesn't I I just it it's it puts a cloud over it but it doesn't necessarily directly bear on it [noise]\nNow despite best is\nRe catching and you know saying no I I don't believe that Harry communicated with me nor could he then why did she continue to do these ... high profile public ... on the anniversary of Harry's death for the next ten years\n[noise] um she did it for ten years after his death but she didn't start them until a couple of years into that so she did about seven of them as my count but the point is still well taken and here's the way I look at it when she was with Harry\nUm [noise] she would be on stage at times and Harry was the one in the spotlight but when Harry dies she's in the spotlight but she doesn't have anything to do [noise]\nYou know and so all of a sudden she's in an unusual place and so by stepping into the spotlight only once a year for one night to do the ... and I think the last one was in LA\nI'm On the top of a building you know the first they were going to do it down into building but then they said let's do that on the Doppler will be higher closer to God and the spirits\nAnyway I think she knew these were going to be a failure because she was the one that was acting as the medium and she's not a medium so he's pretty much guaranteed they're going to fail so she can say that statement at the end you know ten years is long enough to wait for any man and\nAnd that kind of thing and it kinda makes it safe for her to say well I tried I open minded I tried but it didn't work and so I'm going to go\nBack with my friends and embrace the standard mainstream believe\nBut you're inclined to believe that the original statement released in the New York times in Nineteen twenty nine affirming that she had been contacted through a Arthur Ford has been contacted by her beloved Harry that that that quite possibly happened\nYes yes I Do in the other letter that she wrote to wind chill is also it has a fair amount of passion to it she's very strong you know and so I'm now someone would say well if she was tricked and didn't know she was tricked she would still feel very strongly so I'm I'm open minded to that comment to [noise]\nYou you finish the essay with a I don't know if you have in front of you and if you could share with is the final words of Harry Houdini as brought forth by Fletcher and Ford Flex your being the spirit guide and for it at the end of that successful

to go and spend it all a what\nA beautiful place in the Roosevelt national around over overhead is the national archives show I just want a tremendous amount of time the Marshall archives of what's going on as it was top secret previously\nAnd they're huge files there on the hour and a his wife Eleanor communism there's that's right or filing cabinet right in the middle or the animals fell over actually\nThat as as I Want to Roosevelt\nAnd actually the communism she was being invested their investigator for being a comment so you know who you will never had that information years ago you

it's like a scorpion sometimes things [noise] um but you it needs\nTo say you don't paint a flattering picture of of FDR you mentioned a communism although you know let's be honest communism was was kind of the fat back then before people knew I guess the real truth about what was happening in Stalin's Russia and the er the programs in the ... the the forced\nA started nations in the Ukraine and so forth um but um let's let's talk about young FDR talk about someone born with a silver spoon in his mouth\nOr pay me a a portrait of I'm a young FDR\nKnow FBI lose a I always say use beneficiary of

his political where it started out in the Los about men and stuff and help them ... and they blossom them being the owner of a new or by the people don't know what I was governor of New York that are they forgot or they're just not talking about it any more\nOr less you know he he was ... I mean maybe just cause I Know [laughter] all the Roosevelt was born a Roosevelt maybe Roosevelt biter Roosevelt which was a little odd or the woman that he could change the monitor grammar and part of life actually [laughter] no um\nNo I mean this is the evolution of the good person\nEllie his cousin teddy was his was a distant cousin was the second or third cousin I think it was the second week of right and and he was he was a Republican how did he was a Republican how did he received his younger cousin and the Democrats\nWell they got along really well\nI'm actually our father wasn't too thrilled about what because that was just not the way that he was raised with a that Roosevelt was done anything differently if he was um ordinarily a bull all you have this special night comes out\nSo he did a lot of things are well unsavory slip and sort of self marrying his cousins on funding a number Teddy Roosevelt you know that name though it was awful lot of ways so you know he was a ... benefitted from the laws will name as well so\nRight and he was also governor of New York lots of you know he was you know he was also governor of New York which is was has always been sort of a stepping stone to the White House\nAnd it has happened that way through history absolutely there's no doubt about that\nAnd the young FDR didn't exactly have the common touch daddy I mean he didn't have um ... I I think of George Bush senior trying to buy stocks in Kmart back in the er the remember that back in Nineteen eighty eighty tried to show people he he was the common man and there was a famous\nTV reporter he's trying to buy a pair of socks at Kmart to show you know well he's just one of us and he had no idea what to do when he got up to the cash register [laughter] it's funny how that\nMaybe it was smaller and easier to control we didn't have other things so on and on the phone and why they're at work\nWhen he won the the the first election or you know they'll get the whole idea of the one hundred days those first one hundred days which you're seen as being so important today in the media what does the president accomplish in his first hundred days that really started with FDR didn't it but the kind of cheated that a little bit\n\nYeah absolutely the um\n[noise] ... like this was ...

Mussolini at first he was in awe of Mussolini so Mussolini actually started the whole thing but you know again I'm history books being what they are that tendency to get a little lost\nUm [noise] so America gets into the war and Britain is getting polarized ah being bombed and night for more than a month every night\nUm people are taking shelter in the tubes in the book I have a first hand account of that I actually my great aunt is still alive she lived through it through the ... bombings in Burma and she watched the city's burn\n'em coverage of entry and in Birmingham I'm very interesting stuff so um that was really neat that I have that personal contact with with her and she's still alive and doing well by the way\nUm anyway uh we get into the war and we're we don't have anything to do was down at the moment we're just trying to help Churchill and because they were really they have no people have no idea according to my end it was there\nHow close\nEngland came to losing your island\nThey were lined up on the other side of the day being the Germans were lined up on the other side of the English Channel\nAnd this was what their MO was they used to go and lay down air strikes bomb them into oblivion and then just tape around your ground troops over and it worked exceedingly well especially with France\nAnd they thought the same thing was going to work in a in in Britain that of course it didn't because of you know church does resolve a and you know of course so we're going to the war\nAnd now we're there to help out Churchill so we're talking amongst ourselves now working hand in glove with a with the Brits\nNow all of a sudden we get the rainy idea to bring styling into the war and Churchill loses his mind he hates style and doesn't want anything to do with them never trust them\nI'm of course the two at my previously and I'm Churchill really masterminded the whole thing to be honest with you jerk shows the one who\nGather together but he he just hated the fact that the Americans because they were so similar to the time that style and in America and the the American president FDR\nWere working in unison on this it was great for the war it was bad for the world\nBecause Stalin was a temporary ally he had his eye completely on the post war world he knew that after the war we weren't going to be from\nSo to answer your question around about fashion um Churchill like it for the war hated it for the world and I don't know if he completely trusted that FDR wasn't going to become a small one only a less aggressive one\nWell at this point was FDR still a a huge fan of style needs to say that they called them uncle Joe\nOh yeah absolutely absolutely it was a there was of course you have to understand\nWe weren't getting things from Russia we didn't know much about the great for I think of FDR had known about the butchery and everything going on and he wouldn't have been his fan but of course we weren't getting that until decades and decades later\nRight here in New York Times wherever they were writing glowing a pieces about uncle Joe and how wonderful sure communism and listeners\nThere's still a communist newspaper as far as I'm concerned and [laughter] you know um they're right down the street from the the Communist Party of the United states of America so you know I mean they're still carrying their pieces are ... million\nFDR it seemed a bit from reading your book that FDR was very anxious to get a face to face was down and I don't know if this was because he admired him or like that he was burns and Stalin was playing a little hard to get\nStoned in need us we needed style and style and and the U.S he was already\nYou know when when the Nazis started to hit a pact with style and of course we know as Hitler and it's and spelling hit a pack well Hillary violated the pack and I went after style in which completely blue silence mind and they were on the march to Moscow and they were doing good doing well with this march\nAnd then you know Hitler's ego took over and he\nDecided he was going to go to ... because it held his namesake so now it was leading under the delusion right now that he's unstoppable is completely unstoppable so of course we know anything about Hillary's drug habit at the time he was on like\nThirty some odd different drugs so he was such a delusional Vic theatre if at this time he thinks he's completely unstoppable so he decides to switch course midstream and go toward styling read\nUm meanwhile the weather is changing a winter is following the Germans are ill equipped and he'll close to do this it doesn't matter you know his generals are coming back saying it's a suicide mission and they were just says well I don't care I Want it will do it so\nStalin is already beating him or he doesn't need us so Hitler has he has the other hand here he has the opportunity to play a little a little hard to get in he certainly was so when we really had to go begging it is it's dollars table in which they get this done\nRight so there was a the conference in Casablanca and and then later Iran I think in a was terrain in Nineteen forty three and a gang member forty three correct\nThey have at even at this point they have their eye it sort of carving up the post war world a instill at this point you know I I see pictures Roosevelt still looks pretty robust\nOr you know he you know by by the standards the Nineteen forties he was an older guy but by today's standards he was only like sixty years old we tend to think of him and you know in our mind that he was like eighty but he was he was a relatively young guy\nUm but he looked pretty healthy even in in Nineteen forty three\nUm but I wanted to back up all the minute and talk about the assassination squads that Hitler was sending over the United states because I didn't know about this until I read your book\nWhich might well maybe this guy was standing stop I'm Sorry I'm Lenin wrote the quote from one of his will I'm rich donors to root too dangerous removed\nAnd after stoned to death they they called him a pusher and all kinds of stupid things\nMurder have I got a ...

I I Can't buy the fact that uh that's all I Want her to death I I think he did not want him to want to deliver the pop like that's just my my take on it\n[laughter] now as for FDR or he was sixty three and I mentioned you know that was pretty good age for Nineteen forty five today that's fairly young\nUh but just because he he surpassed the average lifespan I don't think it was as low as forty nine back then but I mean George Washington ... ... you know lived to be in ... I Believe in his seventies or Thomas Jefferson and so forth that that that doesn't disprove that he made the point and obviously\nYeah I Would say read the book check it out give it a shot I think it's better than you might think it would be um the Elvis spoke to some people they deal with different different parts in time and um you know I spent ten years researching all this stuff\nAnd you know FDR not quite that much for sure but um there's this information in the book is is pretty compelling I Will check it out\n[noise] uh Easter the Rockies Martha easy in Gulfport, Mississippi Maher said good morning welcome to coast\nHanky rancher thank you for taking my call my play the idea that had been pont originally made their money to pay this fine trade them for a guy a wet I'm more a humane way to make money and the Rockefeller ah\nStarted out our lighting houses with kerosene that find that combat stumble engine that guy's a ... like a byproduct then that can End Days ran they got down nice guy that I never have no idea how the relatives out well and you can be\nYou have a clue as to how they made their money originally\nWell I Know that I I yeah I Do\nActually and the tour guide at the Roosevelt mansion mentioned this they were actually in the timber business so I was told\n'em and they were dealing with timber in a in the United states and they also we're dealing with timber and South America so that's where allegedly there and when he came from and if I'm proven wrong then so be it that's what I was told uh at the Roosevelt mansion\nAnd they were very good at manipulating the stock market just like the Kennedys were\nSo I mean you're dealing with the\nStock market was not as big as it is today and there were only a handful of major players back then you know in today you know the world is on our stock market other countries are in the New York stock exchange back then it really wasn't that way so a handful of players could really influenced things they can create the peaks and valleys in the market\nSo when you have the money to start with and you can you you can influence where the bottom is and you know what the topic is you can make a fortune pretty quickly and Joe Kennedy did the same thing this is why\nWhen a after they made their money they shut the door so no one else could do that and they started the FCC the security Exchange Commission and FDR actually put Joe Kennedy in charge of it because according to FDR quote unquote it takes a crook stretch across\n[laughter] really interesting stuff so that's what I Know about that I mean if there's more information out there I'd love to hear it but their their their money came from timber\nA and also I Would I Would imagine I'm you know it's an old it's an old east coast family are probably it's money so you know just kind of a ... to me elation of wealth over generations compound interest\nUm that sort of thing when you have all money I'd also hurt and I don't know if this is true but the the um that's FDR's mother the Delano side of the family\nHad made their money during the opium wars as well so I'm sure there was a lot of a lot of those nice to call them the Boston brain than those very wealthy east coast families\nAnd I think a lot of them were involved in the east India company a and a lot of that was the opium trade so there may be that as well\nYeah I had heard that about the Delano family as well there is so much information out there I mean I spent so much time digging and digging these guys are never written a book on let me tell you what if I was paid a penny an hour\nI'd be lucky [laughter] by the time you research and dig and dig and dig because if you attach names who wants to be as best they can you know for them\nAs far as I did I I still

paradox of enlightenment and his article Houdini afterlife experiment did it work Thomas resentful welcome to the coast to coast am how are you\nI'm way Richard thanks for having me on\nMy pleasure let's talk about Harry Houdini ease um how should we described his I mean he was not just a skeptic of after death communication he was an of vowed to bunker and I don't even think that is saying it strongly enough I mean he there was almost a hatred for\nThese people that he considered to be frauds where did that he knew why did that happen to come about\nThat that's a very interesting place to start 'em because you're absolutely right I mean he wrote two books as you mentioned and he really um\nHe um [noise] I was not just on the side he his mother died in Nineteen Thirteen and at that point he tried to get in touch with her through some psychic but he could tell they were all faking what they were doing and so um [noise]\nThat kind of got him going and so we as an excellent magician he was able to replicate some of the things that these fake mediums would do so he was always looking for that and actually I think this is ultimately got him killed because I think that the people these fake\nPsychics we're talking amongst themselves and I think they want it to refer them up a little bit I don't think they wanted to kill him but I think they wanted to say back off and we don't get in your way get out of our way and I think they might have spent some money to get that um\nThat young student who had done the boxing team to punch him in the stomach which was a trick he did in public and as you know Richard he\nHe would pick someone out of the crowd pick someone like you or me you know right I mean I'd have them come up to the stage and he would make his muscles ready and he would be ready for that but this time there's\nThis guy came backstage and Harry wasn't expecting it at all his muscles aren't from this guy really late into him and the trauma in his abdomen was so intense that um you know you had those problems and his appendix burst and this is why passed away\nRight and and had he had he gone to the doctor immediately to receive a medical uh help he probably would've lived but always the showman he the show must go on and he went on and he performed or four or five more shows and and then finally collapsed in Detroit\nYes he was doing little tiny handkerchief magic 'cause that was all he had the strength for 'em\nBut one other point I on this subject about these fake medium he would send his assistance out\nAnd they would find people and they would see the show and he would find a point in time where the show could be busted so to speak and he wouldn't even get the guy that was in control of the lights and on the deal and Harry would show up with a photographer from the newspaper Harry would be wearing a disguise\nThe magician would be in the middle of his you know they say on the weather would ever where the hidden string making something fly to this guy or whatever and the lights would come up and the photographer we take a picture and\nAnd ah you know the fake media would be totally surprising where are you and he'd say I'm Harry Houdini him to pull off his mask and so these guys were very upset again\nFascinating I I had not heard the the theory that perhaps some of these a cabal of of disgruntled psychics mediums and put this young student at McGill University up to the task\nOf of uh yeah this\nRumbling on beating on Harry right into\nMy that's my own idea I haven't heard it from anyone else it seems to make sense a few phone calls hey you know I mean that guy had nothing on Henry you know I mean he didn't have any kind of reason to go there or do anything right right\nI thought it would just I just wanted to ask you about briefly about a ... sir Arthur Conan Doyle because they were Harry and and he were were good friends and yet a ... was a prominent spiritual so how did that how did that friendship survive\nAs the fact that Harry was such an a vow to bunker didn't have time for spiritual and yet he's good friend and his wife ah we're both very much into spiritualism movement\nYes yes the spirit was movement is not exactly out in the fine in some kind of permanent structure you know you can't say there is a leader but a lot of people did look to the oil as the leader of the spiritual as a matter of friendship starting in around Nineteen twenty for about two years\nAnd I think the friendship came about through fame just fan crossing pass and hey how are you and they enjoy the fact that they had a different perspective and they talked about it\nUm but eventually um there was a little bit of\nA discord between them that got so much that\nThey did break off their friendship after a couple of years it was the oil's wife who gave a I think it was a [noise] what do you call it a automatic writing kind of reading for Harry where she claims that he brought she
