I I think what was ... I I mean I I it's it's it's just it's still very solemn to me that you know the innocent people were hanged who were protesting their innocence and that the real the people who had confessed to being which ones\nWere originally let out of jail and then it's kind of you if you can test and said yeah I was really sorry about that then you know what are some of the people said no I'm not going to get this and then I've never been a which those are the people who ended up\nDying for the most part I mean there's a large percentage of them in any\nIs that right ... ... avenue wants the tragedy of these people who did the right thing you know stuck out for their beliefs only things are told to do in your life and it ended badly for them um which is why you know Arthur Miller's crucible of such a great work of a literature\nWhat is it because he tapped right into that kind of idea that these guys did the right thing and by doing the right thing they ended up at the end of the rope on a hill you know Neal America\nWhich the or in the population you said under about fifty thousand but of balloons up to two hundred and fifty during the\nThe Halloween um festivity the month long festivity of Halloween\nIs is there in Salem is there any other time of year where they are they see the kind of bumps like that or is it just is like a ... I mean I realize that they always kind of get a steady stream of tourists but it's this they're big season this this this October you know these thirty one days October\nOh mathematically I mean some some only open in October and can make their whole year in October\nShot up really\nThey've been getting\nAnd more a year round kind of tourist and not just for the which stuff but for the maritime stuff they've amazing restaurants than they have the ninth largest art museum by area in the country so they have like a lot of like kind of\nYou know arrows and their host or too cold tourist and still happens the biggest one is October which will never go\nWell I Would really I mean that's like a ... there are state fairs that have that right where people open up a booth at a state there they can make their entire year in the weeks that the teacher is open and I I Would never get their shops that are just open for one month in in ...\nYeah but it but other than realizing there's so many tourists coming to say on the court for a year\nBut now it certainly open longer if you go in the summertime you'll still see the shops are still open you might even feel haunted house open to the monster museums so they're starting to realize that they can do this year round at film grows and becomes more even bigger in popular culture than it is now\nWhat's not cool in Salem what ... what are the rules a lake or curbs that they that are either written or unwritten about how people are just you know ... or to or how they want\n... just to be in in Salem\nYeah they're they're getting better and better at that is figuring that it's actually a ... year round you any other time of year there's not that many curbs but in October for instance the er the burial ground which is the old seventeenth century um grave you're right in the middle of town then Salem and this year they had to put a cap on how many people could be in the grave at a time\nBecause it was just getting overrun and people were like using the grave as you know picnic table and climbing on them and doing all kinds of bad stuff to an actual historical artifacts\nThat there is on Halloween Night they have a curfew I think it's around ten pm that if you're not inside of a bar in federal party you couldn't be on the streets so they'll shoot fireworks in the air to kind of tell people hey the nights over start start heading to train it started I think their cars so that's\nReally good at ten pm [noise]\nYeah I Believe it the ten pm yeah it it might be a little later maybe eleven but yet they're trying to get for pushing the hundred thousand people to the train and he takes some time so by midnight nobody around an aloe in\nIronically did they make everybody get off the streets of Salem before the

plea GW locker or and or Edgar Award winning author thank you so much a season with the which the magic and mayhem of Halloween and Salem, Massachusetts it is now on my bucket list thinks do you like I didn't have enough of my bucket list [laughter]\nAnd one of the things I learned that sets true crime apart from great reporting is advocacy and proper journalism must stay focused on the facts of a murder and the prosecution of potential murderers so the result\nIs a resistance to the expression of sentiment you know the the or sensationalism\nEmotional manipulation of the accused because that could result in somebody not getting a fair trial [noise] this is why this is why journalism stresses terms like alleged and allegedly and how it is choose mainstream\nYou know notions of what sensationalism means stories that inflamed the census right that sensational journalism the kind of news writing that stresses emotions over information risks riling the public up unnecessarily and at one point by the way\nThis is a very real day to day concern regarding regarding the power of the press\nOr there was a time in us history not even a hundred years ago when angry mobs would storm a jail and Lynch somebody before a trial ... just like you know the showdown in to kill a mocking bird or white or black Lynch mob justice is the opposite of the rule of law\nAnd journalism understood its place in keeping the public informed but at the same time call\nAnd letting the courts do their work in educating some kind of justice our guest this hour by the way will attest to this because mob rule in lynchings played a key part in the injustices regarding the story of the men from the tree\nUp but this is the same reason that love true crime and bear with me another minute or two where true crime reporting can go where true crime story can tell something [noise]\nCrime reporting must not go right true crime is allows for advocacy for justice giving victims of voice it's a central tenet to to crime\nBefore her death I interviewed I'm\nA true crime legend and rule about the conventions of great true crime writing an ad rules number one rule was that any true crime story you tell must be victims centric\nThe focus on the acts of the killer or a fetish size the details of somebody's death like a lot of these true crime shows do on TV where it's almost like crime porn\nRight they're really into all of the blood and the wounds to a point where it starts to dehumanize the victim I think so I think true crime must always be about justice and on a day when eleven people are dead\nIn a synagogue where they should have been saying\nBruce ...\nThat not run for your life [noise] [noise] ah all because of a story seemingly that had been told about a Jewish philanthropist George Soros we need to be mindful about this connection between the stories we tell and the unintended consequences that can happen [noise]\nAh these victims should burden our national heart for years they will mine\nWhen we tell the story of the shooting in Pittsburgh today we must remain victims centric\nJournalists need to be responsible in order to avoid whipping up torch bearing mobs right intent on lynching people accused of crimes but everybody in the media or anybody who uses social media needs to share that same sense of responsibility when it comes to conspiracy theories as well [noise]\nI'm not waiting and do a debate but who is responsible\nToday's mass shooting clearly the majority of the blame rest some the trigger finger of today's shooter\nBut take it from me and my experience is on the radio it's important to be mindful about every thought seed you send out into the world that bears your name because once it hits the wind you'll never know where those thoughts seeds will take root that's what we know to be true [noise]\nThere's many other stories in the news this week that the test it up so not everything is a false flag up only a small percentage of such things\nI've ever happen not everything is die hard to not everything is a conspiracy if everything were conspiracy than we wouldn't have any media about it in fact the media would be focused on what isn't just conspiracy right if everything was a conspiracy devil radio shows built around we don't have a conspiracy around this today\nSo I ask you whenever you talk about murder whenever you talk about\nPeople who you believed to be guilty\nOf some thing [noise] stay victims centric in the stories that you tell and not just about the victims of crimes that have already happened in the case of true crime but stay victims centric about telling stories that could result in the victimization of somebody yet to come\nI ask you that [noise] in the name of all those people who died today\nSay a prayer for them if you will and and keep that in mind when we talk about the men from the train discovering America's most elusive serial killer\nThat even though the story is over a

the devil not for\nThis killer or the one from this morning but just because there's a lot of doubles and running around these days including son devils getting big wins it takes the fun of show the we were just a hated the interrupt you because you were doing such a great job with the\nExplanation about the the similarities between the cases and I I think you were coming up to the end but I I had to cut you off because we had the heartbreaking but I'm In the\nGraduate or after that because I was going to run out of the things to say but I was able to find\nEvery little bit more of the murder what's that like thirty four of them aren't there or something\nLike that they um they uh the crime you normally occurred on Sunday night so you're the hurt on the weekends\nUp until my team pan the crimes almost all occurred in areas in which the primary industry was barking or one of the primary understood was logging [noise] the or\nFingerprints and blood and and that nothing to them a mutt typing was unknown and Eighteen Ninety eight\nBy Nineteen ten by Nineteen twelve but the night and Eighteen Ninety eight no one knew that there were these for blood group say a B o and whatever it is the um uh [noise]\nThe ah by Nineteen twelve people didn't know that uh and and breakthroughs hadn't had had [noise]\nVent achieve that had been done to make their way into courtrooms bought a it was it was a very slow process and it has a very infant pile stage\nI mentioned the train discovering America's most elusive serial killer\nTracking this story then required you to go through a lot of newspaper are ... and other things to try to find\nA lot of these stories which as you point out had been a they had the dots and human conduct connected then so you you may have been the very first person that ever started putting this this case together in this way\nWell yes we were ... except for the end of the the\nThe the last year the last few crimes were connected at the time the public was aware that that what we would now call a serial murder was on the loose from in Nineteen eleven Nineteen twelve which will runner and he was killing a lot of people but the earlier crimes we what we did was say\nLook this this this murderer is way too experienced to have started this and Nineteen eleven there has to be earlier crime so let's try to find them now getting started walking back toward the first crime\nAnd that's when I got into that nobody had walked it back before you were the first person to go back to the very end and how is it that you are able to determine that first year or so successfully\nDumb luck and it is not all of them are empty I had told my daughter ... if\nYou walk the crimes back\nWhen you when you commit to first crime he will make mistakes that will give away who he is\nAnd I told her that because I Know from reading crime books and reading hundreds of crime books for very off of a serial murder when he convinced his first crime reveals who he is but then all of the times he will be ... and seventies he'd be sent to jail for five years honeybee out and start a series of crimes\nHe would coverage track so I I guess that that was what was going to happen in this case\n... we would just fantastically lucky and it is fresh crime happened to occur the the two biggest newspaper towns in the country where New York and Boston is first crime occurred straight west of Boston straight north of New York\nAnd because of that both of New York and Boston papers covered in death and because of that there's lots and lots of information available about it and it's uncanny it's unbelievable how many points\nThat first murder matches up with ... against the uh with uh with with the last last murders and the series\nSo are we\nJust luck I mean we never in a million years expected to be able to find convincingly who was actually doing this but we found a evidence about this man and argued that this is Pam and almost nobody doesn't believe it because it's just there's lots of evidence\nAnd you say you sound the arc type crimes for the prototype crushed right he and he modeled he he he perfected that crime then successfully after that it\nIs is the years went forward and yet ... there was kind of a mixed media rent I mean there's sometimes there were sometimes over guns involved in\nAll likelihood was carrying a gun all the time after about Nineteen oh five\nThe uh I think that he while he used an axe to commit the murders there are I think three crimes in which the man of the house was shot before he was hit in the head with an axe my belief is that he had a pistol stuck in his pocket or in his\nBelt or something that he would use if somebody was awake and confronted him but um [noise] and that was not what he was trying to do but it's why he would do if you had to do [noise]\n[noise] a lot to get back to some of the aspects of these crimes coming up next our but before I Do ... ... ... what did you hope to learn about\nThe human condition about people about crime what was that you thought you were going to learn when you went into researching and and being the first one to ... all these crimes together to determine you've you've found demand from the train\nThey ... the general answer the question is a crime stories are fascinating to us because they they come from the parts of our of ourselves that we don't like to talk about a all crime stories are about lost\nAnd greed and anger and hatred and all the things that are a part of you and me\nI don't know you but they they are part of everybody that I've had the pleasure of knowing and and yet we we don't like to talk about them so\nWe cover them up crime stories expose those parts of ourselves that we are ashamed of\nThe uh uh that's that's the general answer to why I'm obsessive reader crime but by the way at the last book I read was the real crime but it was the real Lolita a it's a book by a bathroom ... uh I Believe with Weinstein I could have a last name or\nUh the uh [noise] I think I just screwed up her name I'm Sorry you\nKnow there surely a his\nAnd and one of the things I learned from reading that is the ... who was a an avid reader of crime stories uh Charles Dickens was going to have them\nAt an avid reader of crime stories or a Henry Fielding well it's it's very common among writers to be avid readers Tolstoy was avid readers of crime stories because the ... what I just\nTalked about that that they they tell us something about\nYou do get from a church somewhat but the ... you don't get from sports to me as I live in the sports world for the most part and the sports world is\nIs about positive people trying to do positive things in general I mean we take a lot of abuse from people who don't understand it but but that is what who we are and what we're trying to do with positive people trying to do positive things\nHang on hang on to that thought on crime stories as this world picking up the men from the train discovering most Americans most elusive serial killer and there's one story or two here you need to know about before you go to bed and coast to coast am\nDifferent ages in white adolescence maybe in especially vulnerable period and emotional development here's what the teams on a new study of one hundred forty three people ages five to twenty five young children can differentiate and

die\nAround people involved doing positive community things and writing demands from the train because he likes to write about crime so do you want to finish that\nThought you're fading out here and I was not able to hear a lot of them\nI'm fading out no can have that um I was just saying that you are presenting it as sort of a dichotomy of I'm working in the sports world is by day in writing crime that night\nThey are a that was saying that crime stories are last name to it because they they uh come from the parts of ourselves that we don't like to talk about we don't normally talk about in the case of the man the train I didn't make a deliberate and thoughtful entry into the subject\nI just got hooked like a fish\nUh I was I was I saw a documentary about the murders and all those car Iowa called fuller co living with a mystery it's an extremely well done a documentary and far above them mama levels of crime documentary\nI was interested in it and it was clear that there was a part of the story that was messing\nWhich is that it's relatively obvious\n... murders are a part of a serious so I started I was just going to put an hour and to and to trying to learn more about the series but the the our became a week the week eventually became five or six years\nOr so but I didn't I didn't decide to get into it I just wandered into it\nYou know it shows you a ... you can do you consider this a a true crime book pure yes it is yeah you know and that's the interesting piece too is that true crime\nYou know the tradition for true crime is I discovered in in my research goes all the way back to execution sermons right sort of shares a similar DNA with American journalism\nUm except that in the case of true crime you know it was the it was the preachers it was the ... circuit riding preachers diminished or is that would come to these towns in on the day of somebody's execution\nAnd they would do a sermon just before the execution that we tried to provide the context for why this person was being executed in wide the community overall would benefit from his or her desk\nAnd became became an important part of trying to understand executions in America and and this is where when the teachers decided there they used to just print up their sermons and people would snap them up and then you know what this will just sell it for a nickel\nAnd so they started to sell their execution sermons and then they would get passed around in these became some of the early best selling\nTrue crime near and is it it it just feels the same function is what you're doing in in demand from the tree and you're trying to bring in it even though it's a hundred plus years later\nIn some cases you're trying to bring a kind of um a a a kind of healing anyway I'm not that anybody is still alive that was directly involved\nBut for these communities maybe this this lingering sense of some tragedy that it happened maybe some closure\nI'm On my own exactly what happened to their town and how the town was involved are not involved in in the the deaths of somebody that at one point were popular members of the community\nThere are ... there were just the favorite happened just a few weeks ago I actually got a letter from a man in London england who ah\nWas a a a ... his great great [noise] and had been was one of the victims of the crime\nThat he had always believed that uh uh the man who was accused of her murder and was\nLocked up without any evidence for two years before he was released always believe that he had gotten away with it and he said that reading it in my book back in our book that uh um it wasn't that was not actually what had happened was just a tremendous relief correct yeah it was that was a shock to me I\nHadn't thought about that but it was it was a he said he was tremendously relieved to realize that it was just a\nA random crime and that this Manhattan actually that that Manhattan actually gotten away with it was the other fellow at I don't know why it was important to him too well I understand the understanding that sense it was important to have to know what had happened\nBut you know one guy getting away with it or another guy getting away with it I'm ... I've I've I don't know a lot of different\nBut it still didn't have that reaction to it\nYou can go ahead go ahead no no please no a lot of the book them a lot of ...\nBook is about is is that all all booked all good books are search for understanding and a lot of the book is is trying to get people to understand the America in which these crimes occurred\nThey hurt a hundred years ago and ah I grew up in a small town very much like the crimes that these ... that these murders occurred to him and I grew up in them fifty sixty years ago so it's sort of equal distance from me and them and that's one reason that the\nStory was powerful to me but I Am trying to get people to understand what ... what the criminal justice system was like how fantastically primitive it was really a whether they are or what how people\nLived that they they lived rich meaningful live\nA ... ... people\nIn urban areas today think of people who lived in small towns a hundred years ago or often think of people who live in small towns a hundred years ago I was living in these boring lives which nothing ever happened\nTo all of the things that happened to you and me and people in our lives happened to people in small towns I mean they they they got married they fell in love and got married and they got divorced and they started careers and got promoted and got fired they moved and they went on long trips and brought back souvenirs\nThey they had entertainment so they went to literally every night\nAll of the things that that happened ... who happen to us happened to them uh and I was trying to create a a picture [noise] unfortunately it is a picture of their death for that's a terrible picture because they died terrible bath\nAnd also I was trying to create a picture of how they lived and and and give the reader or a an understanding of what it was like to be in America and in a small town or a hundred years ago\nAnd I think he did that very effectively in fact I think that's one of the interesting things about true crime in general is that the the focus can be on things which ... ... ... the inverted pyramid of journalism\nAnd you can spend a lot more time on the things which are less important to telling the story improper journalism you can spend a lot more time talking about the atmosphere of the tone for the um the things that people ate\nOr the way that houses were constructed or their communities were laid out you can you can do that in and it brings up a fresh context\nTo these murders um you know as opposed to the traditional way that the crimes are covered in in St storytelling into journalism context I that's what I really like what you were doing especially when you were getting into the fabric of these communities\nAnd then there's what is it up and always sticks with me that those traits that party or just back there and that has to do with the the soccer in the case of soccer and then that it wants\nSo am I think it was soccer do we had an alibi for the time of one of the crime is one of the crime was committed on December twenty four of I think\nNineteen Nineteen or Nineteen Eighteen and he had a a\n... he had\nA witnesses who said that on that particular day he was delivering a to his neighbors\nItalian community um a pickle deal because trickled deals were a delicacy that we're eating on Christmas Day and there were there was but there was conflicting testimony that said no no no that couldn't have been done\nOn December twenty fourth because you're never buy the pickled deals on December on Christmas Eve you have to buy them on December twenty seconds or something so that you have time to prepare them and put them in on on ice for a couple of days before you eat them see a\n... it's a it's a tiny detail that you would right that would not never survive I mean he would never know that that was true of Italian or the way that tell you in American communities lived a hundred years ago\nExcept that it's important in a crime story and that's what kinds of stories are there are these little there's a flash of light that illuminates the details\nOf uh uh or something that would otherwise be totally forgotten\nYou know I think that brings us very effectively ...\nIowa I'm ended the crime story which ... as you pointed out earlier is the one that starts to to give away um ... the communities are already catching on at this point to the fact that there's a ... a killer on the railway tickets tickets through what happened in ... [noise]\nAn an item of June nine Nineteen twelve\nBut it's interesting how communities will will sometimes do that because that that is their way of honoring so but I think you mentioned the economics piece that explains everything you know that that's one of the reasons why it's usually prominent citizens that enjoy that kind of status or not or you know\nThe um the one of his maps and trade crimes are the double murder in Colorado Springs it murder to families and what not an adjoining how\nThe uh uh but if you if you go to that a community where that happened now the people that area's still remember it still they they could tell that to house right\nThere um but it still has not forgotten or many places\nMany places where these crimes occurred it was so long ago that it's totally I'm absolutely forgotten but at some of the ... still quite well remember [noise]\nSo I Want to you know I'm I'm going to make a sacrifice you because [noise]\nIt was really hoping to finish the book before the interview but I really want to get to the part about how you think you have narrowed down this suspect so let's let's go through that\nLet's go through that process Ninety victims [noise]\nStarting in the late Nineteen century going up to the early twentieth century of one men the men and the train [noise] does he have a name [noise]\nNext coast to coast am this being punished [noise]\nNews radio nine sixty W we are seeing [noise]\n\nDid you see [noise]\nFox News I might be off the Republican Pennsylvania Congressman Keith Ross was shocked by the eleven lives taken as a Pittsburgh synagogue by suspected gunman Robert ... hours you're\nSupposed to stay at a place of worship here ... you should never have this kind of a terror anywhere\nRoss was speaking to Fox News migrants at the border on President Trump's mind\nThat sometimes it gets up to Seventeen thousand people they say today they said it's really\nGets bigger and bigger doesn't make any difference because they're not\nComing in [noise] and\nThe president addressing a campaign rally in southern Illinois Mexican president Enrique Pena Nieto has offered the migrants shelter medical attention schooling in jobs\nIf they apply list his father [noise]\n\nPartly cloudy conditions light westerly wins temperatures falling into the upper forties by sunrise was later today we'll see sunshine in the warming trend begin with the highest Seventy five mostly clear again this evening on overnight lows fifty\nTwo then Monday we see sunny skies once again tomorrow so I sent to be born in the WBRC bought six personal our weather center\nI meteorologist red hundreds on your side right now it's forty seven degrees at news radio nine sixty tell you we are see\nOne two one covered why seals mammal can take a deep sea diving and reserve is with her lungs no worse for wear on the way down Lucille delicate among two shoes get injured as the crushed and suffered blood and oxygen flooding when the seal heads back up\nNot better no the fragile tissues could suffer inflammation usually response by the body to heal damage yet the researchers found no evidence of lung damage him these deep divers hunter steals protect their lungs from a potential dot org\n[noise] news radio nine sixty W we are see\n[noise]\n\nBin\nAnd al\n\n\n...

I don't doubt that he had\nCommitted pieces of the same crime earlier I don't I ... to ... very much would suspect that he had been adding inappropriate interactions with young girls\nThat he had a a while you have if he had a chip on his shoulder he wasn't that like a nice guy and then he says he ... is his the documentation of his life around around the time of the first crime mentions that he was\nUm it wasn't hard to get him into a fight you know he was he was he had he had he carried a they carry the sangre pretty open by the uh but I so I don't doubt that there were other violent incidents through in about his life the uh uh but I don't think the whole scenario\nIt's come together for him before that\nBut it still and that's that's a great point what year had gone into the navy do you know we don't know no\nI'd be curious whether to find the town in which he grew up in uh yes um and then ... ... what year he went into the navy and see whether prior to that year there had been something which\nYou know he knew he had to get out of ... he had to get out of dodge ... joining the navy it was a great way to do it so whether it's just one person who was the victim of his rage but gave him a great satisfaction and and you know I'm\nA nurse assist sociopath which is what this guy sounds like the most dangerous kind\nA sociopath ... are often rage killers and they just you know they it it's a pent up thing and and the ... they just they do it as a kind of release and I I Wonder whether that that first released came long before he came to the new world\nBut it was not a nurse or a ... because it was not um [noise] it it didn't have any charm it was not it was ... ... generally as a charming\nRight motive often well spoken ... makes a good appearance\nHe didn't do any of that they were it was a true cycle a psychopath have no fear ... norm at do not have normal fear and one thing the apparent about this ... on the train is that from his crime that he was not [noise]\nNot acting and fear he was he was calm in the middle of events that\nAre horrific events that anyone else would have been shaking in their boots and that was one reason he was able to get by with it or I ...

that area and Eighteen Ninety eight\nUh but uh it's cold cold a lot of the year and he didn't he didn't read all ... it would create some crimes up north when it was warm weather but not never been happier is limited to the south the um\nThe or that area is a interesting because it it it's always been a hotbed of um a reformist motion or a movement to it's as you no doubt no a a\nA a one of the

of the country I don't know what it has to do with my book but uh it is a very interesting area and I I'd like to know more about it\nYou know there's an argument in true crime that the the ... the ... murders on its own just unsolved\nCrimes like that seep into the soil and then did they tend to also then grow back out of it again which I was kind of poetic they're interesting Doug is in New

five of these ah ... degenerate hobo is that stayed there in the yard that were actually killed and they found out that they were all killed by actresses they were they were chopped up the axes were supposedly taken off of the trains\nAnd there was I Believe a total of five bodies found and um I Believe at one point Eliot Ness when he was first getting in to his position he was asked to go ahead and looks at this and this was one of the things that he had never\nIt's called and they said it bothered him greatly ... you know till he retired do you know if that has anything to do it or are you familiar with that case at all yeah\nThey um uh [noise] I I I Know exactly it it's not ... actually Cleveland the Nineteen thirties I I'm sure that the case you're referring to it it's a Eliot Ness or after the ... ... a ... was hired to try to solve a series of a\n... and I I've been named by which the yet right is\nCrime series is known but they've actually started in Newcastle Pennsylvania Nineteen twenty two and then spread the Cleveland in the Nineteen thirties I wrote about that period of the crimes that some like in in a popular crime but that is it's not it's not it it it they were\n... they were acts murders that were directed to train the but it it's twenty [noise] uh the uh [noise] ... twenty five thirty years after\nThe crimes that I wrote about it and I it is not

thanks I'm not going to go about a nice to see again but but I think hey\nA bill the guy in a in Cleveland out here in LA I'm a longtime journalist out here they think he might have been a suspect in the black though you're killing or LA enough thought that\nUh and I just real quick about a Lizzie Borden she killed or a she if she did it used to play to the acts and you said the other guy use the blood and so that would be I guess that'd be something else I guess to go on to ask you real quick did they ever have a picture of this guy somebody could have had to if\nYou're given a description of 'em that you know we had newspapers back then you know we had a you know we had a Morse code and tell all types of stuff like that I mean there had been some sort of of picture circulated or something of this guy right to the people knew about it later\nHe just blew into and out of town and no whatever no one knew who he was you know when you when you buy\nBuy it that's a really big on the first crime [noise] everybody\nKnew everybody knew what he looked like and he was a very unusual looking man\nBut for some reason that we can't figure out no one ever did that we can fine no newspaper that we can find ever did a drawing of them and posted it and I don't know why they didn't do it it was common practice and and the wild west in the same era\nThe it was ... it was commented dude drawings
