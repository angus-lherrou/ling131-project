it's very very hard to tell the difference it's very strange I Can't really differentiate what's real and what is and\nBecause the the the frauds are very good at what they do\nThat's the thing and you know what I watch shows on TV about uh how magicians are pulling in public and I say this is so bad because it's so good at this and it makes all of us who are legitimate like really really bad\nAnd it looks like we're all doing trickery of something so I I'll tell you if you have a psychic reading you should not you should not ask the person who's receiving their reading\nAny questions I shouldn't say well you know it's your mother's name or anything like that or why you hear you should be able to tell them that's the first test of legitimacy of or what you are receiving\nThe retailer on a few days ago I heard it in a great guy and I I Believe he's got these powers who are others who are critical of him say that he's just a great magicians\nAnd and I told them I says hurry I got to tell you if you're a magician are you doing this would sleight of hand you've got to be the best there ever was because I said we can't see how you been those spoons magically you if you're a magician I Can't see the trick\nOr you know we're we're you do the switch or anything like that ah I've looked at videos I've slowed him down a gun frame by frame\nYou can't catch the guy I think he's the real deal\nI think he's probably the real deal I Believe he started out doing magic trick says many of these wonderful psychics do they start out doing simple magic tricks and then it ethically from there as a there are six cents kicks in and they start to weigh it legitimately\nAnd that's the kind of well close together you can't tell the difference\nBut it's wonderful that you're you're falling down in frames and did you learn anything from that we were able to\n... you know what I just learned that the guys got some powers but a lot of us have that ability to generate some of those similar kinds of power she was starting up watches and blocks that haven't started in years\n[laughter] to to say that when you were growing up you did magic tricks or you're involved with magic\nAnd did a little magic when I was kid um you know was I was really good at that but you know I dabble with that I had a lot of body experience when I was eleven\nWhich really I think you'd me into the field that I Know I just wanted answers to all these unusual strange things and they're still unusual and strange for me Joyce [laughter]\nYes I Know but you you're really amazing because I find that most people are so skeptical and you spend so much energy trying to convince people are really saying something that will really be impressed and they'll say well I was a trick I it was a visiting a Web site last night that I thought was terrific and\nThere there were some uh doubters who had captions over the whole thing saying this is obviously fraudulent and those are people I Believe who will not allow themselves to move out of out of the third dimensional way of thinking that so restrictive eliminating no into higher consciousness go into fourth dimension stuff and beyond\nAll move forward and it's the people who are very mired in a monetary and ah other um financial interests are very earthy that will not leave that dimension and that's really a shame because the earth is supposed to be in growing in a consciousness of the kind of a\nDigging their heels and it's like a little bit of resistance\nYeah you do now do we take calls next hour what do you need from our callers listeners your number of months ... days I\nHave a birthday ... and the first name possible short they're asking about I'm a soul mate I Do a lot about love and romance\nAnd try to keep each call two minute nap personal mouth has so many\nWill cut it short will try to get right in there as quickly as you believe in reincarnation [noise]\nI don't see how it's not possible how could we possibly have the experience as we have if we weren't more and more than one time and either on the earth or another dimension so I think people can be here the first time because they've been in other dimensions other um\nWow that's a I don't think anyone is new so I'd have to say do I believe in reincarnation as say a variation of it and the churches need to catch up a little bit which I think they are and the religious orders\nAs a psychic is there anything out there that bothers you the the the you feel very strange about\nWhen you say very I trained her about like um\nAre you picking on them are you picking up weird feelings or anything like that\nWell I don't like going the cemetery I don't like the energy there and people who are ... and they go to the cemetery frequently polling that person back to their grave site and they they really want to go into the light they want to be elevated themselves\nAnd yet the grieving process is really not good it's not healthy for anyone I Know I Know that grief\nBut you don't dwell on it you say you know I Love this person good luck God Bless you and try to relate to them and\nAnd I always think about them right he was and\nThink about that we can we're still wells that go on for like a bless you I Love you thank you for what we had to go there and let them go are going to the cemetery very bad uh you know my my parents were big cemetery hours as I was growing up is that a good word for word [laughter]\nI don't like cemeteries and I don't like funerals\nExactly but my parents were part of the generation that with the cemetery it's a lot you know and I found myself a cemetery great you know growing up and at one point my parents were pointing to a Marshall am driving through Greenwood cemetery and my mom to the gym I think we should\nGet one of those oh and I think it's time yeah I I'm thinking to myself I really don't want to live here don't play no they're not going to stay here\nAs I started crying and what's wrong with you I I don't want to live here they said no no no our from my mother explain more about that to me and that was very enlightening\nI thought it was like a house ... ...

call it power where'd you get it from\nI I don't think it's powered I oh God that ... where it really is just trying to think a lot of people say that and I think on the God as the ultimate power but the rest of us to an end and I try to help people I've had a radio show four more years and I can remember\nAnd it's actually afraid to call in I'm very happy to it and that's why she went and got the

help people\nPeople people listen to the show love animals joys and many of them owned them what happens when that pet that animal passes on\nThat's a great question oh it's all connected to our animals [noise]\nWell you know how when my cat died we were so close they came to me that night and he said you know mom I'm fine [laughter] and I don't want you to worry about me\nWhen I lost my dog he came to me and a little hospital bed the night he died he was lying on his side he said I I'm okay now I didn't feel well before I passed but I'm okay now I Know it's so crazy they call me mom they really think that your mother\nSo animals and that's to your question try to either go to a dimension of all animals are they usually go with the people they crossed over with they will stay with them on the other side so they're really cut and dried rules about where animals go [noise]\nBut they do have are really as we all do from pain and misery it's like a it's a wonderful dimension but\nI I don't want people to think that two sides right you're supposed to go and you're supposed to go and you know a suicides are all different matter and I think Robin Williams and a lot of people have taught us a lot about suicide\nSad stories are very sad yes don't do it [laughter] no\nYou'd asked me if I see or is that I don't but I Do feel or as Joyce I Do have that ability to be on ...\n... is

healing and that's a terrific that's really really great because they don't know how to help themselves and you come in and it could be training for you but it's not because you know how to control

Maine yet when my father had been friends for the straight an army officer\nI got pneumonia and I died in hospital the doctor told my parents that I had died as pronounced clinically dead and then they look to get and they said oh you boy died and he came back so that\nThat is one of the first experiences of my life involving the stuff that goes into the new books I must tell you George I don't

back eventually opt to seeming to live a whole life of Ninety years old so and I'm shocked\nTo find myself in the body as a kid and and now the hospital and from that George comes my lifelong understanding that there will be on the physical you know nine years old who he talked about this she tried to talk the adults that the medication you're hallucinating or something like this person who could explain\nTo me what happened in any way that made sense was an aboriginal kid from the indigenous tradition is that oh yeah we do that we get sick really sick we got to live with the spirits and then we come back and sometimes we have the same\nAnd sometimes we're not so the gift of these experiences which rings my co dissociation was an ability to travel beyond the body traveling consciousness without psychedelic drugs quite easily and an understanding that there are well beyond the physical and they are accessible\nYou must have been an amazing little boy Robert [laughter]\nWell I was a former loan me a little boy you know I was sick I on my father's in the army's moving all the time army brat situation I'll tell you all the things that kept me going is it amongst mine this boat companions a phrase probably most of us remember from childhood was a big man and a lot of white hair and a pink face\nBecoming sit on my dad didn't say backup Robin you know you're going to make it through your survive I can promise you that you're learning now that you know goals and they'll like you and one day all day you can't tell your dreams are easier right now people want to hear you\nThat invisible companion George was the older rubber younger than I Am now traveling across time to cheer up his younger self and help him come through one of the things I've learned is\nWe are time travel is in our dreams and when we develop the odds of conscious or active treated me as I call it one of the cool things we can do is we can actually go back to younger self and be cheerleader and counselor to them in the right time and going the other way we can sometimes managed to talk\nTo a why is the self who sees what life looks like a bit further down the road that we have gotten and can help us to get the right perspective\nAmazing now let's get into your latest work of course mysterious realities dream travelers tales from the imagine all realm you call yourself a dream travel or what is that\nWell it means that one of the things going on in dreams is that we traveled beyond our old and read dimension of reality into other will we traveled the parallel worlds for example\nBut we're leading parallel lives this isn't as weird as at some science tells us in the many worlds hypothesis that you and I live in right now in one of many parallel worlds well how do we know about that in human terms while we might know it from our dreams in which we find ourselves for example\nIn consecutive episodes living a life a bit different from other living right now on may be radically different so that's part of a dream traveling mainstream traveling also means\nThat in our dreams in sleep dreams of venting conscious elusive dreaming we made travel to places where the dead or alive and this might be the source of understanding that solar consciousness survive physical test so this is a pretty pretty important area\nUh so the idea of dreamed travel goes beyond the routine idea about dreams as the little bubble up from the U.S no subconscious and that's all that's going on a this was the ancient an indigenous understanding as lived in my life and told and stories from that life\nBut in dreams we traveled to other places and we received visitations from people who come cooling those people to come calling my enclosed glued but loving family members are ancestors of spiritual guy some kind or another\nSo dream travel means we get out that we get beyond the body in the brain we get into that whole field of non local mind science tells us about getting the condom information field to get into the ability to access sources of information beyond the Audrey and also part of this is that we are definitely time travel is\nAnybody who follows their dreams for wild and writes them down will notice that they dream of events before they happen and one function of time travel we see the possible future we can reduce the challenges and opportunities that lie ahead\nBut we also traveled into the past from this nice and pronounce the lives you learned about our connections with drama is playing out in the reality is another time periods in the multi dimensional universe\nSo this is the key to the U.S hand understanding\nOf what the multi dimensional universe is all about this is the power of direct experience as pop the dream travel and my stories in the book come absolutely and entirely from my experiences in these areas and the experiences of some other people who work with me and they're giving me permission to use the story\nRobert if we did not dream of course we all do not everybody remembers him but if we did not dream what would we be lacking as human beings what would happen to us\nI think we'd be locking quite often a sense of purpose a sense of Seoul since the spirit because you know one of the things that dreams do is they connect us to keep a source of knowledge of wisdom actually be on the old and remind this is one of the reasons why\nMost human ... human couches across history about dreams and dream of say believe the dreams put you in touch with the guard or got us if you like\nBut you can talk to nature with the ancestors with the big self all the highest ... so we might be lacking that I'd say terribly relevant to our time is that we might be lacking conscience stickers dreams can be the voice of conscience and dreams can be\nA ... a magic mirror that shows us our actions and attitudes from Baton and more objective perspective than we can manage for ourselves an indigenous people say if you lost your dream\nYou've lost a vital part of your sold your dream sold in fact has gone missing and probably the scariest story in my book mysterious realities local unquote dreamed takers\nAnd which takes a look at what that might begin to mean if you live in a society where people are divorced from their dreams have lost the sense of conscience have lost the sense of a deep up to ... percent of that by the gun to lose a sense of what it really means to be a human a fully a live human I think it's actually as important as that\nI was mentioning now Robert that some people don't remember their dreams what makes them not remember\nWell first of all we haven't made it socially rewarding oath on to share dreams I mean we don't have good ways of talking about dreams most of us when we remember something a bit embarrassed how do we talk about this how do we tell us\nSo one of the things lacking in our society is a way that makes it fun and as I say socially rewarding to bring a dream to the table I invented the very simple\nFalse step process to sharing a dream of a story that makes it fun you can get it done and minutes you get some help feed back in your guide to towards action but there are other reasons why we're losing our dreams I mean bad habits apart from that is part of it let ourselves\nRushed out sleep by the alarm clock but then you get the job of deal with the family we think that we should lie in the in bed and don't pay and it took eight dollars or whatever and they pay any attention to those in between twilight states of consciousness you'll between sleep in the wake\nThat's a good time to catch it means good time to talk of loose and dreaming but many people don't realize that that just ... because they're awake in the middle of the night yet ... says losing that others\nSometimes we close off our dream because they're scared of what they might be telling us we don't want to know that we might get sick we don't want to know that our actions may not be okay we don't want to know the relationship is in trouble so we'd slam the door and say no more dreams sometimes this is very interesting\nYou have to know that in dreaming we step out of the time altogether we step into a different place and in between place\nFrom which we can access time passed future or power low so you may discover that in your dreams your getting really interesting experiences\nOf what's going on in all the time together in those parallel times we're leading a power life this become very interesting when you begin to look at gifts and lessons you might have learned in a parallel life that you can apply and you present my and how to avoid things went wrong and not at all the power alone I\nThink it's very interesting when you discover that you can go back to younger period of your life and reclaim something you lost at that time\nWill be guide to that younger self or you find yourself also in the lives of situations the people in far flung places feel proud of your multi dimensional family I'm a bit of a an agnostic about reincarnation but I firmly believe based on my experience\nBut we are connected to dramas being lived in other places in time and that from a certain point\nOf view it's all going on now I wouldn't be doing what I I'm not doing not found myself connected with an Anglo Irish men who came to the American colonies\nSeventeen hundred ... Indian very well I found myself dreaming into his life that I had to study his life\nAnd on for a second Robert we're at the break but we'll be back with more in a moment of coast to coast they um [noise]\nGet Daily Show updates right to your inbox for free with the coasts zones newsletter sign up to the coast to coast am dot com\nNews radio nine sixty W we are seeing [noise]\n... the ...

I was in the graveyard this week and I look at him\nYeah I was in a graveyard I've never been to before never been in this place and just having a walk and I'm thinking about a girl I loved and could never have from Thirty years ago and I looked down on the name of a headstone is her name the full name\nAnd there's the dates this person died last summer and I can't believe it or what I call\nShe's never beat in the air as far as I Know I make some calls I discovered she died last summer something drew me to a head start he says what do you think of that I said it's a great story it's a very great story I mean that introduces whole themes about you know the energy and the connection that might exist between the living in the dead and how someone who has died my coat into sudden\nGoal is to a certain place might even be an age and the simplicity but as I'm telling us it's also an example of how like attracts like I like stories so even on a day when I'm staying at the airport I don't need a new story today I'm given what else to live as a story immediately just like that\nAnd in the ... these examples proliferate so\n... you know what it how it works is that the the the attitude and the energy you are carrying again to have results your attitude travels ahead of you in life\nShaping wanted waking for waiting you around the next corner which is a very good reason every tuning in life to pause and check your attitude check what is playing when you're in a soundtrack\nCheck what you're saying to you so drop the negative mantras and self limiting beliefs and be open to something more positive coming into your life\nRobert is there anything physical about this I mean I Know we need the brain the dream but we're also tapping into I think the subconscious and it does its thing outside of the physical body but how important is the physical body to all of this\nWell I think about is very important that the first of all I mean scientists telling us there is no barrier between mind and matter anywhere in the universe mind and not to into leave at every turn in every level in fact some scientists tell us that the hot a matter of reality as a dense consciousness so\n... there's no hope of separating mind matter they're always play together but when we think about the kinds of messages the kinds of discoveries that we're exploring we have to remember the party has its own messages discoveries there's the phenomenon but\nUsed to be called pre sentiment which I experience a lot maybe you do to what it means in terms of the body is the body sometimes seems to know things that are going to happen before the the mind of the brain can recognize what is\nGoing on the body reacts\nTo something ahead of time for example I go to the doctor for routine annual physical one time my blood pressure is much higher than usual even though it's controlled surprisingly high\nAnd there's no explanation for this until the nuts trying to do uh get get some blood for a blood analysis hits a gusher in my blood is though they're going to have\nYou lived in pants and after that I'm completely common my blood pressure is normal and she and the doctor trying to understand what just happened\nI said well this is pretty sentiment it's what's called an Alice in wonderland the the white queen gamble the white queen screams\nBefore she picks her finger so she doesn't have to scream when she actually picks the thing where I just did the same thing I had a reaction in my high blood pressure too and in the Ford took place on the doctor says my goodness that probably is a scientific\nProof of a sudden the phenomenon ... sentiment or anticipating symptoms he says but I couldn't possibly be reported people think I was looted you\nWell you know I said so I think the ... we know in our body all sorts of things we know things\nThat we know what the bleep we don't know that we know enough about it you know so medic response was we pick up things from a distance from other people\nWe feel what they're feeling in our body as well so that's part of the story\nNow you teach active dreaming what exactly is that Robert\nActed dreaming is way of getting active with dreams in the sense that you again to remember your dreams are going to share them the right way you're going to take action that will empower your life and brings them healing energy and guidance in July from your dreams I mean that's one aspect of it\nIt's also a method of loose dreaming you would call the ... medical use of dreaming we ... my favorite way of talking on the loose and dream adventure\nIs to start out loose that ... what does that mean that means that we use shut many drumming in the workshops\nAnd we might take a dream that we remember as a starting point we might decide okay there's some romance an adventure still in the stream let's go on with the dream let's get back inside the dream and have more we might decide okay it's time to brave up to a nightmare terror and stuff that stuff's going on\nBy going back inside the dream and facing the scary based on its own ground it might mean\nI Want to talk to someone who turned up in my dream whether it's spreading Morrow someone else\nSo that's an example of traumatic looser dreamy another example is that I encourage people to spend a lot more time in that risky try lied state\nTo eat and sleep and wake because that's where creative connections made where we are extremely psyche can intuitive and creative naturally so I encourage people to instead of complaining about being awake in the middle of the night\nRelax into that state make it a state of horizontal meditation if you like I tend to the images of rise and fall and see what he wants to make one of the scenes that will come to you the pool to loosen dreaming and finally\nActive dreaming of the method is also about dreaming with your eyes wide open we got the how to look at simplicity outlook for signs and symbols in the world around you so this is also a program and the method all attending to the dream like symbols\nI don't think that dreams and self misleading I think that I've been on the dreams can often be misleading we might be in a rush to interpret it might have to interpret according to the wrong standards I think I don't think the dreams and themselves as a deceptive\nI mean we can pick up things in the night of the problems that are floating around that we don't watch around we can pick up pigments from other other entities from whether they're just a bit confused or militias\nThat that can be confusing or deceptive but I think that any image that belongs to is that is truly are owed\nCan be worked in the service of hope and healing it might not be great to begin with it might be horrible my dream of some horrible based but by learning to go back inside the dream and confront the issue on the ground you might find that behind something that's scaring the very end you and\nYour dream is the power power of understanding of power that might might give you a kind of spiritual ally or life guide a life coach if you're willing to work with the material I I think as I say that the dream is not the step to put a rush to interpret according to a narrow understanding what dreams is about to be very misleading\nYou got to Robert we are going to take a quick break we'll come back and take phone

C.\n[noise]\n\n\nAnd welcome back to coast to coast are dear friend Robert boss back with us as we talk about dreams will get your calls as well Robert you write about Carl young a lot in he even had some of his own situations didn't need it didn't they\n[noise] but he made his situations Joe in his dream of life [noise]\nOh yeah he would do you own your own was inspired by dreams I mean he said\nIn memory streams reflection thought he has interesting thought looked every day but he takes up in his work and study only what comes to an end dream so here is the man I mean a titan of scholarship and science who is driven all his life by his dream\nA lot of the stories ... new book as scary as reality is it both humans passage into the afterlife and actually what he might be doing now it's a pretty interesting title but the part of that is in the previous documentation is that Yom dreamed again and again before his death\nBut he was living in a Bush and all his retreats on the lake come late lyric\nWhich is called bowling get up in the nearby village is living in another balding guy on the other side of death and those close to him said that he lost all fear of death you thought absolutely confident in certain he knew where he was going to a towel on the other side of death on the lake and in\nA story in a mysterious way out of his Kobe other bought a gun I follow you on\nTo that possible afterlife situation and actually give some insight into where how you'll miss mind might be working right now is he works on a great new books or in the afterlife I mean some people might be shocked and surprised\nBut Robert his crazy enough to think that you would have an audience with him from the other side of death but you know you'll himself rage a great deal not always the publication about his contacts with the defaced he talked in his in his mouth and then he read book about extensive conversations\nHe had with the deposit that shaped your view of reality and he was one of those are always understood\nOne of the key things about dreaming is is it gives the U.S had the ability to understand what happens to mind of consciousness after death because it dreams as you understood we receive visitations from the departed I didn't dream to make travel into the realms what they are at home but very briefly one more thing about him\nAnd his relevance to this book in my approach to everything\nHe came late in his life to the conclusion that one of the things going on in dreams is that we live I'm quoting you continue to live and other realities that we perceive and dreams so I'll dream maybe memories\nOf ongoing life situations nothing this reality but somewhere else\nThat we visit again and again when we when we slip out of the body and go into ...\nSo this is a great a dream ... of the west to you and the manager of a ... is it ... through a deep and horrifying experience of an under will journey and he paid the price\nOf surviving that and coming back and adding his science and his scholarship to watch it you first and about deeper realities and giving us an incredible model of understanding of all the things we're talking about something a great admirer of you\nWho wasn't young close who'd Sigmund Freud and then eventually they broke often had disputes\nFreud regarded as his air ... your was your most Freud favored apprentice but they broke because young because Freud although at tremendous scholar and pioneer of understanding dreams in his eye and writes who made himself is number one study\nWhich is what you need to do to listen to to anything on dreams from someone who's not a dream of\nDespite all that Freud adopted rather narrow view of what's going on in dreams or rather narrow theory out he tried to apply to human streams\nAnd you only had famously a dream in which he's in a house that has on many levels and the basement area below the comfortable Bush ... upper level is is a a floor vote ... something primal\nAnd Freud insisted on interpreting the dream to Yom as something to do with you know among the complex and the desire to see somebody dead\nAnd you didn't break with him at the moment but then eventually he did because he felt that Freud was putting his dream experiences into a cup of narrow understanding\nAnd that break up with very interesting but the company by synchronous stick phenomena you talked about the body and math to in relation to these things and one of the conversation but human Floyd approaching that pops up there's a tremendous crack in a cabinet to avoid stop so scared and confused and\n... and Yom wrote in describing that he felt something ... and his belly like a hot enough and he was going to happen again there's another huge bang for the third ... sounds of blowing up hot\nSo what we're seeing in that episode is something that goes on in the form the phenomena of Sin City which is the thoughts and emotions we are carrying strongly\nCan have a physical impact on the world around it so it's a very interesting thing in my story about your young says from the afterlife that Freud has changed his opinion he's evolved has gone a long way since he died but that doesn't have much contact together now\nI Love it in your book mysterious realities the subtitle of dream travelers tales from the ...\nFive times the most
