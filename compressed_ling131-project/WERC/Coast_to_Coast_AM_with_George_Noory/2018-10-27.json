the\nPencils that I don't know your ... believe me\nThere there's a lot to talk to a and about coming up on coast to coast am and we'll start with Michael Guillen who is here the end of life as we know it\nOminous news from the frontiers of science is his new book but you might know him better from an ABC News or from the History Channel where he hosts the show or from his other books including a novel the no prophecy a he's in LA guy or you are you a dodger's fan Michael\nWell uh you know what I grew up rooting for the Dodgers um but I spend a lotta years in Boston\nHarbor day of my son was born in ... and I don't know kind of caught between a rock and I are [laughter] I understand that that's why I asked the uh\nUh later on a ... you are obviously you you achieve great heights both in academia and in media and you are amongst I think in the elite group\nOf science\nReporters people who actually write nonfiction about science in into very accessible way or we put you in the same category as Mary Roach are you a fan of hers\n[noise] you know I I I I'll be honest with you I'm not familiar with Mary Roach\nOh you're missing missing a terrific come in but you know she's a she's a frequent guest year and but very very entertaining and she writes I'm always about science and so she left to explore particular subjects and\nSo her book on for example what happens to the body after we die called stiff or ... or packing for Mars and when she talked she tried to learn what it'd be like to go to Mars and all the things that would happen and she is very good at it you know she's grey\nAnd you'd really like her and it's just very kind of ... it was reminiscent to me a little bit on how you were getting into the subject because you handle it with a very um [noise] a very non scholastic approach it's the science is there but um anybody can follow these stories and everybody probably should if you want to get ugly\nAnd do what the future is all about the students should be a great gift for for Christmas if you if you have a a young scientist and you're on your list some urban old scientist for that matter but looking ahead you know I did you pardon the pun I was just talking about Larry King and he was he was talking about he he believes he's a big believer\nIn cryogenic [noise] yeah yeah a lot you know there's also that famous baseball connection with you Ted Williams family in ...\nBut I mean I what what is the science these days on something like that and how realistic is this would disappear for somebody like Larry King do hope that he will be able to come back again and take his place behind home plate in the few huh [laughter]\nWell first of all thank you for the kind words I I have spent my entire life communicating science I Try to make it as interesting as I can you know I spent fourteen years at\nA ABC News as you indicated good morning America twenty twenty Nightline and you know you have to you have to make things interesting or they'll give you the hook basically [laughter] uh I've kind of cut my teeth on that\nAs far as cryogenic says concerned you know it's interesting you bring that up and I covered the cryogenic story over the years\nAh you know they're in the stories that Walt Disney had his head of frozen and ah with with the hope one day of uh of being brought back to life the head being the most important part because it carries our memories or thoughts and so forth and so on\nBut you know I got to be honest with you that's like old school um what I get in the sense that now with what's going on with robotics and so forth and so it's more likely that um\nWhat Larry King is going to want to do is you know before he kicked the can\nUh you know he's going to want to upload all his thoughts and memories or onto a supercomputer and then downloaded onto a very realistic robot so that Larry King [laughter] can ah can remain behind home plate you know indefinitely into the future but I'm Serious\nYou know in in my book um the end of life is you know what I deal with these four big topic areas or the first is the worldwide Web the second is an artificial intelligence robots\nThat third it has to do with privacy and surveillance technology and the fourth has to do with genetic engineering so between genetic engineering and artificial intelligence robots man I'm telling you Larry King is going to be around for a long long\nTime ago and I was reading some of those sanctions and I thought that was interesting because there really as you said when he was very I think you mentioned like ... once the book and there's not a big emphasis on it but there is still this hope that people have about\nPreserving their essence and and then that becomes a course a full debate about what we're is the seat of the essence of us you know we used to think the soul was the heart and the head contained all of the you know the the computer works but [laughter]\nBut do you how realistic is it ever in any near future that we would be able to upload\nThoughts in dreams like you might expect from Minority Report being able to capture them and then put them into something else\n[noise] I think it's very real or in I mean you know and and and you indicated about the my book about the future but but the truth of it is it it's really about what's going on right here and right now even as we speak and ... in labs all over the world\nUh I tell for example the story of Ilan must uh being very very involved well you know he's involved in driverless cars who's involved in outer space and going to Mars and so forth and so on but he's also got his finger in this whole neural net\nBut anyway it's changed but it was a game changer for me I don't want to get into all of it so I became a

life as we know it and just before we went into the break we were talking about\nThat that space in discussions of what we should and ought to do which\nMight be better informed by discussions of morality as much as ethics and and you know I think even Michael when you were talking about [noise]\nAbout the idea of preserving physical life on this planet is like the weather that was through

the whole idea is to then bring back the wooly mammoth and that's going on right now a including a group that's being led by a guy at Harvard named church\nSo um the question then becomes do we I mean you know it's exciting it's it's interesting it's it's like science fiction come true but then when you get past all that kind of the bells and whistles of it all you have to ask you know do we really want to do this and\nThere's an even deeper question that I raised in the book and that is with all the genetic engineering we are doing and you know the extent these the extinction efforts are I Do come under the category of genetic engineering\nWhy we're doing in is something that's never been done before\nAnd that is we are elevating recessive trade\nAnd we're gonna traits in other words we're flying in the face of the very forces that have created these species the evolutionary forces sure we're defining the\nNatural flow where to find the natural order of things and you kind of believe that when you take on Mother Nature remember the old commercial you don't don't mess with Mother Nature or something like that\nYeah it's not nice ... nice to mother nature\nYou know that the one yeah it's not nice I forget what it was\nThe commercial was margarine I it was very mired in for a merger and right now and we all know margarine is not so great for like\nYou gotta wonder that because we are doing this we now have the ability of elevating recessive traits and suppressing dominant trait we're fine in the face of Mother Nature\nWe had to pay a price and he can't do that you're you're you're fighting against you know a billion according to science you know billions of years of evolution right where we didn't do that if we take it on or who was going to be the casualty\nI'm thinking we are now you know this\nThis is the ultimate question and I I mean you know I was reading the DEA extinction thing and I'm not sure that if they brought back quote unquote a wooly mammoth what we really wouldn't have is just a wooly or elephant\nYou know but much in the same way that we have a sweeter orange right where we have a a a a juicy repeat or something that people do by\nFlipping genetic codes around here there and I'm not saying that that smart either but but I think I'm more worried about some of this idea about the the ... some of the robotics that you talk about and and what that what that really means ... who's gonna decide\nWhen robots have really gone far enough and are we going to be in a situation as crazy as it sounds words like sky net and it'll be too late the robots will you know there'll be self teaching and we're out\nWell you know again that's a very real possibility I um\nI tell this story about this guy I think his name is Anthony ...\nIs a former Google engineer a big into driverless cars I'm so he he he helped launch way mo which is the driverless car a division of of Google right and then went to her and then got involved in this ugly lawsuit about stealing industrial secrets and stuff in the sun but\nHe recently applied to the area and was granted I'm a tax exempt status for what he's calling the church of artificial intelligence\nAnd you know on the surface it sounds a little bit crazy but when you look into what they're thinking his thinking behind doing is he's he's basically saying this look\nIf we continue in the trajectory we're now on\nIt it is inevitable that one day\nA artificial intelligence robot\nHoward by artificial intelligence will will become so much more intelligent than we that they really reached the level of a deity they they they are in effect God because they know everything they see everything they they control everything if we give them that kind of freedom\nAnd so we may as well just start getting ready to worship it because\nWe want to stay on its good side because God I did that this technology we're creating will run amok and you know you start thinking well okay it's a little crazy this guy but you know it's not that far fetched because the rate at which artificial intelligence is\nIs developing you know I talk about how it beat the pants off of the chess champion and then the checkers champion and now it can beat the champs it to you know Texas hold them poker and the uh the gang go which is generally conceded to be the most complicated game most ancient game around go yeah\nYeah I play in every once in a while\nYou write in artificial and tell us now can beat the pants off her her you know the the goat champion and so it's printed that writing is on the wall in I mean ... it's pretty clear that these computers and not just going to become fans there they're no longer just fancy adding machine there no there are no longer just doing computations\nAh but they're they're becoming more adept at doing things that we post about are we once posts about being very good at\nThat well you know like you they're ... button that up I think they're generally like he was still pretty small\nBut you know one day they're general like he was forced seem to be even greater than ours that the day of the singularity that's for the day all singularity him one day we'll have the equipment IQ of you know ten thousand two hundred and twenty five so\n[noise] yeah and it I think the interesting these are that you is it that the equation is let's use it a hundred and twenty five and we're using that as like a horizon line for human intelligence right we go with an IQ one twenty five\nBut at the smarter machines get and the more the takeover of our day to day activities\nAnd or the more they do things for us and we allow them to be in the driver's seat of our lives who's just said that that that average IQ isn't going to drop ten points\nSo we we'd like to think that we might day but the more we get cushy our brains get ... and who knows it might be a lot we might be bringing on our own physical demise faster than right than we would have possibly the magic you\nKnow ... like that the cushy Murphy ... yeah I'm right because you know the old saying if you don't use it lose that you lose\nA yeah no but I talk about I think I caught one guy that says you know it may very well be that we are in the process\nOf creating our own conquers yes raising with that the I fully believe that completely and ... and let's pick this up and coming up after the

I I Can't think of a downside to that other than the military application I guess a ... where are you with that one\nNo I I agree with you I'm a and I I think that you have that discussion that I have in the book about trans humanism and you know that's there's actually\nA movement are called the trans human movement where as you say the uh the ideas to enhance ourselves one way or another using technology and I break it down into three categories as the usable a trench human augmentation there's so there's usable there's wearable and then there's implantable\nAnd I I agree with you I I there this is an area where I see very little downside\nI mean I tell the story of the sky from Dayton, Tennessee who he was a power lines when he touched a a high voltage line that was lying on the ground and he'd lost both arms ... them right off now here's a guy who would have you know live the rest of his life you know of severely crippled\nAnd now scientists are creating for him what are called neuro prostheses prostheses\nBut see these are artificial arms but not like your grandfather's artificial arms\nYou know that we're mechanical that requires you to wear a harness and you have to ...\nYou know these are these are arms that he can move with his thought or they're they're wired to his\nMind and I mean isn't fantastic oh yeah and\nAnother story that I tell about the woman who is a quadriplegic and now you\nKnow she she's able to have some level of independence and uh because of of some of the trans human augmentation um so I Know I I agree with you and even even in um [noise]\nEven in the military setting I mean if we if we can outfit our soldiers so that\nYou know they're wearing an exoskeleton or talk about how on day has come up with some stuff there you know where you know write it just it just it it you know so so for a soldier who's out there and he's carrying you know what I fifty sixty pounds back ...\nYou know if if if they if we can give them an extra fell a skeleton to take some of that load off their own skeletons I I think that's a\nI I think it would be a stretch to find fault in something like that\nOr maybe but maybe that's been robo cop more times than you have I mean I think that\nMean and I do I'm not I'm not being facetious I think that's the only one I'm here's why it there's always this belief somehow that if we can\nIf we can come up with the technology um that saves our soldiers from from harm inevitably that that gets weaponized into and yeah we can invade without losing any soldiers and therefore there's no political consequence yeah from the ...\nAnd ... and ... you know back to 'em that idea about I'm about maybe\nSome of our advancements should not be consequence free\nIs that I think that that's the ... I get worried a little bit and maybe that's the science fiction part of me then I see\nThat politicians would rebel at the thought of not having to be accountable for anybody's death by having super soldiers that can go in and take whatever we want 'em until the embittered enemy that we've created does this one but then in ... new arms race\nNo no you're absolutely right and then I again I talk about that but you know it's interesting as you look ahead to what this technology is pointing to\nAnd uh you know we're talking about enhancing sold a human soldiers abilities but I think are equally realistic will be a you know a robot warriors and effect Terminator like warriors that will be our surrogates going into war and so we stairs\nCould possibly go wrong there [laughter] yeah [laughter] and you know I quote that sounds like a plan [laughter] yeah\nI Know and and now and and the ... group you know I called them in the book in Russia is very upfront about them doing that they're I mean they're in the process of doing that and they're talking about unveiling some of their stuff soon or using their own that says it's just a fancy way of saying these are robot warriors that have human like brain\nThe question then becomes\nDo you give such warriors the right\nTo make the decision to shoot or not should in other words you give them complete autonomy\nAnd and that is called the Terminator conundrum right now yeah nations are thinking about well gee if we give our robot warriors complete autonomy then that's basically going to make Russians do the same thing and now we're going to be as you said a moment to go in\nWe're going to be now in another escalating arms race\nRight you know ... in some ways you know ... that I often I often think to myself you know all this technology is brand new it's unprecedented but\nWe are just still the same you know all our faults in our foibles and our weaknesses and are downsides just get magnified by this technology the technology doesn't eliminate\nOur weaknesses in our foibles and are downsides you you know what I'm saying to you\nYeah I Do and ... and ... and yet I Would propose to you may be the biggest\nProblem we would face in the law of unintended consequences would dictate the Sarah Connor conundrum\nNot the Terminator conundrum but the Sarah Connor ... which means if you can't win a conventional war because you're over well by the technology\nOf the euro ... you go unconventional and you go gorilla end this creates more terrorism and you know you know I mean\nThat's that's how eventually she was able to beat the I don't want to spoil the ending ... Terminator but you know I mean that's how that's how you know she will one is eventually learning to to you know to go to grill her way out of it not to face the enemy but to be the enemy by you know going\nAnd his weaknesses but but positive person because whenever you mentioned Russian scientists I'm reminded of the story\nAbout the the scientist that want to put a a a a new head an old had on the new body right\nYeah yeah okay or had transplants yeah yeah\nOkay so let's let's pick that up [laughter] that's one of those that's one of those Halloween\nHe kind of moments right there were like All right now there's this is this is one of those nightmare dream things depending on where you are with that I could understand if somebody had um a body that was decaying but their brain was brilliant and you wanted to put it on a new body but then where does that end and how far along are they in that pursuit\nYeah well you know what I've been reporting on that story for some years now and um it began with a small number of scientists um\nWho experimented on monkeys and it gets a little grizzly but this being Halloween okay ah where they yeah they severed monkeys head and then they re attached it\nOr just to prove that they could so there's a lot of plumbing involved right I mean you have to show up the the the the veins in the arteries and the nerves and so forth and so on and they've they've scientists have achieved to a level of success with monkeys and so now embolden\nBy that they are turning their attention to doing it to humans and there's at least one guy and Russia who's been quoted a frequently\nOr who is a quadriplegic or you know otherwise mentally very alert and he says yeah come and do it to me man I'm I'm ready I'm I Want to be that guinea pig and there are scientists who are her were quoted as saying yeah they're going to do it so\nYeah just bringing them into our own home you're talking about the showcasing in\nWhether that's true or not it's entirely possible and I tell the story in the book of a woman who was murdered\nI I don't want to give away the story but she was murdered in the police started looking into\nThe the situation and the husband was I mean one thing he said there was an intruder and how he came in\nHe killed he killed his wife in the basement and we started looking at things and they found she was wearing a

I had to cut you off but we're going to the bottom of the hour and it's a heartbreak so I couldn't\nOn that [noise] oh yeah no\nYou the story of a murder that happened to Connecticut and or the husband claimed one story and the police looked into it his wife was murdered and he claimed one story in [noise]\nWhat the police found was that the woman was wearing a the deceased woman wearing a fit with one of these little smart watches that you know keeps track of your heart rate how are you walk and so forth and so they downloaded the data from the fifth\nAnd they found out that the they could actually get this calculate how many feet she walked and it didn't square with the story from the hospital\nAnd that was I remember that yeah yeah\nThey they won't have soles God didn't make him they will have soles there'll be like zombies there'll be like and I'm like no they weren't so I mean I think some of it as an education piece and and I think that's where great science writing in science journalism in a book like this\nIs really helpful because it really makes clear to people who how complicated these issues are but what's the great benefit or not for us in the long run that's the part I'm I'm focused on myself anyway and I think\nIf you you're you're absolutely right and that is why I wrote the book people can have their own opinions but you have to be well informed in order to have a sense right Kenya right after you read this book you'll have you'll be well informed and then God Bless you with your opinion\nRight and and God Bless you in five years this may be totally irrelevant right because by that\nTime so that you're going to have to write a sequel the end of the world is end of life as we know what let me get to Jason in Portland for Michael Guillen on coast to coast Jason\nYeah they um playing God is kind of baked into I D I F ... when they say that we are created in the image of God that kind of you know is put into\nOur sense then ...\nNow into my question before I get I if I read the uh your schedule right are you going to be talking about the subject of immortality on Tuesday night\nOh coast may be yeah I Will be a great little it'll give it a little plug for an up [laughter] I think you you were\nTalking about immortality and I don't know exactly where it is but in the book of revelation I talk about your mortality and when the wrath of God is or out of a finance high and it says that they will pray\nThat they would die and they were not able to and they asked for the ... mountains in stone to come down and in and cover them up and are they talking about this period that you're talking where we've achieved immortality\nThis is this is an interesting premise again is whether immortality would be a blessing or a curse I'm you know that uh that is the the portrait of Dorian Gray a ... what's your thought on that Michael well\nIt's a it's a I have a couple of thoughts about that and that is number one uh you know obviously as a theoretical physicist and and as a serious minded Christian I'm fascinated by finding a references in the Bible that might give us some glimpse our summer camp\nAs to what what's in store for us and how it jibes or doesn't jibe with what's going on in science I just find that just it's fascinating intellectually fascinating er and and so I I I'd\nLove to think for about this reference to revelation I I think also my other thought is\nYou know do does does a supercomputer and this is this is a kind of a ... of a mental a question or\nA mental experiment that people talk about a lot of it we don't we reach a point where we create an artificial intelligence being whether it's\nIn the form of a big computer server or it's in the in the body of a hunky Alyssa a kind of a role of human like robot but get so complex\nAnd so beyond ... you know has an existence that is beyond the human experience that you cannot unplug it\nYou know it's like that's kinda running it's like\nRunning on on energy that it absorbs from the environment I\nMean that's the horror from saying or for the crush souls of the people in stumps on on you know getting getting itself coffee yeah I get that I think\nThat happens with some of our technology now right after you haven't you ever been in a situation where you know you're you're like try and everything stop you know that that piece of machinery is going great stop stop stop and oh I don't like it and it still goes on you know\nA ... tell me but I spent the last two weeks trying to get a Kenmore elite dishwasher ... so ... that actually was exactly where I'm living and by the way to is somebody with the I mean I have a masters of divinity degree I Would just say\nIt's really interesting about the Bible in this the the only problem is the Bible is multi vocal\nOn the subject of immortality life after death et cetera so it's really great because it creates more conversations but it doesn't always resolve them so deep that my let me go to a let me go to a ... who is in Arizona on coast to coast saying David\nGoing hey my question for me I'm In ... and\nThe ethical and moral conflict created by doing these things artificial intelligence\n[noise] a new one would be the result\nYou keep breaking up dude you're killing that gives it sounds like a really good good [laughter]\nYeah and if they were just losing and we just lost [laughter]\nOh no Well James is in the in the Washington ... trying to him well we still have a minute for Michael Steele and before we go to open lines coming up on coast to coast James\nYeah I uh enjoy your show but uh\nI I've been on and kicking machine going on forty five years I used to hearing ... macular degeneration had like you know from your guest or would you feel that the shoe will be overcome through CRISPR or\nA maybe a genetically modified pigs I'll take my answer off the air\nHang hang in there James hang in there James we need every one of you go ahead Michael\nYeah what what what kind of I didn't get what kind of machine is\nHe's on dialysis is on kidney stones ...\nJust like my friend yeah no I think this is where are the technology really is very hopeful um they they are making enormous strides now uh with restoring people's site with macular degeneration\nActually interviewed a woman who had the operation and you know even though her fight is still not crystal clear she can she can make out shapes and it's given her an enormous amount of independence but we're making enormous strides are already working there's this one company in particular in California I talk about that are already working on a second\nGeneration a that will help actually restore\nSight to people who are born blind not never mind with macular degeneration so I see a lot of hope on that also in the kidney from I don't think we need to create these merits\nA there's a lot of great research and I've reported on off for ABC News and elsewhere where they are now able to create using stem cell or ... it might create a artificial Oregon so\nThat are more tailored for the the person yeah yeah I'm In\nTheir brother is you know that that is really where the technology is

GM Samantha Davidson says at the turn of the century this building space with\nYou that's a form of ... to ... and so so yeah so this could have been a pharmacy and maybe there's no real explanation for why there are goes there but that video\n... especially ... and the fact that we were really got me was because it's a kind of a shop law mandates they can't touch the video so what was it I don't know but if you go and look at it and you want to jump in on open lines of loved to have you let me go to a Mike in Charlotte North Carolina coast to coast to get us started Mike\nAnything good

impossible because we are not charge as do I have to say\nOh it's fair enough I mean I it thanks for calling you know I think the the issue of that sold peace though is a little more complicated so a lot of people would say in it if it's a version if it's forty percent of who you were [noise]\nWhy wouldn't it have a soul if other people out there have you know uh other meant if there are other people who have problems with their mental capacity due to injury or disease [noise] you know we don't say it was suddenly they're less human or that they have less of a soul\nI'm so I'm not I'm with you in theory well I'm with you in theology\nOn soul um but I think it is much trickier question than just saying they wouldn't for sure because that used to be the thing that people said about\nTest tube babies and I think we're we fortunately moved beyond that uh okay let's get to where we get a lot of people standing by which is always fun Aaron is in Richmond, Virginia on coast to coast Aaron\nUm I and world power guys first of all for not for five years I don't want to get through my interest right\nI'm after last night I have a couple of things to say I'm In march ... her saying I'm a revival manner awarded a habit of things he ... that were to survive\nI mean wouldn't even know what to do and that's a fireman now furthermore our current situation right now we have there are a lot of people to sign up\nFirst survival situations and there are a religious groups such as the Mormons who are highly compiling surprise for\nFor years to come for for that is families with multiple wives with multiple shoulder with multiple multiple and um and we don't really we haven't really touch it whether or not we\nAre usable and we don't know even with\nTraining we don't know if\nThe supplies what's known somebody who was in a cave or in a whole or in a ditch or whatever I mean\nSo I Would hurt and or you like to um volunteer myself not to consume companies supplies but just chew on my cell and my child\nEven I hesitate to say my child but I Would like to offer a myself to give her trial like for a year on one of the supplies without training without any\nKnowledge of how to use the supplies to just hear somebody could even\nHis name is Sal\nEditors do you don't really know even with the like Mormon families if there was a huge disaster you don't know who's going to survive it could be a child it could be a twelve year old kid\nWho hasn't had any training on how the year the supplies that are stored up in these codes or or whatever um\nOkay well I think that's a really interesting proposal and I I I just want to because there's a lot of listeners who are\nA latter day saints and so I just really be a clear for people most LDS do not practice plural marriage really overwhelming number of them do but to her point I was watching on Netflix\nOr there's this series called uh like the men with three wives your three wives club or something I don't know\nBut it's about a renegade\nA Mormon sect community and everybody generally in the community has more than one wife and then the following some of these and that's in Utah near Moab\nAnd um and that they they've already talked about saving up than having enough food for these big giant families to last for seven years that's a lot\nI mean and what it even work Kennedy even work I don't know\nA ... but uh yeah so air willing to be a volunteer but um I think the only thing I ever get to bring your kid a done is in a in Kent, Ohio I knew well on coast to coast am done\nRather a I'm happy to have\nA you know I got a kick out of your commercial about the ghost in the pawn shop in the court that was their name with Andy Gomez remember Gomez the monsters yeah\nSure loved them as one

something what is your opinion on that\nWell that's an interesting claim it that that the the marches on purpose or coordinated toward us I mean I\nI think that you'll always see migrations and the good the long history just bring up the Bible again\nBut this is that we're all immigrants read the Bible says that we we all move 'em and that would be you know all of the stories you a lot of the stories we're both from people just trying to get food just trying to move to get food and begging people to allow them to live in in space has food\nSo I kind of see that as a perpetual thing not something new but you know ...\nIs or is there if it that's the smoke screen than what's behind it I guess we're supposed to wonder about or are you suggesting that something is going to come from the

through this is such a great privilege\nIt if I can and I would like to share something a ... about the Bible a and there's a great truth that we need to realize in any discipline uh\nAny discipline that your study whether it be science or whether it be ah the Bible for instance uh you can't just take a a ship if you go to the wealth of knowledge you need to take a big drink\nAnd the and the Bible as something to be studied and pondered over all three of the model the ... religions from the middle east began their roots what the Bible\nAnd polluting the ... the Korean has deep roots in the Old Testament and\n... and the Newton is and the new ... the the current estimate yeah I mean the\nThe story the story of the prophet Jesus and the Koran is is significant it's a it's a big portion of the current\nThat try and ... even the story of the floods the story of Jesus in the ... all of that validates not counting the historical values a historical cruise you know that that line up with a so many of the stores in the Bible\nA mini the many of the critics don't believe that it's even possible for Daniel to be real because\nOf the historical value of the book of Daniel is so accurate and ah and if it hadn't been found and the dead sea scrolls you know they ... they were you know people would have said well it was impossible for Daniel to know as much of the future as he is he did\nBut the crews when you look at the courage there and you look at a big picture\nThe heart the grace of the Old Testament and the New Testament this has done so much for humanity\nYou know oh I agree I agree we yeah we we stray\nAway from that and people and people like to take two or three versus an\nEdge a whole right that's terrible whole book or you know and they'll\nAsk held in and you know it's called proved texting and it's yeah it's\nThere's a there's an old saying I said it before I go ... but as soon as the first in St learned in seminary was that some people\nUm some people rely on a on scripture I'm like a drunk leans on a lamppost not so much for\nThe looming nation but for support and I think it's the illumination part that I always go for another support I like I like it when I find new things that make me think differently and I'll tell you some interesting about the current I don't know if you know it just sounds like you're a learned guy but I did a um I I was writing I wrote an article about\nUm about the true crime texts I'm interested in how true crime stories are told and I was interested in how many troops um how many murder stories there are in the Bible\nAnd that the basis for true crime as we know it today the ... the popular genre on any platform that the basis for that\nStarts in the Bible and that these true crime stories really are these murders stories or or had the same effect they're teaching us a lesson which is what these murder stories still do\nWhen I found was when I looked at um the ways stories were told in the Koran they actually use the word murder\nWith regard to Jesus\nThey where is the Bible says you know in in the Greek portion of the the Bible and the New Testament the Greek word says kill but actually the word that's often used\nUh the Arabic word is the Jesus who was murdered and I find that very a very interesting distinction that that Muslims see that and that's the way they look at it than he was murdered and I don't think murder comes up\nA lot when we think about it in a Judeo Christian context but I'm just throwing that out yet I don't know if they find that interesting or not but I did\nThat that corporate I Want to be careful how I said this do you think that corporate Christianity has a you know or Christianity for higher so to speak where people are wanting to build\nA legacies de do you think that that has hurt us and gotten a so why are from the central message of the Bible in a whole ah\nYeah I think I think your question answers that you know and I think that what we you know I think anytime there's always been the big difference of shooting a bullet in the name of God or taking a bullet in the name of God and I'm I'm In the taking the bullet camp [laughter]\nI'll take the bullet in protecting somebody else I'm a ...\nYou know people go way far onto their way to create these\nStructures were there shooting people killing other people in the name of God and I and that's where I draw the line we enjoyed the conversation the rigging you've got a great town let's get back to her too but\nUm last time I was in a Bowling Green actually and they were doing work I was on my way to the airport in Nashville and I came across it we get to a Charles in Portland, Oregon coast to coast Charles\nAnd good morning how are you today\nGood it's open lines you think is anywhere\nWell let me first start by saying uh I've also been a listener just like read from the coast because to have ... days and uh you are my absolute favorite or a ... second [laughter]\n... bench warmer I'm okay with that\nI I mean nobody can replace man but you know I get the body to wind up on it\nOr do drugs is a great job I'm having a good time uh where do you want to take it as\nA just what you said admitted to a different thing murdering show that's fascinating that's going to be ... that lives with me for a week in the\nIsn't it isn't that just ... and the fact that it's Islam where they say murder the Jesus was murdered yeah that's amazing it really is I don't know I'm ... go ahead\nWell I yeah I wanted to take us back to the Bible um I was telling the screener I'm a I'm\nFor lack of a better term hardcore atheist and everything but ah I Believe in\nIn you know seeing wisdom where you find that I I heard a whole lot of wisdom in the Bible and if you read it at the five ... uh uh I don't see much value but if you look at it is how people were thinking two thousand four thousand years ago\nUm it's fascinating I mean you read genesis and if you\nActually go back and look for you know the garden of heat and you're going to be disappointed but if you look at it is you know what separates humans from the animal knowledge of good and evil how to spell for action and how how people we're dealing with that that fundamental truth back then and um\nYou know they were putting your own poetry behind it but they were saying this is what separates humans from animals and how you know how do you\nBalance good meat but once you understand it you know a cougar doesn't understand good and evil wouldn't eat something you know it it it only does what it does and an animal does what it does and thankfully but as soon as yourself reflect of your human\nYeah and it's really interesting yeah I think this is and I ... I you know I I I probably had\nFriends there's a lot of lot of people I Know who go to church to hide from God because they really they think like a roof over their head in the church is\nSomething that ... dealing a like a screen like some sort of force field is going to protect them and and outside of a church I think they're atheists they walk around like you know and I so I think I think always exploring and thinking is but it's better to be bold about what you are and what you believe in and looking for value and I\n[noise]\nOvernight tonight falling back into the upper forties when

I'm more in line with the Quakers and I stayed with the idea of um\n[noise] the beginning of an age and when they get the current age began disagreement about\nThat as well yeah ours is that I'm going to determine I'll go ahead I'm Sorry\nNo no no you're you're bringing I'm just commenting on your question is you go along ... yes I think there's a lot of debate about what age we're in or is this is this comes at the same argument gets made about modernism and post modernism Marxism Neal Marxism and you know all we could ever do is the arise [noise]\n'cause we can't there's no there's no met a\n... data so that we can tap into that explains oh no no you tripped into the age of Aquarius in the year ... so yeah I think all we can do is we ... we I think we use that to try to make sense ... of of periods of history\nAnd it it just it makes it it gives us a frame for what something that just otherwise it'd be completely ... the way for us to try to understand\nThe time period in which we live I I spend a lot I mean I can remember this conversation about the aquarium Bible cause I've looked it up several times and\nAnd it's very interesting I mean I don't I don't have any argument for or against it just sort of like it is sort of exists out there especially the part about that period of time the missing so called years um because there's a lot of different books that address that I don't want that they all tell the same story though do you\nI don't know I'm not familiar with all the ... the only one I'm familiar with it covers ... years\nI'm a good wanted a wrap it up quickly a lot I could go with you about this book I wanted to say um I I agree with what you're saying I respectfully disagree with something you said earlier with different color your I'm Talking about live along the lines of\nIt you you appreciate the freedom we have a we we all worship something you know whether it's money or her materialism or whether it's got him or herself um\nThat we really appreciate that freedom is just that you should stay there for you to worship\nYour way I I I appreciate that but I also think that there's a downside as a as a\nSure I have an edge because you know we have this freedom but we don't always use it responsibly oh yeah we have a responsibility not your health individually but can we collectively\nCouldn't agree more to have some kind of shared values every\nThat oh yeah well I mean we don't people make a big so I hear all get minor league political here I I think what holds us together as a\nCountry is\nA I I I don't fixate on borders I understand the importance of security I'm I'm On board with that\nBut what people talk about each the border that makes us a country that's just not true you know it's not the border that makes me in Arizona in or write or soon to be a a cans and it's not like we didn't cross the border that exist on a piece of paper\nAnd I think what holds together our values and that's what I fear most that you know we could have there could be more we need to concentrate on that more and back to a previous caller who said we got to teach more philosophy\nAnd we ought to we aren't philosophy should be where every education START I agree with that but it's those shared values especially the ones on which the founding fathers based the entire country I think that's\nWhat we need to always focus on that's the that's the most important things other things are also important that is to me the most important thing gosh well I learned a lot\nAh for people who don't find it interesting pardon the bladder but gosh darn it that was great\nThank you so much for jumping in an open lines and look forward to borrow night so the most elusive serial killer in history\nAnd you'll be shocked and in fact the author\nVery well might have solved this case\nLet him make that decision I Want to think a George ...

that I think you will love hear the story of the men from the train\nOr as scary as a story is um it's still not as scary in some respects as some of the things that are happening in science and that's why Michael dealing with Glenn joined us just a minute a couple of things in crypto news tonight though there is a strange\nCloud on Mars and\nIf you go to coast to coast am dot com you can find out more about that story that may come up when we go to open lines in the third and fourth hours of the show also the ah the story about the small town which claims to be the most haunted place

carousel\nOn the top of the website it goes to ... am dot com and that's this string of play a little bit of it here give me a heads up on it 'cause I'd love to get back to this coming up later on in the show rolled in\nDowntown Oregon City there are there it's just like at least that's the theory\nBehind paranormal activity witness that science erode trees candidates dispensary behold if you dare this surveillance video from August watched the glass tipped John counter slowly it starts to move that Andy Gomez next to it\nI feel capitals positive here for a new we'll just get back to that later on but you can go see the whole story and coast to coast am to come and look at\nThe video and then try to explain that coming up later on okay how does that jar move on its own and then the thing with the pencils I I don't know\nYour ... believe me there's there's a lot to talk to a and about coming up on coast to coast am and we'll start with Michael Guillen who is here the end of life as we know it\nNews from the frontiers of science is his new book but you might know him better from an ABC News or from the History Channel where he hosts the show or from his other books including a novel they'll know prophecy a he's in LA guy or you are you a dodger's fan Michael\nWell uh you know what I grew up rooting for the Dodgers are but I spent a lotta years in Boston\nHarbor day I was gonna say my son was born involved here and I don't know I'm kind of caught between a rock and a hard [laughter] I understand that that's why I asked ... uh\nUh later on a ... you are obviously you you achieve great heights both in academia and in media and you\nAre amongst I think in elite group of science reporters people who actually write nonfiction about science in into very accessible way um I we put you in the same category as Mary Roach are you a fan of hers\n[noise] you know I I I I'll be honest with you I'm not familiar with Mary\nRoach oh you're missing missing a terrific how me and she's a she's a frequent guest year and they're very very entertaining and she writes I'm always about science and so she lives to explore particular subjects and so her book on for example what happens to the body after we die called stiff\nOr ... or packing for Mars in which she talked to she tried to learn what it'd be like to go to Mars and all the things that would happen if she is very I Love it\nYou know she's grey and you'd really like her and it's just very kind of ... it was reminiscent to me a little bit on how you were getting into the subject because you handle it with a very\nUm [noise] a very non scholastic approach it's the science is there but um anybody can follow these stories and everybody probably should if you want to get a glimpse into what the future\nIs all about this what else to be a great gift for for Christmas if you if you have a a young scientist and you're on your list them urban old scientist for that matter but looking ahead you know if you'll pardon the pun I was just talking about Larry King and he was he was talking about he he believes he's a big believer\nIn cryogenic yeah there are a lot you know there's also that famous baseball connection with Ted Williams family in ... and\nBut I mean I what what is the science these days on something like that and how realistic is this would disappear for somebody like Larry King do hope that he will be able to come back again and take his place behind home plate and if you are\n[laughter] well first of all thank you for the kind words I I have spent my entire life communicating science I Try to make it as interesting as I can you know I spent fourteen years at\nA ABC News as you indicated good morning America twenty twenty Nightline and you know you have to have to make things interesting or they'll give you the hook basically [laughter] a credit cut my teeth on that\nAs far as cryogenic says concerned you know it's interesting you bring that up and I covered the cryogenic story over the years\nAh you know they're in the stories that are Walt Disney had his head a frozen and ah with with the hope one day of of being brought back to life the head being the most important part because it carries our memories are thought and so forth and so on\nBut you know I got to be honest with you that's like old school um what I ... in the sense that\nNow with what's going on with robotics and so forth ... saw it more likely that um\nWhat Larry King is going to want to do is you know before he kicked the can\nUh you know he's going to want to upload all his thoughts and memories or onto a super computer and then downloaded onto a very realistic rope so that Larry King [laughter] can ah can remain behind home plate you know indefinitely into the future but I'm Serious\nYou know in in my book um the end of life you know what I deal with these four big topic areas or the first is the worldwide Web the second is artificial intelligence robots that third has to do with privacy and surveillance technology and the fourth has to do with genetic engineering so\nBetween genetic engineering and artificial intelligence robot man I'm telling you Larry King is going to be around for a long long\nAgo and I was reading some of those sections and I thought that was interesting because there really as you said when he was very I think you mentioned like ... once the book and there's not a big emphasis on it but\nThere is still this hope that people have about preserving their accents and and then that becomes a course a full debate about what we're is the seat of the essence of us you know we used to think the soul was the heart and the head contained all of the you know the the computer works but\nBut how realistic is it ever in any near future that we would be able to upload thoughts in dreams like you might expect from Minority Report being able to capture them and then put them into something else\nI think it's very real or in I mean you know and and and you indicated about my book being about the future but but the truth of it is it's really about what's going on right here and right now even as we\nSpeaking in labs all over the world uh I tell for example the story of Ilan mosque or being very very involved well you know he's involved in driverless cars he's involved in outer space and going to Mars and so forth and so on but he's also got his finger in this whole neural net\nAnd finally um I met this girl this girl came into my life and she challenged me to read the Bible and I was interested in like ... or not I I just thought it was just too familiar to prosaic but anyway it's changed but it was a game changer me I don't want to get into all of it so I became a man of faith faith I'm a
