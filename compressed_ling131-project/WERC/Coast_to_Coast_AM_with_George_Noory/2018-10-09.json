I I find that the one person in twenty ... doesn't believe that\n[laughter] that may be more that that may give us a lot more than ... ... ... it's very little suggests the machine\nWhat do you know through their accidents are absolutely you know you had to blow up because single one was um transposed with\nI I always transposed with a zero so a lot of our systems are quite brutal and that is very true you know if you\nHad a um an airline pilot has a heart attack and that's one airplane for people I think you've got the copilot right but if you if you have a computer fly\nA network computer fly all the airplanes and it has a heart attack luck I [laughter] yeah that that may\nPropagating or our systems may be much much more parental much one better they may get big while he's now that being said they haven't done that yet and\nAnd we come you know we're better now I think a reading goes south where did that we were a few years back\nWhen you lean in the ... and and just really the incredible gross this kind of technology\nYou know is it the humane [laughter]\nThe main thing that you will for technology is it's actually finally working\nOr even the term was calling to Nineteen fifty six by a man in the car McCarthy and uh you got together with a few of the computer scientist and they said you know we work really hard we can solve artificial intelligence at one summer a very interesting reason which was\nNew you know three laws of planetary motion magnetism laws of physics laws electricity very few simple laws that explain everything and they hope to find out what the delicate we did\nThat being said people got excited about a bunch of money came and everybody was disappointed by being tried out all the people you know took a nap for ten years then there was a breakthrough more funding everybody\nA winter it kept going well now for the first time in space up her three separate space up his race up space it's delivering the glitz it can it if you're on the basis it can make probably any department in your business ... past super ... better ... percent more profitable\nOr it can it can do all of these things you couldn't do before and so we're never going to have another one of those winters we now\nHave the technology that we know how to do some cool if there weren't you know ... and they are ah we probably twenty five years worth of stuff just to apply what we know today to the world but of course we're going to have you know work that says ah they they kind of like speed almost\nJust amazing now we ever have a series of artificial intelligence soldiers by the millions sending them into warfare\nIn battle [laughter] it's a fantastic question um [laughter]\nArtificial intelligence the simplest definition is it's a system that response which have gotten so long and it's a kind of artificial intelligence if it were a program it is if something weighs more than fifty pounds explode that's a very rudimentary [laughter]\nRudimentary or if somebody came out with a landmine hypothetically that it was a camera and it can make sure it's somebody wearing a puppy or\nCarrying a gun\nShop you would say well that's that's bad or isn't it and then if you say well it can also sniff forgotten powder and you know we can do for other things to make sure it's blowing up the right person you say well that's I guess that's better right\nAnd you you eventually get your way all the way to um if you could ask you to to an artificial intelligence that fights wars and instead of um\nThere is there is a quote debate about whether we're going to make a ton of his killing systems I think it's disingenuous the debate in this I personally think it's disingenuous I think you've got twelve or Thirteen countries that are ... that have significant military budgets that are spending money on these systems and no one of them can say\nYou know I like the other guys all have it but I'm not going to do it I just don't think that's going to happen or the south Koreans came out with the forty million dollar\nAutomatic gun turrets that I'm sure people when it gets that's automatically and it's required by law to say you know leave before shoot\n'em and it requires a person to approve firing but uh they only because people request and somehow or it could easily be turned off so even if you make decisions require people can make killed decisions\nYou always disabled so I think it's inevitable that we're gonna for better or whatever you think that we're going to build a weapon systems\nSpin out\nWell for for three very easy reasons you can argue there the better the more effective it their mission and there'll be lots of collateral damage wherever they are you argue that you will be saving lives of soldiers ...\nOr ... whatever country you are and and you know they will they will work and be effective uh probably cost effective will enable unfortunately what were the political cost going to war which uh is is not not necessarily a good thing [laughter]\nWell it may not be a good thing but in the long run we don't do what some other country will [laughter]\nAre absolutely absolutely I'm just saying that it isn't necessarily good for all nations to feel like oh well let's just these weapon systems fighting each other it doesn't really matter and and you know which has caused a then perhaps it's entered into more rationally\nI mean I Do you see the dean though by run that now we're coming up to the top of the hours just to stop when we come back next hour but you know we've got drones delivering packages were talking about artificial cars with driverless cars you see the day that you know all\nThe entire post office system will be done because they'll deliver and

human are we interested in and we only need you to be a machine that we invented\nA is delivering the mail or or delivering packages something like that I could imagine a machine that did it I could imagine a machine that washes windows I can imagine machine that automatically most my yard and so I think by definition we kind of want to get machines to do those things that [noise] [noise]\n[noise] no but but if you take a step back these technologies this country for two hundred and fifty years as ... as high unemployment between five and ten percent all the time except the depression which wasn't caused by technology five\nTo ten percent but but I think the half life of a job is fifty years I think every fifty years off of the jobs vanish and so you have to say how have we had full employment [noise]\nNew technology ... years right and we had rising wages and because so why are we able to\nDo it it's we're able to do it because a new piece of technology comes out of

Hooper a Google Amazon you wouldn't have seen any of the million companies that were made so\nThat these technologies are the same way you it's easy to say that jobs going to go away it's hard to see the better job that's\nCreated and what happens is every body [noise] Everytime technology makes a great job and destroys bad job everybody kind of ships up one level\nIf you had a robot that was a waiter and delivered food to you you get a tip that I'm not [noise]\nI don't I hear the waiter wonder why I don't I don't think a robot can do a what a way to do you know they use spell a drink\nYou know the robot cat a clean it up that would take you know tons of programming there you have a special order you want you want to send your foot back or something you didn't like about it you have a question about where the radishes were I mean there are so many things it's it's funny we we\nWe have every human on this planet has ten thousand skills then thousand things you can do\nAnd then we have this vision that if you can do those ten thousand things and you can do estate planning than your high skilled otherwise you're low skilled but in reality every human being is incredibly high skilled we don't have robots that can\nThey can do what a two year old can do let alone and an adult yeah so well the correct correct but it's proved very difficult like right now I heard somebody say if there was ever a robot uprising just wait Fifteen minutes all their batteries there'll be dead 'cause we can't even you know make batteries that the power these things for very long\nSo right now heads down and and I think for for decades to come\nUh people are going to you're not going to make machines that had the same range of movements are are going to have a robot electrician who comes in and look at your house over figures out where to punch your well out to run the wires it's just way beyond [noise]\nYou know when I called my airline of choice [noise] and it tells me you know say your number I'm happy when it gets that right when it doesn't get a an agent ate all mixed up so that's kinda wherever that um [noise] but like you said that you know yet um\nAnd that's it and that sort of big yet because one day at the progression we're going we're going to get there\nWell ... ... with physical robots maybe that's true it's an open question on intelligence it's an open question whether a computer can be creative with a computer can\n... it may be that that you have to experience the world in order to do a lot of the things we have and it's it's unclear that computers will be able to do it and let me let me say a real quick thing about our brains you know we have these brains that we don't really understand and then we had these mines which is kind of all the things the brain does that we\nCan't really explain like I have a sense of humor you know your liver doesn't have a sense of humor but some of your brain does and then we have consciousness and people think we don't understand the brain 'cause it's just so stinking so many neurons but people have spent Twenty years working on something called the open worm project\nTo try to take this little worm he's got three hundred and two neurons in his brave they spent Twenty years trying to modeled out of the computer just take a worm that lives in a computer with a brain of three hundred new neurons and even among the people have been working on it they're not even sure it's possible\nSo there are so many we're we're so spectacularly amazing uh beings that that to duplicate what we do with the machine\nIs you know ... one leading a researcher said worrying about those kinds of things like worrying about overpopulation on Mars yeah maybe some day we'll have to worry about overpopulation of Mars but it's like that far out\nSo you call your book to for the age because you believe we've had three ages week already going way back but tell me about this\nSo we learned this trick humans did which is technology which is multiplying what we were able to do\nAnd and we've used it\nTo overcome scarcity because for law of human history there's just never been enough of the good stuff never in a food and medicine never enough of any of the good stuff but we learned this trick technology and sometimes we learned something so big and knew that it just changed their productivity of humanity forever\nAnd the first of these was a hundred thousand years ago I think it was language that's this thing we do where we coordinate action about what it means is that you know twelve humans working together you know man of was a match for us anymore 'cause 'cause we could all communicate and the man it's couldn't\nUm then the second one I think is when we got agriculture and that actually wasn't the big deal\nBecause agriculture give us the city and the density gave us a division of labor\nAnd the division of labor says you know you specialize I specialize and we're all better off because of it so agriculture indirectly gave us prosperity and that changed everything we have prosperity\nAnd then the third time things changed I think it was five thousand years ago when we got two technologies coincidentally at the same moment we got the wheel and we got writing and when those two things happened uh you invented the nation state and that's why five dollars and years ago you can kind of shut your clock by it all over the world\nA giant sort of sanctions emerge ... Mesopotamia missile America and just go all over the world and so I Do think that\nUm that artificial intelligence and robots are another thing of that magnitude if you if you actually can take human thought and put it in a machine and human action and put it in a machine and and and multiply us both you know we're number one on this planet 'cause we are the smartest thing on it\nImagine if you can just make us a whole lot smarter [noise] I don't I Can't predict what that's going to what's that's going to do but it's going to be a big one\nWell we know for example that machines called 'em robots or revolutionize the automobile industry with mass production I mean they they did things faster than humans can I'm coming from St Louis I've been in in in ... Bush factory and\nI see how they bottle beer or by the thousands in the bottles humans can't do it that fast or you're ...\nYou're right that's already Fishell intelligent and it is to be\nFrightening if if you saw if you were a skilled crafts person and you saw unskilled people making more stuff better and cheaper than you like how purifying once that and yet we don't look back and said that was a bad thing do we\nKnow not at all not at all and has displaced workers probably you can't have a million workers are simply not bottles by hand\n[noise] right and yet we never had unemployment and uh you know we never had unemployment along that time you also had an interesting phenomenon that from Nineteen forty call it to Nineteen eighty\nNews radio nine sixty W we are ...

GDP did go on a fault just like he thought so why are we still working all these hours and what it turns out is that if you want to live\nThe way somebody lived in Nineteen thirty\nBel Air

we save at home I'm with labor saving devices\nWhere do you see this fifty years from now by this technology\nUm [noise] I I think that question I ask earlier which is you know if you can imagine a

in a very direct honest kind of person that when I started telling these stories and they couldn't help but believe even if they were kind of on the fence because they're like way you would make this up\nYou know you're the you're the nerd we wouldn't be [laughter]\nAnd you know and I would say Ninety nine point nine percent of the people have kind of gone with me on the journey um I I think that the very small you know point zero one percent um you know they they just they can't make their way over right\nTo our nine that's right um but I'll tell you at least half if not more than half the people that when I started telling them one of my stories they could interrupt me fast enough to tell me there's [noise]\nAnd I realized you know during this time that I was kind of thinking about you know put it writing it all down like oh my gosh people don't want to come out about this like there in the closet\nThey're afraid to tell these stories because they're afraid that they're going to sound like they're crazy which is one of the reasons I actually wanted to write the book was so you know people could feel liberated to just to tell their you know talk about their experiences because\nThere's so many people have had him and I also wanted them to you know I wanted to write it so people also will believe in themselves and believe that it's actually happened and not you know their their brain playing tricks on them or something\nWell what's so amazing to is that the people are all into this and like you said not a lot of um admit it but once they feel comfortable with you or somebody who is gone through the same thing they open up\nOh my gosh they talk your ear off and you know just just for your listeners then because I Am a nerd do you mind if I roll through just a couple of stats for them yeah go ahead because I you know when this started happening to me um I didn't know a lot about it you know I didn't understand\nUm a lot about what really anything about goes

it scared the heck out of me um I actually want to I'd open a like a ghost portal because you know I Do live in the world of movies so everything in my life I think about tends to get exaggerated when it's like oh my gosh he goes well holder guys what am I done\n'em and and then I started the aging you know the house the perimeter everything um and kept taking photographs and I now have a crazy

Adam and Eve away from God and today\nIt get scratched out of the book of life and so clearly he's done a nice guy right so my theory and it's just a theory that's all it's a theory is that you know if you subscribe to the idea that we're spirit having a human experience\nThat when we sleep it's our physical body that needs to sleep not our spirit spirit goes off and parties and the actual face I'm sure many people have talked to about the actual planes\nAnd you know what our spirit is getting ready to land back into our body I think what happens is that it doesn't fully land and there's like this little space\nAnd I think that's a little space before it lands properly and you are a line on is when this can happen again it's just a theory\nWhich are pretty good it's not terrible so I really consider it more of a spiritual condition than I Do a medical condition and it's not that people who have at our bad because you know what\nThe light doesn't need more light or the dark doesn't need more dark but dark needs a lot you know the the the darkness one flight\nSo I think it's you know people are are these bright lights that I think that this entity kind of makes its way and and I don't really want to spoil for folks 'cause I I Hope people will read the book I'm\nA at what happened that last time that alec saw the ... man because of that is probably the most profound event that has happened in my entire life\nWould you want to duplicated duplicate that experience yeah yeah I could handle it now you would really yeah I could would you couldn't\nUm it was um oh let me just tell them\nI just tell your audience what happened what I'll do it if you want me to George is like\nRight I'll tell him we have a couple of minutes of use with something that's the blackout oh I'm Sorry\nIs when you say you're going to tell us\nOh yes Oh yes so I have I but I just tell everybody instead of is the thing about them having to read the book to find out because what happened was that Alex called me in one night and said I saw\nThat man again and and he spoke to me\nWhat he said to me was how her my name is Ron\nAnd I went he he said what he said\nHow her my name is wrong because I noticed that the message for you and I said yeah that's the name of my ex step dad who was not very nice cheese and I said and he's trying to scare me away from you\nYou think that was him\nI don't think it was my accept that but I think it was the ... man who knows\nI Would say a lot about a lot of people fair to say um but I think that you know if anybody tries to if if there's any darkness that is trying to scare either going to find that thing that triggers you right there I find that deep dark thing they're going to find who is the antagonist and this person's life\nAnd mine is my accept that and and he brought that up and Alex didn't didn't even know about my accept it didn't even know his name\nWhen all this was happening [laughter] we went weird yeah I mean\nAre you under control which now I mean do you feel as if you're in control of what's happening I\nI Am I Am I Am I Am now because I now understand that I Am in charge I completely\nUnderstand that I Am also I've become fearless\nUses the photography all ... it's almost like that's the hobby will you do the ...\nYou know that goes photography and um and uh and storytelling it would be considered um the inciting event it's it's that event is what triggered all this other stuff to happen and the\nPhotography with you know a little scary at first because I it's weird it's\nIt's it's weird there's no doubt\nUh do you know the subject matter is or you are these random ...\nUm [noise] I Do have a picture of my mother has passed um I didn't include it in the book because it felt a little too

they do yeah no I I don't know that all of them are there is some of them um you know I feel like I've gotten a few that looked like they had a rough time the last time they and their bodies\nLike a guy looks like he's been beat up a woman who looks like she's very sad maybe that's how he died it could very well be could very well do they talk to you you know I'm after a while and after I got
