then so as you tell us about the origins of Halloween it\nReally does have a um an interesting history very rich in history um it's silly it's scary and gets the panic in gets kind of crazy I enjoy watching\nThe ah television shows around that time the Halloween and that were the fun ones the little peanut characters that's always fun with the great pumpkin and all that kind of stuff\nUm but that like the fun ones and I like when people dress up you know like the vampires and the Frankenstein I like the really good scary stuff\nAnd he went to the the um the police saying that the ... the he'd found like a needle in in a Snickers bar or something and it turned out that he put that in their himself\n... and ... when the police busted him he said well I was trying to make sure the kids knew not to trust strangers\nYeah not to trust you exactly I\nWas just such an offensive of like the first of all the you know the whole stranger danger thing is really it's really played on the fact is that most people are good most people don't want her kids at all and you know and\nOf course every year they X ray candies and it's I mean whatever if if it makes me I wanted for her but\nI wanted to ask you that are they still doing that I remember you know it was always go X ray your candy I mean really do you do people really go to the emergency rooms where they really sick ... you know people are really sick needing to get in and do they take the time to x-ray that did that really happened\nIt occasionally does happen and I know that because uh I I used to live in Buffalo and I remember there would be occasional announcements and it was also I'm a dentist office they would say you know come to the dentist office actually at the candy\nAnd and I followed that for several years again I I Would I Would pay attention to the news stories and I'd follow up and say did you guys actually finding anything in the candy and the answer was almost all you know\nFor something like you know it's it's a piece of candy if you have any any doubt throw it out you don't yeah I don't\nNeed to wonder whether there's something in the candy if if there's any reason at all you think its dubious you don't need to make but just toss it in a way I just the whole thing is just silly\nNow my dad would go through it\nAnd say well let me let me look through the candy make sure it's okay but he did it just so that he can steal stuff that he wanted\n[laughter] where where are the ethics\nHere was you know we need to go back to the days when people are ... for soles of of of you know purgatory this ... you know\nThis was something here\nWell what we did the\nYou know sometimes I always think you know like little Linus commercialism when it comes to like a Christmas when did the haunted house has come out because you know those are cool and everything however it was it primarily for money is it all these raises money right\nNo no that that's a great question you know originally you know of course originally that the the when when people begin first making disguised as I mentioned it was originally an Irish thing it it was primarily districts with the British Isles\nAnd then it came over with the with the first and second we use of the of the ah the immigrants to the United states\nAnd in fact you we mentioned little while ago about some of the conservatives getting upset about it the Puritans I'm In New England or who of course are you know part of the uh the witch trials they have they were they were dead set against Halloween and that was that was a ...\nPope abomination [noise] um and so that for for so certainly for for for many years I'm a court before there was mass marketed commercialized stuff\nUm you know you couldn't go to the local store you know Halloween spirit store and get a a teenage mutant ninja turtle mask so your people were having to be creative you know point though you'd actually have families coming together to make a kid's costume\nAnd what you find is that the first um the ... the first record that I found of Halloween masks are really emerged in about the Eighteen seventies so it really dates back over a hundred years\nI'm uh they weren't they weren't of course you know as ornate ... plastic molded and stuff\nBut what's happened that over over the decades as as you know as marketing is turn Halloween into you know a much more of a commercial enterprise and you know it's it's ... it's become commercialized for for better or for worse\nAnd this is when you start getting adults who are you know doing the the elaborate which costumes and you know the the you know [noise] the the sexy police officer costumes or the drag\nYeah\nAnd of course as soon as you have mass marketing then you have a you know you have the princess is right you have Cinderella you have peanuts and you have all that sort of stuff and so you know that that's fine I mean but I like you I I sort of ... I have a sweet spot for for homemade costumes that really creative and not just you know something with a mask slapped on it\nYeah it's fine for sure and so you know you talk about the history of it we now basically what goes on now so how do you see since you studied it so much and you really continue to to to do that how do you see the future of Halloween how do you see it in about ten years Twenty years Thirty years\nWell ... ... s really good question you know I think that um you know\nHalloween mentioned I mean it's it's it's very much wrapped up in tradition and folklore and stuff and all these things changed right I mean we've we've talked about two or three different incarnations of Halloween going back to to win and then you've got the mixing it with all saints day in office all day and and you know we with each\nInteract with each you know a couple of generations it changed a bit\nUm and I think that um I think it's probably going to remain more or less the same for the time being a you have had occasional places where people taking it too far\nIn Detroit for example it's it's known as hell night I mean there's the other like ours and stuff it's like a scary scary stuff going on um but for the most part you know most people keep it keep it pretty simple I think that that there is asserting innocence about it\nBut I think he's really appealing again it's not it's not Easter it's not Christmas it's not tied to a particular religion it's\nIt's something that anybody of any of any uh of any faith and creed hum ... who does like address how we all like to dress up right I mean eight year old kid was just an eighty year old kid like dress up and so it's there's something that is I think just inherently\nA humanistic and fun and and I don't think that's going to go away and\nUm you know it's still going to be knocking on doors and national for candy or you know I don't think it's going to change dramatically in the next ah in the next you know twenty or fifty years or you could you know who knows maybe two hundred years from now a ... there'll be a sort of you know virtual a go if you know where you've\nGot like holographic oh you've got to that you got to say that he was laid the giant thing that would be cool\nThat's right that's what's going to be knocking at your door and that'll be cool All right so we're talking with Benjamin Radford origins of Halloween we're going to ask them about this the panic part of it when we come back stay with us you are listening because because I Am I'm kind of you will as Andy says we'll we'll tonight\nNever missed a detail on a show or a guest sign up for the ... ... email newsletter available for free at ... dot com\nFish signals I Bob Carson ripping discovery bottles new advances in science and engineering from the national Science Foundation\nIt's as if these fish and I am each other only instead of a tiny British Boehner other divide the every many director pulses to keep up with a B a best best fish friends and to navigate\nCertain fish one commonly referred to as a baby whale I've developed a unique security system produces incredibly short pulses\nOf electricity a few tenths of a thousand ... second but what's been communicated navigate while the looting but highly sensitive electric detection systems major predator catfish\nEvolutionary trick mid researchers University of Texas at Austin in Michigan State song might shed light on human illnesses seems fish ... rely on a protein also bonding hearts of muscles of humans the team believes we learn from the origin and mechanics\nOf is signaling ability could apply to the treatment of epilepsy where electrical pulses in brain and muscles cause seizures their findings could also give us insights on migraines and some heart conditions also related to electrical signals and their pathways sounds like the electric fish are giving\nUs a message to\nDiscover more than a dog and go find Bob Carson on news radio one oh five five W.

E. R. C.\n\n\n[noise]\nCounty Willis here on coast to coast am our gas tonight on Willis wean is Benjamin Radford we've been talking about the origins of Halloween\nAnd uh oriented ... we are also by the way because he's a science based paranormal investigator he goes all over the world and investigate all sorts of great things great mysteries that we all love\nSo uh and he writes a lot of books his last book was on actually um investigating\nUm goes goes hunting stuff so let's say I want to talk a little bit more about the origins of Halloween and some of the areas and then I Want to talk about his book because it's very interesting stuff in there I think you guys are going to like and you know it works with the will of saline theme of goes tiny so Ben\nI'm as we talk about Halloween I Want to make sure you say everything that you wanted to say about it but I Want to know about that let's say panic part of it\nI mean it can really can get pretty evil with some people as much as I like the orange and black and the which isn't it you know and the Frankenstein and the Iraqi like kind of almost like the bubble gummy kind of\nHalloween that's what I like sure um but then there's this deep darkness in St panic part where people really do get creepy and scary\nWell yeah I mean it's one little thing for I mean there's always going to be a certain segment of the population that take things too far right there's always going to be you know some some creep in some you know a mall haunted houses you know reached out and grab the crow somebody or whatever I mean it's there are some of that but\nBut you know that's for every one of those examples or you know there's you know hundreds and hundreds of other people who who just you know have a good time with it\nUm you know I mean as I mentioned before you know so and was not you know there's there's nothing the panic about it a lot of conservatives cause a candidate because of its roots with with with pagan ritual\nBut you know the the ancient a health I mean they they they they didn't worship anything\nResembling the Christian devil at all I mean they if you drink when if you ask them you know if you told them about some some horn goat creature that you know the the evil they wouldn't have the idea what you're talking about it wasn't it wasn't part of the world view\nAnd and again you know the ... festival died out long before um before you know that the the Christian concept of of of\nA seating and all that sort of came up and so what you find is that you know there there's there's tradition of course I mean you look at exit is coming to Eighteen you know ... not suffer which to live\nUm and so there's a there's a strong tradition in in being concerned rightly or wrongly about a a cult influences right so this is fine uh this is of course not just Halloween that's that's one of the more\nUh obviously comes up every every year in coming up every year but I mean for example we saw the same thing in the Nineteen eighties with a concern over dungeons and dragons\nI'm and role playing games and heavy metal music and and ... and ... um I was up in a way to go to ... and a couple of years back up at the heart of St James hotel in northern New Mexico\nAnd I was there during investigation and looking to go in and on the wall I I'd never seen that before I have a I have a photo of it is it a point you board or strictly prohibited anyone using a ... will be kicked off the property\nAnd it was just it was just so interesting I mean the the owner or so\nSo concerned that using the ... board was going to open up you know demonic corals or whatever I I I agree with that one\nBut it didn't say what was interesting was was that it was it was codified on a wall and I'd never seen that like you know in the room you know sign this don't use it and so you know typically the\nConcern is uh it's about kids because again as I mentioned for for most of most Halloween it wasn't\nIt wasn't centered around kids or was it was something that mostly you know adults and and and you know teenagers did you know whether it's a bobbing for Apple's are doing trick or treating but beginning in the Nineteen fifties\nThat twin because it was centered on kids that were the concern came from and so it was ... and that a kid the dresses up as a which are of goal\nWill become interested in witchcraft or wicker or the cold because of that and that's that's basically the foundation for that and so this is why a lot of times um the the\n... parents who are concerned about that um they do a couple of things one of them is they have instead of a Halloween party have a harvest party\nSo they they they they they make a case to distinguish it from home and this is our way into harbors party but there's lots of similar stuff and of course they'll they'll you know parents were concerned about that they'll have the kids dressing up as princesses or something instead of anything that might be you know darker scary\nIt's so interesting because um you know everybody has their views and their opinions and and uh you know in in everything\nBut I just um I just remember as a kid levine that it was\nIt was like a fun scary and it was you know creepy and like I said again you know black lights and the\nUh we were um and I grew up in Louisville, Kentucky and one of the local radio stations at W. H. A. Y. was wacky and they had the wacky haunted house and it was\nIt was what your bigger brothers would take you to you know as a kid and it got to be a family event and everybody would be there and it was the coolest thing of all is one of the biggest advance like in the country I mean even though all the radio people still remember this from from back then it was all wacky haunted house there was nothing nothing\nHere it was all so much fun back then everybody had a good time you'd be dressed up a it was fun to be scared you laugh and then you go home and the next day you know that was that you eat candy for awhile and sometime you still had that candy when it came to Christmas and just lay allies write that down the marathon\nBars amount either right away I assume doing those\nHuge freeze those have you ever had um frozen\nThey were great a hundred and you're just taking you back your love is\nSomebody needs to a grand that recipe and make those again I don't know why they ever stopped because you knew that everybody loved marathon bars my gosh\nYeah they were and they came and that was like a red and black rapper written\nOr something yeah and the ruler on the back oh man I I mean anything Googled after we're done here\nAnd uh and uh I I didn't know that um that uh what's his face was last seen McGregor so I I I learned that tonight in fact if I weren't here talking to you I'd probably be watching the fight\nThere you go it's gone now is there any way\nYeah Yup yup yup never on all the producers were were watching that hey you guys are going on the air now still well knowing all the origins of Halloween talking about the the past and even what you think about the future and the same kind of part and all that good stuff\nNow another element and some people

author and one of his latest book is called investigating dose and it's um\nThen that means that by definition there the material because we you know sound is Adia waves and and you know hitting the eardrum and stuff and so you can pressing audio waves and so\nSo that's that means that they can be recorded\nUm on on you know audio tape and and and and digital things and so so you know when we're looking at the different technologies that are used to detect ghost for the most part they are ones that the replicate what we can experience right we were all we can see what we can hear and those sorts of things\nUm and so there's really no reason that I can see why we shouldn't have better evidence of ghosts because people do report seeing them people record you know if they're recording them\nUm and you know then you get into things like you know enough detectors ... electric ... feel detectors and the problem is that there is no good scientific evidence linking ghost PMS um there's there's theories and there is speculation\nBut but no one has ever proved that you know that a location with high EMS um correlates with with ah with go siting there was a guy named Michael person you're a who tried to do some stuff with something called the got home it uh\nAnd that wasn't really replicated and so there's lots of pseudo science and sort of want to be science\nOr in goes hunting and that's one thing that frustrates me because I think those are cool [laughter] I think looks are awesome and if they're real than I Want to I Want to be able to find them improve them but I just don't see I don't see a good quality research going on and that's one of the reasons I wrote the book\nAnd and I don't want a you know we can talk about this forever but just for I think I Want to ask you what do you think those are I mean you think they're cool but what what what what is it\nWell you know I'm I don't know it goes or I mean that that's you know of course that's that's a million dollar question right I mean you've even even among the the ghost hundreds and believers\nAre across the board there's no there's no single answer right some people leave their residual events that are you know the stone tape theory that there's something that's going on and\nThen it was some murder murder tragedy that was recorded in stone and trees that is the three played other people think that goes for in a dimensional beings other people say that they're you know the spirit that that have gone on\nAnd and the very fact that there is such a diverse range of opinions is problematic for goes research right because\nGoes can't be both inner dimensional spirits and you know an emotional recording into a tree or house of murder and\nYou know here's the dead so so ... if you have a phenomena that has such a widely disparate range of explanations that's a problem so I I\nDon't know what ghosts are obviously they're not have been Scientifically Proven I think that that my my best guess if they're real would be basically a folklore Rick explanation that would be there some sort of spears of the dead that we live\nWe're seeing that they want to communicate with us from reading\n... good stuff for windows for Willis weaned so thank you for giving me the information\nYou have in fact that I Know you have a whole lot more that we can go to you but are coming up we're

Nineteen seventies once again now spoke to this guy numerous times and recorded it sightseeing or you know\nAnd he did a bit of poaching in the Nineteen seventies you know catching has and rabbits and ... and places that he shouldn't have been on private land and um it was at a place called Fox ... in written Dale which is\nEight miles from flicks them and he still lives in ... I mean it's an interesting story\nHe said it was with a friend said need noted for the past week or two weeks that something was ripping the prey out to be snazzy what my roommates net to catch the ... and the has and the other game small game\nAnd his words ice is proper so to ... born and bred and he's with what he ...\nHe said but we couldn't sort of what he was he said we just couldn't understand what was doing it you said there was still a bit of snow on the ground you could see so two rows of its own as he looking over to was the uh the the open fields and he's on the edge of folks ... with us it's friend who was doing the poaching\nIn the daytime than the lodge hedge hall forums and things about he said he probably eight to ten ... so I mean what is sort of turn round to speak to his friend and call the ... thing and he's peripheral vision and then looked and saw it on the left over the head ...\nHe said he thought he was a U hauls he meant halls so hate older bless each other for a while you'll also first so I couldn't believe what I was looking out so what we're saying is that this thing was as big as a small pony or you you know your house it's\nAn interesting thing was he left over the edge and just landed he said wait expects a horse to lend to move forward because the momentum this thing just limited and stuff like a magnet\nSudden something not to be nice to look at that\nHe said and he was the most peculiar thing he'd ever seen he said he glad them before you run away he said but he was on all fours and he said if it to the stood up to the being over seven Fulton looked like a body builder he said you know\nHe said he was a tiny waist and the main like a lion in the face of a of a boom\nAnd ... was and he said he was almost sort of Britain's gulag you know like a box that dog all the stuff that you both areas and\nNot what he ... he says well he said I went on to the edge off to them to try and get sentenced to have it\nSays to protect myself he says although there's nothing we could have done if this thing I decided they were going to come across to us they said the speed it covered crossing the field and into the world or what quite incredible um you know\n... miles from the coast all the sightings are quite close to the coast county and if you if you go further down the coast to watch a whole or in the papers probably two years ago there was the beast of bombs to drain the featured in the u._k. papers quite often\nAnd ... such as supposed to be aware of that was such a going the bombs to drain rooms into the sea six miles from where I'm ... now so we got this where we'll type creature reported but moving along the coast and they could go for the the coast you got\nOld folklore and legends old legends of dogs with glowing red eyes to the ... bay and raven ... they took they took the ...\nAnd you know these stories have to have that they've come down to being hunted down in time ... there's just I think there's grains of truth in the store is so that was a side thing\nIn the Nineteen seventies and they lived in Britain do all his life\nAnd he's never seen it since\nHe's never seen it before that I mean never seen it after that which is quite incredible if this thing I Believe his story but if this thing was native to that savvy you would think that they'd be more evidence of it so why are we only seeing small glimpses of it Kony was made\nYeah and that's what you're saying that they pop in and they pop out along the way kind of like\nWhen I talked to people before we had\nA friend of mine Laurie
