say about the current state of TV\n[noise] well I I think in a in one regard I think he would be thrilled with how adults television has become in you know in the in the realm of drama\nUh during the time the restrooms reading obviously we talked about some of the censorship but not on the issues but also the language and and just the ... the subject matter in general even if it wasn't a social issue um you know today there are so many shows that are that are are so adults in scope\nUh you know I don't even have to name them but you know Mad Men and Breaking Bad and you know not just cable but but um but network television I think it would be thrilled with how how uh the with the quality of those shows now of course we have many more channels now and he\nIs certainly a whole lot of you know of of jumped to but\nUm but I think in general he would be happy with it and one thing I can tell you I'm sure he he would hate reality TV on the um he and and I don't say that just you know that's not just like me saying that at the time you know I guess reality television Ford's time\nA rod had some very negative things to say about a show called this is your life if you remember this is your life [noise]\nUh this is your life with a show where they bring somebody\nOnto the show it in the normal you know regular everyday person and they will\nTrot as family members out there and they would go through his you know scrapbook and look at you know it was kind of reality television for the time and he just despise the the show or you know he thought it was just the invasion of privacy and everything else so the reality of it and he would hate but but I think there are so many shows now that he would absolutely love\nWoolen old time television tuned to a really did not understand racial mix ups demographics when you look at some of these old shows way gone back or even the comedians are the game shows\nAnd they were all older white guys you\nKnow in and I'm not I'm not talking like a middle age I'm ... older white guys [laughter] where did the television\nYou know it would be difficult to get that kind of a person like Jimmy Durante for example you you thinking him he was a big superstar very talented I don't think he would make it today\nYou might be right yeah yeah you could be right I mean well listen to the ... the um\nThe field as has grown so tremendously there's so much more competition\nThat uh you know there'll be there'll be but it's kind of like talking about now major league baseball before the before Jackie Robinson you know young you know they didn't have the competition from the from the black player from the Latin player from all these places and how they were certainly people who played in the major leagues in Nineteen forty one\nWho may not have made it in Nineteen fifty one because there was so much more more competition\nWhat would rod say about all the different channels available now in his day there was just three major networks now my God you've got hundreds of channels\nYeah well he would he would love the freedom that it that it gives to uh to writers and creators that you know in his day you know if those three networks didn't want to hear it that was it I mean you know and in some cases if he was you know have on the contract to CBS CBS didn't want to hear it that was it\nNowadays you know you can go to so many different outlets to get your creation\nOr seen and heard uh so yeah he would be thrilled with that aspect of it for sure\nI mean Netflix and Amazon truly rival the networks now don't they\nOh absolutely I some of the best television being made right now is on on those platforms\nAnd it's amazing let's take some calls let's go west of the Rockies cursed in Boise idaho or to get us started Hi Kurt\nHey George I'm Glad he got Nick I Can't wait to read the book you mentioned earlier when you're talking about the impact of the fact that the entire series is in black and white\nAnd of course Nick mentioned that you know the film or look but I've always been amazed at what I was able to do\nWith regarding the size of this sets which to me was as far as the visual impact was which is a testament to the you know the cinematographer or the lighting directors which I just I was just blown away with what they were able to accomplish was watering for Nick if he knew how many cameras they used during the actual shoots\nOkay Nick do you know\nI Do not know the answer that question by will absolutely agree with that that's one of the striking things about the series is\nIs that you know of course the production level in terms of budget you know it was a fairly of generously budgeted show at the for the for the time but of course in terms of special effects they weren't going to be able to give you the brilliance you know spaceships a shooting across the sky and that kind of things so that ... had to\nWork with a you know more a relatively modest a set\nAnd the so and he did he got the most out of out of those particular sets and and every now and then to actually because budget was always a concern\nUm he would write a particular show that only took place in one the one room because it was going to be cheaper to make you know young actors one room and that's it and he would do one of those after they had a couple of expensive shows like I have the holder or you know nightmare twenty thousand feet or something and then he would do one of these shows that we've got kinda got the budget back on the control\nHe jumps started many careers to did you not\nYeah I think so I mean it's it's certainly there are a lot of you know stars and soon\nTo be Robert Redford yay yay has learned Redford\nActually got his first job not on the twilight zone but in another show that rod Serling had written cold in the presence of mind enemies on playoff Ninety it was the very first appearance by Robert Robert Redford on television a and that was a great great show when he was a very good in it too\nYeah in the twilight zone episode he was a cop in the lady thought he was a death coming to get her yeah I'm not going to see what the ending is but that was a great show\nYeah was it was very that was written by George Clinton Johnson actually and that's a terrific show\nWhat was the name of the show Nicholas were ... more head was a woman in her house in a small flying saucer landed inside her house or something like that and she beat it with a broom\n[laughter] it's called the invaders and and that was written by Richard Matheson or the late great Richard Matheson uh he wrote several episodes of the show and that's one of the most well remembered episodes of the series it's ... it's largely dialogue free there's almost no dialogue in it until the very end when the when the\nYou know spit out the person you know ha says a few things\nI found out who they were in the other one I like to was the lady who was having plastic surgery\nA because everybody thought she was ugly in a she wanted to look like everyone else and uh we sure found out what everyone else look like and that's\nThat's the eye of the beholder and that is um you know if there is a quintessential twilight zone episode I think that's that's it that's that's the one uh and again one of the most well remembered episode\nAnd the one that really gave me the message of people was the shelter above the fallout shelter\nYeah the shelter is a great a great episode Serling wrote that one\nAnd uh yeah it's about the idea that there's going to be you know there's a there's a bomb threat a nuclear threat and what this what does this community do when there's only one bomb shelter and they all want to get into it and they can't get into it and they turn on each

the back alley and picked up a bag and it turned into gifts mysteriously bag just all of a sudden became full of gifts instead of a you know and pecans\nMan he went around giving gifts to everybody and it just and that story you know and the guy that ran a department store\nThey found car well given these gifts out at this a place like a John three sixteen mission type place you know policeman

now and does an awful lot of good for the blind and for a students who need scholarships you don't\nIt sure does how did you get involved in collectibles\nWell I got involved in and take away a lot of people do I just feel that everything else [laughter] not really but you know I I was\nA middle aged guy always in a restaurant business I was a stock market forecaster I used to that was one of these guys who told Merrill Lynch which way the market was going I worked at a think tank yeah parents got sick got called back to Connecticut\nAnd ended up in the antique business after a restaurant jobs didn't work out only things usually working life\n... that's true but people of color collectibles aren't going to tell you when I Wish I still have my baseball cards from the Nineteen fifties I don't know where they are I've asked my mother who's eighty nine years old mom checked the ... where are they she says George ... we gave them away\nWhat I had in the fifties every baseball card and clear that play during that period what would they be worth today a fortune\nWell Nineteen fifty two mantle Kurd oppose it was great good shape your real good shape right what would you feel well suppose

mind's eye and mental saying Willie Mays I haven't had 'em all to\nMyself I used to put those cards and my bicycle spokes [laughter]\nI had to duplicate so we did it with the duplicates remember\nYeah with the duplicates in generally your head like I had Fifteen Pete Rose rookie card to punish them\nI ran into Pete Rose a couple of years ago in Los Angeles and the ... what would those cars have been worse if you'd given them the him to sign even more\nNow I I actually don't think that would help the value very much probably it would hurt the value you don't want to do that with you know you're better off having them sign a napkin\nYeah exactly now old football cards and stuff so they worth money too\nThat's what you should be buying right now really I always think if you do little things a little different than the average guy you'll make a little extra money right everybody's on the baseball card that nobody's buying football cards which means you should be eyeing football\n... interesting to\nWrite basketball cards I once saw a guy who had a complete he had Michael Jordan rookie cards that before they got cards it's called the big plate he had a plate of sixteen Michael Jordan rookie guards on oh I don't know what the heck that would be worth today\nShe's banished basketball card but nobody collects cars and you can buy and real cheap and that's sort of thing you should be you could get yourself like addict but his rookie card right some sort of thing if you can buy that for a couple of bucks you buy it\nI think I threw away a wholeness Wagner
