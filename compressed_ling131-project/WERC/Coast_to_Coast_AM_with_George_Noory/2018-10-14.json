E. where did you go what did you experience how did you know it just seems\nWell the my first one I've ever had hundreds and hundreds of experiences over the decades but the first one I had um I was actually in a dorm room a going to college\nAnd I was doing what I call the target technique where you select three objects and you focus on them and as you fall asleep at night\nAnd the next after a series of days went by a one day I was sleeping on my side and I when I become aware I've realized that was vibrating differently\nIt's it's strange to really describe this but you feel a vibration of floating sensation and when I reached out my arm I realized my arm entered the wall\nAnd when I did you think we reached beyond that\nOh no I was not ... I didn't realize it was tell you the truth at the time but when I reached out what is at now I realize it at that moment I realized was my non physical arm it went through the wall and then I saw them stand in the next thing I knew I was standing by the foot of the bed\nAnd it was a one hundred percent real when I began to move around the room and examine my surroundings\nWas my first experience it was relatively brief but it was quite a life changing\nDid you encounter any body being guide anyone there\nAre actually that I did and I write about this is my first book adventures beyond the body that I observed someone that was observing may\nUm but they didn't I didn't communicate with them but somebody was observing may which was at the moment was a little bit shocking I was a newbie I had no idea about the what I had first stepped into here\nAnd ah over the decades and years of course I became more and more comfortable as I began to have more and more experiences\nIt's addicting isn't it yeah well it's\nIt's it's exciting because you can finally obtained the answers for yourself that\nSaid I think is the most important thing you don't have to depend upon um external sources and uh the indoctrinated society and culture that surround us you can you can find out the answers for yourself\nYou don't give you an example 'cause how do we know the answer is a true\nWhen you experience some in other words once you leave your body you know you you're more than your body you know that your brain is not the source of consciousness mhm\nAs we've been trained to believe you realize that you continue to exist and also you begin to realize that the universe is multi dimensional when I began to experience was a not only one non physical dimension but many of them\nAnd you realize that the physical world is just the in a sense the EPA term is a sin at the ... of the universe\nIs just one of them yeah\nYes and but you can experience that first hand and that's what's important it's it's it's not conjecture or belief system\nMhm I always think you know is incredible as our our world is and you know this incredible globe that we're in\nA given topic couldn't stop here I mean with all of the intelligence that we had here and with all the pistons information Janine di why would the universe just create one type of human being that doesn't make any [laughter]\nAbsolutely not and once you have to mention that\nOnce you have these experiences you realize that the universe is multi dimensional and and that there is there's trillions of all their life forms yeah\nAnd not all human there has\nTo be it wouldn't just be one [laughter] you don't want him anything\nNo of course not and it's the universe is far more diverse and magnificent and then we can that I can express\nMhm yeah it is it absolutely is so now when you you have these experiences and you know their meal because especially they ill meal you know he was playing the because usually not a language to really clearly defined\nWhat an entertaining chin is\nUniversal understanding\nWell once you leave your body and you begin to you begin to communicate and meet other being's\nGenerally they're humanoid they're generally what we would consider to be people that have died a I write about communicating and meeting my mother and my uncle who to it passed and all communication is very elegant it's by solved and there's no need in other words\nLanguage is no longer a barrier we we communicate directly by thought ... and it's amazing it's so clear and concise compared to the physical languages that we use here that are symbols and it's uh it's amazing\nBut that's one of the great benefits of this is that you have an opportunity to experience and explore\nYourself and discover the answers for yourself\nThere was no um when I teach my classes are there is no um belief systems attached to it each individual is given the skills given the tools needed let's say to go out and become an explorer themselves so they can\nDiscover what they feel is the truth for themselves\nWhich is very important\nNow your classes you teach them and really tell us what does look like when you have

themselves and not only have it but control it and get the most of it my main goal is to teach people how to have a profound\nA spiritual experience ideally throughout a body exploration it's not just about walking and walking through a wall and talking to someone and it's a lot more profound than that you have the we have the ability to have\nThe literally connect with their herself with are multi

doing twenty five years of research at the mineral Institute sedative or sixteen thousand participants who have gone through the OB e training at than than real Institute in Virginia\nAnd he's come up with a common let me put it to nominate associated with the Cleveland Plain and then the audience [noise]\nYes I'm just to clarify I've been at the Monroe Institute for the last eight years so um but I've been studying this in practice in it for forty\nOr just to go on my website astro info dot org I included um over a period of ten years I did a a number of surveys and I receive sixteen thousand responses from people that had out of body experiences and this is from forty two different countries by the way\nAnd it's it was amazing how similar kinds of experiences that people were having were so similar it didn't matter what the culture was for instance I'm a floating or um vibrations high energy sensations\nEighty five percent of people experience buzzing humming are roaring sounds as a as a prelude normally to the experience because normally when you're in your experience things become very generally speaking are quiet but there's a lot of phenomena associated with the onset\nOf Seventy two percent at some point experience some kind of partial or fall asleep paralysis\nI'm being lifted or touched that was quite common thirty three percent hearing voices are footsteps thirty seven percent this is one that's very common probably to almost anyone\nAnd that is seen through close dial it if you're seen through your clothes die lives at night and you can begin to see you are already in the process of shifting your consciousness\nTo your non physical body because you have and it doesn't mean you've accident your body but it means you're in the process\nBut most people don't know this because they haven't been trained in the in the prelude and the phenomena associated these are common things at\nA for instance probably the most common it's just a jerk awake you feel like you're just a you're taking a nap and suddenly you just jerk back into your body\nRight is I find that many people feel that that's an indication you're you're at a phase with your body as your fell asleep\nThat gap I ... on because that happened I'm retired I Will switch and I think his muscles and ... are you saying that now the money you\nKnow I'm I'm saying it's not that I'm saying it's a prelude to one potentially ... this is what I have found and what many other um experiences have seen and explored\nEvery one when they sleep we all humans are moving out of phase from our body sets with sleep is ... we take for granted no one you know there's no we we know about REM periods and we know about this from a scientific standpoint\nBut what happens for that one third of our life\nWe're actually moving out of phase with her body and when you leave your body you can observe other people it's like a double image people literally are floated I'm not saying they're floating up the ceiling they're just like two inches out of the phase with her body at night as a sleep\nAnd you can observe this actually during an out of\nBody experience losing ... image you're looking at\nIt's amazing the same applies to animals by the way animals also do the exact same thing\nOh yeah when you watch the animals sleep they aren't switching and having all sorts of experiences\nWhere they're moving their legs and the dream again or they may be running in their non physical body I mean my point is that out of body experiences are is natural was breathing and think about this for a moment and and that is just that everyone is non physical we're non physical ...\nIts temporarily for a very brief period of time eighty years or Ninety years\nWe didn't have any biological machine ... and then we're ... we're all moving beyond the body\nSo it isn't it I find it just\nIt's one of the ways to discover what's really going on what this multi dimensional game of chess wordplay and most people only aware that they think there's two levels of the game life and death\nActually it's a it's a vast multi dimensional game but very few people are aware of it and you begin to awake into this one you have an out of body or near death experience\nWell if you wanted to ask a question like how did you hear me here would you go into an OB and ask that question and have you ever tried Dennis and I'm curious how did you hear me now to me\nThat's a good question it's all in the perception of the experience are okay and you can have multiple experiences for instance I had I began to have spontaneous experiences when I started this goes back into the seventies\nAnd I was still learning what was going and I'm Still learning by the way you know one's a master we're constantly learning and I started to have experiences of myself as a German tank commander in these experience I Would find myself literally riding a German tank\nI mean and it was so real it was just like the physical world and I didn't even know what was going on I didn't believe in a past lives that wasn't on my radar but then I had these repeated experiences and that's the way a lot of people end up getting verification\nAnd I had multiple multiple experiences where I found myself as a German soldier in World War two and I also found out that my let's just say one of my sons was with me at the time\nAnd um my point is that when a often will get information given to us or we open to these experiences and we get a download and it's more than just download of information it's presented to us in exponential were there were present\nAnd when you have this happen a dozen times it begins to get you get your own verification\nOr what's going on and I think\nThis is very important because no one's telling you for instance I didn't believe in past lives into I started to have my own\nThat's I mean I'm just using this is one example\nRight that does make sense it's not needing to be validated ... anyone other than you are\nRight and it's very important that that self verification is\nEssential I find because that's the only way will ever break free from the indoctrination of belief systems that dominate our society and culture\nAt Marion point\nBecause all of us have been from birth we've all been indoctrinated along certain religious and let's just say educational lines and [noise] you know I always have somebody\nThat's an avid believer and anything like that a specialty of religion you know what would you believe what faith would you believe if you would have been born in India\nAh eh we're all been programmed and this gives us an opportunity to break free from that program into truly see what's real and look beyond the programming that we all share\nA cause and that's an important aspect of this ... and it's an individual journey nobody can tell you what you are and where you're going nobody can you have to experience that menu sudden oh my God now I got it and it's it's a transformation\nShould know powerful experience\nVery self empowering\n... it is now back to the report that you had you talked about the common maybe put it in ... and also\nThe

San Pedro or the empty or it doesn't matter how you and do the experience if you're a fear based and you take your fears are mindset is ...\nWith us into our experiences\nThat's why it's so important to begin to each to take a closer look at yourself and your beliefs and to see how and tried to perjure yourself as much as possible of these fear based a belief systems that have no reality to them\nBut if you believe in some kind of negative vanity if if there is not like there's negative energy if you were going to create it when your mind is going to mold the reality around you\nIf you believe in love and light you're going to manifest love and light if you believe in darkness and a negative beings and whatever\nThen you're going to manifest that is well well your creative powerful beings and when you leave your body no matter how it's done you're entering into it incredibly thought response of environment and you have to take responsibility for your experience\nSome people don't like to hear this but the it's the truth\nWell I had we had one once where I went it was a specific dream I guess I don't remember but it could very well in and out of body experience where I\nWas shocked by somebody that he had written up it was like a future scene and they were on a motorcycle and they got in the recycling your helmet look directly at me didn't recognize this person you don't know anyone that um [noise] rides their own motorcycle\nAnd it was and it looked me up because it was as if\nThat person was really looking at me and I don't know who lives in it wasn't a protection of anything and it was when I was no there isn't a premonition of anything that happened it just isn't it was as if I had gone into a future dimension\nWhich looks pretty bleak pianist and then this person looked at me saying why are you who how did you cross into this dimension and then I Will cut because when he was scared to each other yeah and I do know is that an adult law out of body travel most likely\nMhm well it could have banned but it wasn't a projection of my psyche at all\nNo there's object there is consensus what I call consensus realities and there is no consensus realities\nThere's that's that's why it's important to learn about the consensus realities are created by a collective group of individuals that all agree on a reality and they create that's why I called consensus there's\nMany types of realities that exist and in our multi dimensional universe and that's why it's important for us to look at them learn these what is essentially the rules of nonsensical reality and how they function because it's not the same as it is here\nWere used a linear time right is to gravity we're used to air yeah when you leave your body you don't have a biological body you're not breathing air you know you don't have gravity all the things we're used to have to you have to learn how to function in a new kind of energy space\nThat's and that's of course one of the things I teach and I'm\nIn my workshops but it's also in my book but it's important for everybody to start learning the nature of our\nContinuing existence yes so that will be prepared for this transition of consciousness\nI understand I understand they want to thank you so much lately it's been great if you go to his website which is ... ... dot org you'll find out about

there's any way to go to the show [laughter] funny\nYeah thank you very much and um thank you very much for being for letting me be on tonight and I've been a long time listener so this is a dream come true\nOn so will you send me your book and we do are you constantly in Colorado during a guy who shows and I thought it would be so fascinating 'cause there are so many different pieces of history little pockets of history and its own assuming you can\nFind things like that in Colorado and everywhere but where did you what was your first experience when we are normal\nWell this is this I've been seeing go since I was the an e high to a grasshopper is what I always say I'm and about and my parents never believe me so it was quite frightening\nAnd so this really has become part of my mission in life is to try to spread some better understanding and after I got cancer I'm about ten years ago\nIt was my wake up call and I looked at my bucket list and believe it or not my goal was to try and the unite the paranormal ... community and to also do some outreach to help children better understand\nAnd um so I actually started this paranormal convention and I partnered with my friend or a spins\nAnd she's a professional psychic and she runs a nonprofit called kindred spirits out of Longmont, Colorado\nMhm and so\nThe two of us are with the brainstorming and then getting a lot of support from other people in the community now we've changed the name to spirits of the Rockies paranormal convention and uh we've we call it a ... feast because every year\nWe try to sponsor it in a different community and by doing that we outreach to the historians because we call ourselves haunted historians\nBecause what we do is actual real history so even if you don't believe in goes or things that go up and the nights supposedly this stuff really happened\nAnd I woke up particularly interested in this after I found out about a journalist named Charles sport and I'm sure all your listeners know about him\nThat he was pretty popular about a hundred years ago and what he did was he went into old newspaper archives and old mysteries and he revisited them to see if it was possible that these things really happened\nAnd so that's what I decided to do and interesting enough this is actually my fifth book and I want to shout out to shift for publishing LCD they actually publish my last book\nGoes legends and lord of the Rockies and it is available through shut the ship for publishing\nOkay well let's just back up for a second here so you let's talk about your Journey Through you're going to diverge cancer and how do you how you reconnected your life which goes what were you doing before then\n... well before that I like I said I've always been into the paranormal because I've been seeing it you know since I was little child\nSo what do you mean seeing it you you\nKnow I see it and I actually feel it\nI really like him as an example that\nWell I can [laughter] I Know this is going to sound really funny but I can actually sense things\nI'm I'm an impasse I think a lot of your listeners probably are familiar with that kind of a term\nBut I'm very ... I'm just highly sensitive now if somebody came up to me and said hey is the Broncos going to win the football team I Can't protect that into the future but what I can do is I see pictures for example today I was at the flea market with a friend and they lost their backpack\nAnd I saw the picture in my head of where it was at I just close my eyes and I saw where it was that and we went back in there it was so I'm able to do things like that\nUm but I let's see I think okay so I was a professional story tell her from the time I was about twenty all through college I used to do singing telegrams all of this kind of thing and so I've worked in the entertainment business for quite a while and about Twenty years ago is when I bought a bed and breakfast\nIn managed to Springs Colorado and he was taunted\nAnd so I said well I might as well start doing haunted history tours and I open my big huge mansion to the public and I had haunted wine and cheese parties\nDid you know before you bought it it was haunted\nYeah I was haunted but I was kind of like this you know my kids were oh starting in junior high at the time and I was like oh this will be fun kids get this we are oh you're going to love this story this is way true I mean it sounds like it's made up but I'm telling you that all that I'm telling you tonight is a hundred percent true\nWe were living in Southern California at the time and my husband was working for cancer research company and he got laid off when the company changed hands\nSo my entire family a move to Colorado and bought\nAn old haunted mansions sight unseen I Swear\nThat because they wanted to buy a hundred mentioned well are they wanted to buy a mansion\nWell what happened is I actually come out I'm actually from Colorado and I'd come out on vacation and I was staying in the bed and breakfast\nAnd I got to know the owners pretty well and I told them my story about how my husband was in this cancer research company and he was the CFO and everything\nAnd at the same time the owner's life who actually wasn't living there she was that in California because she I mean ... Texas 'cause she had cancer and she was dying so she was really interested in the research and I tried to give her as much information as I could you know her husband and mind you and your she died\nAnd so during this time it was really interesting because I actually got an email um and it was back in Nineteen Ninety nine you know so I think it was like I feel bad a questionnaire and the room and that's how he got my email address and he said to me you know I I Know your husband was involved in this and everything but we actually have this\nA bed and breakfast up for sale and uh if you you know I Know you said your husband just got laid off of work I don't know if you were thinking about coming back to Colorado but we could talk about\nFinancing the home for you and that was interesting because my husband didn't have a job I mean everything just fell into place like we were meant to have this house and by the way I actually knew of the house because I grew up here and he was always really fond of this big beautiful\nOld a craftsman style mansion done and the arts and crafts file I just loved it\nAnd um when we bought it it was really rundown [laughter] extremely run down and so one of the first order of business was to actually fix up the house now this was a problem because the owners said to us\nThat they would finance us no problem we didn't even have to put any money down\nBut I was not allowed to sell anything in the house until the house was paid for\nAnd we signed a balloon I'm a balloon like loans and said that we would pass the house in five years after five years we could do whatever we wanted with the furniture or the house what what have you well\nAfter us and you know no no hard feelings to the former owners or anything but I really did not like the way this house was decorated\nAnd I'm an artist you know and it's very iffy that I'm In a soothing you can see where this was going roe [laughter]\nSo I actually called the owner's son and he was managing the bed and breakfast at the time and I said hey\nYou think they would mind if I you know just sold a few things and it goes you know what steps do what you want he goes\nMy mother is old and she is going to die soon you know this was before she died and he goes don't worry about it you know I'm just do what you want there never coming back to Colorado again because you know it's too high of an altitude song about it just do what you want\nAnd I said All right thank you very much so I put an ad in the paper and I had the biggest state so I don't think anybody's ever seen anything like that\nWhile I hired twenty people um to help me out and we all had T shirts that said on a ledge estate so Nineteen Ninety nine and it was ethic\nMy goodness you didn't bring so loud literally everything\nIn the house lock stock and barrel you can see where this is going right [laughter] I Can't wait\nTill the ghost of Shirley actually sue was not happy with me I'm not long after that my nephew was living with me and he was only six years old at the time and he actually had his own bedroom with me on a ledge estate and he started talking about a ghost named sue\nOh [laughter] I

Institute in Virginia and William cells as a certified therapist and he guide you\nThrough these incredible states as consciousness and I personally know that things just from my experience it love to hear more from William welcome to the show and\nThanks for joining me William\nHi how are you feeling good aid\nSo tell me first of all what led you to even create such a system set out of body ventured idea\nWell over forty years ago I had my own uh I had an out of body experience to go back to Nineteen Seventy three and I was not a believer and then there should be impossible\nBut I had a friend of mine that I had a spontaneous experience in college and I decided to explore it ... it was a life changing experience for him so I began to investigate it and found that there was a message to self initiate and out of body experience so\nI explored them and for it took me I Believe on the twenty fourth day of having the daily exercise um I initiated my first holy conscious out of body experience and it was\nIt was completely life changing I mean 'cause I was not a believer but I wanted to explore and experience it see if it was real for myself and it's it's quite a life change your\nFamily who had to leave your tire life a whole paradigm of your perception of reality shifted\nOh yeah it is but now you had your out of body experience was South Indian state wasn't through a an accident or any type of trauma right\nRight it was self induced through um like a meditative exercise that I that I learned and then I developed many different kinds that we can do to self initiate the experience\nNow was this before or after you became a hit in the therapist\nOh that was way before yeah I later became a hypnotic therapist\nThan I was a I used it to develop other techniques to help to negotiate these altered states and out of body experiences\nSo after you had these experiences yourself then you went into helping other people experienced the same thing so tell me about your oh B. E. where did you go what did you experience how did you know it just seems\nWell the my first one I've ever had hundreds and hundreds of experiences over the decades but\nThe first one I had um I was actually in a dorm room a going to college and I was doing what I call the target technique where you select three objects and you focus on them and as you fall asleep at night\nAnd the next after a series of days went by a one day I was sleeping on my side and I when I become aware I've realized that was vibrating differently\nIt's it's strange to really describe this but you feel a vibration of floating sensation and when I reached out my arm I realized my arm entered the wall\nAnd when I\nDid you think we reached beyond that\nOh no I was not ... I didn't realize it was tell you the truth at the time but when I reached out what is at now I realize it at that moment I realized was my non physical arm it went through the wall and then I saw them stand in the next thing I knew I was standing by the foot of the bed\nAnd it was a one hundred percent real and I began to move around the room and examine my surroundings that was my first experience it was relatively brief but it was quite a life changing\nDid you encounter any body ... guide anyone there\nAre actually that I did and I write about this is my first book adventures beyond the body that I observed someone that was observing may um\nBut they didn't I didn't communicate with them but somebody was observing may which was ... at the moment was a little bit shocking I was a newbie I had no idea about that what I had first stepped into here\nAnd ah over the decades and years of course I became more and more comfortable as I began to have more and more experiences\nIt's addicting isn't it\nYeah well it's it's it's exciting because you can finally obtained the answers for yourself you need that\nSaid I think is the most important thing you don't have to depend upon um external sources and uh the indoctrinated society and culture that's around as you can you can find out the answers for yourself\nYou don't give you an example 'cause how do we know the answers are true\nWhen you experience some in other words once you leave your body you know you you're more than your body you know that your brain is not the source of consciousness mhm as we've been trained to believe\nYou realize that you continue to exist\nAnd also you begin to realize that the universe is multi dimensional what I began to experience was a not only one non physical dimension but many of them and you realize that the physical world is just the in a sense the EPA term is a sin at the ... of the universe\nIs just one of them\nYeah yes and but you can experience that first hand and that's what's important it's it's it's not conjecture or belief system\nMhm I always think you know is incredible as our our world is and\nKnow incredible globe that we're in\nA given topic couldn't stop here I mean with all of the intelligence that we have here and with all the system's information Janine di why would the universe just create one type of human being that doesn't make any [laughter]\nAbsolutely not and once you have to mention that once you have these experiences\nYou realize that the universe is multi dimensional and that and that there is there is trillions of all their life forms\nAnd not all human and has\nTo be it wouldn't just be one [laughter] I don't want him anything\nNo of course not and it's the universe is far more diverse and magnificent and then we can do that I can express\nMhm yeah it is it absolutely is so now when you\nYou have these experiences and union of their meal because ... he'll meal you know he was playing because usually not a language to really clearly defined what an entertaining chin is universal understanding\nWell once you leave your body and you begin to you begin to communicate and meet other being's\nGenerally they're humanoid they're generally what we would consider to be people that have died a I write about communicating and meeting my mother and my uncle who to it passed and all communication is very elegant it's by solved and there's no need in other words\nLanguage is no longer a barrier we we communicate directly by thought ... and it's amazing it's so clear and concise compared to the physical languages that we use here\nThat are symbols and it's uh it's amazing\nBut that's one of the great benefits of this is that you have an opportunity to experience and explore\nYourself and discover the answers for yourself\nThere was no um when I teach my classes are there is no um belief systems attached to it each individual is given the skills given the tools needed let's say to go out and become an explorer themselves so they can\nDiscover what they feel is the truth for themselves which is very important\nNow your classes you teach them and really to tell us what does look like when you have people come and I called in after all tourism many [laughter] it really is an adventure and you say beyond the body [noise]\nYes it is it's um the among roe Institute which by the way I'm calling from how great it is urging him only twenty four people\nCan attend it's a world renowned as being the center for the exploration of consciousness but in my workshop\nI'm generally what I each person is in
