game is is that they don't want us to know that they're they're they want us to think that this is our own feelings our own thoughts and some of it is all of the violence author is not caused by demonic spirits and negative spirits\nAre but certainly there are there to amplify and right now everybody's got a target on their back\nEverybody\nHow did they possess how did they take over somebody's body\nThey work on them for on people for a while you can leave these things happen over a period of time people who are depressed people who move into a home a and there's a lot of negative emotional\nEnergy drugs or something I practice something called modern actresses and and that is that came out of the idea when I started going into people's homes I I found out\nMany years ago that ... homes because people have lived in there to generate both positive and negative emotional energy use which are unseen but we feel them\nAnd they accumulate in the environment and demonic spirits actually feel stronger and become stronger and these kinds of environments and so do negative spirits\nSo they are attacked people and homes we don't take care of our homes we clean them\nWash windows when you move into a new place the carpet paint everything but we don't clean the atmospheres and so essentially were living in other people's emotional energies and so demonic spirit's just play on that\nAnd they come into the our environments\nAnd generate huge amounts of energy that is negative and the air thickens with emotional energy especially negative energy at thickens and so it's easier to transmit negative emotional energy\nHatred those kinds of negative thoughts and emotional feelings when the air is sick with emotional energy and so I get calls all the time from people who you know say hey I just moved into this new home apartment whatever and it doesn't feel right\nI don't know why but you know the kids are crying the dogs are barking in a certain area or we're just getting into more arguments why is this happening and so modern exercises and deals with the idea of that first the negative emotional energy has to be removed by\nSomebody like me from the atmosphere of the home that makes the spirit weaker than I deal with the negative spirit or that's the second thing that I Do that's modern exercises different from traditional actresses and in that I don't\nAlways go after the spirit first sometimes I cleared the atmosphere to make them weaker and then I attack the negative spirits\nAnd you're not you're not ... you're not a priest does that affect what you do\nI Would not say that I'm not a priest I Would say that I'm an independent priest says Sean priest exercises\nI don't belong to any particular religion because I work with people from all different religions or no religious at all people call me who are\nAgnostic atheist everybody calls me and that's the thing you know you don't have to belong to a particular church to call me and a half of your home cleared and these days I Do it by distance as well because when I was going through homes and doing strictly in person and work\nFor the Internet ever came about\nUm I wasn't touching anything anyways personal clarion wasn't touching anybody anyways it's really it's not necessary there's no such thing as as a\nDistance on a non physical level doesn't matter as long as you have focused each one of us is a complete individual\nAnd so anybody can be cleared from anywhere if you know how to do it\nAnd it it it has to be done you know we we move into apartments like I said and there's lots of emotional energy from maybe people living there for Twenty years forty years a hundred years depending on where people are from around the world\nIt builds up it accumulates and spirits need to be\nDealt with you know sometimes there are already in the homes\nTimes that come into the home they sense of family that having a problem because of emotional energy in our living environment and they're ripe for attack and so it may be a professional to have a weird one and I then I teach people how to\nMaintain the clarity of their bodies are energy fields\nAnd also how to maintain the clarity of their living environment's so it's kind of like having your carpet cleaner and then first and then you can if we are all carpet once that's done\nSo it really is something we all can do to a certain extent and something I think we all should do I'm not going to be around forever and certainly there are great exorcist and every religion and not the only one\nThat are qualified exorcist and just about every religion but they but they don't work for people and other religions I get that all the time you know that people call up and say well like I called you know local parish even though I'm not no I don't belong that religion I'm not Catholic\nAnd they won't come over and help me I Hope everybody so I that's why I don't belong in the religion but I remember doing this kind of work and has lives um I have deep contact with higher spirits\nAre also in this universe is filled with the stars and around those stars are planets and there are [noise]\nThis

time I\nWas just you know sleeping after hard night of giving speeches and talking about all these things and I said I'm not going to sleep again in this mansion and actually went down into the basement which used to be a speak easy and sat down and they're not out of fear I just wanted to get out of the room you\nKnow you you just learn\nAn exercise does not safe I don't go into homes and uh in in to entertain people or just to give speeches if there are negative spirits in somebody's home or negative energy I get rid of it\nHow do you know you've gotten rid of\nPeople say so I I go completely on the client I give a report on what I see and what I did and suggestions I have but I go completely under clients\nWhen did they get back to Egypt for you I mean how many days after you were there do they call you back and say I think you got rid of this thing\nOh is usually right away or you know sometimes you know a week or so later but on the calls come pretty quickly you know times\nImmediately you know it's like you know we feel better right away especially when I Do a personal clearly not do these things by Skype I work with people all around the world they don't have to travel everywhere sky telephone\nUh you know whatever and so people say hey I feel better right away because I work on a lot of individuals are just working negative environments and they need a clearing\nAnd and I teach people how to protect themselves and and so I Do a lot of this and so they feel better right away I get that right away and they call up and say hey our family is no longer fighting I feel better at work and better able I go into business meetings and I'm no longer coming out feeling drained\nBecause I'm not getting hit with negative energy from my co workers we all generate negative energy\nAnd we don't always noted subconscious and so people don't know that are getting hit they don't know they're sending out negative energy they don't know something like a demonic spirit is around them are on negative spirit\nAnd so you know people calling me family is calling me and sometimes it takes a while and sometimes it's a media but I always get a caller and email thanks a lot Jeffrey really really helped you know very very seldom out of the thousands of clients that I've helped or the last\nAlmost three decades now have not said that you know it's it's not a matter of ego or bragging it's just what happens you know I'm very good at what I Do and I make sure that the client isn't the best shape possible so personal clearing might be forty five minutes I Do thirty five different things in forty five\nMinutes already by different things so remarkable and it's almost like a checklist\nEvery clearing has different George depending on what is going on with the client it may just be negative energy a nurse works in a hospital or psychiatric ward or around ... people that is coming in from the six month clearing they're calling me up\nYou know buy Skype or something or is most common uh you know and I don't have to look at them for forty five minutes how I was I always work with my eyes closed unless I'm walking around really on a business or a house and so\nYou know or they feel better you know and and you know the fight stop because the idea of a negative spirit or even just negative emotional energy that's accumulated over a period of time in a home has no effect upon the family more arguments\nAnd they can turn violent this attracts negative spirits this attracts demonic spirits\nAnd so negative emotional energy attracts negative spirits demonic spirit is also happens in the workplace far more than people think\nAnd are these are the complaints that I get and so my job is to remove the negative emotional energy from a person's energy field both deep meaning that the from the very first day that were born we generate emotional energy\nAnd also things we pick up today yesterday last week as well and also the homes we move into apartments were lived in by maybe a hundred different people generating emotional energy schools\nPeople go to school I went to this this is the same school both elementary and high school that my parents went to\nIts old very beautiful but I mean think of the energy just\nWaited and so people will be calling on comfortable they don't know why and the body picks up emotional energy we generated we don't know how to release it I teach people how to do that you know and and so\nSometimes it's a teaching session and sometimes it's a clearing session and all the time as I Do both and you know a clearing session a forty five minutes first standard adult you know maybe you know thirty minutes for a child and maybe Fifteen twenty minutes for pets\nNot so good because it just for you know most all energy more than people do\nNext stop let us go to Jay in Minnesota Welcome to the program I DJ\nGood evening gentlemen I appreciate your time thank you thanks for calling\nUm George it's always a pleasure I've I've called you a couple of times about turmeric and everything else but Jeffrey you treat me extremely a great late at night and I have some questions I have some

themselves\nWhich unfortunately is a great portion of the population and so they will attack people who have mental issues physical brain problems a depression anger issues unhappiness\nA overconfidence all sorts of things that are going on and so it does happen and and we have to watch out for that and and so ah demonic spirits\nAre experts at reaching across that dividing line and being able to reach into the physical realm and affect people when the wind is right usually meaning that there is emotional energy in the atmosphere or a person is feeling weak they're not protecting themselves properly\nAnd they can reach across in damage a person physically and they can cause even something like that usually what happens is is not so much of an immediate dug but actually been working on them for a long time\nAnd they can cause physical injuries even happened to me once you know I I woke up one morning I was getting dressed in my office my girlfriend was asleep at the time and I was getting up and ready to work\nOut doing what I Do here and all of a sudden\nDemonic spirit appeared behind me I knew I could feel its power suddenly a light shot out from it hit me right in the back\nAnd it caused me to have a centrally a pulled muscle I actually had to go you know get in my car and drive to the hospital and you know I haven't looked at in a you know get some light medication for it\nIs it the demonic Stewart had pulled the muscle so it can happen to me and I'm good at protecting myself so all the people out there who are not protecting themselves which is\nYou know most of the population of our planet are very susceptible to attack\nAnd it can be a physical because demonic spirits studying how to do these things\nThe non physical universe heaven the other side whatever you want to call it which is a wonderful place but they also have dark rooms that are negative\nVery negative what we might call hell and in essentially that is very connected to the physical realm of the physical realm as something like the crust of the bread and heaven and the other side to being the inside the bread itself which is much larger\nLet's go next to Jim in Portland, Oregon while we have some time here Jim go ahead\n... on my question is is it possible for one of these evil spirits to quit being evil or you know to\nTo repent turtle like I go to the other side gets off drugs\nAre so many psychics back in the Nineteen nineties asked me and said hey Jeffrey as long as you're doing extra citizens in teaching people how to protect themselves why don't you help the spirits and I said when I say no I Am not the spirit psychologist uh it's\nKind of like if somebody calls and your window and wants to see her still your stereo or worse you don't sit them down on the couch and say look we need to talk about while you steal things it's not my job you don't have time to spare to\nThrow that actually are very good at trying to help negative spirits demonic spirits are homeless but the idea of negative spirit's just negative people who are dead and doing negative things and trying to get them to look at themselves and see what they're doing\nBut it's not my job and people who hire me I work for them to my job is to get those things out of their home get negative energy out of their home out of their bodies energy fields I don't have time to do it and if they're not going to listen to me anyway\nThey're they don't have to there's going to go someplace else they're just not going to do that anymore the physical criminals going to sit there on the couch is going to he or she is going to get up and walk out the door back out the window\nI I just don't have the time I have to immediately focus on getting rid of the emotional energy and the person who's energy field of the average person\nNot everybody's not everybody's disaster anything they just have negative energy issues and also getting if there is some kind of negative spirit attack or not necessarily living in the house they could just be going from house to house every night or apartment to apartment condo condo or Republican pub whatever and getting them out of their fast\nAnd making it work so the family or the individual is safe\nThis is my main concern not are dealing with a negative spirit's there are millions and millions of spirits out there they don't just sit on clouds or walk the streets of gold actually do things and one of the things they do is work for higher spirits and help other spirits look at themselves and stop doing what they're doing\nIf they don't there are other measures that we can take\nJeffrey are you glad you have this ability ... ability to see demons to maybe even get removed them\nGeorge I am I was born with it and at first it was really scary because when I reported that the teachers you know I'm seeing these spirits and you know I'm a mom so that could you know you know tell her when my grandmother my grandmother was going to call and you know two days and all those kinds of stuff at first it was real scary\nBut actually I I started as I went along in my life I started and and I'm fifty nine now I started to remember doing these kinds of things in past lives helping people that to me is the greatest gift\nI could ever be given the ability to help people it's dangerous work [noise] but the idea is that once I teach people how to protect themselves they can go off and not be so susceptible they can go to work and not come home so dream\nAnd I bet they really appreciate you while they love it\nYou know and it it's just great to hear them say thanks Jeffrey but you know the real the reward is feeling better that's what it's all about me\nSure is Jeffrey ... would you please\n... ... you can find everything you

I didn't I didn't know when I was dreaming that it was a dream and once in a looser tree but [noise]\nAfterwards I woke up right after and sure enough that was only a dream but what I'm curious about is [noise]\n[noise] somebody like Dr ... in the area of psychology and whatnot I Would I Would not be surprised at all that she has and consuming these drugs\nWe don't we don't know that\nI don't know but but what I'm saying is that it could very well be that she instead of what this young man had with a with a well he can dream soon [noise] she hers was more like Roseanne Barr that you can read on you\nKnow you're you're absolutely right but that's that's something that nobody asked either one of them if they were on any mood altering drugs I don't believe everything I ... I've seen in in that case\nThat never came up but I'm sure that's a possibility or even though we don't know for sure what it probably happened key thank you for that when we got open line calls let's go next to Jason in Bowling Green Kentucky west of the Rockies Hi Jason [noise]\nYou know and go okay where are you a\nUm um I had a a thing you could do to believe that I saw before I had a I had done a little ... ...\nAnd I had gotten to read the Bible a little bit you know and um and I was in a bone in my life where I didn't really know if God was real or if the devils real all this you know and I started reading the Bible\nAnd then I'm going back to the point when I was out and do whatever and uh uh I asked God and I was like ... ... you know your real angels on everything Israel you know show me 'cause I Would like to know I Would like to believe [noise] so I [noise]\nIt's probably ... at first nothing really happened except until about a week\nLater what happened when I started seeing\nThese little things like with people like a Beagle like these little spirits and stuff and um [noise] uh well I I think this one guy had three of them right when it seemed like everybody and he had frenzy everything he did he touch with no\nI mean you have a one like in you know what I'm saying in and then I think it's monkey he didn't have none okay now these kids that you know no\nUh it's a glass of water without knocking over something breaking it up and told me that\nHe was going to get an angel but he didn't have one at the time when I'm leaving it was kind of me just to show me that you know how it works warning or you know and then\nSo [laughter] so I bought a church in a [noise] I tell my uncle buddy told me you know you get to go to church you know and I'm so we go to church ... while I was doing church I won't eat them and I started he will will be angels ...\nOr early in the church all over the place\nAll the way around it you know it is like there was a state of behind the ...
