AM radio broadcast then that a mere Knight planet or planet X.\nY. indirectly discovered at the far edge of our solar system where the hyper belt in New York cloud meet\nThe hyper belt is shaped rent of rock Dustin ice left over from our solar system creation and it and then from the orbit of Neptune out far beyond Pluto too about the astronomical unit from our son\nAnd the crowd of mostly ice and uh go much further\nStarting where the hype rebel then and then three point to light years from earth and theoretical shape that surround our entire solar system including the hype about\nAnd I have a beautiful graphic of ... at ... dot com report for people to see what our so I'm really looks like\nNow I say planet nine indirectly found in twenty sixteen because\nIt eight no human on earth has yet seen this hypothesize massive object but Michael Brown PHD professor of planetary astronomy at caltech in Pasadena\nAnd now back in twenty sixteen that he was confident that ... ... jobs and to twenty times the mass of earth moving in a big looping orbit all the way to the word cloud forgot that brown simply called the planet\nFine because he's the astronomer they got quite a knock down to a dwarf planet after it had been the historic ninth planet of our solar system for decades it was\nTwenty three and professor brown that year discovered another dwarf planet he called era out in the hype rebelled and it was more massive than Pluto\nSo it was professor brown who argued that Pluto or should be downgraded from the ninth planet in our solar system to adore planted in the hyper belt that surrounds our solar system and he even wrote a book in twenty ten that\nWas called how I Killed Pluto and why it had it coming\nWhen I first interviewed professor brown about the massive but still unseen planet nine he told me back then quote it is like chasing a go whatever is out there it's math is so great that it's gravitational field pushes\nHalf a dozen other hyper belt object to cluster together on the opposite side of the planet nine huge looping orbit or at least where they think it orbits\nClose quote now that is why so far it is an indirect discovery\nIt's now late twenty Eighteen after several tries at the hacking Subaru observatories in Hawaii to find planet nine invisible light and or infrared professor brown says that it is quote till like chasing a go\nAfter more refined computer calculations he has reduced the expected math of this unseen planet can be only seven times more massive than earth\nAnd just a couple of weeks ago I checked in with him for an update on his search for this ... have planet nine or planted act that he uh is still trying to mine and he told me\nThat he is planning another trip to Hawaii November first just in a week and this time he thinks there is a chance that he'll finally be able to actually get to this big mysterious math because they've been working on computer refinement\nAnd for example he told me in a recent interview that calculations place on the body\nAbout five hundred times further than the distance from the earth to the sun so that is putting it in a spot that is something like twenty times further than\nNeptune a good way out there but they have ... narrow down the focus so yeah that well there were only going on November first started another surge because the new calculations\nPredict that planet nine is close to a constellation that can only be seen by American eyes in the winter here now from the California Institute of technology's planetary sciences department in Pasadena, California is\nAstronomy professor Michael Brown\nOr predictions are that the planet is in the region of the sky close to the constellation Orion which is one that everybody knows the constellation of Orion is a winter constellation that's when it's up in the sky that's when you can observe it most so we have to wait until the constellations up until the winter\nBefore we can start looking to where we think it is\nAnd in November what date will you start to remember first\n... that's not very far away what frequencies will you be looking in\nThe best way to search for this is actually just a visible wavelengths just like your eye because so far as the brightest part that we think it's going to have is just the sunlight reflected off of its upper atmosphere and so we're just going to look right at what you would see just taking pictures with a big telescope what about him for rent\nInfrared is actually is not going to be a very good one for searching simply because\nWe don't have any telescopes with really massive infrared detectors that can look at big areas of the sky at once once we find planet nine looking at it in the end for a study of will be very important but it's not probably the best way to look for\nYou isn't it amazing that all of this impact on the solar system the perturbations and even tilting the playing of the solar system six degrees to the sun that he would be caused by an object out in the ... cloud that we can't even yet\nI think it's pretty fun to think about it we just don't know where to look it it'll be easy to see once we know exactly where to look I suspect and then once we see it then we will study it in detail with probably you know every large telescope on the earth will suddenly swing another direction so it would be quite exciting when it's finally found\nThis new planet nine is hypothesized it'd be five thousand times more massive than Pluto that you've got knocked down to a dwarf planet [laughter]\nYeah so it's a good reminder of the difference between\nThings that are not real planets like Pluto and real planets sometimes people say oh this new planet nine it's just a little bit bigger than Pluto right like no no no it's five thousand times more massive this was what we mean when we say a planet and the other part of the solar system\nWhen we last talked I think you had two categories where might come from why use this massive object all the way out to the edge of the hype about going into the or cloud\nAnd you talked about possibly being captured rogue planet or not you were inside of our solar system where Neptune and urine is our but then he got knocked out my Saturn or Jupiter what do you think today\nI still favor the explanation that it came from inside our solar system and got knocked out by Jupiter Saturn but into we find it and know exactly what its orbit isn't exactly what its composition has\nAll of this is just speculation you can probably come up with so many different ideas to explain how I got there but once you find it I Hope will really start to learn why it's there and what it's made out of\nYou've been living with just now for three years do you have any sort of intuitive sense of what you could look like\nMy best guess is that it will look sort of like Neptune we think it's a Neptune like planets just a little bit less massive than up to him and so it'll be a gaseous atmosphere\nIt probably won't have clothes it's probably too cold have any close up in the atmosphere so in fact it might be quite bland a mostly just kind of\nGrayish white atmosphere with no features in it but it's easy to speculate that we're almost always surprised when we find real objects and so the one thing that I Know for sure is that there will be things about it that we never even thought about that are completely president\nExactly how far from earth to where you think this object is\nWe think is about five hundred times further distance than the distance from the earth to the sun so that puts it it's something like twenty times further than Neptune for example so it's a good ways out there\nAnd he is that a quarter of a light year\nOh no it's not even close to a quarter like ... it's about two and a half light days\nOr two and a half light games from earth is that the border between the rebels and your cloud\nWell that's actually really good question to which we now don't know the answer before we realized that there is a planet out there we thought we knew about the border but now that there is a planet where the border we thought was now we're less sure because we don't know what is beyond the planet and we don't quite know how the planet is affecting what this border is\nNews radio nine sixty WBRC [noise]\n[noise] [noise]\nFox News I'm Carmen

the future and can have devastating consequences\nRight now what her computer models showing to those of you who worked on the eye BCC report about what we can expect say in North America\nIn just the next decade because we've already reached another half degree warmer and it's projected that we may go up to two\nIt could be substantially\nWorse than even those ...\nBut the politics of the planet don't seem to be supporting dramatic reduction in the greenhouse gases in fact it seems that some of the larger nation the United states included\nMy adding poll now to an industry that we thought had ended\nThat we are going to be contributing ourselves to increasing amounts of greenhouse gases and accelerating the amount of warming so that we would be ourselves pushing the needle on the computer models in which there is even more rapid warming but\nUnfortunately you put your finger on my guess is that the politicians assumed that the problems will only become more severe once they're out of office\nAnd so if they are thinking of the next two to four to six years which does or most of the political offices\nThan they are assuming that they can cope with\nThat shorter period of time and it will be somebody else's problem or two decades from now\nMeanwhile we're facing the fact that there will probably be be a lot of people who are going to be forced out of homes and housing and what is the United states in the world going to do with what has to be future migrations away from coastline\nCertainly there will be in fact already are places that are having to be abandoned votes on the east coast around the Alaska due to rising sea levels and that will only continue to get worse we will have an increasing number of domestic migrants\nBut it's really the developing countries where their farm or people susceptible where they're likely to be enormous numbers affected by the level Roger I'm forced to migrate as their\nCities become inhabitable and that's really one of the things that the report highlights where you go ... billions of such migrants at one point five degrees but you had many tens of additional climate refugees as you grow up to two degrees\nAnd that will be a problem for all the wealthy countries because naturally you want to go somewhere where there are better prospects and so I think we can expect\nNorth America and Europe and parts of Asia to see lots of migrants coming from low latitudes\nAnd in fact I think we've already been seeing that in Europe that's part of the reasons for the Syrian civil war in ... all of the migrants that were coming up

with\nThe general audience that is growing around the world for my work and they like uh my YouTube channel\nWell just a three weeks ago and October third I was doing update on three categories the first had to do with the very distressing subject of half\nCats beheaded cats around the world bloodless\nWeird and Scotland Yard trying to get away with announcing that it was closing down its investigations after three years because they were trying to force people to believe that it was Fox is in a car wreck kill and that wasn't going over well with the u._k. population at all\nAnd then I was also doing an update about the sunspots solar observatory shut down I had a received a whistle blower email saying that are actually uh the child pornography was just funny deflection\nThat he actually involve the Chinese infiltrate or who had hacked into the observatories computers in order to spy on the sensitive white sands missile range in Harlem an air force base that down below the solar observatories nine thousand two hundred foot peak and then the third update\nHad evolved from my asking my profiles YouTube channel audience\nOn September twelfth if anyone had young childhood memories of floating out of body\nSpecifically I was asking for ages four to six approximately\nAnd I had received a huge number of emails\nAnd a lot of people were saying they never told anyone this before and this is what I was\nTalking about when the next morning\nOn October fourth floor a Moriarty who manages my are filed social media emailed me that a fan saw something weird happened in the video of the a stream the live stream\nSo I saw a video that Laurie sent me that was slowed down it was weird uh I sent the puzzle to a photo shop at video analysts I've worked with for years\nAt first I thought maybe it was an insect was over on a ... like something coming through the window up to the top of a book show\nAnd he did a video loop that you can see right now all of this at a ... report what are the smoky fog sometimes linked to afterlife returns you\nCan see the whole story and you can see the loop videos which are really strange and the reply that I got back from the photo shop analyst was\nThat he thinks this is truly anonymous\nAnd uh then I asked that second week I asked my earth files YouTube channel audience if anyone had ever seen Smokey fun like what was in my office\nAnd believe it or not a second I'm One of these whatever they are came between my hands and up to my right shoulder\nOn October seventeenth adding to the mystery of what is coming in and out of my office and uh people began writing me emails about their own experiences with the smoky fog is it like act applies than\nDo not know this is extremely a translucent and uh when I started reading the letters\nI began to see how heart felt\nThat there were people who were telling me they had never mentioned any of this parrot to loved ones to children to parent none they but but I started receiving these emails and one\nCame from a a he had been a retired airline ticket agent\nAnd his name he gave me permission to use is Charles hazard and he uh let me say\nHe said you can use my name and that I'm now from Sun City center Florida but what you're going to hear took place in Arkansas in two thousand and eight\nThinking about all of this is provoked by two episodes of a strange smoky fog in my office when I was working in live stream and that's what provoked him and hear now is Charles hazard\nOr talking about what happened to him in two thousand and eight from his now Sun City center Florida home\nMissed was in the spring of two thousand in age\nAnd I was preparing that morning for a group to come in the next day I was mowing the lawn during the campaign area on a riding mower and cleaning up the facility things of that nature\nSo at the end of the day after dinner I was ready to go to bed as soon as the sun went down I was very tired so after shower and I got into bed it was dark by that time I Can't remember about what kind of was maybe eight thirty in the evening\nI got into bed with the poverty level my show and just lay there and looked outside the leaves on the trees were not fully out yet so\nAt a very good view of the night sky with stars that I can see and then suddenly I just I was getting ready to close my eyes and suddenly I opened them again\nAnd through the window I can see this misty gray bomb drifting in through the window and I was just mesmerized but the thing about it was that in this dark bedroom it was luminous\nAnd I could see light within it and it was three dimensional was swirling in slowly kept coming towards me it looked like it was coming right for my head\nAnd I was just frozen fascination of\nI didn't know what to think then as it reached my forehead I could see in my mind off by three dimensional lighted hieroglyphics passing by my field of vision\nI was mesmerized by these hiring lives and the feeling that I was getting was a feeling of euphoria and one is with this living thing that was surrounding made\nAnd then at the same moment everything was happening at the same time at the same time I was getting all this information that was almost like answers to questions that haven't been asked out millennia\nAnd they were all be answered at the same time like all of these answers was coming I wasn't asking the questions\nThey were just coming to me and be answered simultaneously and I don't know why this was happening I was just going with it I don't even know how long this lasted it could have been just a moment but it seemed to go on forever and I didn't want it to end because of the feeling was so loving\nCan you describe the shape of a ... that you remember vividly and try to give us an impression of what kind of information was coming to you and was it like a word voice in your head tele possibly\nKnow there were no word there was no sound the hiring glitz almost like God was looking straight ahead and they were coming towards me and then going past the side of my head\nAnd I could see peripherally these high regrets but they had the same texture as the fog good would shadow in life\nBut they were living minutes at the same time and they were just float by me but kind of mean\nAt the same time like they were walking back and forth as they were passing by my head and as far as the information I was getting it was just almost like a download information\nThat was so quick that I was not able to grasp anything that was being given to me it was just a feeling that I was getting\nIt was almost like I knew every answer to every question like I was the super human genius or something that had all the answers to everything in the universe was indescribable it's really difficult to explain it felt like to me it wasn't for now\nAt that moment it was for something that was being given to me but I wouldn't remember any of it afterwards but it was for some time in the future that I was supposed to recall this information because it was like it was being given to me but I couldn't decipher it\nDid you have do any sub text in your mind or your soul about who we'd be doing this and why for the future\nNo the only thing I couldn't think of was that it made because of my past experience with ever since I was a child I've had psychic dreams\nDreams of having relationships with an entity\nThat was giving the instructions I can describe the entity to you as a very thin very white pale entity I couldn't see a face all I Know it was very skinny it had very long fingers\nOn that it would cause the nominees and tremendous amounts of flooding and I had now several emails I'm going to be doing stories on them about exactly this kind of thing and raising the question could there be a natural strange cycle\nInteracting with planets in our solar system that could relate to know is flood that is written about in genesis\nAnd that is how woven and a complex\nAll seem to be going that every single question is leading to answer that people are raising more issues and scientists are also coming forward and saying that they have information about

trying to share some of the more serious slices related to uh the issue of what might come back into this dimensional existence a after a death of sort of an afterlife\nI Would like to share with you and our coast audience an example of one of the many emails that I have been getting tonight\nAnd this is an indication that the quality and the heart felt and the profound email that I had been receiving these various categories having to do with out of body\nOr what the ... fog is and here I Want to read this came just a few minutes ago\nListening to you on coast to coast while writing this my father was very involved with World War two Pearl Harbor Hawaii survivors during his life\nHe passed away on December seventh two thousand and nine and was buried on December seventh before his burial I was sorting things out in his home office with his caregiver\nHe lived in this home for almost six years which I currently still owns that you do not live there\nWhile sorting out his items I was looking through the open door\nIn the laundry area hallway adjacent back door I saw a very sad thin moving horizontal Smokey grey fog go straight through the back door without it being opened up\nIt went through the door I did mention this to my wife son daughter in some close friends\nI Am an open minded conscious oriented person but immediate feeling was my dad showed me his spirit was leaving the home for good I Would have never expected to see the gray color\nI would've normally thought it would have been associated with something negative but he was a very positive person\nI have come to the conclusion that whatever part or level of his body consciousness soul left the house\nMay have been more like the gross more earthly matter in its purest form I had never heard the word smoky fog until you offered them up all night and this is what it's been in my own office and I have wondered\nIf it relates to a beloved cat that\nI lost a year ago and that that to the young one the big furry ones that everybody loves chocolate and fluffy now\nI just keep wondering couldn't have been that cat that I Love so much a or I have a cousin\nWho passed about four months ago she was Ninety six years old sharpest attack even a passing it was her body that gave out a she always said that she would try to show me that she had survive\nOn my mom and dad have been gone for a long time but you never know because I really do think that this foggy smoke that you can find Google when you start Googling foggy smoke you will see amazing photographs\nOr that resemble what has been in my office and if it is something from another dimension trying to come and get my attention and the YouTube channel I Wonder why have you ever encountered this charge\nNo I haven't had something like that but these are magnificent stories in emails I but I Do get a lot of emails from people who have had similar experiences yeah there's something very strange going on and you can\nYou cannot rule alone the fact that it's real yeah rules don't yes and that\nProfound I'm going to be doing an entire series and may and one of my uh end of November coast\nI think it's going to be with at least two

organic body what part is it\nThat is moving out from the body in out of body travel\nAnd there are all kinds of explanation in ancient each Egypt about there being nine parts to the body and the so complex but we don't even acknowledge our soul in the western world and it probably is the most important part of us\nAnd when you go back to ... ages four or five and six and you read these extraordinary emails coming from people who say in their opening sentences\nI have never told a single human being in my life and I am now provoked from listening to your asking the question on your YouTube channel have any of you at age four to six\nDo remember an out of body because that is significant where was the learning there was nobody teaching this is something that must be spontaneous

yeah in two thousand and two silver was four dollars announcing there at the cost of production we predicted silver would rise to thirty dollars announced within ten years people thought we were absolutely not nine years later silver hit forty eight dollars an hour and we weren't so nuts anymore\nNo not at all so what made you so sure that the price was going to make such a big move\nAll at the time silver was trading near its production costs an industrial demand was absolutely skyrocketing\nAnd why do you think a hundred dollar silver is possible now\nSolar in fact China alone is expected to need an amount of silver equal to half of the global annual mining production that just China the whole world is moving to China just recently California's now requiring all new homes to have solar panels there's just not enough silver supply that kind of demand\nSo we're going to see a shortage Kevin\nAll I can say is that some smart people like J. P. Morgan has accumulated the largest private stockpile of physical silver in the world more than a hundred and thirty million ounces that's over two billion dollars worth of silver I'm sure they're not doing it because they expect the price to go down\nThe hall I guess not but could silver reach higher than a hundred dollars announce\nHope you adjusted for inflation George Silver would have to be about a hundred and thirty dollars announced to reach its all time high so we think are one hundred dollars is well within reach one could that happen over the next seven to ten years but we believe most of the games will happen over the next three to five years just hard to ignore the potential in silver right now\nKevin our listeners are passionate you have anything that you can send out solicitors so they can find out more about a hundred dollar Schober [noise]\nWe do George or how to make a special offer for you it's our latest sky high silver report listeners can learn more about

intuitive feel\nIs that it it is a or was the spirit of loving cat of mine who passed a year ago um that that cat was like a human being to me a furry soul\nAnd uh several people around the world I've probably gotten twenty emails from people who Medicaid or are involved with various kinds of um meditation type of forms to access\nAnd they've all gotten the impression that both times that this has been my cat ah the the one that had passed and I feel that intuitively that gives me a comfortable feeling why shouldn't we\nBe educated about the possibility that a soul that passes because a body

overlooking York and when we sat down to talk and I'm staring at decorating pitch and blue eyes magnified by his black eye glasses or blue silver eyeglasses I said Mr pitch and have you ever in the

himself as a professional a truck driver and Christian minister both\nWas driving a about eleven thirty five pm he's driving north and his home town of West ranch went to his great amazement he saw a huge fireball come straight down out of the northern sky\nDescending vertically estimates and it was about the size of a full moon and the night sky pretty sizable\nAnd the interesting thing about this there's several things about it it had no tail and know injected no fragments from it\nAnd it had a bluish green glow coming from the bottom of it a very interesting report just a few minutes ago I checked the American media society to see if they had recorded a meteor site in there and I cannot find one for the same time and date location so\nMust have been a very interesting site in those mice as my suspicion [noise]\nThree and a half hours later in Winston Salem North Carolina gentleman walked out on a balcony to have a smoke and he became aware of the fact that something was directly above his head he looked up and he estimates not more than fifty or a hundred feet above him there\nWas a triangular crowd with orange and red lights on the trail a an edge of it and they flashing he could see later on in the site in a flashing bright red light on the a dorsal surface of the object\nVery interesting site and after the first object he saw moved to the east towards Winston Salem reports he realized that there was a second one above it headed a different direction added to the north instead of east\nAnd the second or two later and realize there was a third similar looking object in the night sky or make them in the mornings uh this is six o five am on Tuesday of this week the twenty third of October\n... very interesting report and he's provided for a very nice
