in a way they were sort of a victim of their own success because when they when they started Google Plus throughout its entire run\nGoogle decided not to put an ad on it so there was no ... there was no way to buy bonds or post right these are both things that drives people crazy or his book\nSo there was no separate income stream coming from it\nThe meantime everybody got kind of look or by Facebook into thinking well you got to have you got to have the ... post you got to have these things that are manipulating your your time lines and everything and they got a massive number of people

really didn't is they found that in a during a if I understand that during their on auditing their own security auditing and they didn't have any evidence that it had ever been exploited in other words it with a theoretical vulnerability but apparently nobody knew about it outside of school\nAnd the kinds of information that we're that we're theoretically vulnerable where like name and email

they were very right here that uh but I think I Hope people about the evidence that I was referring to people\nAnd we're interested in the fact that I was taking the time to research and write a book on this topic\nNow let's talk a little bit about some of the things you uncovered that you didn't really know about before to love of the ... cycle could nieces you you of course learned a little bit about them but you learn more as you did more be research the new\nYears ago during the television days they would hire anchor people lose people\nAre based on a system called the ... skin test and it was a series of electrical impulses that they would hook up with audience members to and then they chose videotapes of various anchor people and ... the ones that showed the most remarkable response\nFrom the audience because of the skin test they're the ones that got hired a they were looking for some kind of reaction from people and the person who just you know didn't register at all on the meter\nOr with the people in the audience and they never got hired I I don't know if they still use that or not but it was amazing technology back in the seventies\n[noise] well that's the type of technology that is being used in pre sentiment experiments measuring skin response\nMuseum work no cycle ... is the ability to move objects with your brain what did you uncover their\nRight again this is something that doesn't make any sense at all under the material is paradigm consciousness is considered to be at the phenomenon of the brain it comes out of the brain has no effect on the world\nWhat I found in my research is that that might not be true and I think the most compelling studies that had been controlled are once again that show very subtle effects\nAnd they were actually done a primarily at Princeton University which is interesting because I went to Princeton University and I had no idea of these studies were being run\nA Dr Robert Johnson who was the former dean of engineering a rocket scientist ran a lab for nearly Thirty years running these studies and he also look at remote viewing but he also he looked at psycho can east is which is disability for the mind that matter\nThe classic study uses random number generators these machines that spit out the heroes and once in a totally random fashion\nSo again if we look at probability overtime a random number generator will have fifty percent heroes and fifty percent one overtime\nOr what the experiment does it asks people to put their mental attention to the machine to make it produce more ones and zeroes for example and the person doesn't even have to be in the same room\nSo they say hey I'm pleased put your mental attention to the machine and make it produce more ones and zeroes again what do we find is that there is a small but highly statistically significant effect where it seems as though the mind is is changing the what used to be random behavior of the machines\nRandom generators picked up some incredible responses during the tragedy of nine eleven in two thousand one\nThey did not know what the time what was happening what was going to happen what they felt something was going on because these random generators mark just went ballistic and in ... people have that ability growing up\nThat's right George ... those to me or perhaps even more remarkable and this is part of the global consciousness project which which was an offshoot of the Princeton studies where these machines the random number generators were set up around the world so people weren't even necessarily aware that the machines were they're\nGenerating these numbers and what the experiment yours have done is looked at the behavior of the machines around the world around event\nThat we know are produced heightened emotions and nine eleven as one example where we know that people had heightened emotion and it happened at a constant ... basically in a single moment that we can look at what was happening when everyone was focusing their attention or many people are focusing their attention on the events\nWhat do we find that there was a spike at nine eleven but in the case of nine eleven which is even more fascinating to me is that the spike\nHappened before the plane hit the towers before the event yeah before the event which suggests almost a global pre premonition that this was going to happen\nOr a yellow her you know that name of course had an incredible ability or you've you believe what he did\nFor ... she had the ability to bend spoons keys and everything else with his mind now there are some who said dollars trickery its magic but do you believe that he had that ability he did some incredible things and a candidate B. taught\n... be taught\nWell I've heard of of spoon bending parties which sounds ridiculous but ah I've looked into it and it appears that people train themselves to be able to use their mind and ways to to affect matter beyond just a random number generator where it's actually\nBending metal for example and early ... is an example where many credible people have suggested that what he can do is real including um Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu who sat in a two thousand Fifteen television interview that he saw\nKeller Ben Ben spoons so there are many people who have suggested that this is real um but a side note on your a gal her very interesting I mentioned the CIA documents earlier\nThere's another document that I include in my book an end to upside down thinking that talks about Ehlers abilities but not in the context of spoons pending it's in the context of remote viewing mhm abilities and what they say again this is a direct quote from a classified document\nWhere he was he was put under very I mean they were watching him closely what the documents that is as a result of ... success in this experimental period we consider that he has demonstrated his paranormal perceptual ability in convincing and unambiguous manner\nSo\nYou know there has been a lot of debate about him but these documents suggest that studies were run and he was able to perform which I think should open up to the possibility

really really important one because if\nIf there is some truth in what people are experiencing beyond that was an Asian perhaps they give them into a window into a reality that we typically do it with her eyes that I I think we should explore this went further my perspective on it after having looked at the evidence\nTo me the most compelling evidence are the cardiac arrest studies known as ... cardiac arrest studies so this is where people have\nAre in cardiac arrest ... hate it and the experimenter as talk to them soon after they're able to uh soon after they've had the experience rather than asking people to remember something that might have happened twenty or Thirty years ago\nThat either cardiologist for example Dr ... a ... from Stony Brook is another one that we all scientists are looking at this and what they're finding is that some percentage of people who are in cardiac arrest\nCome back and describe this near death experience\nAnd why is that significant\nIn cardiac arrest severe physiological trauma in many cases the person is clinically dead we know that when the heart stopped after a certain amount of time there is no blood flow to the brain and the brain stopped functioning\nSo if there is minimal or no brain functioning we would not expect people to have these experiences that are so vivid to them and as I mentioned earlier sometimes what they report during the near death experience when they're out of their body in verified as being accurate later\nI'm One example in particular is\nFrom doctors and party up in a peer reviewed journal called resuscitation in two thousand fourteen\nOne of the patient in particular had a very vivid out of body experience where he heard something in the room it was later found to be the difficulty later and we know that that's happened during the time he had no brain functioning because of the time were being stamp and we know when that ... later went off and it made it very distinct it's down\nAnd yet this person came back and describe the sound in the room that happened when his brain was off\nWhere they've been cases as well where somebody\nIs literally gone through this near death experience there floating above their body they see the nurse and the doctor and everybody in attendance talking about the person you know well sorry we're losing enemies dying or whatever then they come the person comes back into his body\nAnd tells the attending doctor exactly what he heard in it boggles their mind\nAbsolutely it doesn't make sense according to this material is perspective that we need a functional brain in order to have conscious experience memories are but\nWhat I found is that there are very credible scientists that are looking at this for example the University of Virginia that division of perceptual study that the med school has looked at the very closely and Dr Bruce scraping as one person in particular\nWas looked at these phenomenon and it's finding that something is happening when the brain is not functional and people are able to report things like what you describe where they couldn't have known about things through normal means and it seems as though their brain was off and they said something that was accurate which is not by definition if not all of the nation\nMarquee Iran six hundred and twenty terrestrial radio stations as we speak and they're all sending out signals in the cities in markets that they are in you can't see those radio signals but they're out there\nIs that a little bit what what this is like consciousness were sending out signals that you can't really see but they're out there\nThat's such an important point I think we tend to be biased by what are ordinary a perceptual systems can tell us particularly our eyes and ears but we know it's not even controversial to say that our eyes show or a small sliver of the electromagnetic spectrum\nAnd what we're dealing with here may be something totally separate from the M spectrum but we know that our eyes only show us a very small sliver of reality so I Do think that maybe there are things beyond what our normal ordinary perceptual systems can show us at our existing but we just don't perceive them [noise]\nAll right let's take some calls here for you as they begin to line up and I've still got a whole slew of questions for you mark and by the way\nFor a non scientists you're doing an incredible job on this topic you've learned the law damage you [laughter]\nI have and I hope to summarize it in a way that a general audience can absorb it\nLet's go to bill from West Hartford Connecticut built by the way is an amateur astronomer and an atheist hey bill\nHi George Hi Hi Mark yes I Am a rational atheist than a materialist\nHowever I Do think that there is something to near death experiences I Do think there is this phenomena going on I just think regarding and the ... uh where where the mind I Would use the word mine not sold ... mind or ...\nOr or or exist temporarily during the ... is not heaven or hell in a religious and she was like there is no God or no devil I Would call an energy dimension or an energy universe and I have a new term for it I Would call it may be\nSeeing you ... you know space no time a dimension but my question do is to simply a I like to\nSort of question your whole premise by talking about site medications explains psychiatric medications\nFor either anxiety or depression whether it's anti anxiety drugs Claude ... anti depressants or major tranquilizers ...\nA theft chemically the brain and therefore they do affect\nChemical you the consciousness meaning the mind so by changing biologically biochemical brain to these medications or even aspirin or Tylenol ibuprofen can it can affect the brain that through the headaches going back to like ... it can affect the brain chemically we know that positively\nAnd in the mind that's my first part my second part of the same one question is\nAlzheimer's disease dementia affects the brain does affect the conscious as the mines doesn't the show and here's my question for you it doesn't show that\nIf the mine in the brain are not the same thing at least the brain is connected to the minus connected to the brains and I'm trying to say\nThank you very much for your question bill and this is something I Do address in the book and I've thought a lot about personally because we do know that there is a strong correlation between what happens in the brain and the type of conscious experience we have whether it's like medications or if someone gets in a car accident and then has cognitive impairments we know there's a correlation\nWhat I argue and and some others argue this as well is that\nCorrelation does not always imply causation in other words just because two things are related to one another we can't automatically conclude that one causes the other so here's this simplistic example from Dr Bernardo Castro when when I mentioned in my book\nImagine you have a fire lots of firefighters show up you have a larger fire more firefighters show up a very strong correlation between the size of the fire and the number of firefighters that appear at the scene\nWe know however that the firefighters did not cause the fire that's not the nature of the relationship\nBut the firefighters are highly related to the fire so I've used the brain in a bit of a different way with the brain is highly related to consciousness damage the brain takes psych med the brain and consciousness will be affected but the brain I view it more as like a filtering\nMechanism or like an antenna receiver which similarly which show a strong correlation between what's happening in the brain and conscious experience but it's not the producer of consciousness\nWhen what do you think mark reincarnation [noise]\nWell I have a chapter on that in my book and I know about the studies done at the University of Virginia I think there is evidence for it\nWe we've had some incredible stories to people who have talked about their past lives including little children uh and it just does remarkable when they're checked out\nThere's no way that they would know certain things unless they experienced it is it's it's mind boggling isn't it\n... George I agree with you it's chapter eleven of my book and I think the most compelling cases in addition to children being able to recall thing that they shouldn't have any way of knowing\nA man or sometimes verified by medical records by the use the professors is in some cases the children have birth marks or physical deformities that are very specific that matched the way the child describes dying in the previous life\nAnd in some cases the medical records are found so\nIt's it's something that's beyond genetics beyond environment which are the two factors typically considered to affect the physical something else was going on and the researchers call it a third factor\nOr a person's petrified of water and then somehow a in hypnosis they died in the past life by drowning let's say\nExactly so it's preferences and fears that somehow or transferred to something beyond the body seems to be a transfer from one existence to another ostensibly\nWe have Monique in Southern California with us I'm Monique go ahead\nBy George and why I have a question for your gas sure how I thank you for a ban on the show so I'm back in two thousand and one I experience [noise]\nOur molecules moving through an electric field are nervous system that's magnetism okay that's electricity\nIt's just the same thing when you were in fifth grade and your data a little dynamo with a wire wrapped around a a a a a close pen NATO electromagnetic or something same thing only we're talking about something at the fine it's fine if the frequencies if you will\nMean everything will be ... everything in the world can be defined by either it's density or its frequency\nOr ... or maybe all of this thing in the in film of organic life on earth which you know is is thinner than the skin of an orange on an orange\nOr is some old you know the whole guy at the whole you know very complex very very huge being that exist sits on its own timescale our lifetime of Seventy eighty years but but what abreast of the earth\nWhich you know again if everything to rise from consciousness that's the same thing that Michael ... talks about her I was conscious has swung\nSound like you're open to the possibility that there's something very unusual going on\nYes I'm In my work it might work I've often not often but several times over my career I had the opportunity to accompany a rural folks farm folks on\nDoubting with water which in yes okay I've seen it work the at work and then seeing the drillers calm\nAnd drill right to that same to adapt and there it is ... and ... you know again I'm a scientist okay so it's not that there's something there that we don't fully understand\nAnd can we say that it's the ... the person or is there some other force behind it\nWell let's suppose let's pose that uh the cows are and I've seen it with three different methods brass Raj wheeler sticks and tendons over a map mhm okay I'll watch pendulum over a map\nWhich was the most strangest one of all [laughter] that somebody could could could find water and yet there it is up comes to water [laughter] so\nAre is the Dow is there a particularly sensitive to the electromagnetic flocks in the earth caused by the water moving through various layers of conducting semi conducting insulating properties\nWho knows what she has a scientist we need to we in science\nCannot ignored in cannot ignore going all the way back the your guest mentioned William James okay all that whole period when all of this a lot of this early early research started to\nShall we say five to ... ... and other other sorts of things and I I I I've never seen a U.S I've never seen what I could call a UFO night sky and I've lived in places where the night sky was glorious\nI saw it when I never did before but I saw two\nYeah so I Can't I kept it but I Do all this stuff that has to do for instance a desert tortoises will show up at the mud hole the desert tortoise in the southwest will show up at the mud hole prior to when the rain\nComes within within just now maybe that's something to do with the change in the air pressure and they know that feeling yeah\nThey can feel it it's a it's they're reading but to the to the to to to the native folks that lived in that country that made that animal of pretty sacred animal\nAbsolutely let's get a quick reaction from you mark is the time was clicking by here no there's no question that if science skin see the things steam and just said we're on our way using it\nYet even raises a number of really good point about the need to study these phenomenon much more to understand the nuances of how it all works I don't think we understand some of the mechanisms because it hasn't been studied widely enough\nAnd that's largely because it's so taboo particularly an academic institution to even talk about these things\nI've talked to scientists who say that it's a academic suicide effectively to talk about these things before getting tenure\nSo that's another reason I really wanted to write the book and put the evidence in one place for people to hopefully open up the conversation so that it's not such a taboo topic\nWell Steven as a scientist admits that there's something very strange going on you know what it is but he's open to at least say that it's unusual in different than you know something could be happening\nMhm [noise] well we haven't talked much about quantum mechanics here but it's a field a physics\nThat has been around for over a hundred years which is accepted in the physics community as being real but it's totally counter intuitive\nThere's a phenomenon known as entanglements and the very basic phenomenon is you have two particles two pieces of matter that are physically distant from one another and when you affect one you affect the other simultaneously like an instantaneous effect\nWhich suggests that there's some hidden interconnectedness now I Albert Einstein did not like this at all he called it spooky action at a distance because he thought the speed of light was the fastest anything to travel and yet here we had an instantaneous connection between distant particles\nSo there are things in the ... the fabric of reality that are totally counter intuitive but we just don't feed them in our everyday lives\nHas this changed your life\n[noise] it absolutely has I think from the standpoint of\nUnderstanding human potential and what we can do tactically ... opened me up completely but also it's it's introduced this notion that interconnectedness the idea that we're not actually separate even though it appears that we are and that takes on it brings a whole new meaning to things like altruism which\nIf we're all connected than helping another is really a version of helping ourselves but to me that this has implications for interpersonal relationships all the way up to world peace\nAll right my friend mark thank you again one more time you bought your website and

chronicles stories from the wrong with the young known the unexplained and the unbelievable let me tell you about marine fifth generation psychic transfer medium for as far back as she can remember\nChoose communicated with the deceased at the age of Fifteen\nShe was introduced to a person who studied with laureen Cabot\nWas the official with chips Salem, Massachusetts and she took Moreno under her wing and Guided Tour and ways to not only understand\nBut also control the gift\nOf the age of Fifteen she served as the medium for adult sales says she's practiced studied and instructed metaphysical studies for more than twenty five years more has been with the New England ghost project since two thousand one and it was a company the group on more than one hundred investigations\nHere she is on the coast to coast Maureen welcome [noise]\nOh thank you so much for having me we could afford to this Fifteen Years old all this happened for you yes\nUh I Know as you're reading that I'm thinking oh my God that was only a few days ago right\n[laughter]\nTell me about Lori Cabot the official which have Salem\n[noise] you know he's very a\nA wonderful woman when I was at that age Fifteen you know she was someone that was rarely renowned in the city and she still is um she's known as you know the high priest is at Salem and feel often when I was younger\nI see her walking around town you know dressed and her her garb and very regal looking very um you know she's big presents for a person [noise] and ... at\nThe time to people welcome or with open arms you did they go oh my God there's a which\nYeah that's a great\nQuestion see you know there are many people that welcome her with open arms but let's just say the town Sam I'm not necessarily [laughter] so it always seems to be at those days it was a little bit of a battle between the businesses and you know and the town in Salem and those who really believed in the witchcraft\nAnd um so basically she did she really changed\nThe whole way they look at it now you know obviously it's a big tourism right\nFor the type of these and then it you know go to Sam I'm so I think that it really worked out well for the town of ... you\nKnow you are a fifth generation psychic trance medium that means we're talking about we back to your family you said the stability what\nYear are who did it start with\nNo my um\n[noise] it's interesting because growing up my mother just never really wanted to I don't know if you don't want to scare me she just you know my father though he thought the girls insane [laughter]\nUm but I Would come to her and talk to her about spirit that I was seeing and I mean it was normal I did it seem unusual I didn't have anything to judge it by um and my mother would just you know God Bless her she'd say oh he hasn't holy water you know just that you know she'd come my father she is normal\nUm but she didn't really discuss it with me a lot until I was older and I was still you know involved but say in a matter of physical and that spiritual around and one day I mean she was talking you know in their sixties she finally told me that she's you know what Marlene\nThis has been from my family for many many years like her great grandmother and you know her grandmother used to help people in town and he'll them of their illnesses and keep them stop them from bleeding and reading to them and she said you know I hear the spirit but I just turn up the radio\n[noise] so\nWould you say that there was a member of your family that was better than another member\n[noise] [noise] [noise] I never you know never really quite thought of that um I Would say that I had you know my grandmother died when she was twenty eight so\nI never really knew her um\nBut my great grand right grandmother rather I did know and she was the one who really got involved with doing reading for people so I heard that you know she was very trusted in her city or in her town um so it's hard to know I mean I don't know have a lot to really judge by in my family history of who was might have been stronger than another\nDid they ever passed down stories from one to the other the the you could carry through [noise]\n\nNow the only thing that I Do have was given to me and uh I have this little picture of you know and it was my grandmother actually before she had path and she was maybe ... maybe five years before she passed and it's interesting 'cause she had a picture of her and she looked like a gypsy\nUm and my mother used to joke about it and say that that you know that was her true self she was very unique that what you said so that the stories that God will always bits and pieces never never anything that was really concrete that I could say I'm about the earth anyway\nYou know you've been with the New England new ghost project Maureen since two thousand one would use that [noise]\nA well rounded doing much better than me to tell the story but he started this story\nAfter and a near death experience um and he had to work and do a um you know a special course our class that he took\nTo try to keep him busy when he was hailing from his illness\nI'm and basically have started doing a cable um you know he's got a cable program and during that cable program he had to do it on something so he chose you know feeling you know he goes that his workshop and again he'll do much better at explaining that I Would focus\nBut it's a team of individuals that\nYou know over the years I've learned is you know to me everybody is really you know it's a great team of people you work really hard to get to go out and look for things that go on for the night you know someone else doesn't really want to\nSee why look into that they're quite satisfied not knowing about the unknown all you have someone that really needs help there's been many calls over the years Iran and the team um that were you know businesses um you know\nYou know you'd have restaurants and they don't really want to\nDo I go out and tell the public all the time this was years ago they don't want to tell the public that something is going on that they can explain and people were getting a little freaked out and they need help so\nIt's really been a journey of love I think to go out and actually work because we're not paid you know it's not something that we get paid to go out and do investigations of people it's really going there to to just help them\nOr how many people are just off the wall when you go to their house and then you're just using it [noise]\nWell off the wall meaning terrified of spirit you off the wall just crazy\nYou know show [laughter] sure why his birds I guess\nUm you know as as it says we've done more than a hundred investigations um I Would say that you know not a hundred percent would we find something active going on at the time but we're big believers to know that you know it doesn't always happen on command\nUm so I really believe that there are a lot of supernatural things that are going on um if you aware and you're open to it you might experience it you know some people say well I've never seen it and I don't believe in that well isn't good reason why you don't see it\nUm so if you say how many people I'd say a good percentage of paranormal activity does take place out there and I would bet that if you did a poll and you ask people on the street you'd get a good amount of you know maybe Seventy percent of people have had some odd experience they can't really explain and their lives\nWhat do you conclude about what may be I mean a lot of people have their thoughts about what goes or what do you think there\n[noise] [noise]\nWell I think there are varying degrees\nOf what they could be right so our experience and my experience over the years has been\nYou know if I Do a reading for someone for instance um I get more of a loving spirit someone that's passed over that wants to communicate and come back and you know let their love when those are okay or maybe has a message for them that they weren't able to give before they pass\n'em but then you know you called out to some locations where\nYou know things aren't really going while someone's gotten thrown down the stairs items and being tossed around the house um\nThere's different you know events like say a you know people walking by and then you might see a spirit walk by and all these plants just die as they're looking at them um we had one case of a woman who was living by herself with the door\nTo door closed in her apartment and yet she was hit on the back of the head with a a ballot stripped from the stairs on you know all these\nOut she'd have something go on in the oven she'd go to put potatoes enroll them in foil and should lay down and take a nap while they're cooking and yet they would fire with starting her oven I'm it would wake her up with the alarms going off and she'd get up and look in the potatoes underneath on you know on the plane itself\nSo what do I think I think again as many different varying degrees of paranormal activity and not all of it just like you don't have a person that's\nJust overwhelming right sit there and so why is it is looking at me and we get in the house and he said I think I have a little girl in here spirit and you look around and the mayor is shattered in glass table can busted and it just looked like someone went through the house with a bat\nUm it was just torn apart and they were terrified and he said you know my phone's been ringing with all the Arabs on it and my wallet went missing and now he's telling me all the things that he kept saying I think it's a little girl and I'm like okay well let's see what we can pick up\nSo after a few minutes and thinking oh dear God this is not a little girl I could feel that you know spirit of a man very angry I'm very trying to get his message through and I thought wow you know this is a man now it's not and he was getting adamant that you know it wasn't and I talked\nTo use them brings us out of the house and now I'm thinking jeez what do we get ourselves into right I'm elite run up at the top of the driveway with the guy knew any dragged me down on the on the driveway and he looks at me he said I Want you to come back here tonight by yourself and I said\nWell you know I really don't feel it's a little girl you got to be careful you know you don't want to welcome in something that you don't know it's there and and he turned to me and he said look I just got out of jail for murdering\nMy best friend she said and I'm telling you right now that wouldn't be him and it's got to be a little girl and I want to hear and I thought oh God I just have to get out of here so that\nThat is scary hey we'll be back in the moment with more on coast to coast\nNews radio nine sixty W we are seeing [noise]\nFox News I'm Carmen Robert fear and dread in Florida as the strongest

was ghost hunting or while I was just doing normal stuff yeah\nI work with a lot of White House history funds for him and we do you know public goes on and that type of stuff and there are two separate occasions when I Do these goes to his own ... a bushel ... White House that we do these haunted toys and one time we were in the um [noise]\nIt's a like an observation tower where it's a square\nBuilding with glass all around you\nAnd say is when does all around you can absolutely see you know three hundred and sixty degrees and there was one daughter in and out of it and there was a group of people there and I began talking to them during my ... and I looked outside and I saw a woman a walking on the outside towards the door\nAnd she got about halfway down the the side of the wall you know going towards the door and I I stopped because I don't want to repeat myself ... she came and they didn't want her to missing anything so I I just waited for a night I saw her continually walk all the way to do it and I waited\nAnd waited and yet nobody came in so finally said is there anybody out there and there was a volunteer sitting on the rock out there and there was another one by the door and she's just notice there's nobody out there but yet I saw her as clear as day so clear that I had stopped my bill to wait for her to walk it\nAnd yet there was no one there and oddly enough that said vocation is with the ... because it's on the coast guard base a coast guard report and she and women walking on the wall in that same location so that was kind of intriguing I'm\nA ... the other one which is going to the opposite scale was on a Sunday Morning after we get a public or goes typed on uh what Iowa light hosts and a good fit pool meals in Maine we were in the White House ah keep his house it was on\nUm renovation at that time we were sitting on the picnic table in a in a room off the kitchen I look towards the kitchen I serve dog all across the or the kitchen and ah but I didn't hear anything you know how it drives you hear their claws on the\nYeah yeah the the the there was no it was founded outside\nJumped up and leave earlier in the kitchen\nAnd the dog to the door was closed\nSo I came back and spoke to a woman and she says why would you see that's just that's our dog she says to describe it sure absolutely as ours clear as day and I describe that she'd just stood there and\nShook her head and smiled at me and she says well you know Ron there was a White House keep it here who had a dog and when it was time for him to be relieved to leave the island or the dog wouldn't go so I Would die lighthouse keepers afterward took care of him till the dog actually died and I don't\nShe says the dog you describe pretty much matches because she has a dog\nThat that of that dog and I did see a picture of it looked like it but can I say that was it though I Know but so I mean these two things that I'm really not looking for goes but it certainly saw it would appear to me as a ...\nMinute still hangs around Ron stay with us we're going to bring Maureen back in both of you are old will take phone calls next on coast to coast am runs website of course is linked up at coast to coast am dot com and their latest book is called more ghost chronicles and\nFind out more about tonight's gifts logged on to go to ... am dot com\n[noise]\nFish signals I'm Bob ... with the discovery ... new advances in science and engineering from the national Science Foundation\nIt's as if the Spanish I Am each other only instead of a tiny British bone rather devise very many new electrical pulses to keep up with a B a best best fish friends and to navigate\nCertain fish one commonly referred to as a baby whale I've developed a unique security system produces incredibly short pulses of electricity [noise]\nIf you don't suppose thousandth of a second\nBut what's been communicated navigate while the looting the highly sensitive electric detection systems major predator catfish\n... trick\nResearchers with the University of Texas at Austin in Michigan State that's on mine shed light on human illnesses seems fish ... rely on a protein also bonding hearts muscles of humans routine believes we learn from the origin and mechanics\nWill do signaling ability could apply to the treatment of epilepsy where electrical pulses in brain muscles cause seizures their findings could also give us insights on migraines and some heart conditions also related to electrical signals on their pathways sounds like the electric fish are giving us a message to\nDiscover ... mind Bob Carson on news radio one oh five five WBRC\nHe was radio now you can tell you we are ... head on line nine sixty dealt with you we are ... dot com\nOn our radio see these three o'clock [noise]\nThis could be the strongest storm ever on Florida's panhandle ...

I don't know if you've seen that yet or\nNo I haven't seen that yeah it has a ... it's pretty that's your own\nIt's our number ... ... dot com but it's pretty cool sorry about that maybe\nWe can concentrate and bring nothing down from a for doing nothing\nThat would be good [laughter]\nWe've been able to do some of that so when when when you go on your team when your team gets together how much research do you do before you go\nWell Maureen doesn't do any because half the time she doesn't even know where we're going to you\nKnow she was telling us that you you don't want to ah influence\nI I have to know something about a for instance if you're going especially if you go into a big location you have to know a where the cost of tree you're you're investigating for instance if I'm there are a lot of noise is coming out of particular area you might want to concentrate your audio recordings serve\nIf for a A R a visual phenomena are in different locations you certainly want to uh you know put your cameras in there and and so you you ... you have to have a little bit of it I tried to get too much into the details with whoever the\nThe climate is for lack of a better word\nAre you there to discover the ghost or to cleanse it what what did they ask for\nI Am not I am there for ... strictly investigate\nThat's a popular question because then that was one of the things people will say when they read our first book was like oh you know\nYou know what were they doing you know they're not going they're releasing spirits and you know those are things you hear from people but you know they love the book but the whole point is is as one and I've always talked about you know some of those parents have been there long before we have\nUm and we don't know why they're there right so we don't necessarily know if they want help to move on and that's one thing if they're there and they don't want to leave who are we to tell them to that they have to\nGo to the person who brings you when do they want that goes out of there\nI always ask them you know what you want from us you know basically a you know what you expect for us in a in a very of the cases on that if they're looking for someone who watch like a house ... we're not going to do it without you know or are we from someone else\nUm but if they wanted to investigate this to understand what's going on and try to understand what's going on than will do that type of case\nAll right let's take some calls we both to view let's go to brandy and granted big California walking to the program I brandy\nHuh okay thank you for taking my call um [noise] yeah I had a question and I've had a really really rough year\nAfter year I'd probably the worst year of my life and [noise] and I'm Wondering if you are able to tell me if you see you here next coming or being a lot better [laughter] hopefully starting to go more my way\nMarine this would be for you\nThat's for sure yes [laughter] yes at what um okay so Brandi I did pull a couple of cards for you on and honestly\nOne of the things that I see is a lot of emotional turmoil right so that you it seems like you're holding on to a lot of hurt\nThat have been happening around you right um and I obviously don't want to get too personal um but you know and the other kind of poll is you know this was last year in our things that have been happening is like a pressure right so because of all these things going around you it feels like your hands are tied and you're not able to move forward\nOn what I Would tell you is that for you to get to a better place you really need to trust you need to let go of some of these things that are you know in your life that I hate to say it but even even if there is um like a health issue that is taking place it's a learning lesson right now for you\nUm and it's a time for you to grow and you have to be able to to trust that it's not going to be this way all the time and I know that might sound cliche but\nI'm calling these cards around you and it tells me that you know you're really trying um but you're having a hard time you're like okay where do I begin to let this go on and you're doing a good job of trying to act the part I feel like you're going through your daily day routines are really trying to put it on a mask but you're not\nFeeling it is that correct or know a right [noise] yeah okay right so\nPut ... think of it this way right so if you know I see that there's a healing hand that you have and I used to me you up and go to person feels like a lot of people that when they come to you and they have an issue is that correct\n\nThat you tend to be the ear that people talk to someone I was there\nYeah yeah [laughter] okay so you need to know that you know you have to have\nPatience with yourself and your situation okay um how many is coming so know that you you are coming to a breakthrough it is going to get better but I think a lot of it is knowing it's going to get better you know you have to put yourself in a place that's like a catch twenty two right so you almost have to feel it\nFeel that strength inside of you again which you're kind of like well how do I get that back\nUm and a lot of it is balance right is finding a balance in your life is what you really need to do at this moment\nAlright thanks good luck brand new hope everything works out for you\nDuring this time do you do you find Ron in marine that these investigations are more prevalent during Halloween season or does it matter\n[laughter] [laughter] it it doesn't matter but you know what\nEven Ron I'm sure would agree is early on I mean a lot of people have that and they think well it's October Halloween season right we need to be out there um and I'd say over the years that might have started when I joined the group that was more it was busier around that time of year but now I think Ron would say is probably isn't constantly\nMaureen what do you think we gee boards\n[laughter] funny you bring that up um you know I think that they're a tool I don't\nThink that's something to be afraid of them I just think it's the intention that you use when you're using that we ... so if you're you know you're drinking you're using the ... then that's probably not a good idea um because you're not\nOpen and you're not protecting yourself and um we had a actually a case of a woman who had some issues by using and we'd be bored and I believe she lives on\nHaving you know getting high at the time or whatever she was doing 'em and she invited the spirit in and her how her whole life rather went into chaos her home burnt down a she pretty much lost everything uh and we were actually called in an investigation on a different home she lives in that she was now losing that home\nUm so I I don't know what do you think about it wrong [noise]\nYou know a a a bite parish priest called me and asked me the same question what do you think of what we do boards\nI says I've got a collection of the the games [laughter] uh and uh I Do I have a collection of all different ones for use those most good parent how confess the kid is too\nBut not go on to say though

interfere with and we see what we see we feel we're we feel things move they move\nBut this is my question my questions in all the tragedy\nThat don't happen on this planet\nAnd and that's not excluding things have happened right here in this country if\nThe protocol the goals would be because you have had tragedies\nOr or in your life that took away your life then there would be more goes on this planet and it will be people\nAnd just let's just deal with the United states itself I mean uh I Am part Cherokee and so I'm just saying the tragedy happened in them and all other people Jews all over the world\nWhat is the protocol to be a goal and if you believe in there if it's not the matrix\nOr could you ever consider this being the matrix and the numbers you just not calculating that these are the way it should be that is my question\nThank you for your joined or music or their George I love all your news all the way from bluegrass dude sold to everything from the years you been playing your number one when it comes to that\nAll right my friend more to come so what what what is the definition Ron oh what a ... a ghost becomes why does it become a ghost\nLots of sixty four thousand dollar question Georgian\nEnvy honestly we really don't know exactly what a ghost is I mean ah when I first started doing this I used to work with a Franciscan monks and we had a cause a religious aspects of it\nAnd we come up with the feeling that maybe some of this is the the purgatory thing not like it's a punishment but rather\nIts place it's a temporal thing versus the and visit the thing so I mean that's just going on during their time basically but that's I mean that's the only one third of there are many three shifts the tragedy thing is one I always worried about in\nGettysburg was always supposed to be the most hard then that's why that's the most thing but there are there are battles I mean Nagasaki and you I mean thousands of people will tell like that why are we seeing like almost goes from running around so there's got to be certain aspects of that we were unaware of or or have yet to\nDetermine and a ... and really be quite honestly nobody knows exactly for sure we have a ... and that's all it is\nAre there any friendly ghosts like Casper or are they all the time the evil\n[laughter] well well yeah I mean what's what's the guardian angel what's a you know spirit guide or a ... not the ghost to maybe\n... I guess it depends on what the definition of the ghost might be I mean if somebody sees their dead grandmother at the side of the bed is that a ghost\nIs that some kind of entity your spirit or or one of his name\nNumber one I always say that number one citing is is what I Believe is a messenger goes that's somebody who is just passed away and they they either come back to see how you're doing or let them know that let you know that there are okay I mean it happened to my mom my mom didn't believe in goes or anything my dad died at a company I mean as failing cookout\nThey've got to say goodbye that night uh she was in bed she swears he came in fully dressed in a suit she scared the crap and she screamed and he disappeared but there are countless examples of that uh throughout history\nIt's got a shade in billings Montana first time caller squeeze shaded and go ahead and she then\nWe're going great thank you\nA question uh last night you were talking about spirit guide a little bit and it really piqued my interest in night my interest is once again I'm actually had a question from ... sure\nUm I've had numerous people throughout my life come up to me and told me there's something\nAnd then what and they can never give me a straight answer I've always been curious as to what it is\nAnd have you have you felt that you had something following you\nOh my entire life you have\nFrom my from my early childhood I felt there is something falling or how to experience when I was about seven years old my backyard my parents were both inside the house and I came in house screaming because some some things fit\nIn my name into my ear and it made my ear vibrate\nBox that my ... now have you ever you sell voice\nHave you felt threatened or do you feel secure with whatever entity is doing this\nYou know it's kind of a car and I feel your ... and then there are times when I feel like I don't ever feel like it's trying to harm me but I Do feel like there are certain people in my life that goes into effect in ways\nAnd interesting what let me tell you in the in the short time we have left\nMy experience is that if these entities aren't hurting you uh the the I don't think you have much to worry about Maureen we've only got about thirty seconds left would you agree with that if he's not being heard that the these entities aren't out to really hurt him\nAbsolutely and I was gonna say George you get a great job because that was the same thing I Would ask because typically I don't think it's a who I mean what something is following I think that if someone\nUm and I think it's more of a relative it's like a guy named bill that's looking over you know maybe there will be watching out for you and sometimes not as gentle when they speak with you but I don't think they're there to harm you\nAll right both of you thank you so much for being on the program the name of the book is called more ghost chronicles it's really a great read if you're in the ghost stories and the supernatural dishes [noise]\nFernando auntie Tom damned highs or Lisa lion leaped Sloan heard John Law the shores Stephanie Smith Chris boroughs Tim ...

people you know there's this story for going on for ages with a ghost town there's nobody out millions and millions of people use it very happy with it I've been very happy with it\n[noise] really in a way they were sort of a victim of their own success because when they when they started Google Plus throughout its entire run Google decided not to put an ad on it so there was no ... there was no way to buy sponsored posts right these are both things that drives people crazy or his book\nSo there was no separate income stream coming from it\nIn the meantime everybody got kind of look or by Facebook into thinking well you gotta have the ads you gotta have sponsored post you got to have these things that are manipulating your your time lines and everything and they got a massive number of people onto their platform now of course a lot of people are kind of regret it given what's going on\nBut sizes everything was social media of scale is everything and Google just never really got that scale now this brief that occurred\n... of the right at the top ... uh they currently found out about this for a month ago they should have publicly about that at that time [noise]\nApparently there is that they really didn't if they found that in a during a if I understand that during their own auditing their own security auditing and they didn't have any evidence that it had ever been exploited in other words it with a theoretical vulnerability but apparently nobody knew about it outside of school\nAnd the kinds of information that were that were um theoretically vulnerable where like name and email address no credit card numbers do financial information nothing like that law that stuff that people have with Facebook so they said well why stir things up when there's so much going on right now I mean that's my interpretation\nAnd they cut us out on it and write and now of course it kind of makes it a convenient\nI won't say excuse but ... it convenient to kind of a rationale for setting into motion to fund the setting of Google Plus over a period of about a month but they they should have\n... discuss that publicly of the first place um and uh it would've been a lot better all around if they had in the meantime all of us who've been using Google Plus all these years or try to find other places to go where experimenting with other things and I mentioned that there the Google commercial version of Google Plus\nWhich operates further Gees we the the the business systems where you pay about five bucks a month or per head using us that's going to continue so Google Plus we'll be continuing commercially\nUh and then we'll just have to see what happens competing with Facebook probably a ... and facebooks turf with probably not a good idea and the first place and that's the time at ... at the end at the time that it seemed like a logical thing to do you know you don't want to miss out\nBut as we've seen the way Facebook did it to to have that an enormous growth has now trip them up and a lot of serious ways to so there's positives and negatives to all these\nAnd one quick question I hear Snapchat is going broke who do you hear\nA apparently Snapchat having all kinds of all kinds of problems um I guess their stock has been a wall up\nYeah that's a very well uh their their founder has been sending out there you know kind of\nMessages to the troops to kind of ... try to cheer them up\nUh it it it appears that some pretty serious mistakes were made along the way when they when they tried to grow\nA that's you know that can happen when you're trying to grow rapidly ... you can live off the ball and you as you can really uh fall flat later on whether or not snapshot ... step chat will be able to pull out of this I I don't know but right now
