that we're living in an extraordinary time saying why now and that just trying to keep balance and stay on the cutting edge\nHow did you end up doing what you're doing\nHow does that all\n[noise] well it started when I was a rebellious kid in Detroit and feeling like I wanted to change the world that had no way to do that and that I had a couple of experiences started\nWith uh being somewhere I shouldn't have been with somebody I shouldn't have been with a closing time in the bar on the back of a motorcycle and we got hit by a drunk driver\nThe room my body off the motorcycle and\nUm I had a real physical tangible out of body experience and watched my body tumbling through the air landing on the concrete and I think there was something in that moment that suggests that any way that consciousness is more than just their physical ...\nAnd then I went home to heal and they had talked about passively amputated my leg and I laid there and I used my imagination to visualize my immune system healing me and I was you know really aware of the tangles up my leg\n... you know now I have to start the legs and I think that consciousness is something powerful\nAnd we're going to talk about you your first experience near death experience you were just a year and a half year old weren't you\nKnow that's true I was wandering around my family's house in my ... and being a good in Paris is which means you investigate everything\nWould you have those little feet pajamas I think so I don't really remember\nBut I've heard tales and ah anyway my father had inadvertently left a can of lighter fluid sitting on a kitchen table and my God and you know I did what good Eighteen month old kids do and I put\nIt in my mouth and I ended up in and out of intense drinking I drank it and it causes massive pneumonia and\nI almost didn't make it so I think that there were some seeds planted then too that got me on this path of wanting to understand consciousness\nSomebody once you were wrong\nAnd I guess that's a nice way to think about\nYou do know I was born in Detroit and raised there and left there when I was twenty eight years old\nI think I knew that but I didn't remember in town now so tell me where was\nThat I was born in the city and then we ended up moving to Dearborn Heights a war we spent most of my childhood and then uh my first places I was in Taylor, Michigan Farmington Hills\nAnd then worked in all three television stations in Detroit to four and seven\nAnd then in Nineteen Seventy nine I moved to to Nineteen Seventy eight I moved to Minneapolis a Nineteen Seventy nine I moved to St Louis knowing back and forth between St Louis in Los Angeles how about you know\nWell I was right in Detroit right near city airport and that it was about the time I figured out I could leave that I left and you know I still have a lot of nostalgia for Detroit and a lot of admiration for the people that are trying to make a difference there\nFamily still there I have some family um they moved out to Harrison township where I had my motor motorcycle accident\nUh-huh you're born ...\nReally yeah well if\nYou told me where cars you must remember this the the street\nOh I don't I doubt who was ... was it a busy street yeah\nWith history but it was late and I think the trauma kind of over\nAnd I was going to I'm going to I'm going to close my eyes in yes you'll remote dealing now that you were on telegraph road\nThat sounds that sounds about right\nNear Michigan viewing skill near Michigan avenue\nYeah that sounds about right I Can't remember exactly to say for sure but I'm sure there's records\nOf it and you're back here my gosh\nYeah well thank you my friend I preach\nShe'll do solves really steer you in the direction where you are now I mean you've got a PHD and social anthropology you've just been elected a vice president of the Psychological Association will get into that but is this what leads a foundation for you\n[noise] [noise] well I think I really started when I got to Wayne State University in downtown Detroit which you'll remember\nI Do and what time versus the Detroit\nGood one oh really so that is right downtown yeah\nUm well I discovered to books when I got into college in the first one was Thomas ... book called the structure of scientific revolution and that book that that we live in a paradigm or a world view I kind of social construction of reality\nAnd that that world view has changed periodically through history\nAnd that was a big empowerment for me because I felt like well maybe what we're experiencing in Detroit this you know kind of civil war that was going on the race war and class war and gender war and ultimately a worldview conflict I think that\nUm maybe wasn't permanent and maybe wasn't defined by ultimate reality so that was liberating and then that led me to the second book which was psychic exploration by Edgar Mitchell the Apollo fourteen astronaut regard and I didn't apply for the job at no attic sciences but it was about\n... Fifteen Years later that they invited me to come and be there director of research and worked my way up the ladder from their\nNon Europe show for your university no\nThat's right we are looking at ... personal experiences and from a psychological and\nNow what is the trench personal cycle what is the\nStuff you're interested in George it's all that kind of a notion that there are aspects of our experience that transcend the physical\nThat people can have these kind of altered states or near death or out of body type of experiences and it doesn't mean it's pathological it means that may be a catalyst for some big breakthrough the understanding more about who we are and what the nature of reality might be\nMore with Dr Merrill Lynch ... just like the beer run\nIs really only\nWell it's you know it comes from an old brewery village in Germany ... but ah actually ... brewery what she'll remember I remember the Troy lists and so\nThe beer that made Milwaukee famous actually is now Detroit beer at least last time I checked\nThe ... the huge do college which we're you know I don't know I haven't really ... yes well I'm sure\nRight although micro breweries have taken over\nWhat would it be you know what have you learned about new experience of all the other side what to do what can you conclude at this point\nWell I Know that culture takes a big role in defining what we experience so if we're told our entire life through our educational system and our families are work environment\nThat the only real valid reality is the physical you know that which we can measure and manipulate and\nTouch and paste a then that's usually what we see and if we are brought up in a world your a culture that except\nExtended realms of possibility then more and more likely to perceive those realms of possibility and some of it may be a cultural construction but I also believe\nVery definitely that there are more aspects of our human experience than just our physical embody met\nYou people can tap into this and use it in their living life I think they can do some remarkable things with that don't you\nI really do I think that if we start to own the power of our intention\nYou know the fact that the intention is very important principle so from the morning when we get out of bed and we intend to ... you know make up a path or a plan going forward that's an expression of intention\nUh and then what about those big intentions where we want to achieve something\nYou know beyond our normal capacity that becomes a tremendous empowerment and so to the extent we can begin to cultivate these abilities I think the more we'll be able to accomplish those dreams that many of us have\nHave you come across any doing much do ...

well regarded worked with him for years wonderful person Edgar said in the interview I did with him for death makes like possible that you know I mean I was really interested in his story because\nHe was a person who had been fighting in Korea he had been a test pilot and he talked about you know being on those\nAircraft carriers where when they would go off on a mission and then they had to come back and find the aircraft carrier in the middle of the ocean it was like a needle in a haystack\nAnd so for him that was a scary moment when he got in the Apollo capsule and went to the moon he said you know there were plenty of space on the moon and it was hard to find\n'em but you know his thing that he said that I thought was so wise is that he felt that was much more important\nTo live a good life and to be a good citizen I'm to be loving unkind toward other people than it was to spend a lot of time worrying about what's going to happen next and I just thought that you know it's a powerful notion and he was a great man\nUsed their descended of evidence to prove that there's life after death\nIf you are like quarter law and she knew this was challenged debts was challenged could you prove that there's life after death\n[noise] so this wouldn't make a great reality show and I remember you Ina courtroom let's do it\n[laughter] so you have a judge in a jury and you have people representing different points of view on controversial topics so take this one you know life after death and you have these people arguing their various position\nWith witnesses that come and go\nHey exactly giving their own personal testimony based on their experiences\nWe ... put it right there\nAnd then you get into this question of what\nOne shift people's mind about that question\nAnd is it that data is it the fact that in Stevenson collected these you know nearly a thousand cases and showed that thirty five percent of them correlated with the birth mark is that what's going to persuade people or is it the personal experiences that somebody's reporting\nYou know I had a conversation with my departed dad and he told me to go to this closet and find something you know that's really persuasive for people much more than accumulating a lot of data I think\nI I think so too Dr Merrill Lynch blitz were those were going to take phone calls next hour\nAbout life after death let's talk a little bit Marilyn and the time we have remaining here about consciousness and how important it please and its role but it plays with all of this what would you first of all say consciousness is\nWell I think again we can have many definitions for me it's been about our awareness and also\nOur lack of awareness of what we're not aware of so by that I mean when I first talked about Thomas Kunz book on paradigm shifts we live in a paradigm or a world of you and the interesting thing to me about world is is that we don't even know that we have them\nAnd yet they're the most important thing that shapes her experience so it's like we're walking through life with these colored glasses on and it\nIt shaped our experiences and so we can't see those things that lie outside of our expectation and I think part of the process of becoming aware\nIs becoming aware that we're not aware\nAnd that we have what's called an attentional blindness for example we are primed to perceive those parts of the world that we expect to see and if we don't expect to see them we simply don't see them\nAnd I think that that is a remarkable uh aspect of what our consciousness is all about it's a lot of a functioning on auto pilot at the unconscious level\nAnd to the extent we can you know turn the light on what those experiences are and what Shapes Our awareness where are we placing our attention that then offers that's the point of liberation and to expanding what we understand to be true\nOr do you believe that the consciousness lives outside of the brain\nI Do I think consciousness is something that has intelligence it is self correcting it is reflective\nAnd so you can go into a rain forest and see that as consciousness manifest in the forest because\nEvery ... is filled with life and with that intention to manifest life and so I I Do believe that consciousness as something much bigger than our individual brain\nI don't think it's an ... phenomenon of the brain and at the same time I think the brain is kind of like you know the radio that is taking the signal and so if you destroy the brain you may destroyed the radio it doesn't mean you've destroyed the consciousness\nOr the signal or the signal exactly\nKeeps coming ... exactly will will science ever meet\nThe spiritual side of all of this\nI think so I mean I think we're getting closer and closer all the time I just spent time with Sophia the Android she's a robot New Hartford and both her\nYeah she'd be great for you to interview 'em and see if they would do it in a way that doesn't give me

after death\n[noise] I think most people believe there's something there I think people have had experiences that give them a sense that I think that there are a lot of experiences that people report you know\nBeyond the survival of consciousness or identity you know people ... reporting of like pre cognition knowledge of the future uh people\nYou know doing what you did about looking into your mind for information about a geographical location whole remote viewing paradigm they're all kinds of experiences that people have had that they report regularly and that the majority of our population in including people with\nHigher levels of education\nSo this isn't just something that people experience and they have no education and you know the critics would say you know they just don't know any better uh in fact what it is it's something that people have very direct personal experiences about and which can change their life\nAnd you have written in the book how some people's lives have been changed dramatically through this change\n[noise] yeah I wrote a book called living deeply the art and science of transformation and we were very interested in trying to understand how people\nCan gain a perspective on life that is richer and fuller and less filled with stress and anxiety and\nHow can we do that and we know that a lot of people can become very rigid and fixed in their perspective and opinions but it's also possible that people\nYou know begin to shift their perspective and these kinds of experiences can lead to the sense that the world is more expansive and more complex and more\nMysterious then we had previously understood so we started to interview people about it we talked to the mistakes and we talked to the great spiritual leaders and people representing different kinds of\nYou know traditional a ritual practice type of orientation send and that in that we really created kind of a change model that said to us that there are ways in which we can\nBegin to bring our awareness and our intention to creating our life in ways that are are positive are um imbued with meaning and purpose and that ultimately lead to happier healthier experiences\nHog the younger people react to these things now what do you think\nWell I think we have seen a generation of people grow up with the media with video games that expand their sense of what they're capable of\nUh there's certainly a lot of fascination with I you know horror movies I think you were talking about that last program you know I think our imaginations are very fertile I think\nPopular culture has a way of training us and we know that these kinds of topics are extremely interesting for people who choose TV shows or movies to go see so what's that about you know is that about\nJust something that is idle curiosity or is it something that helps them to take a deep dive into their own personal experiences and I think the latter maybe what's happening\nWants to take some calls will pick it up I'm going to Giovanni in Los Angeles on the wild card line who either Giovanni\nHey how's it going your greet me it's been a war\nIt has been a while and I'm always listening I Love the show as always and a doctor Maryland thank you so much for the work that you're doing on consciousness absolutely that's very your pioneer and I hope you continue doing your work and I hope that this uh this this birth more\nUh wander in and and and after you off into this world\nBut uh I just wanted to share that experience of mine but I just really springs to mind when I heard you talk about the about the forests are about the jungles it ended up being a form of consciousness or out of a of kind of a a pure consciousness\nWell my parents are from Nicaragua and uh our our indigenous people are\nVery very uh very rich culture of ah of mysticism and and also a you know being able to travel into you know in three dimensional early and and uh and explored the potential of the mind\nThrough um through an ancient practices and so it's been instilled in me over time uh the practice meditation one uh one one one one moment at one time I'm\nOn my travels I was probably Nicaragua and the Nick and Nick and in Nicaragua there's a a jungle called luck than on negative or roughly transmitted the black a jungle and ah this this lack jungle is just is an illusion jungle it's\nMost of it is untouched by man very rarely ex lord still still rich with with a with a with undiscovered of it\nYou know what's out there but when I was in the jungle like I sat down to meditate and while I was meditating maybe an hour into my meditation I felt what I believed\nTo be this pure consciousness I felt the jungle\nCalling you ask me now it was so strong that I had trouble breaking for my meditation and and to a certain point I became a little bit\nHammered a bit bit fearful because I was I kind of lost control over my ability to extract myself from the meditation for a moment and I believe that this pure consciousness was was calling me or or or trying to pull me into it\nSomehow and I wanted to share that consciousness I Do believe that there's more out there absolutely\nAnd uh the more we explore the more we'll find it's like you say if we put it into our mind that there's something there and we will find it as opposed to\nYou're always hoping she'd get

that people who have these kinds of experiences begin to reflect on a world view that is more imbued with meaning and less reduced to material is\nAnd that's really important and I think that um you know the whole world view engaged in questioning a wonder you know love\nDoesn't necessarily translate into a conventional story around what is God I think that some reverence for the mystery maybe a
