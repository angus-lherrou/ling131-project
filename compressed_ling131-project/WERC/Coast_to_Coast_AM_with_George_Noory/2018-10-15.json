mentions and in illustrates two things is there and desert Fox just tweeted is there a second ... thinks well there's two things is there\nThe pay for that minute published last week he's on his website we're going to be discussing this uh tonight on the show like on my news website over a coast to coast am it'll take history there there are elusive papers on the right hand side\nThe current neighbor is the one that is on the town\nNow with your uh analysis here minute it gets a little complicated a little technical\nBut the idea behind it is actually quite simple in an allegation which is is that some of the layers have a different thickness in stone and take us through bad\nYeah um when when you when you're standing in front of the pyramid and you look up the walls are you when you stand close you don't notice there's so much but when you go further away let's say you're in your hotel and you have a pyramid view\nYou start noticing that there is a certain texture to the pyramid and um ah the review are or who was it was very well known or ... or drop your who don't we reviewed my paper or he calls the waves and I call it sort of a federal effect\nUm and so when you look at the details of that which was published by Clinton as petri a hundred and fifty years ago who actually measured each individual course as a function of total height\nYou then you actually see the numbers and so there is these uh you know you you start with really thick courses and as you get to the top of the courses get thinner but every once in a while there is a jump so uh you have a much thicker course\nAnd then the thickness tapers off and then it resumes the overall trend which is a thinning trend and then you have another sudden jump in thickness and just keeps on going and going for twenty three times as far as I'm as far as I see there's twenty three peaks like that [noise]\nUm and ah and then\nBefore each one of these jobs petri noted that uh if you calculate the surface area of course and you divide that surface area by the surface area at the base some of these peaks\nHave around fraction of twenty fifth so you know one twenty fifth to twenty fifth ... so he found that there are round fractions of twenty fifth associated with some of these ... courses and that was it uh it was not for the interpreted what does it mean\nA it was just noted but uh it just sat there um until I took a look at it again\nNow how many layers total and ... and the forty two story great German how many rows\nYeah two hundred three left and probably two hundred and ten a originally\nTwo hundred and ten originally is there and I have to have to immediately say there are some researchers who say the\nPyramid was not completed there was a they say that was there was a virtual top so it was actually ... at the top\nAnd the rest was a maybe a as fear and you know the one of the the most prominent researchers proposes is Robert ... bother jump off of all and the papers on I think it's on a Robert Duvall ths or\nAcademia a page and it's also in cosmic womb uh his brother vote to attend these he's in the back of the book where he explains this theory so there are some people that I think the pyramid was not coming to a peek a and now of course other people\nThey it was ... and so theoretically at least you can say to on a course\nNow we have is there a consistency to the ah repeating of Ficre layers\n[noise] um [noise]\nIs it every ten steps is that every twelve is there is some kind of ... you\nKnow that's a great question I I that was the first thing also I was looking for it but unfortunately unfortunately no it's not that easy it's it's kind of what you do what you mean it's kind of haphazard has to be honest with you I I'm I was just struck when I first saw that I was just struck why did they do this\nBecause you know you were just you know simple minded me I thought each step they weren't just applied the uh the pyramid and go you know in Egyptian Egyptians designed appearing it's with something called they called ... which is the German and go\nAnd it's a you know when you walk up a staircase basically for each amount that you go you go a certain amount Ford and that's how it conceptualize a pyramid angle so I thought you know each course it should be the same amount like you're going up a staircase each step is the same\nAnd and it's not and and uh and all of a sudden you know the steps gets much thicker\nAnd chew question again there's no regularity even to the thickness so when you know it's it's completely off hazardous but of course you know I think I Know the answer it has to do with the interior architecture it has to do with spaces inside\nAnd we'll get to that uh after the break but what is most amazing to me about this is that with the different layers of which there are a\nCouple of dozen that are decker yeah that the orientation for the pyramid that it still ended up at the right angle on all four sides\nYeah a to complete the pyramid correctly without any errors but that's an engineering feat that is just beyond comprehension\nWhich which to me I Want it to correct something I said in a shape to block interview I I think I said that uh belong to a shot a shop to ... and ... published that al ... was disappearing or during\nThe twenty seventh century so I I I wanted to correct that it wasn't a case in a big dip her it was a star Iraq\nSo it was starting to disappear in the southern part of the country\nAnd because of that because that constellation big tipper was so important to Egypt shows that the authors propose that therefore they began to oriented oriented monuments to another part of the of the paper and we why the pyramid ended up in the in the north south uh

passage way and the ascending passage way up to the grand gallery\nAnd and so working from the bottom the first layer up a voyage we're talking about a road number eight Seventeen Twenty one and of course thirty for\nThese must have been for you and I want you to take the audience through this but these are game changing moments when you see these alignment these layers weren't they\nThat was a game changing mole and you're right I'm I'm I'm listing all the peaks you know the total number of peaks was twenty three some of these peaks a or specifically noted by peach tree\nTo have surfaced a ratios that were around ... a number of fractions of twenty fifth so you know six twenty fifth five twenty fifth\nAnd I'm a and those are also this that and it turns out that those courses\nThat are associated with these round fractious tend to run a over ceilings in a in that of course we don't have a lot of feelings but the few that we have there seems to be a correlation and thirty four is the most striking one it goes right across the queen a chamber\nAnd based on this ... this observation that there seems to be a correlation between round fraction twenty or you know courses that\nHave a surface area that is around ... number a fraction of twenty fifth\nI Am proposing that the top part of the pyramid what we don't know of any spaces and work but where we nevertheless also see these type of round fractions of twenty fifth that there must be space is just the same up there and I'm saying at least six if not then\nNow we're going to get to that ... ... exactly that's on page three twenty eight yeah but staying on page three twenty six with this cut away yeah you need to have if you are going to propose these extra chambers above the kings chamber where there\nIs supposed to be nothing right well then you have to have some basis for this and clearly\nWe have a I I'm just looking here one two three four five six seven eight\nAbsolute definitive uh marks on these roads starting with the descending passage way all the way up to the top of the king's chamber\nRight so for example of course not a Twenty one which is a ... which has a surface\nArea that is around fraction of twenty fifth from Nineteen twenty fifth that aligns with the uh the uh you know ... that ah that guard the entry of to the great pyramid show right that that cost on the Twenty one is right under the V.\nOr so it is in other words if a soldier with a feeling than the than the one that we just talked about is a course number thirty four also has a round fraction of twenty fifth sixteen in this case and it runs right over the feeling of the queen chamber\nOr then the other courses don't don't have ... the twenty fifth and they're not associated with ceilings so it works out very nicely and then we go to the top and then we have eight a we have eight twenty fifth\nUh and that goes across the feeling of the um off the ground at tower\nI'm now there are there are two courses nine twenty fifth and twenty fifth and those ... line up with a with a two of relieving chambers inside the tower\nUm and and then the final point I Want to make is that the possible avoid which I marked in here um that was found last year is also aligning with eight twenty fifth so it's possible that that causes marking not just that granted power but maybe also the possible avoid if it's for real\nWhich we are talking about a rose sixty eight\nA that would be a that would be row eighty four\nNo roe eighty four is at the top of the king's chamber am I reading this correctly\nYeah you are at the top of the king chamber and that also happens to be a you know within the resolution of this scanned that they were publishing that\nAlso is approximately the top of the ... the big boys\nI got it yes yes of\nCourse we don't know exactly which is it's kind of have the image so I just kind of like you know paint it that into this illustrations just to give a rough guide\nI Want to jump back a really quick I don't want this to get away from me there was a tweet earlier that is a pretty important and this is from eddy\nYeah and and he says does ah does by news see any connection between a dynastic Egypt she didn't use of the lion\nAnd the use of the lion at go Beckley tabby and everybody's talking about go Beckley tabby today and it's a relationship with ... and the great pyramid and and the other things throughout dynastic Egypt is there a connection\nYeah that's a fantastic question um and I am actually I'm I'm currently looking into that uh with Robert shock we are um we're trying and but I'm not ready to make a statement yet\nOkay but the the use of the lie and see this is what I find fascinating when we go back on these dates and weak constantly land a ten thousand five hundred BC for a variety of reasons one of course\nUh what was going on with the stars we understand that but then we have all of the uh cataclysmic events the end of the ice age the construction of go back to lead tabby the erosion on the banks all of these things and Leo Rising\nRight all of these things happen at ten thousand five hundred BC yet which makes go back leads happy not an accident\nYou know within references of course uh with lines to as low extraordinary\nNo absolutely that it's a fantastic question and I don't want to you know jump the gun because I Can't really speak what authority yet I'm so maybe the next\nOh I'm maybe we'll have something more but it's a great question\nLet's go to a um I'm gonna get to the top half of the pyramid and we're going to work on that in a second but got some calls that have been holding for quite a while to speak with you my new let's go to Barry in South Carolina Barry welcome back to coast\nHello there ... and

Thomas Manu\nJeremy thank you for taking my call Manu ... research you know my question the as we have the supplies into and the pyramids the banks have there been any\nIntention to reconstruct\nThe original pouring a key subplot to do and I know that sounds radical but for example the great pyramid is missing the capstone and it just seems to me that\nYou could bring in architects archaeologist perhaps what specialties some remote viewing\nHim to an intuition and actually reconstruct the temples repair the temples half that's been discussed\nYes and as as a great question I'm so there's two answers to that the first one is that uh the\nMinister of antiquities is trying to partially restored a monument so you get a feel for what it may have looked 'em but they don't want to cover it up all with you know modern reconstruction they just want to give you a sort of an idea so they may may they may do a section\nAnd then they leave the rest on touched so that's the first part of your question but there is something even more exciting going on and I have to reference a a Harvard or it's called digital visa and what they're doing and this is on the direction of Peter I'm a new alien um\nThey are basically re creating these ah ah ah I ... in in the virtual world and I predict in a few years you'll be able to\nAh descend into a virtual world and we exactly like the way it looked like the way we think it looked and you'd be able to go into all the chamber's look at the inscriptions and it'll feel like you know uh the real thing and I they're working on it\nNow with these additional chambers in the upper half of the great pyramid where did you come up with the number six or eight\nRight so because we have we have a sequence of ah courses that conform to this uh you know just a simple rule that the surface area is around fraction of twenty fifth\nAnd so and I am pretty convinced that they that the architect wouldn't just waste I'm you know energy to create these sticker courses unless there is a purpose for so for every single of course that has a round fraction of twenty fifth\nI think there is a space associated with that\nOne more phone call before the break let's go to school out west to Daniel in eureka California Daniel you're next on coast\nHi um I had a quick question about the uh selling he'll watch uh I've heard him many times interviewed on coast to coast over the years in yes apparently he controlled and very closely guarded access to researchers in the public or\nOr to the pyramids and for research and just general public access\nAnd I heard that after the um spring Arab Spring uprising or he resigned what is access like now with the new minister and our researchers are given better access for research in the general public and I'll take my answer off the air\nGreen question Daniel my new what's it like there now with you\nRegarding doctor how 'bout so first of all I had a few email exchanges with him and he's been always very nice very courteous as as the questions and so I've had good experiences with him I've never met in person than he probably doesn't know why I'm\nI'm regarding getting a permit so we are currently applying for a permit um for a small study Robert Robert shock and I are um and I think I'm so I'm hearing mixed messages so on the one hand it solves like investigators are being invited to come\nOn and on the other hand I'm hearing is that the uh they've become more selective so you know it probably depends on the project they have certain areas where they won research to happen and other areas they feel like it's a it's been exhausted\nUm you know so it's really in their hands and there's nothing you can do about it other than you just try it and see what they do\nWell do you think that the the ... one research would be ongoing like it is it ... yeah I watched was ah still the director there\nHe I think he is actually involved a Jimmy he's on the he sits on the on the uh the board of directors\nThat reviews the data so he is involved or not maybe not publicly but behind the scenes he is involved they ask of course by a get input um you know I think they're sort of mixed\nBack here you know there is a public school you know I was on TV and gives announcements and then I Believe there's a scientist you archaeologist who loves what he does\nUm you know it's difficult to kind of saw it all out but I think um you know they they have to strike a balance between protecting the monuments and allowing people to research done and I to be honest with you I understand it and you know some of the projects\nThat uh you know you want to do you can't do them because it might destroy the monument so I'm\nWell you're being you're being safe and political right now and I understand that my new it and I respect that yeah but there's the other part of this where we have been told for so long that there is nothing to discover there\nAnd that they have not moved from that stance and now it looks like it's going completely in the opposite direction that are they gonna have to open right are they going to have to back pedal\nYeah so it to the to the listener's question I think I forgot the name was Daniel I think right yes\nUm yeah so I think what you said because they love and so I think that has something has changed or this sort of a you know people are even Egypt causes that talked to some of some of the scholars there the local scholars they feel like you know they have more of a voice that can you know\nA fairly or they can research and I think it's been I think it's been good for the country and I think it's\nGood let me jump in right there I knew I got to take a quick network break this was coast to coast am more by new when we come back stay with

his own to him as a blueprint for monuments\nAnd thank you for the call Joe and that paper is underneath the latest papers the second one listed over on my news website and one last question from Twitter before we had to the break this is from dean\nIn doses are there any other pyramids in central and South America that carried the same traits as the ...\nTraits meaning\nThat's just what it says in the winter\nWe don't know yeah um\nI I assume there would be a couple of things I Do know is referencing your one would be size in orientation or to true north and maybe a something astrological ah with the non linemen\nWell let me let me put it this way so I think I you know I've I've watched this documentary or which is intriguing they're basically saying is that all these monuments\nAre lining up a across the globe and I find that fascinating I and I don't know how to explain it if that is true that would definitely suggest that master plan that you know people were coordinating this this this is building activity and of course that's what Graham Hancock\nOr has been writing about four years and uh so I I think it's possible yes but just specifically some of the trades I Can't really comment because I don't know enough about it\nWell let me help you with this idea when we look at the the tops of Indy the the pyramids in Mexico in Mexico city and the mind structures throughout Guatemala and Honduras 'em and believes\nThat the tops of these pyramids there's always something there what about the top of the great pyramid is and what do not not the top top ... there'll be a chamber or something and the have the upper levels\n... as well I think so I think that could be that that could be a space or that um connects that connected to the summit\nEr and of course the summit itself I'm you know like I said before John a\nDrop off ... pose that the summit of the great pyramid was not at peak was basically a virtual top and a and it would have been a you know as sphere and it's interesting that the diameter of that fear is a meter\nA it's a very interesting a very interesting theory or and others have proposed similar things there's even a hero cliff I think I'm\nA this was first mentioned by a state Jeannie in a night in uh Nineteen Seventy one book by Peter Tompkins that there was this fear on top of the great fear of it's not up to your media and by the sphere so yes I I think I think those theories out there I but I don't know how you would otherwise prove it I'm\nNo you've got to anomalies and a and one is clearly defined ed row one Ninety six and do you do have a ratio there could there be a chamber at the very top I I think\nSo how big would it be way I'm looking at those upper rose or the dimensions of the pyramid at that high um how big a chamber be\nI think a chamber like that would be maybe no more than five feet something like that five feet by height I'm saying right you know maybe maybe a five six courses or something like that\nUm and they would be it would be difficult to detect it may be on a on the ... especially if you have a grand gallery in between which you know the last ... was from the queen chamber so I think in order to protect these spaces you'd have to put the place up in a in the uh in the or the chamber of that's off limits right\nNow yeah and how would you how would you detect more than one chamber will ... scan show multiple chambers that were stacked up on top of each other\nYeah maybe not if they're stocked up maybe not but ah they might not be stocked up um they could be you know like the one for example I mentioned that\nUh Rudolph guns and bring a is suspecting that will be a chamber that's in the southern part of the pyramid maybe close to the face\nYou know so they may not all be stocked up I'm a one way you could do a Jimmy is by putting the plates into that notch that we talked about you know the one that ah who John and buyer investigated it up on the south it's on the north east side\nYou know the north east corner right in the\nNorth east corner it's a fairly sizable space you know I mean I I don't know how big the plates are but I Wonder if you could set up the place up there and then you might be able to actually discern the different chambers they made it might be possible\nHow expensive is it to perform ... studies\nIt seemed like it wouldn't be that expensive because you're just placing the the wage throughout the pyramid and then of course running a computer system it's not like there was any excavations or right right it's not that expensive but\nYeah they have I think they've already spent the main capitals already spent basically you know making the plates and then you know the ... to people to experiment I'm guessing multiple million dollars I think maybe\nTen million or something like that you do this project um and most of that money has maybe already been spent and now like you're saying you know now it's just you know you just to repeat studies\nUm but I I think if you do any kind of invasive a project or the project like this spending several million dollars a which if we want to go back to the things and things that's a kind of money that will need for a project like\nThis is coast to coast am host you'll be church it's been an all Egypt the great pyramid evening here going into Monday morning more with my

I'm Sorry it was the question\nAgain he's he's asking if the pyramid is actually the tip of the iceberg\nAh okay that's a great question so I'm a you know one way to marry the the the theory of a lot civilization starting something in ... uh and then the old kingdom\nAre Egyptians of a building on top of it is basically to draw the line exactly where you are asking a Michael I think micro is your name right yes so\nYeah so I think ... and in fact when even when you look\nOn on the pyramid itself on the on the north east corner I I was there just a few weeks ago and you know what that is that\nThat's not humor in stone that is actually the original hill that was there and it was molded to sort of you know allow for stone to be placed on it but you're looking at something that was there before the pyramid was built\nAnd so it is possible that there was some structure there before and in fact Robert Duvall has seen you ate it is that he thinks that maybe there were shrines on in this three locations and they were lying to you know the bell stars of uh Ryan a dating to step peppy\nAnd then you know the old kingdom Egyptians came they basically built their pyramids on top of the shrines\nAnd so uh and the ... so what's under the pyramid\nAlso you know the subterranean shame or from the looks of it it looks\nMuch older and when you walk into the pyramid or you walk into the what's called the kings chamber\nThere's also a you feel like you are you are basically in a to phase monument like there was something there before and then the pyramid was built on top so it's an excellent question um proving it is a little bit difficult of course but uh it's definitely be something that's possible\nThank you so much my new or just an absolutely perfect fascinating conversation tonight here on coast yeah I loved\nIt so much to me we've got a twenty seconds left what's next for you\n[noise] um [noise] what are your ... one of your listeners exactly the right question about the connection between Quebec they Tempe and uh in Egypt and that's that's what's next\nAnd there's no doubt that there's a connection I there's a seven thousand year gap in there and we're going to fill it in and ... with your help thank you so much Manu they safe out there\nWhat a conversation tonight this is one coast to coast is all about for me is being able to come in here and disgust my favorite thing which is loss history and Egypt well of course time travel goes UFOs all of that stuff counts too but for me it is Egypt and loss history\nAnd with that I got to get out of here\nSo I don't see everybody here in a couple of weeks but before I Do that I've got to think Nathan for running the board of course Donald behind the glass\nChris for being the producer for me here lax Greg Tim Lisa Stephanie George and my beautiful wife Rita with that I'm your host Jimmy church spent coast to coast am I'm signing off go back to lead tabby\nFish signals I'm Bob ... with the discovery ... new advances in science and engineering from the national Science Foundation\nIt's as if the Spanish I Am each other only instead of a tiny fish bones or other device very many electrical pulses to keep up with a B a best best fish for him and to navigate we\nConcerning fish one commonly referred to as a baby whale have developed a unique security system produces incredibly short pulses of electricity [noise]\nIf you don't suppose thousandth of a second\nThat lets them communicated navigate while the looting but highly sensitive electric detection systems major predator catfish\nIt's an evolutionary trick mid researchers with the University of Texas at Austin in Michigan State that's on my shed light on human illnesses seems ... rely on a protein also found in the hearts of muscles of humans the team believes what they learn from the origin and mechanics\nOf is signaling ability could apply to the treatment of epilepsy where electrical pulses in brain and muscles cause seizures their findings could also give us insights on migraine spend some heart conditions also related to electrical signals on their pathways sounds like the electric fish are giving us a message to\nDiscover ... mind Bob Carson on news radio one oh five five W.
