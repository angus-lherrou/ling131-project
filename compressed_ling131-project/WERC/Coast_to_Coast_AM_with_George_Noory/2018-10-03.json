S. are\nLined with a with a a waterproof barrier to keep things from leaking out they're covered with dirt every day to keep a a rats another room and the other way um our air is very much a a cleaner since Nineteen eighty are six major\nLet's roll down a combined Seventy percent those are the ones I mentioned the carbon monoxide actress oxide sulfur dioxide water is is a it's not worth it ought to be but the great lakes and cleaned up many of the offshore areas have been cleaned up\nIn Europe the Rhine River is making a comeback to Daniel rivers is making a comeback as a matter of fact the interesting thing is people say well energy use as a big problem but it's funny the nations that use the most energy per person\nThis low severe and water pollution today and those levels are declining so this energy causing causes pollution and really it's not accurate\nThe nations that are not able to put energy use effectively um can use it to reduce their air and water pollution and so they're they're in the worst states\nSo it's really good news story what we need to do is get get a nation as well\nAnd then they will start cleaning up the start cleaning up their water and uh so it's it's really it's a good news story from Lucia point of view not what's going on Steve because regardless what side of the fence you people are on climate change\nWhy is it so either [laughter] as opposed to dialogue and he this is my opinion and I appreciate your worst screaming matches it it's kind of remarkable I\nI've spoken to the ...

of the sun is heating up the solar system itself is warmer than it used to absolutely there are ... by long term cycles called them a lot of rich cycles which are uh\nThe earth's axis changes over time the procession of earth's axis are are they around the sun change is a major like twenty thousand a hundred thousand year cycles like cause the ice ages medium term cycles every Fifteen hundred years or so scientists believe the sun causes\nAnd those are the fluctuating temperatures so we've had the medieval warm period a thousand years ago when it was very warm I'm like I said in Europe uh

hundred billion dollar annual climate payment to go from the wealthy nations to the\nDeveloping nations a hundred billion annually quite a big amount and a year and has that\nHas completely collapsed a matter of fact the guy who was ahead of that just resigned this last summer and with the ... with uh the United states cutting its commitment or they're nowhere near that they're down about four or five billion dollars a year\nSince the scandal among some of the scientists who were ... you know pro man made climate change with the emails and things like that\nYeah the ease the climate gate was called the University of east East Anglia back in two thousand nine\nOr they don't know who ... somebody released thousands of emails either end in sight or or a hacker\nAnd these emails showed some very bad ah behavior or there were a uh guys that are\nOr were saying I'm a don't tell anyone that the United kingdom has a freedom of Information Act or there are people are racing emails uh there were people a trunk Keating a data are there were people trying to you know interview or to influence the peer review process\nI'm\nJust I'm just not a tough situation you know and and my thought is by interpretation is that that the scientists to these things and by the way this was a this\nWas the primary I mentioned before the climate research unit which is the primary keeper of the world's temperatures are these folks I think we're we're trying to do whatever they could to try and save the planet to try and convince the world if you think the world is going down the wrong track\nOf they

Streever wrote a book\nCalled the coming global superstorm and that inspired a movie called the day after tomorrow and when I was wondering was or is it remotely possible that\nIf things are keep going the way they are or with art and uh what is predictions\nCould very well happen that the events portrayed in that movie as well as the events portrayed in the movie ... thousand well with\nYellowstone popping the cork in blowing Wyoming and the Kentucky or is it very possible that the fans in both of those movies could very well happen [noise] yeah I don't\nKnow about the two thousand twelve of Yellowstone and that for Kaine although I understand there's a big went under their call during\nThe day after tomorrow is based on the idea that\nUm manmade warming would would stop the Gulf Stream basically slow down the Gulf Stream which is part of a of the uh a global uh uh overturning a circulation there's this huge ocean current\nUh which which carries a millions of square miles of water of the gulfstream goes north goes up to Iceland and then it sinks into it slows down deep and then it goes down into the deep underneath that goes down to the south Atlantic the Indian and the Pacific the the theory basically was\nThat are warming would cause a cause or water to melt up there the ice caps to melt would stop the current and it would cause a U.S move us in the next the ice age\nUm I think most scientists now realize that that that is very unlikely we just don't have enough ice up there um to to affect the current so um there was there was a fair though a number of years back that that was slowing down but after they looked at the data they found that the no the gulfstream wasn't slowing down it's really not happening\nThere was a good movie though

you can have anything out now that can't be the only land they all in the United states we know that and they're all going to be born in a methane gas now I Want to go why haven't there been anything done about that\nWell I think they are recapturing that are in some place as a matter of fact that's a big push in California they talk about they talk about that being renewable gas [noise]\nAh they also want to get methane from water treatment plants and even a dairy operations and and uh uh agriculture\nUm the problem is though it is really more expensive um gas from landfill is about twice as much as our natural gas regularly and it goes up from there um water treatment or three times as much I think there he gets up to about ten times as much\nSo they are capturing that and some in some places are capturing the gas from landfills\nOr but it does tend to it does tend to add to the expense of things that's that's the only issue\nNext let's go to Michael in Virginia Beach I'm

billion a papal so two dollars a day comes to point six billion dollars a day or we would have\nJust been nine hundred and forty nine billion dollars a year just to know their two dollars a day just four hours\nAnd I'm going to come to the point that people like frosty will reject may end or a lab or a a young child a\nHere's the point is you've already said they were willing to do a hundred billion they're certainly not going to be willing to do nine hundred and forty nine billion right\nAnd and so I watch frosty has told us is this your section\nThinking that we can see your ah that by

[laughter]\nSo there are some good science the trends are good but yeah we're not going to go back to the days when most of the world was uninhabited we at all forests and we had all the vice and that just won't happen\nWhat's happening with rising sea levels\nSo sea levels have been rising for the last twenty thousand years you can go to to NASA or their website and ... and see that data they've written a three hundred and Ninety feet a hundred and twenty meters since the last ice age\nNo scientists can tell you when natural sea level rise stopped and man made sea level rise began\nUm\nRight now the rice is about seven inches per century that's been going for the last a couple of hundred years or any politician who tells you he knows how to stop sea level rise I hold onto your wallet\nOh we need to adapt to rising oceans oh we're not going to be able to stop that and that is a largely driven by natural factors\nMood obviously has happened in the past because there were discovering the ancient cities that are under water\n[noise] um there have been some well yeah there are\nIf you look at a I think it's emphasis in Turkey or if you look at a a piece of both of those cities are about\nUm\nUh there are some some um indications that the seas were higher at one point in time as well um those are about five miles from the coast with historical accounts peas are used to be a big court or a big uh port\nOn in in a northwest Italy an excuse to be a port as well so there was some times when the oceans were higher\nBut again this is something we need to adapt to a we're not going to stop the sea level rise will matter what the what they think in California\nRoots in woodland hills California is with us I grew screwing up\nGeorge thank you for taking my call Hi Steve I'm Bruce you know before I I I Want to talk about the word climate change but before I get into I just kind of like to mention I perhaps to a lot of listeners that aren't aware\nIs a global elites that run this country who are masters at keeping us completely oblivious and dumb what's really going on the\nWord climate change is a narrative we hear all the time the weather stations and news articles scientists that is not the proper word the word is abrupt climate collapse and we never hear about the word climate engineering\nThese are programs now that have been in effect for over seven years and even ramped up over the last Twenty years and this is the aerosol injections\nThey're spraying God Knows how many millions that kinds of aerosols anyone could just look up in the sky\nNo doubt this a lot of ... Sandler\nHarp technology is and you know if anyone wants to prove that kind of self I can tell you how to do it\nFirst of all any time you watch the news you are watching at him manufactured why you're not seeing the real no weather satellite map that we used to the many years ago ... an animated cartoon\nBut there is a fight I it's a YouTube one Pacific redwood\nThat this guy is obviously a former meteorologist she keeps anonymous name but he is showing actual weather satellite map but here's the thing that's interesting\nYou can see storm front hurricanes tropical storm low pressure zone coming directly into California and they're being blocked\nAnd it's being blocked by heart technology which our ground based atmosphere heaters anyone could look this up they're very powerful I Believe they can put out as much as three billion watts of power\nCan have the upper atmosphere to Fifteen hundred degrees they can steer hurricanes they can start hurricanes they can blast under head they can break up low pressure zones and this is what's happening this is not an act of nature it's an act of the military industrial complex would have in our with our weather\n... when I hear about it in the new let's against team's reaction to that Bruce like you\nSaid some I'd have to research I'm really not up on that I Know there's been some quotes eating attempts but to the rest of it it's not something I've run across um and there's been a lot of discussion about climate engineering but to my knowledge there's not been anything done on a large scale that something I'd have to look look into further\nLet's take one more caller may be too if we have some time in in Tulsa, Oklahoma he said go ahead [laughter]\nWell let's go man just said is exactly right I Want to these conservative it happens to believe\nThat the way to add on is being gay oh engineered the Kim trails or a proven fact even the discovery channel show now George should recently at gentleman on his show\nTalking about can't drill team put out a video called Franken's guy and the idea behind it was to create a canopy over the blogging out son well people are so much heck shoes were hate\nAbout the fact that they're doing this so they're going to back off of it now what they were telling us that they said they were going to back off the trail we don't have the weather's going to get real radical now they have they have the ability to geoengineering this weather down to a science I mean it's it's to the point now where you can go to Wall Street and\nOn the stock market on the weather if they want hurricanes that they want to intensify the hurricane through the eight of heart\nAnd now on top of that then you got the geo engineering of the soil and the crops which is destroying the honeybees are almost becoming extinct and if they you know that's pretty much gonna destroy everything now I Do agree with you about the nuclear power plant that was foolish idea that may never come up with man is not smart enough\nTo harness that kind of power safely okay now I Do agree with that but here's the thing with Trump I'm proud of him he got us out of that climate accord 'cause it's a sham men they want they were doing is gripping the oil um industrial nations away describing it into the pockets of the global elite\nAnd meanwhile China to do with their sky completely on pollution not paying a dime and do it either as Russia but the United states of America was going to quite old guy now I don't blame a Trump one bit I grew in fact I was proud of him for backing us out of that sham\nLong he's

later on a which to me makes them a living breathing entity like any other creature a B they greater small on the planet\nA I have no doubt whatsoever in my heart any way that they do exist and that people have every walk of life or in countering them\nUh having said that uh we\nWill get into a little story later that out of hand picked for the coast audience\nA and I have a couple of them are that do involve a ... the UFO phenomena and my take on that is that there may be some mimicking going on here\nOf the natural okay the UFO suit so I think\nI think there's two I think one's almost

sees something going up and down in the trees that he described as like a chimpanzee\nSo he's watching this thing going up and down and think to themselves what on earth is a monkey or a chimpanzee doing up here now he couldn't cross the river\nAnd when the thing came down on the tree it went into the the trees the surrounding it in other words there were like low gross ten Fifteen feet and then this big tall tree standing in the middle so when it was up in the high tree he could see it\nAnd want to climb down we couldn't see it so obviously you're out there this thing has your attention\nWhen he's watching this thing going up and down and at one point it comes up sits there and one position and staring at him\nSo now he's looking at it it's looking at him and then at low was gone again well moments later\nHe sees them less willing in the bushes on the other bank which kind of came down a hill alongside the fool's\nAnd here is this little big foot sitting on the shoulder of daddy coming along the bank and going out of sight in front of him into the woods so you had one carrying the other one\nWho knows it's anybody's guess what this little critter was doing maybe it was like you know I I Know it sounds ridiculous but I think of it in human terms like when we used to go down to the monkey bars or something to play with your kid in the park you know\nThat's right now you mentioned earlier about a couple that moved on to their house to get away from big what happened\n[noise] well I've had a ... there's been a number of people that moved houses are a\nUnited sooner aren't and rural areas right\nHe uh yeah for the most part are people who have backed up against a wilderness areas or for instance when we talk about I mean this is a very interesting a story a involving no sighting but evidence like it's nobody's business\nUh these people and when you talk about Maine George I don't know if people really realize this Maine is the size of the risk of New England combined and you're\nPercent of it is uninhabited so when you talk about wilderness it's not just the Pacific northwest British Columbia Canada here we have a lot of wilderness in Maine we have a lot of wilderness right here in New York state\nAnd so these people had moved from\nOne house to another house in northern Maine\nOr the money was right the property was right the people that had lived there before them well gardeners they will gardeners this was like a match made in heaven\nWell as it turns out over time they found they were accusing each other of losing the gardening tool the wife is saying the husband was to shovel wisdom rate was so finally the husband get the idea\nThat they're going to gather together all the tools they have to an inventory and then they were going to keep them all locked up with the exception of two small hands space\nSo having accomplished that they realize they were missing some tools and they started they left to hand spades on what she called the the wife pulled the heat stroke table on the patio and they were using them for plotting plant\nAnd no sooner had they left them out there a couple of days went by and now these hands spades withdrawn they it actually called the police report in depth on their property of you know tools and this and that nobody could understand who would come on their land and\nTake tools and take two of them is ridiculous you're going to go to jail for taking a shovel you gonna run the place Rob the place well [laughter] bright TVs and things like that [laughter]\nSo they actually went out into the property in the woods they found one of the shovel leaning on the tree and the wife spoke out nine feet off the ground one of the one\nHand garden trial with a rubber handle on it shoved into\nThe side of a tree nine feet up\nNine feet up so they went back to doubt they got a I guess an iPhone or something took pictures of it they brought a ladder out the husband couldn't Bush just thing it was buried in a tree several inches thick couldn't budget\nSo they had recalled the police and told them the story about finding the shovel in the woods showed the cop shoveling the tree and everybody was baffled by you know the turn of events you\nAnyways the long and short of it was the cop told them look if you have any other problems get back to us I'm not sure what happened here I'm going to pass it on to the detectives\nWell as I said the long and short of it was a couple of days later\nThey came outside and the guardian behind the house had been trampled down there were huge footprint in bed or made those were taking the head of lettuce one mashed and whatever had done this which was obviously a big foot\nI stepped right over the fence not using the gate there was a gate on the garden and it just step right over the wire\nWent and had it's full of feed and then left they recall the uh the police over to see what had happened that transpired\nAnd he actually told them that this was pretty much the best evidence he had ever seen a and that they had had reports periodically of people saying they show these big ... creatures coming in their property of walking now so it\nIt's convincing yeah it's not like it's not like these things on being seen it and not being talked about which is a very odd thing you know you know

snowman the lady from the Himalayas is that the same as the big but we talk about here in North America [noise]\nI don't believe so uh although I'll tell you something really interesting uh I had an account of was told to me by all things a Russian professor\nWho was out hiking with his landscaper that he had befriended because of his this knowledge of the things botanical\nAnd they formed this unlikely friendship and turned that into a hiking partnership\nThey had run across a couple of big for its\nMessing around with some trees are in the woods and they got close enough to them whether they could hear them ...\nAnd the professor said that it sounded like a Siberian dialect that he was on familiar with now this is a Russian speaking immigrant\nSaying that what he was hearing sounded like some type of Russian that he was unfamiliar with\nSo when you talk about the the Eddie in or the abominable snowman\nIt's hard not to think of the land bridge that was once they're above the Bering Sea and did these things or or had these things go back and forth I have no idea but it was just really unusual to hear this gentleman\nA speak about this on dialect that other people have said they've heard a voice as I had a couple that uh was canoeing and Minnesota and they parked on a\nPulled the canoe up on a piece of the lake where they thought it looked clear and they could sit there and rest for a little while and they ran across some sasquatch and the trees structure in there or they will unseen by them they walk by through the trees they heard them ...\nAnd they said it sounded like when you stand at the counter and the Chinese restaurant and they're shouting orders back and forth to each other\nSo it's very very odd but as far as the ah the ah yesterday in the abominable below snowman I have no idea uh I have a ... book the abominable a snowman come to life\nAnd uh you know that thing is like reading or an encyclopedia on the creature a and yet getting back to what I said earlier none of this stuff means anything to the majority of people around the globe\nThat book is a hoax all of my stuff is a hoax all of the conversations about big foot or a hoax the film is a hoax all of the uh uh uh ... ridges on the footprints taking everything's a hoax to them so\nYou know we have to just keep doing what we do a in spite of ... what the majority of the people out there I think about it and that's one of the things I Love about coast\nYou know a a we all\nTune in because we're hearing things that we can get you know the little ... nobody's talking about what you're talking about you\nAnd photos in big encounters where's the time\n[noise] [noise] well I've had a couple of them are one of them are called the dead falls incident but one day they'll share with you a was named the orb\nAnd it's really interesting uh these three scout leaders had four young boys ... we're working on their uh Eagle Scout badge\nAnd they decided to take them uh to this mountain in a mountainous area or in uh Pennsylvania to do a weekend of survival training\nOr on the first day they were pretty much focusing on building huts lean twos and and different things like that and and the second day or the focus was on that of ah getting attention being paid so they were\nSpending their time in an open area spelling out the words help than SOS uh using branches and bows and then they were making Smokey fires using a green a green vows\nAnd that night they decided to go on a night hike to see what it was like a navigating around in the dark\nA now during the day they had climbed up the side of the mountain to look down and see what they had made to see what it looked like from a higher elevation and they had gone up into the same area right night for the hike\nBut when they got up there it turns out that the one scout leader was a UFO enthusiast which was very bizarre considering what you're about to hear he had a pair of military grade night vision a by knock you lose your own monarch yellow\nOr that he had brought along now when they get up into the trail [noise]\nOne or the kid says hey what's sad and they noticed in the distance a light moving around in the woods\nNow of course the first instinct was it somebody with a flashlight or a you know battery operated lantern but then they realized that this thing started to daughter around in a crazy fish and which immediately told all of them this is no human being and what it is we don't know so they started moving closer\nAnd they got closer they got the night vision on it and they could see now that was in orbit around bluish white light moving around in the forest\nAnd now this really had their attention so they got even closer they've been trying to get ever closer to it they didn't know how big it was because they didn't know how far away they were from it\nFinally they got to a place where they believe they were about Seventy five yards away from it and when they put the night vision on it\nThey could see that it was about two feet wide\nBluish white or it was about uh ten or twelve feet off the ground and it was illuminating the trees around it\nSo now that passing a it\nI mean it it it's a glowing orb of light darting around in the forest and now it's stationary and what happens next is absolutely out of this world\nThe one scout is holding it and he says to the leader hey Mr so and so you better take a look at this thing it's still something really weird\nHe described a number of picture this George a two inch wide let's just say beach ball a two foot wide beach ball he described a globe ... coming out of the size of this thing\nAs being like when you blow bubbles through we want and as a jar okay so this thing is coming out of the side of this or and making its way down to the ground [noise] and what blew their mind was the fact that what was coming out and go into the ground was like\nTwenty times are thirty times the volume of the orbit self and yet the war was on changed and this thing was attached to it\nNow they don't want to see a big foot appearing in secondary glob coming down and they described it as being like in his state of suspended animation that wasn't moving whatsoever but they were certain to what they were looking at\nAt some point the glob separate from the orb and now you have like this power a blue and white\nFox News we
