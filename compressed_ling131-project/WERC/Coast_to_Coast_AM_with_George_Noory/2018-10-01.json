Wednesday ... going to be back on the air\nAnd I always tell them not soon enough we get more requests for Dave than any other guest that I've experienced is I've been with the program for ten years and that's just because he always brings the goods\nI Am jazz that he always allows me to get the first interview when he unveiled a new book and like the other books this new one does not disappoint\nA Davis you probably know spent Twenty years in law enforcement then worked in the tech industry for a bit but found as true calling as an investigator of unusual disappearances and his work in that area has become a phenomenon known all over the world multiple books a documentary film\nAnd maybe some other surprises become Dave great have you back\nIn Georgia I'm always humbled that anyone even wants to listen to listen to me though or appreciate the invite\nI wanted to say you know I noticed something as I was reading the new book today that you make some personal observations than I Am not a I haven't seen it you go this far in the other books insights\nInto your own emotional reactions to some of these cases and it seems clear like the subject really gets to you and you've got I think eleven hundred and thirty five cases that you profiled over the years thousands more they'd be looked into\nSome of them really seem to get into your head though I I think in part because of similarities or some of the missing to your own life right [noise]\n[noise] you know I think that's true um I've been very fortunate to me a family of people who have been lost\nAnd when you meet these people it really brings brings home the emotion and there's a lot of parallels to my life with a lot of these families and I've written about people that remind me of myself a lot of times and uh [noise]\nI've put that in the book just recently ... probably because it's it's more of an evolution in my writing and\nHopefully people see that you know hey if people are really really good people these are the Drake who is fighting these are\nThe upper echelon and it's a conundrum to me why I don't find people that are down and out in life that are disappearing but it it seems to me that it's always the high rollers the people that are high performers that are disappearing [noise]\nYou know one place in the new book you mentioned how as a rule you did not reach out to the families of the missing now sometimes you meet him in ... due to various circumstances but in general you don't call somebody up out of the blue and say hey can I talk to you about your dad loved one or you're missing loved one\nBecause it seems like an invisible line that you don't want to cross over but I Wonder has the success of your books help in the sense that these families now reach out to you that they're unsatisfied say with the the search effort or something and they're they're turning to you for some help her answers [noise]\nIt has happened and uh [noise] I don't want to inject myself into a search or into the turmoil that evolving with somebody disappearing now somebody reaches out I Want some help absolutely I'm going to be there I'll do everything I can [noise]\nAnd there's been cases just recently where that's happened and I've been glad to help and ah\nI've kinda guided them and it it seems that a lot of these families and covered the same sort of issues time and time again and it's frustrating as heck to sit back and hear the frustration in their voice a\nCommon one is is it seems as though when jurisdictions stop searching they get to a point seven to ten days and they say hey there's nothing else we can do there's no place else to search\nA runner and out of resources [noise] we've got stopped well many times families and friends rally at that point and they get a group together and they keep searching\nFor what I tell these people is you've got to get a copy of those reports that the jurisdiction wrote search and rescue reports law enforcement reports see who they interviewed who they talked to were they search the effectiveness of the search\nOr the areas that they completely eliminated and the and the areas that they thought that they still should search more because without that you're really searching blind and there's been instances just lately where people have said no they said they won't give us anything [noise] I I find that baffling [noise]\nWell I mean that's how they've treated you I was gonna ask you the same question about different agencies I Know how the national Park Service feels about you and that they are we should anybody who has not heard\nYour earlier interviews or is not familiar with the books who might be listening tonight I'm maybe we start there where you can explain the history of your interaction with the national Park Service the forest service government entities in general because they've shut you out I mean I guess\nI I'm interested to learn that they're doing the same thing that the families of the missing but ah it's really a kind of clear over the big picture that they don't want to help solve these mysteries\nOr you know it's a sad note on humanity if that's the case but there is a lot of obstruction so when I started out I was told by a couple of Park Service rangers that they had found\nDisappearances and their parks were they had worked that bothered um didn't make sense when they tried to find information that couldn't [noise] and they thought somebody with an investigative background on to be looking into it [noise]\nAnd that sort of how it all started and I filed a series of freedom of Information Act of course the confessional Park Service they have the largest contingent a federal ... we train police officers and the national park police

mentioned uh during the break there that uh you've got some imitators out there are people who have written books similar to yours as well as people who've gone further than that pretending to be you can you address not for a moment before we jump into the cases\nSo this is one of the most frustrating parts of the you know in the public spotlight that go to conferences all the time people come up to me and they say so you said this or how did you come up with that and I'm thinking I never said that and there's a series of YouTube sites\nThat have the name David polite is missing for one one missing a national parks there all frauds [noise] they're not me there are people that have used my name to get innocent and listeners to get on and every time you click through they get paid by their

else talking about some other topic and it's not even me at all so\nI tried to tell us that people don't trust YouTube I really don't even listen to him a list that cannot missing project site that's the only real site that you're going to get honest information from [noise]\nAll right I'm a sucker for a moment about search and rescue\nParameters because that that information becomes key to you picking the cases that use zero in on I mean there are metrics there are there's data\nUm for search and rescue 'em yeah how how they proceed and and I are huge database I Would think that gives clues about which cases stand out as being unusual [noise]\nSo that the data that you're trying to get to is really in the reports that they generate\nAnd the national Park Service for one won't volunteer up any of these reports now find name a specific date and a specific time and that\nPerson has been rural to be a missing and presumed deceased [noise] they're released the report most time a lot of times they want there is a case from eighty six\nI'm often found impossible distances away and there is no way no way they could walk there on their own [noise] uh talk about that [noise]\nSo there's a couple of sites that talk about my work and talk about these cases and the couple of people have chimed in and said well you know Dave talks about people in this books that have been found and there's no mystery there the obviously haven't read the books and they don't understand the rationale behind why these stories are important\nSo you've got a two year old child that's in the middle of the wilderness with their friends or their family and they disappear and that child sound say three thousand feet higher in elevation and six miles away in a day and a half [noise]\nUh well I don't know many parents that think that there are two year old could make that track\nBut that's not it I mean when I started to accumulate the data on it in off the grid the book before this one I had a list that accumulated\nThat probably there's fifty a cases in their starts off with the case let's say a four year old missing in Australia found five days later forty five miles away across the desert or four years old\nI'm there's other cases where two year old in Florida found twenty miles away through the swamps\nAh another two year olds in Australia ... Fifteen miles away in three days two years old a three year old ... Fifteen miles away twenty four hours not possible in my book\nBut I mean there's a long long list of these and why did I start to accumulate that data\nBecause in search and rescue manuals that says that a two year old should be found Ninety five percent of the time in a radius of two miles or less from the point last seen at these numbers absolutely blow to smithereens it's something search and rescue people don't want to talk about don't want to address that want to even think about\nAnd I can understand why because there's no way you could plan a search [noise]\nThirty miles away for a two year old it just you don't have enough people to do it and you have to work for that Ninety five percent tile\nBut the problem is and all these books they don't talk about the other five percent anywhere I'm probably the first person that ever talked about it but as you state [noise] how are these kids are making this extraordinary distance and extraordinary heights\nWhen I go to a conference I always ask people how many people in the room or parents you know Ninety percent of people raised their hands and I said if I said okay you you're just going to set your child down in the dirt on a trail\nWalk away we'll watch the child [noise] what's that child's gonna do for the next hour they said well maybe it'll crawl under Bush and go to sleep maybe the plan that dirt for a while maybe they'll run down the trail for a little bit get upset cry and then go to sleep\nAnd I said how many how many parents and you think your kid would run up hill [noise] nobody raises their hand I mean it does happen but it's pretty rare but I have all these examples where these heights have been achieved by these little kids [noise]\nWere they cross a couple of mountain ranges or you know incredibly difficult terrain sometimes without any shoes on [noise]\nWell yeah it's going to move we\nTalked about a two year old boy that they just he traveled nine to twelve miles in nine hours over two mountain ranges and he was found face down in snow the next morning unbelievably alive and we found that guy years later and interviewed him and he has no recollection of what happened\nAnd his mom said we couldn't believe we found them and we couldn't believe he was alive\nHave a case in the new book ah in Southern California the Lucerne valley Bill thanks this was back in Nineteen fifty six is the child is five years old at the age of disappearance and you do the math on a bill I guess if he had walked nonstop for twenty four hours you have to go one six miles\nFor our a bunch of kids are going to war for twenty four hours with no food or water um it it seems just impossible unless somebody picked him up for some something or someone picked him up and blocked him there [noise]\n[noise] well ... and the reason cases have significant is that your report on a child who's a duck to downtown\nAnd they're found in West Los Vegas three hours later six miles away you know church often we put them in the current girlfriend there\nBut when you're talking in the middle of the wilderness happening and [noise]\nWhen you talk about this happening when the people in the party and anybody never talk to anybody and when they check the trail walks nobody else was there nobody saw anything nobody sonic cars [noise]\nThey're so how did that child make a difference in that time for me [noise]\nUh in the new book uh it's law L.

national Park Service it's their property and they patrol it in their national park police are there\nWell there's an art or location called Oregon or Ga an organ pipe cactus national monument and it's an Arizona [noise] far southern part of the state right near the border with Mexico well on February third Nineteen Seventy one\nA woman thirty two years old named Carol Turner who was a student at the University of New Mexico\nDrove there and was going to take a few days vacation and break from school and kind of walk around she was inquisitive smart athletic brilliant some people called er\nWell I I stumbled onto this case and saw it and some archive somewhere and I immediately wrote to the Pima County sheriff yeah some pretty documents on that case\nI got the documents in my hand then I called the national Park Service at organ pipe and ask them for their reports and they said we don't have any I said have you heard of that case no well this person's still missing\nSo she was a thirty two year old graduate student she had been a PE teacher with a master's degree in physical education decided she wanted to go back and get to more masters degrees\nAnd she she was just really admired by all of the faculty that she worked around and and studied under and all the articles in all the reports said that they stated she was really smart\nWell she was about to graduate with a degree in sociology and biology [noise] and she was working in a ... a university lab tech to earn some extra money [noise] [noise]\nShe love the outdoors hike regularly on January thirty first Seventy one she left her residence in southeast Albuquerque she was driving her white sixty Plymouth station wagon and she went about an eight hour drive to the monument\nAnd she slept in her car that first night February first it was established that she attended an evening ranger presentation at the end of that presentation she went up to the ranger engage them in conversation he remembered it and said hey she asked really good questions and was smart\nFebruary second she went to the park visitors center spoke to a ranger they're stating she had just returned from a hike to bowl pasture and asked about a guy the trip to a place called dripping springs subsequent investigation found she spoke to a ... a ranger an individual named Larry Henderson\nYou said he she he remembers or ask good questions was interested in the environment wander nowhere to go to see more things\nOn February third she moved your car out of the campground nobody knew exactly why\nAnd on February forth at nine Fifteen and I am a ranger was patrolling and found chemicals car parked in s this canyon picnic site with a note taped inside the windshield and it said if I'm not backed by four thirty pm on February through these contact the ranger\nSmart smart thing to do\nExactly not ever wish everybody would do that\nBut then as I went through this I started to think [noise] she was going to a place and she was heading to a place that she went to earlier and I always wondered in the back of my mind that something happened that first trip and she was going back to the second time and just in case she was leaving this no I wasn't sure\nSo he purchased patrol vehicle and he had the two miles up from bull pasture he saw nothing and decided to check the trail register and it was signed by Carol the first day she went on February second notify park headquarters advise them that he has a missing hiker and starts the search process\nFebruary fourth and fifth national park service that sending to Forman teams up that trail the search whether it was described and reports of cold and blustery\nThey determined Carol was laughing eating an orange on the trail and they did find some spare orange peel scattered around [noise]\nThe Pima County sheriff was asked to join the search when the national Park Service started to get low on resources\nThey also called in the border patrol and the tribal police US Customs month an air force base they brought in civilian helicopters was massive the search over three hundred ground searchers were on at any one time\nThe park superintendent again he met Ryan contacted turtles parents in North Carolina\nThe parents that did the care would never ever go off trail [noise] she was in ... outstanding athletic condition and she was supposed to be back in Albuquerque on February fifth February twenty second Matt Ryan told the Associated Press\nIt's almost becoming a search for the answer to a mystery march seventh one last push to locate curl rangers claim to\nSmell an odor of human decaying flesh up the trail\nMarch thirteenth national park service for the team into the area of the odor and found nothing\nAnd [noise] again they have no documentation on the incident anywhere\nNow I did get this NPs report that was in the Pima County documents and it was written by the chief ranger Roswell boils\nAnd it was three type written pages that outlines of search for Carole and Ninety percent of it real boring real mundane for radio what it says\nOne additional was turned up on Monday February fifteenth too limited locations about four hundred yards of park on the south west facing of the hosts a J. O. S. a very strong in distinct human odor was found but no other locations\nSupervising ranger how cross of ... ... ... national monument in one of the researcher who was recently involved in the recovery of body had very strong and positive feelings on the day than vacation at the odor\nThe following day ranger cos after flying the area and a border patrol plane let an eat man search party back over this area again the order was observed at the same location but only occasionally and not as distinct\nOther members of the team described it as a very weird and scary\nAll efforts were negative and search activities have been reduced intermittent patrols at this time I have never [noise] and thousands of reports or seen anything described in our national park service report of very weird and scary\nWhite guys yeah that's really strange just a feeling they had or the fact that they're smelling what they think is decay human flesh but there's no source for the older\nWell here's what's as other members of the team described it\nAs a very weird and scary [noise] so I'm sure all of us who spent time in the outdoors have spent have smelled the odor of dead flash decaying sometime animals die smell it I don't know if that could be weird and scary\n[noise] [laughter] [noise] but uh again\nThis was her second hike into that area which she nervous about making the trip is that why she left a note where she just smart about it they never found her there was never any subsequent follow ups after that first sixty days search both of her parents are deceased she didn't have any brothers or sisters there's no\nThere's nothing left of her family any more [noise]\nYou have another a case in in the book about a land disappearance that involves a really smart person

Cody twenty seven years old and ... and Charles McAdams thirty eight years old [noise]\nAnd uh they've left Treasure Island no big deal general patrol all the details on this came from the navy file under a freedom of Information Act I filed fascinating report on this\nWell as they depart they start to head out over the Golden Gate and they start to go out over the Pacific towards the pharaoh on islands\nAnd Cody with control of an L. E. airship and this was originally taken by our military and it was owned by good year and they took it because there was a needed for patrol [noise]\nWe'll both men lived near Moffett Field and non view but they drove up to Treasure Island for the day to leave on their ship\nOr that night water vapor was in the air and it made the ship too heavy to carry a normal for person that would be in the bucket they only left with to\nThe first hundred and ten minutes of the flight was normal in fact there was no communication and then at seven fifty am the crew radio that they were investigating a suspicious oil slick and there were five miles to the fair on islands [noise]\nAt eight oh five numerous attempts by radio to reach the crew but there was no luck\nAnd the navy scramble to over to you kingfisher aircraft out of Alameda naval air station to go track down the boy what a plane's encountered cloudy weather with a ceiling a five hundred feet they decided it was too dangerous to fly below the crowd so they flew above them\nAt ten forty five AM Moffett Field received a call from Fort funds to near the Golden Gate stating that they are to LA ship with two pilots and all we're fine\nWell the navy made a huge sigh of relief and they felt that all was okay now this was a really really weird call but it was in the file and they couldn't explain why it was there [noise]\nAnd then at a weapon Fifteen for function calls Moffett Field against they didn't get that in LA had crashed in the hills at Daly city Daly city is just south of San Francisco on the coast\nOr the navy response to Daly city and they find their airship on the ground with one bomb missing the gone to was in near perfect condition both motors on the ship or off even though one trial was half open and the other was all the oil\nAnd the crew which was required were white preserves over the water both of their life preserver that they were supposed to be wearing were gone there was a confidential maybe briefcase in each a airship and that was still intact the cabin door was open plenty of fuel within the tanks\nThe radio was in perfect condition no distress call\nFor fun and called back and say they they made a serious mistake know LA was present at the Fort that couldn't explain why they made that original call [noise]\nCentral coast of California had a major search that started almost immediately the navy found to fishing boats and navy boat in a postcard ship that's all the blimp dip\nAnd drop to wears on the oil slick the blimp then gained altitude and disappeared into the crowds they said all appear fairly normal but it did go into the crowd and disappear\nThe crash happened at four thirty to build your street Daly city three miles east of the Pacific ocean\nThe crew did not use parachutes and shoots that we're in a craft were still there [noise]\nI mean there's a couple of theories that I'm Sorry to interrupt you there was a couple of theories that developed a and that the theories are just about as weird as the disappearances or we're going to go to a break and when we come back we're in the jump into the other details about this case and then I get your take on what might have happened to these two missing crew people [noise]\nEnded the break with journey wheel in the sky\nMind them more of us and I just log on to go to ... am dot com\n\n\n\n\nSmart

Nineteen Ninety four NAFTA packed\nNews radio nine sixty W. E. R. C.\n[noise]\n\nBefore the break we are talking about this US Navy blimp it's patrolling off the coast to California and uh the blimp comes back crashes on land the crew is gone they pick up the story from there [noise] for\nThe navy did their investigation and they said that uh there was no fire on board when it hit the beach originally when it hit land it dropped one of its bombs accidentally that made the blimp wider was able to take off again and crashing that Daly city neighborhood\nThere was a massive search off the coast that went on for days and they never found anything they reviewed radio bugs there was no call for help\nThey could never explained why the blimp went straight up into the crowds after dropping the players and they thought that it would have stayed lower to watch are like that they were watching on the water there were lots of water craft in that area\nThey never found the crew or the emergency survival equipment that they were wearing\nAnd there's an area outside the Golden Gate that I've written about many times before because just north of San Francisco [noise] yup point raised national park which has had several strange disappearances I've documented\nAnd just south of the Golden Gate to a location called the half moon bay in that area because I've written about other disappearances that are very very strange no other part of the northern California coast north of that coin raise area\nAnd nothing immediately south half moon bay so it's this one area that has just strangeness attached to it and like you said they they came up with some explanation for to me that were laughable [noise]\n[noise]\nWell uh like uh maybe they got into an argument and uh and both fell off or maybe one of them accidentally fell over and the other guy tried to save him and was pulled into the water or\nI mean could that could does not have happened [noise]\n[noise] what do you think George [laughter]\nWell I'm just asking you did to respond to those stories that doesn't seem like a there was any kind of a disturbance sign of disturbance in the in what was left or the craft or a and if they were wearing their life jackets you'd think that they would still be had been floating around out there when the when the search was underway\nOr even if they come out of their life jacket they would have recovered the jak [noise] right because the area of the water that was searched up there with search so thoroughly and eventually those jackets are gonna wash up the shore and they would have recovered them on the beach so\nOh these explanations absolutely made no sense at all\nYou have another case from Scotland a that was held Nineteen Seventy five\nBefore I get into that if I Want to address something that you said just after the break and that was an explanation that fits the facts and I immediately thought of in Walker ranch you know\nGive is going to bring this up at some point um you know as I read this book today um\nI notice that you you've ventured a little bit farther than you have in previous works or in the land in the air disappearances there's the Fred let Frederick ... case which is a famous UFO case\nThere's also a reference to a needs a National Institute for discovery science which\nThe organization that was studying skin Walker ranch in and several of the cattle mutilation that had happened and he went to a base in\nAt the circumstances were it looked like these cows had been dropped from the sky some of them disappeared altogether but some of them or their their legs were broken as if they'd been dropped from the sky several of your cases I've thought the same thing in multiple missing for a woman books it looks like people are snatched out of the off the ground\nAnd then some of them are dropped back into these are odd locations little kids that are suddenly miles and miles away I it it seems like I Know you don't want to commit to\nAny particular explanation because you don't have enough evidence to a to point to one in particular but some of the stuff\nCertainly ventures into the area of the paranormal and um I wanted to share this with the audience that I don't know David how how closely you follow the UFO a topic I Know sometimes you get into those subjects but\nIt's been an amazing nine or ten months a where all these documents are coming out about government studies of UFOs the Pentagon's ongoing interest and one of the stories that I was able to break earlier this year was about skin Walker ranch that a program that have been created by the Pentagon\nOr to look at UFOs also went much further that it it studied what we would call paranormal events unexplained\nMysteries at places like skin Walker ranch in elsewhere\nAnd Jeremy core bell is made a film about it and I included in that film and is a reference to our book which had been read in Washington it turns out an earlier this year I was invited to go back by Senator Harry Reid to meet with\nSome people whose names I cannot cannot make public\nBut they are they gave me sort of a download on the UFO mystery and what some of the research had uncovered and uh\nAnd as well as additional information and some of that has been made public but the one of these guys pulls me aside he had a had an ongoing interest in skin Walker ranch and other mysteries related to it and he asked a asked me some questions about the ranch and then he said\nYou know we think that that guy de ... that are\nThat his mystery with these missing people might be related to the phenomenon at the ranch\nAnd I ask a couple of questions it didn't seem to have a real solid answer or not one that they would share with me but the idea that the phenomenon that's been seen there which is sometimes playful and sometimes dangerous\nMight be related to yours startled me and I don't know how you react to that but maybe it makes you uncomfortable or being associated with anything as weird as that but you're stuff's pretty weird too [noise]\nSo how would you rank this person's credibility and integrity on a topic like this [noise] [noise]\nUm I'd say this person that I'm Talking about knows more about it than any one [noise] and I don't mean just in the military I mean anyone uh he's this person has seen a lot of stuff that the the public has never seen so [noise]\nYou know he he has a very broad spectrum and a very broad knowledge base about what we would call paranormal including UFOs and alleged abductions and things of that sort so I don't know exactly how your a phenomena fit in with a larger picture\nBut the idea that somebody who's been looking at it is a I think that's pretty interesting\n[noise] [noise] that's a wakeup call [noise] I think so [noise] um [noise]\nSo you know way back when we first started to talk about the ranch I really put an emphasis on that area to see if there was anything related to disappear as I could think might come into the can relate it to the activity there\nAnd you know there's really nothing around that ranch that I could say is related to missing people that I study but\nEthics seated before sometimes I think\nI I related to law enforcement and if you have a say a series of bank robberies\nThe bank robbers aren't ever going to do a bank robbery in their neighborhood because they don't want to draw attention to it and I've always stayed at that I think that this is related to the profile points I I gave you one of those is water\nAnd when you look at Mississippi and Louisiana say it's just filled with water [noise] and I have no cases from there\nIt's bizarre [noise] and isn't George isn't there a lake fairly near that ranch [noise]\nYeah it's ... it's a reservoir it's cold bottle hollow [noise]\nUm it's manmade lake ... but the most right in the middle of the ... reservation you control that property and they allow camping and fishing and swimming and things of that sort of that lake is a a [noise]\n... has a long history of really weird stuff creatures have been seen there and the objects coming in and out of the water and there but a lot of drowning said that they the ... tribe believes that or there's something in the water that pulls you down a lot of people have drowned there and\nSo you're right I get asked all the time if there's anybody in the vicinity the ranch who meets your criteria who's banished like that and I have to say no\nOther than animals livestock things that's or but no people have a banished than I Know of course we haven't really dug into the historical archives or\nTo the

and we started talking and walking within five minutes another family came from around out seemed like to me out of nowhere\nAnd there were picnic tables right near there and one woman who I was very suspicious of that just appeared said Hi to the other one and she had a girl\nAnd the shuttle can our kids play and the people that I have been walking with the mother said yeah and we shut down at a picnic table and the strange woman said to the other lady that I had to walk with what's your name\nThey they tell their name and the woman says that's our name too\nAnd then about three minutes later

jumped\nAt least twenty feet from the ground without running jumped up to the the middle of a tree where the you know the branches start coming out\nAnd then I just turned around and I went back I

experience been\nWell back in time I had rented campaign hair and a crank varian ah my friend's wife was going off into the play is my friend that he might read high looking at him\nAnd he had a whole is white back for like the wrong way raptor and there was like ... noises about the future of like a greyhound\nOf hey you know just walking on both parts later on a couple of weeks later because we're running out of their company and it never was ever nothing was ever said if it ever again you know anything about that or\nI don't know anything about that specific a creature or creature report but I Do know that uh the ... of area has been a hotbed for really weird stuff rubbery long time or the guys who investigated the skin Walker phenomena Utah spend some time on the ground up there collecting information and stories rumble\nLocals including the tribe and had reported the number of different kinds of creatures it's always been a UFO hotspot or at least for the last fifty or so years so there's a lot of weird stuff concentrated in the area you're discussing uh but no I hadn't heard the story about the\nThe two girls there's no way they lifted any weight and even to adult men that looked like lumberjacks again they look just like the people on the brownie paper towels\nWould have had a hard time picking up a like a four hundred pound ATV and somehow getting it over this huge trench in mound of dirt\nThey looked at me odd they said they were up there scouting areas to hunt the two twin girls in the backseat\nLooked like they were in their Sunday Best church clothes I Can't remember this is a long time ago I Can't remember specifically if they were wearing dresses but I Swear to goodness it looked like they just came out of church they might have been in dress is not what you would expect\nFor going out scouting hunting areas in the rain forest in the woods um they were like blonde hair blue eyes wide again just like of aliens came down here and said how do we blend in and looked like humans\nIt was like they were too perfect ... not a flaw not expected dirt know dirt on their face their hair was perfectly comb their clothes I didn't even see a a a single wrinkle\nThe cloud shirts were tucked into their waistline not seem like you would expect out in the woods in the middle of nowhere\nSo they just comment you were looking for a place to go hunting as they're driving by or did they stopped to chat\nThey kind of stopped and chatted they they see me they see me coming down the road and so they pulled off and they kind of parked a little bit and I I stopped in I I chatted with them probably\nProbably two minutes probably two or three minutes of course I was on my way down to the lake and like I said I've just got this logical brain\nThat seems to just kind of reason away anything and all these weird events that I've had in my life\nSometimes don't sink in until after the fact [noise] and you know I started thinking about it well wait a minute how did they even get that ATV onto the road that show [laughter] alone how weird their appearance was I mean I was struck by how odd it was at the time but um\nYou know I just kind of reason to the way that well there are people but I tell you up in those woods there'd been some strange strange events uh I I called in a while back I talk to you when you talk to the big foot researcher that the records their their sounds\nIt was those sim woods where I heard this ah ungodly sound that couldn't be any other animal and I don't think of the best opera singer POV raunchy could have imitated the sound\nAnd I'd encourage you to find out what coast to coast did with the audio tape they used to play of this a legit big foot recording\nTen or more years ago George ... used to play it I think art bell used to play it hasn't been played for years but I heard that up in the shame woods it's a unique recording never heard of it before I'm starting to buying more and more to the fact that these big puts might be dimensional\nMight have a a extraterrestrial connection\nThese humanoid that I saw in the woods the more I think about it there's\nI'm Ninety nine point nine percent sure those were not humans and\nHindsight I'm just glad they didn't take me whatever they were doing up in that area\nWell we're glad to cause a ... you wouldn't have been able to call in presumably thank you Jason

there's nobody around her hours up there and we went down to look at it starts with an ...\nAnd I heard that same sound that he's talking about as\nAs I Know what you're talking about um and it at a weird psychic effect I don't know anybody else it had this experience but um it was kinda like hey what are you doing up here and I've got a second guessing but oil and really far away and uh you know maybe I'm just imagining that\nSo I kept and I'll look at the stars in about ten minutes and they closed it say at least three miles in maybe ten minutes\nAnd it did the same sound again only the the

Wednesday ... going to be back on the air\nAnd I always tell them not soon enough we get more requests for Dave than any other guest that I've experienced is I've been with the program for ten years and that's a that's because he always brings the goods I Am jazz that he always allows me to get the first interview when he unveils a new book and like the other books this new one does not disappoint\nA Davis you probably know spent Twenty years in law enforcement then worked in the tech industry for a bit but found this true calling as an investigator of unusual disappearances and his work in that area has become a phenomenon known all over the world multiple books a documentary film\nAnd maybe some other surprises to come Dave great to have you back\nIn Georgia I'm always humbled that anyone even wants to listen to listen to me though or appreciate the invite\nI wanted to say you know I noticed something as I was reading the new book today that you make some personal observations than I have not uh I haven't seen it you go this far\nIn the other books uh insights into your own emotional reactions to some of these cases and it seems clear like the subject really gets to yeah you've got I think eleven hundred and thirty five cases that you profiled over the years thousands more they'd be looked into\nSome of them really seemed to get into your head though I I think in part because of similarities\nOr some of the missing to your own life right\nYou know I think that's true um I've been very fortunate to me family of people who have been lost\nAnd when you meet these people it really brings brings home the emotion and [noise] there's a lot of parallels to my life with a lot of these families and I've written about people that remind me of myself a lot of times and uh [noise]\nI've put the in the book just recently [noise] probably because it's more of an evolution of my writing and\nHopefully people see that you know hey if people are really really good people these are the Drake who is fighting these are\nThe upper echelon and it it's a conundrum to me why I don't find people that are down and out in life that are disappearing but it it seems to me that it's always the high rollers the people that are high performers that are disappearing\nYou know one place in the new book you mentioned how as a rule you did not reach out to the families of the missing now sometimes you meet him in ... due to various circumstances but in general you don't call somebody up out of the blue and say hey can I talk to you about your dad loved one or you're missing loved one\nBecause it seems like an invisible line that you don't want to cross over but I Wonder has the success of your books help in the sense that these families now reach out to you\nThat they're unsatisfied say with the the search effort or something and they're they're turning to you for some help her answers\nIt has happened and uh [noise] I don't want to inject myself into a search or into the turmoil the evolving with somebody disappearing now somebody reaches out want some help absolutely I'm going to be there I'll do everything I can [noise]\nAnd there have been cases just recently where that's happened and I've been glad to help and ah\nI've kinda guided them and it it seems that a lot of these families and covered the same sort of issues time and time again and frustrating as heck to sit back and hear the frustration and their voice or\nA common one is is it seems as though when jurisdictions stop searching they get to a point seven to ten days and they say hey there's nothing else we can do there's no place else to search\nA we're running out of resources we've got to stop well many times families and friends rally at that point and they get a group together and they keep searching\nFor what I tell these people is you've got to get a copy of those reports that the jurisdiction wrote search and rescue reports law enforcement report the who they interviewed who they talked to were they search the effectiveness of the search\nOr the areas they completely eliminated and the and the areas that they thought that they still should search more because without that you really searching blind and there's been instances just lately where people have said no they said they won't give us anything [noise] I find that baffling [noise]\nI mean that's how they've treated you I was gonna ask you the same question about different agencies I Know how the national Park Service feels about you and that they are we should anybody\nWho has not hurt your earlier interviews or is not familiar with the books you might be listening tonight I'm maybe we started there where you can explain the history of your interaction with the national Park Service the forest service government entities in general because they've shut you out I mean I guess\nI I'm interested to learn that they're doing the same thing to the families of the missing but it's really kind of clear over the big picture that they don't want to help solve these mysteries\nOr you know it it's a sad note on humanity if that's the case but there is a lot of obstruction so when I started out I was told by a couple of Park Service rangers that they had found\nDisappearances and their parks where they had worked that bothered them didn't make sense when they tried to find information that couldn't [noise] and they thought somebody with an investigative background on to be looking into it\nAnd that's sort of how it all started and I filed a series of freedom of Information Act requests against the national Park Service they have the largest contingent of federal we train police officers and the national park police\nAnd they're trained at the federal law
