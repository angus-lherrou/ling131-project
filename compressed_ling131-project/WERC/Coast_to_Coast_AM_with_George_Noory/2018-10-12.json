aren't like that they're not as polarized down here\nIn the U.S we are polarized this Kavanaugh thing it was just pure partisan\nYou know the Republicans bullied him and the Democrats believed her the

I've never I mean if this was there was no common sense no rationality it was just political partisanship and the people the Republicans hated the Democrats for attacking this guy and the Democrats\nHated the Republicans for defending him and in installing this thing and cutting I mean this is like\nI mean and and and who's got all the guns in the world we do so so this is really

this is going to be different people\nThe the blue and the red extremes are going to blame each other for the crisis to Republicans say damn Democrats let all this debt run up and all this you know free money and stuff\nAnd the and the Democrats are and say Republicans you didn't let us stimulate on up and blah blah blah blah blah and and and they're gonna hate each other and and so I I think that's going to be the worst part of this\nThat we really and and and I really think there's a possibility that there's going to be movements in this time or in the civil war I compare there's more to the civil war on the social political level at that time the south seceded from the more industrial and urbanized north they were totally different I mean the north was blue\nThe south has read this time [noise]\nEspecially with Republicans in charge now I think there's going to be facts I think states like California or the whole west coast\nOr the whole northeast is going to threaten to succeed from the red states because they can't agree on anything there is nothing that can be agreed on his cabinet thing was the perfect example that no middle ground it's either red or blue you know\nAnd

this is this is when it's gonna\nYou know it's going to happen or not it it's either starting to happen now or or the latest by my calculations with every cycle we have an everything we got a ... vote is going to start by late next year and that's going to be a Ninety year\nAnniversary of the greatest\nStock crash in modern history Nineteen twenty nine to thirty two and that is a one of many of our cycles we cover in zero hour\nAnd in our newsletters that Ninety year cycle is the most powerful for the biggest what I call you know downturns depressions and the biggest stock crashes and this has happened\nEvery Ninety years since the industrial revolution cause the greatest boom and global his\nLawn you know here we had a couple of guests on who say very similar things what you're saying the timing was off some of them said things were going to happen back last September lose one fellow who was talking about Jewish prophecy and he called the ... meter\nYeah yeah I remember that guy and you didn't happen it didn't happen then but you could happen now you're\nWell yeah I mean we we were in the same position and we were coming into a two thousand sixteen the marketed gone sideways for you were saying you know this looks like in may that finally Tom and then\nTrump got elected I mean we turn boys I mean when Trump\nHad that surprised when and the markets were had a two thousand point reversal from down nine hundred to ... eleven hundred just overnight and end of the morning I said look this is a reversal\nThis is a tax cut coming in and all this sort of stuff this is going to extend this boom another year or two another twenty to thirty percent or more\nAnd that's what's happened but now we're on the other side of that now we've seen most of that\nUm and we're running out of tricks I mean what can you do now and the Democrats may when the house it looks likely possibly the Senate but it's going to be much harder for Trump to push his gravy train for businesses\nIt as the Democrats get more control and I see the economy falling\nPart by two thousand twenty at the latest and that\nThat's not good to when I was just going to say\nI don't think Trump gets reelected and they may not even make it we're tracking Watergate on a forty five year cycle almost to the tea\nWhich would say you're about to see the special prosecutor get fired up elections early next year and\nTrump could be in trouble by late next year so so are there were peaking now or best in the polls on and noticed that there were going to peak late next year and see the greatest crashing history I don't see any other two options I don't see this bubble laughing pass\nNext the next year but there is there is a fifty fifty chance it's happening now and you don't want to get hit by that forty

we can predict out decades I mean I was predicting this you know\nThe trouble in the economy started in two thousand eight back in the late eighties I'm\nJust from the baby boom generation where they would predictably spent and when they would stop spent ...\nSo yes what we see is it the worst of this downturn in what we call the winter season that started in two thousand eight will be over about probably about late two thousand twenty two for stocks uh two thousand twenty three for the economy will be the worst\nAnd and probably real estate out there maybe a little longer real estate takes longer to crash and longer to come back\nAnd then we'll start to see a global boom again from about twenty two thousand twenty three all the way into two thousand thirty six that'll be the next\nGlobal boom the difference is George is that it will be concentrated as it has been thus far but even more so in Asia and especially in India and south east Asia most developed countries a lot of Europe Japan and East Asia have continued bad demographics of the United states has kind of the best house in a bad neighborhood\nOr where our demographics or we have a strong millennial generation but not as strong as the baby boom so we'll\nWe'll be in the middle but yeah we can tell about when the economy will turn around and where it will be the strongest the other thing we the biggest Boston bubble burst all ready has been a commodities\nAnd things like oil and iron ore commodities are down Seventy percent it worse so far oil and iron ore eighty percent there's going to be another big commodity boom and bobble which will be driven by the emerging world and they're the biggest commodity producers and consumers they spent much more money there\nSo you can buy these metals and things like that everything from gold\nIron ore and and and copper and things like that and there'll be an incredible boom and again you just wait for them to go down first so yeah but next\nBut between now and two thousand twenty two twenty three\nIs going to be way more on the downside of after that the world starts to recover and again that's when you buy stuff into the only difference on George is a real estate has a new factor this never had before because the baby boomer so large because older people\nWhen they die they are literally permanent shelters if you want to call it a real estate\nAnd more and more countries including the U.S today massively in Japan and places like Germany there's more old people dying and selling homes that young people up the next generation coming in buying so\nWhen we adjust for that real estate is not going to come zooming back and a lot of countries like stocks will so and and of course the aging baby boom sectors like health care will do better than other sector so in our newsletter which by the way people can get on our free newsletter by just going to Harry ... dot com and that's going to be really fun to be the next year\nThat it it's going to be different sectors the next boom is not going to favor everything eighty three two thousand and seven everything went up the next boom is going to be more selective but there will be\nThe next global boom and and we can tell you when it's going to come and we can tell you about when it's going to peak\nEvery what happens if we ever regional war somewhere what's that going to do to to the economy\nWell you know wars are actually stimulate I've been a lot of ways especially if you're not fighting of people don't realize World War one was the greatest gift ever given the United States Europe was at war and we were supplying them with everything from farming commodity\nBut I used to you know a transportation automobiles are tanks and everything we became a major exporter to Europe over that so you know that goes both ways but wars tend to cause higher inflation\nWars disrupt things and and\nUh the great depression was followed by World War two the disruption a around the world and makes people angry as we're seeing now and even worse this time and then when things get scarce and there's a fixed pie countries tend to fight over things we've this trade war and we said this and this zero our book\nCame out a year ago this trade war with China and it is a global thing as well this is not just a short term thing and Jack Ma from LA Bob came out just a month ago and said this is going to take at least Twenty years to sort out\nThis is a major war between the leading to countries the U.S and China who's going to be king and that's why China China should be giving in more because Trump's right about this\nThat they need us or our trade is three times tilted towards them this is going to hurt them more but it's more important to them because they're the up and coming and they don't want to get in too much because they see this is a long term battle and they think longer term so\nSo I don't know if it's more a trade war but but there's certainly after this downturn coming out of this downturn [noise] the the potential for wars around the world will tend to grow\nAnd that's where I go to Peter and cotton wood Arizona did get things started with us I'm Peter\nHi hey thank you for taking my call this is great I'm sure they're going to be a bank holiday during crash\nThat's an interesting question what do you think [noise]\nYeah yeah I mean that definitely tends to happen and and that's what happened in the great depression of course because people don't realize banks can lend up to ten times their reserves and guess what their reserves are ten percent of their deposits and whose money is that that's our money they're pledging now they also tend to have you know capital they raise up to about ten percent [noise]\nSo so they're they're at risk of two but yes when when you get problem like this banking system will get in trouble especially when real estate goes down that we saw that in two thousand eight and nine forward\nAnd all of a sudden they don't have money now the new trick and then I'm I'm getting ready to go into a ... city tour in Australia and it's a big concern there because their housing bubbles already starting to crack a head of ours this time\nIs it banks in Cyprus just said well you know what we need money we're just going to wipe out of the the more affluent accounts were just going to take you know ten twenty thirty forty fifty percent of their count and say look I'm Sorry we need this we're gonna take your deposits\nAnd work in a kind of ... them into equity in our dying bank who wants to equity in a dying bank so this is in in in ... even in Australia that people are realizing\nThey're not supposed to do that but there's loopholes were in an emergency banks can do that so people have to worry you know you need to spread your money around I tell people all your access money\nOther than you need to pay your bills should be in a brokerage account whether it's in a bank or a brokerage firm or an on line from I and I prefer firms that are not into lending that's why I like a lot of the online trading firms that have [noise]\nHave it in a brokerage account 'cause they can't borrow against that they can't swipe that but they can deposits in savings account so yes this can happen and people\nLost their deposits a lot of people there was a run on the banks this happens in in in in the magnitude of what I'm Talking about\nIs exactly what had happened doesn't happen in a normal recession like we've seen it started to happen in some countries the last global crisis it will happen big

I'm going to stay on the line because I Know you're gonna have questions and I want to get a few legs and because I Want to age are twenty three sixty thinks the path\nThat I I Do think I mean this is going to have to happen a lot of rules are going to change just like banks may suddenly started swiping money out of more fluent accounts\nThey're going to have to have forgiveness these loans are going to have to be restructured all loans are going to have to be restructured\nUm except for the most sovereign like U.S Treasury bonds and that may not be but\nBut this is the key to going through this the countries that restructure their debt and we restructured massive amounts of private debt and the great depression it made a stronger coming out Japan never restructured any of their debt and they're in a coma economy forever even when they're next young generation\nIs come along so I I my bet is\nThat they're going to come to point we're going to have to say no we have to allow restructuring of student loans or to owner as we went to find that to me what happened the education establishment I'll even call it a mafia\nBasically overcharging had the greatest inflation next you know of any sector education even more than healthcare\nThey're on a run and win win that got too hard they say okay we can encourage student loans\nThen people can afford these higher prices we can keep our bubble going this bubble has burst and and and too many students are never going to be able to pay off his loan so when you have excess loans it's better to admit it just like a drug addict\nAnd then change policies and restructure detox I call it de leveraging go on we're gonna have to forgive or restructure down these student loans however it happens\nIf it makes it changing in the rulings yes I I Would say that's highly likely in the next couple of years\nTwo thousand a year and I saw one way to bail out everything would be to give people like a hundred thousand dollars in the voucher to buy some good what do you say\nWell here's a I don't like money printing except in emergencies like I think they should have done money printing quantitative easing for the first year in two thousand I like they did just to make sure the banking system doesn't just melt down like it did rapidly in the great depression but to put it on\nA ... a ... you know permanent quantitative easing just perverts the entire system is bad but the second thing I always said if you're going to print money don't give it to the damn banks\nWho got us in trouble and did all this leverage and\nIn the rivers and all this crazy stuff in the first place just sin if you know send period ... to to get us out of the at least send the money to everyday people send them a check I wouldn't say a hundred thousand but if they just sent everybody at twenty five every household at twenty thousand dollar check\nThat would have done a lot better for the economy and then in that that would help banks because things wouldn't have been as bad for the economy but\nIt would have helped people instead of the banking system this whole bailout this whole quantitative easing has only made Wall Street stronger only made the rich richer as only benefited corporate including these tax cuts and has not benefited main steal\nThe reason why I wanted it as a volunteer as opposed to check he really is because I wanted them to be forced to spend the red line you\nKnow right and they don't spend it or the you're right that that's much better way the point is to get every day people some relief and and have them spend that money or to stimulate the economy and then that helps that you know businesses and banks and everything but it should have gone to the people and not to the damn banks\nNext up we're going to hear in Port Huron hello Harry\n... well hello there George and Harry him that question you mentioned earlier about the banks and you mentioned it again just now but I'm taking the money I'm placing my what about credit unions are they going to be doing the same thing or what's what's up with those\nOkay I I Would much rather have my money in a credit union than a than a money center bank\nBecause that's where all the leverage has been it was kind of opposite end the great depression a lot of people a lot a lot of the problems was forms were over expanding\nAnd borrowing money and those were in more rural areas and that's where the trouble is and it was rural banks going under more than the money center by this is totally money center banks thing\nAnd and also when you do a bank if governments have takes brokerage money or pull ... they're going to do for the more fluent towns and those going to be in the in the bigger money center banks so I'd much rather have my money and a credit union\nThan you know bank of America or Wells Fargo or or ... or city bank and stuff like that\nOkay let's take a call or two before we wrap things up with ...

to the program Dr many mate is on the coast to coast Dr welcome to the show I'm looking forward to this\nThanks for inviting me\nVery interesting that the somebody with your medical and psychiatric background would be so heavily involved in the paranormal and how did that all happened for you was it the near death experiences that started it\nWell I think it was because I almost died so many times\nYou know when my book the borders Norma first came out many people asked me if the book was based on stories with my patients had told me that my aunt was always no not at all because whatever patient tells the doctor with confidential\nAdopted bound by the Hippocratic Oath states that are doctors should not be paid anything he told by patience and I don't so the material in my book was based entirely on my own personal experiences\nPlus stories from my readers and for my audiences and from family and friends and from I own extensive reading research into the paranormal in terms of why I had the experiences I think it is related to the fact that I had some close calls with that so many ... that\nUm you know it's been a lot of little tribute and about the near death experience ... ... that\nThe um term near death experience\nYou know it's going back Dr vehement moody in Nineteen Seventy five so that's over forty years ago that's right I think he estimated that something like one thirty Americans that had a near death experience or know someone who has had one and that's a large group of people\nBut it's an even larger group of people who have almost died but never would pronounce clinically dead and never had the typical near death experience\nBut when I look at how my close Russia's staff effected me I see that I have some of the things after effects that Dr moody described in his patients who had a classic near death experience\nIn other words I'm having had all these close calls it that I and to have a deeper appreciation of life and I I also have overcome my fear of dying and I have found get myself a shift from materialism into spirituality and then they and an increased need to find meaning and purpose in life\nWas that a pretty dramatic shift for you\nKnow not at all I I Would say was gradual\nThe first um couple the paranormal experiences I had I was quite young and I honestly I didn't think anything that might just kind of ... the ... you know I just thought well that was weird but I didn't tell anyone about them because I didn't think anyone would believe me and in those days no one talked about those experiences\nBecause there was no rational way to explain them but then as time went on and I got more and more of these experiences and when I went to um a life threatening illness and and came out on the other side thanks to a stem cell transplant from an anonymous donor\nOh jeez well yeah that was that was quite dramatic I'm at that point I felt like I Need to share\nWhat I've been going through because it would help other people\nIn the ... stem cell transplant so why didn't they let harvest stem cells from yourself [noise]\n[noise] well that's one way of doing it that the the um anonymous stem cells donated pollen allergen\nIt ... ... with more effective they actually found someone on the worldwide in computer I just feel like I'm the owner bank and they found his name on the computer and he was a perfect match for me\nOr the super ... what was what was wrong if you want to get into that\nOh sure well I got leukemia ooh jeeze\nUm yeah and I had it for many years well actually I had leukemia for sixteen years and I was in the hospital I had numerous um if I can fusion numerous courses of chemotherapy and then finally the doctor said you can't keep giving you a team of therapy because it's getting too much damage to your body\nYou was it was still in remission\n[noise] [noise] well you have to be any mission in order to receive a tax on so they gave me chemotherapy um and I was in remission but then I Would keep having lived in that fight and that they gave me the ... ah [noise] now the patient who gave me the ... with an anonymous donor with it\nThe rule at the time was that after you when you I was allowed to contact him if he agreed to contact them\nAnd I did write to him just to thank him for his generosity and I found out that he was in the he's the ... was the name of the U.S navy\nAnd when his name came up on the computer he was stationed on an aircraft carrier in the Persian Gulf wow [noise]\nSo he was flown back into the building who sent from Washington DC and the team from the city where I live flew down to Washington and took a sample of his themselves and then flew back to my city and that's what happened and that was eight years ago and I've been fine ever since\nThen have you still in touch with him did that happen\nYes um I actually met him in in DC and we kept in touch and we've become friends\nThat's amazing you save your life\nHe did I can thank him enough he did save my life\nAnd they hear altruism you know he said the way it came about was um [noise] they were having a donor drive and one of the bases where he was stationed and he just got in line with his buddies and all is required is itchy swab I said that's it\nYeah it just it takes time to get the DNA so that's when his name into the donor bank\nAnd then um years later my name came up on the computer and at that point he's even forgotten that he had agreed to be a donor [noise]\nBut then once you know ... we found out that he was a perfect match for me and he was flown back to the ... center in DC they gave him some injections to stimulate his bone marrow seafood produce more stem cells\nAnd they gave him these injections for five days and then he had produced enough themselves so they took a blood sample which can painted themselves and that was what was brought back to where I live in but yes we've become friends than I just I'm not too long ago\nDr ... the fact that you are dabbling so heavily into the psychic Rome has that help or hurt your psyche has your practice\n[noise] well I tried to keep the two things separate I mean\nYou know in terms of the psychiatric patients generally they don't talk about paranormal experiences they have you know serious mental disorders that they need help with and that's why they come to the if the ... [noise]\nHowever since I have that experience in psychiatry I'm able to help people distinguish between ... experience and much a psychotic experience\nRight and and and there's a big difference there\nWell absolutely there is a big difference I mean sometimes if a person the something or here's something they don't know what it is they think they're losing their mind but\nIn fact these types of experiences are quite common you know for example um if\nSomeone is believed if they've lost it I'm a spouse or a child quite often will be some type of post death contact with the deceased loved one\nSo let's say a widow might see her deceased has been in her bedroom at night and she might talk to him or she might feel his tax on her shoulder or something like that and these experiences are quite common\nIn fact one study showed that up to fifty percent of people who've lost of of a loved one will have some type of post death contact with a loved one even if a person has no belief in an afterlife and many of them don't I mean these these types of experiences are not related to religious beliefs or belief in an afterlife\nUm in in fact you know atheist and agnostics have these experiences while as religious people\nYou see that everyone is psyche again I I tend to believe you and agree with you\nOK but uh when you say that what's the basis for that what makes you say that\nWell the thing is the word psyche covers a lot of territory\nYou know it includes things such as ESP or telepathy or pre cognitive beams and other things you talk to both touches visions of voices and so on that that vision is near death experiences so certain types of fake experiences such as ESP\nUntil after the extremely common and a lot of people have experienced that type of thing\nUm for example someone phones you and you were thinking about that first and then you say oh you must be ... that was just thinking about\nYou right what does that very common um and I think everyone has the ability if they're interested to nurture their intuition or their ESP or they have a path a fence but a lot of people aren't interested in it as I said when I first had these experiences myself I just kind of brush them off I didn't think too much of them\nWas really only after I got sick that I start to think that maybe there was more to it than meets the eye\nWith with the psychic roam out there in the ability to tap into it have you found that certain people are better rather than others\nYes definitely um well I think the most important thing is whether the person is interested in it and whether or not they're paying attention to it but the other thing I've noticed is that the second ability often runs in families [noise] um\nTo go to ... dot com and downloaded today [noise]\n[noise] news radio nine sixty W.

C.\n[noise]\n\nAnd\nWelcome back with Dr many major U.S we're talking about his work the borders of normal a clinical psychiatrist de stigmatize as paranormal phenomenon many let's talk a little bit about to death bed visions and your thoughts about that do you believe they're extremely common don't you [noise]\n[noise] that's right a lot of studies have shown that it's it's very common for someone who is dying to see a deceased friend or relative\nUm that actually happened with my dad when he was in the hospital he thought his late sister he mentioned oh they do until you mentioned her name she's out in the hall and there was one study that was done in a hospice\nWith dying patients and they found a lot of these patients I'm said someone who is coming to take them and they called they didn't call them visions they called them visitors\nSo sometimes people have these experiences have these dreams and they disregard them you know and I've heard of other cases like that too so as you say\nThese ... can be very powerful and and where does this where does this message come from that brings up another subject which is sometimes people the messages in ... cognitive\nAnd who's giving them the message\nChats the question right with this message coming from you know we can we can speculate you know we can say it's coming from the unconscious or we could say it's coming from something they've added we could say it's coming from the spirit world\nYou know but some of these messages for example this woman I mentioned who had the dream that should be killed in a terrorist attack where would that be coming from that couldn't be her fear\nMhm you know um and maybe it's just a coincidence that somehow in something like that happens it seems to be more than a coincident\nNews there was a movie about a group of people government people who tried to enter the dream state\nOf other government to leaders to to assassinate them and you know the wanted them to die of heart attacks and they were going to put fear into their dreams and stuff like that do you think that really might be going on many\n[noise] [noise] well that reminds me of the collapse of the studies that I mentioned that were being conducted at my monitor these medical center in New York 'cause I think people can be more susceptible to telepathy I don't know\nWhile they're dreaming while he was the I don't know to the point of getting having making someone have a heart attack I don't know if that would be possible if that's ever been done\nWell who knows when people die in their sleep what caused right that's\nRight that's right because you know I sort of take the position that anything is possible you know and I think that's possible although we don't really know and how how did we know it's right you know so yeah\nThat could be pretty remarkable mhm\n[noise] yeah I was also talking about messages in dreams because I've also had that experience where I received a message but it wasn't um\nIt pay cognitive gene that's just a message and I didn't even know what to make of it that I remembered it just clear as day when I woke up this is the message I got I I just saw these where it said this is a world of illusion\n... and the biggest illusion is time\nDidn't Caesar's wife have a premonition about the ides of march [noise]\n[noise] that's right in fact she dreamt the night before he was killed she dreamt that he was going to be assassinated [noise]\nShe begged him not to go to the Senate hate in order to please also with his favorite told Julius Caesar the where the ides of march which is the fifteenth of march and he he ... ignored his wife and he was killed so yeah that was a very strong feminist premonition is usually a warning\nHow many people don't act on their premonition stole maybe\nI'd say probably the majority I Would agree\nBecause I don't think people believe them they don't believe they're intuition\nAnd then they do the water should uh after the fact\nYeah exactly and how many times has that happened I Know\nThat said the majority of people don't pay attention to it because they they think well we live in a you know scientific rational society and we need to think of things rationally and they ... the guard things which could be dismissed that superstition is always the fear of being labeled superstitious [noise]\nThere was a a movie called let it ride with Richard ... was above horse racing and ... one of his friends apparently really\nUnderstood who's gonna win the race but didn't bet on that horse spent on something else and lost in ... in the movie screaming in the ground you knew you knew you knew that is a little like not acting on your premonition\nYeah for sure that is yeah and you wonder why I think it's fair I think people are they don't believe that\nThey don't believe in also they were afraid of getting into something which appears irrational\nTell me a little bit about blind people in a obese and things like that\nWell that that's very interesting story because there have been reports of blind patients who've been blind since birth who have another body experience during surgery\nAnd then when they recover from the anesthesia and they wake up to ... to tell the doctors and nurses\nAre what they saw and what they heard while they were out of their bodies there was one patient who was blind who when he returned to his body after the surgery was able to describe the color and the pattern on his doctors pie and of course the doctor was astounded\nThere was another case of a blind patients who left his body during surgery [noise] I think no he was he was wasn't surgery he had a cardiac arrest and they took out his dentures and he left his body and he was observing everything that was going on\nAnd then when he when he recovered and they couldn't find where she put his statues\nAnd he wanted his teeth back right\nBack but then\nThen they said I don't know I put them and he said well when I was out of my body I saw you put them in that door over there and she open that door and sure enough there\nThey were they were wild yeah it works is work yeah\nWhat what have you learned many about all of this what do you think it is\n[noise] [noise] [noise] I think well I think that there's a spiritual component life I have to say that\nYou do I do and you don't think it's pure norm [noise]\nWell I think it's related you see I think it's ... I think it's paranormal and I think it's spiritual I mean there's certain words that are used to describe these experiences are these phenomena some people call them ... some people call them paranormal some people call them spiritual or anomalous or mystical are mysterious\nIsrael different words are being used to describe the same event so I think paranormal events can have a spiritual component [noise]\nYeah but I'm not saying every paranormal event but some do of course it depends on the person who's having experience how they want to interpret it or what they want to how they want to think about it\nOr do you think science should do a better job investigating these things\nOh definitely I think it improves the quality of life for people to feel like there is something more out there that we don't just have to live our routine nine to five eight you know day to day lives that there's something more than we don't really know about and I think it should be explored\nUp next when we come back with Dr many ... we're going to take phone calls your goals your stories about pretty cognitive dreams and so many other things\nYou were just talking about here on the coast to coast they find out more about tonight's gifts logged on to go to ... am dot com\n[noise]\n[noise]\nGoing deep I'm Bob garden discovery by the national\nScience Foundation a team of researchers led by Massachusetts\nGeneral Hospital was on a different time you do see a long\nOne to one covered why sea mammals to take a deep dive and reservists with their lungs no worse for wear on the way\nDown ... della ... she's been injured lose the crushed in silver loving oxygen flooding wouldn't feel heads back oh\n... ... issues good supper information usually response by the body you damage yet the researchers bum no evidence a woman damaging these deep divers how do you protect their lungs removed potentially damaging employment we're spoiled\nResilience is going to be uncovered secret saw you tested were the blood samples to ... offered any protection from you ...\nOh you're bacterial toxin result the toxin trigger barely an inflammatory response from your blood do the same test in humans and the information is fifty to five hundred\nTimes greater and when the team added the room for your blood mouse immune cells there was no inflammatory response this study suggests seals the rooms protective compounds could well be sea divers and offer promise and extending the survival of Oregon's used in transplant this you could say we're learning it feels deepest\nNSF taco\nFirming hat hat on line nine sixty got what we are C. dot com\nI harsh radio see it's three o'clock [noise]\nMichel heads out there see now the cleanup begins ...

tape recorders are kind of clunky\nMhm and uh and to record you'd have to hit two buttons I think like recording play at the same time\nYeah so it turns out that was a nightmare like getting up at three in the morning and trying to hit the button so I went back to just writing things down on paper and of course then the problem is uh getting yourself up out of a drain I figured out a method for that that took me some a reliable\nAnd one night I had a very unusual dream or it doesn't seem unusual and then I decided but what happened later will be interesting and that was as a as a I was in a situation where I'm sitting with two other people and we're sitting outside it's some kind of a table and we're enjoying ourselves having like lunch or something\nAnd the one person in the mail and I feel very very close to him and comfortable with him and then there's a woman and I don't know her\nAnd a one point the the nail says uh and we're outside I'm kind of a format outside like you know couldn't figure out the map but anyway he says I'm a very I have to go to the bathroom\nYou know where it is and I said no you know until we were had been drinking a cup of the line I thought I knew too and so uh yeah let's go look for it and and the dream rafter walk up a rock side but some kind of structure outside of a couple of steps\nAnd then there's another walkway going both ways more cable and then I Would have a couple of them just like many levels and finally I said oh look a there's the bathroom got married\nAnd so I'm looking ahead of them and\nThe and the dream and I get to the door and I pushed to the bathroom door open and there and I'm trying to not be grossed about this but there I see something unusual\nAnd the wind was is in men's rooms have toilets of course we're
