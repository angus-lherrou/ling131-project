longtime friend the coast to coast am a coach and Mitch is a very popular voice of audio books as well his latest the miracle club Mitch welcome back\n... much George great to be here I'll always a pleasure my friend what you've been up to these days well a\nToday is the launch day of the miracle club which is very exciting for me because it's probably the first book I've written that is strictly practical that goes into techniques and methods and it's a big bridge that I've crossed with this book and I'm very grateful to have the chance to talk to the coast family about it\nIt's a great title to by the way the miracle club it sounds like a movie already\n[laughter] you know it was a group of a cult explores here in New York City in the nineteenth century and they were dedicated to exploring everything just like you do\nOn your show and I really wanted to revive the spirit of that original group or their motto was try that that just one more try and that's really been my informal motto throughout my whole life so I use the term in tribute to them\nHow many members that club [laughter] that was probably about five of them they were just a little group [laughter] outside of\nManhattan and Eighteen Seventy five while we're experimenting with finances and medium ship and\nTalking to the dead end table rapping and so on they weren't around for very long but they formed the nucleus of a much larger and more influential group to the esophageal society which is still around today and which is probably responsible for the whole revolution and alternative spirituality\nThat is amazing too because during that era the Eighteen hundreds it seems like the dabbling in the paranormal was different than today Mitch yeah and they really took it seriously didn't they\nVery seriously and they had the bureau of childlike wonder I mean they were delving into mysterious things and they were looking at different dark places\nBut they were doing it with defensive just asking themselves what is out there how can we understand life you know it was a period of time when a Darwinism with in the attendance and people were starting to think maybe we've been wrong about\nGod and spirits any invisible world and these people said listen we don't want to throw science out we embrace science but we want to use science to try to experiment with whether we can detect things about the invisible world\nThomas Edison believe it or not with a member of the original group and he talked about wanting to construct a machine could help people talk to the dead it's not clear whether edits and ultimately did that but he and a major general Adnan Doubleday uh we're both early members\nThat's amazing not tell us a little bit about the book to ... and and because it's also a practical guide book isn't it\nIt really is you know for many years I've written and I've been on the show talking about alternative spiritual history the history of the occult but I've always also considered myself a believing historian I experiment with the ideas and\nYeah I'm methods and approaches that I write about and I wanted to take the opportunity to write about the things that I've tried myself I Believe very strongly in the powers of the mind I Believe that thoughts are cause it if I Believe that if\nYou walk around with a deeply held emotionally charged mental picture that is going to affect what happens to you and you can use that and there are reasons for this and I wanted to write a book that we give people concrete hands on math is\nWhat do you think a miracle is Mitch\nA miracle very simply put is something that is a radical departure from all natural expectation and occurrence that breaks away from everything that you could naturally and reasonably expect to arise\nFrom circumstances and I've experienced miracles in my own life the very fact that you and I are talking you know I didn't start reading my own books until I was into middle age I Am currently fifty two years old and my career did not take off\nUntil I was in my forties and that didn't happen by accident there was a mental picturing there was a visualization\nWas an affirmation as\nWell as a lot of sweat equity but I Do believe if you can find a miracle as a radical departure from circumstance miracles do occur today\nAnd the subtitle of the book in which is how thoughts become reality and you're you're a very strong believer in that aren't you\nI really am and you know it's funny if you actually take a look at your life sometimes there is a long interval sometimes there is a long gestation period between a font and the event but if if if listeners really sit back and survey their lives\nThey will find an uncanny ... grew in sea between things that they've thought about and things that have happened to them\nMitch have you found the people who dabbled with the dark side tend to do some of the similar things that the positive people do but that's something always goes awry for them\nWell it's an interesting question you know we faced these ethical questions of how to use our powers\nAll the time in life you know a person could be completely materialist he or she could be an atheist and they still face ethical questions\nEvery single day about whether they're treating other people fairly honorably if you take seriously as I Do that our minds have these extra physical capacities that responsibility becomes all the more that responsibility becomes that much stronger my contention is that\nHowever we may feel buffet by the winds and currents of life we are much more powerful than we think we are we have a hand in events mentally and and often the shows up in ways that we don't suspect\nSo my messages also be careful be careful because what you're thinking about absolutely has a practical dimension on your life and on the lives of others\nI had a rebel or on before you came on and you use that he was in Israel and of course great mental list and it was telling us the story and how he was commissioned to help the Brits in a soccer match against Scotland\nAnd over the stadium they put him in a helicopter in he was supposed to influence the ball and and I guess when the when the Scottish kicker was going to the ball or a mentally moved in and the guy missed it or something like\nThat [laughter] now here's a story about or he's an old or a family friend and he was over at the house hold up my brother in law I've and when I was Fifteen Years old\nAnd I've and expressed all kinds of skepticism and er he said to him do me a favor arrive and go into your bedroom and drop picture and so I haven't went in his bedroom drew a picture came out and said\nYou drew a house and I was shocked and said that's absolutely true\n[laughter] I Know we had gr Mitchell delayed astronaut when he was on our program\nWas talking about a tie class episode yet at NASA tie class in the ... or or type pin and he lost and you couldn't find it and he was telling me about it in and out of the sky just out of nowhere they heard upping\nAnd it was the tight class that that fell on the ground and came out of nowhere the other part of it the the part that class ... into the the pointed at the end of it yeah was in ... ice cream [laughter]\nYellow swallowed it I mean it's amazing the ability for that [laughter] it's amazing but\nBack to these miracles and we take calls next hour I'd like for people to share miracle stories with you Mitch if we can but\nBack to the dark side of it and I don't want to dabble in the dark in too much but you know not be too but you know people dabble in the dark side the curse other people they put ... on other people\nIn in a lot of cases those things happen to these people yeah how how come than the dark side has that kind of power\n[noise] well it represents something that's in us you know we we we we are beings of of of a broad spectrum\nAnd my contention is that thoughts are ... and whether you are using your thoughts through spell or whether you using your thoughts through a ritual or whether you are projecting thoughts at other people\nSomething's going to happen there is going to be some effect however one of my favorite teachers never God or to grade teacher in the mind power tradition\nTeaches that the only way that you can project\nNegatives spell or thought on to another person is if that person could wish the same thing for someone else is if that person could wish the same thing for someone else if he or she could not get rebounds to use so in a certain sense well we grew up calling the golden rule is protection\nAgainst evil forces and I want people to listen to that very carefully because we're apt to overlook familiar things we are apt to overlook simple things if you are concerned about negative forces in your life the golden rule can serve as an enormous source of protection there is an esoteric and a cult dimensions of the golden rule that we don't always appreciate\nWell that's absolutely true now why do our thoughts shape the reality of what happens\nThis is my contention in the book and I felt they really had to put myself out there and come up with a theory of positive thinking I'm going to be very brief about it across all kinds of Sciences from cyclical research to quantify the arising we have made the determination over the

you're coming to consciousness in the morning use that time that is the prime time for silently reciting affirmation stew yourself\nIt seems to work doesn't\nThat's been my experience George when people ask me for a simple step to take that is always the step I give them again my mantra is never neglect simple things we have a habit of overlooking simple things used them there's more depth there than one might expect\nOne or some of the positive mind control methods we should use\nWell one of the things that's most important is\nWriting things down right down your goals and I don't mean on the computer I mean get out and old fashioned pencil and paper and do it because once you do that you've actually created a physical manifestation so to speak of the thing that you're looking for the actual tactile act\nOf writing something I think not only helps\nPersuade you mentally and in terms of your neural pathways of the goals that you're moving towards\nBut you've actually done something empowering you've done something real if you sit down and for a sustained period of time make a list of things that you truly want in life and you know these are things you want with all your heart there not diversionary but they are essential life goals take that list\nPut it on to some sort of a laminated card or something that you can carry with you look at it morning noon and night think about it as much as possible and when things on that list come to you and over time they will come to you and they may come to quicker than you think just expressed gratitude and most important of all\nDon't tell anyone what you're doing remain silent because sometimes you share these things with other people and the roll their eyes are those say it's nonsense than they knock you off your resolve remain silent make your list carry it with you review it three times a day memorize it and when the results arrive\nExpress things that's a method we can all do\nAnd it's easy isn't it once you get into it\nIt is easy the the the the the important thing is to do it with consistency is to do it with silence and has to do it with total stark honesty\nArriving at a definite aim in life or a a a a a small number of things that coalesce around one aim has enormous power and aim is really another way of saying focus and we know that\nWhen you focus the sun's rays with a magnifying glass prism they become enormously powerful what is a laser other than focused light\nNatural laws are consistent your mind is powerful when it is focused which is why I keep emphasizing the idea that you have to really nail down what you want in a very concrete way and be very honest with yourself that's worth focus comes from\nMitch since you've been doing this have you use these techniques for yourselves\nEvery day every single day George and I must tell you you know I my life has gone in directions\nThat I never could have expected I've done television narrating and and and and written many books and articles\nIncluding in places that are not known for their a cult enthusiasm I've written about these topics in the Washington Post the wall Street Journal the New York times I never dreamt that was possible and so I feel like I'm an example of the effectiveness of these\nMethods and everything that are offered to the coast family or things that I wrote tested myself I Would never ask somebody to do something that I hadn't experimented with myself\nOr you could tell you love doing what you're doing\nI really do I really do I mean you know ... it's a dream come true and the most literal sense you know Fifteen Years ago this is exactly what I pictured myself doing and exactly what I wanted to do be patient sometimes things happen quickly but sometimes the gestation period has

power behind writing down a goal women going for it\nYou know it's interesting when we write down a goal in really demand that we pull something out of us that's authentic and that's kind of the magic key to all of this material I Would say that\nAbsolute passionate intensity is the one the hidden key behind every health health program with it something will work without it nothing happens now one of my contention is that we really need to have one absolutely definite chief aim in life and that could be something that we very often resist\nWriting things down can help us with that because if you write down what you really care about over a course of days are over the course of weeks you'll see that it will all tend\nIn one direction and my challenge to the listener\nIs whether you can come up with one overarching goal that facilitates all of the smaller ones what would that be if you can come up with one chief aim you have arrived at mental focus and mental focus is the open sesame so to speak to everything that we've been talking about\n[noise] interesting work Mitch Horwitz with us and Mitch did you get some professional help when you put this together or did you do this all on your a\nToll on my own you know this is really my tribute to the thought of my own heroes and the mental hearing tradition or things that they've thought about things that I have experimented with ideas that I came up with myself\nA you know I view the miracle club is something that we all belong to all of us who are stripers all of us who are experimenter as we are all automatically in the miracle club and my idea was just to create something around which we could all gather and experiment with our mind\nWhat would you say would be a great miracles story that you've heard about\nA great miracles through that I've heard about what the financial miracle I had a friend in New England who was recovering\nFrom a very serious disease and he was facing financial disaster he had only one hundred and two dollars left\nTo his name and he was on the brink of losing his health insurance one night I challenged people like challenged people to make a marathon reading a book George that I Know you love very deeply the magic of believe\nYeah and love though yeah and my friend rather than reading the book decided to get hold of an audio version of it that I happened to narrate\nHe listened to it over and over and over for about five days on the fifth day he got a call from an old boss who said to him you know you left behind a four O. one K. account here have you checked that account and my friend said on that you know you can carry thought it was a few dollars and cents\nIs old boss had to have you looked at it there's over fifty thousand dollars\nIn the ...\nYeah I can only tell you that that's what happened and to my friend I truly felt like America\nThat is a miracle it really is yeah it's exactly what the experience and it was quite recent that when you least expect it you know yes\nYes that's why I tell people you know again George it can sound sort of Hackney to say never give up at these things do happen when you least expect it you can always give it another twenty four hours you have no idea what twists and turns life is going to take and as much as life visits catastrophe on it and it does\nIt also visit extraordinary absurdly good news on us

cold the orbital reflect or get a little ... it's a small shoe box sized satellite which will then unfurl itself in space looking like about maybe the size of a length of to school buses\nAnd there'll be maybe as like a big long reflective sword in the sky will be visible in the night sky for weeks but here's the interesting thing about this George which actually created by an artist named ... of the Nevada museum of art so now we're going to be saying art in space and not only of course in the future when\nWe see individuals like artist pig in that first manned trip around the moon which really sucks but George you got to see as many people that amazing launch a vet SpaceX rocket itself\nOh it was great it was gorgeous\nThe unfortunate thing I missed it but here's the scoop that we've been talking about here folks get set for the next of many launches but one that's coming to my mind George is a falcon nine bought five rocket that will be launching approximately this is what they say at least eight sometimes can change on Halloween anything October the thirty first\nThey're eight pm Pacific daylight time and of course people along the California coast you know exactly where to go because there's many of these public viewing areas\nBut maybe this one will not be a spectacular because you need that near sunset launch\nBut George going back quickly to Florida we find that people are asking what are we going to have the next big Falcon Heavy launch now on the schedule it shows November the thirtieth it's seven PM but that would be great\nBut many space scientists are saying realistically will have to push this back to march twenty Nineteen\nAnd finally in the lives guy don't forget folks the moon coming to first quarter above the sixteenth you'll get to see that
