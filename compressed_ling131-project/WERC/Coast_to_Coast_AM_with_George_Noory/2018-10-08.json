said I have this new piece of technology I'm going to take it to a certain place I don't think I said where of course that plays turned out to be here is if the one in\nLas Vegas outside of Las Vegas Nevada\nAnd um I I I sort of gave everybody a heads up and then when I found something that surprised me um it went viral I mean I I made international news with this discovery it was a Newsweek inside edition and the ABC NBC CBS Fox News\nMedia in Russia China basically I discovered some type of a space time anomaly between Las Vegas in area fifty one at this nondescript site on the side of the road out in the desert\nAnd it turns out that that is one of the most extreme UFO hot spots in the state were incredible footage has been shot of UFOs we're close encounters have occurred\nI'm much stronger but at the same time you're defending perhaps all earthlings from some kind of outside potential for invasion\nAnd I think that even if you are listening to this show tonight and you believe that there are aliens or ... or however you want to describe them\nThat are coming here and you think they must be good because if they weren't good they would have destroyed is already\nIf you're in charge of the military if your job is to be suspicious if your job is to protect the people of your country then why would you take a chance and say okay well maybe these\nBeings are benevolent but still ... why don't we do with ever we can to have whatever we can muster together in place just in case you don't you need to send ourselves because they have a change of heart or they've been deceiving them to\nBe safe than sorry ride [noise]\nWhy sure you know and and we it might be Utah file I mean you would think that it would be that if the if there are being out there that are coming here that are are so advanced that they um they they ... you know would otherwise destroy is\nAh if you know if if that was their plan but you know here's this is getting dark this is this is very dark but I honestly this is a logical point of view or what if George\n... if they were going to come back here [noise] these beings that ancient alien a theorists talk about talk about this kind of thing many times on the History Channel\nUm if they they come back and they want to and slave us again\nBecause a lot of people believe especially if you look at like Zacharias ... work and all that that they came here and modified our our genetics in our DNA to enslave us and treat us as minors for gold or whatever\nIf their goal is to come back here and in slave us it might be a better fate for us to commit global suicide\nIn other words and again I told you this was going to be dark\nWhat if a lot of these governments I actually have some kind of plan in place where they say rather than have these beings come back\nAnd put you know colors on us and and work us like animals we hit these buttons and we just annihilate ourselves spooky but what if that's the case\nSo do stay button basically [noise]\nAnd and that the idea is that we're not necessarily as concerned about each other as we are about the force from outside and you're going back to Ronald Reagan\nI'm I'm sure you recall that kind of eerie comment that he made a one of his speeches I Believe it might have been before the un you know if what if there was an alien threat [laughter]\nYou know what did he really mean by that you know he was he was just being facetious to try to talk to people about banning together or does he really knew something at the time [noise]\nBut when you look back at all of these people who have made deathbed confessions who are related to Roswell and um you know the whole suspicion that surrounds researchers to this day who goes snooping a little too much and digging a little too deep [noise] I\nMean there is something to this idea that we may be up against potentially a some visitors here if you want to call them visitors they call them are just as easily invaders but there may be some some ah beings\nThat we have got to do our best to defend against\nAnd they're using space time manipulating technology in order to completely um\nOutmaneuvered anything that we can\nAnd so once we see it possible examples like I'm perhaps presenting that maybe now we humans are experimenting with some stuff [noise] sadly enough weaponry which also may have a space time manipulating effect\nUh this could be a particularly worrisome for those beings if they say okay we made a little trade off we gave them if you little nuggets of wisdom but boy the the the earthlings are run with it and so we need to put them back in their place\nJosh tell us about your event coming up in October this month\nYeah fake it which this Saturday it's October to Thirteen this is going

you again I'm going to give you a little Halloween trivia year Halloween is an annual holiday ... celebrated each year on October thirty first it originated\nWith the ancient Celtic festival of Saddam Hussein when people would light bonfires and work costumes to ward off ghosts and the evening before was known as all Hallows eve and then later Halloween there's an interesting Josh [noise]\n[noise] yeah it absolutely is I mean that it goes back thousands of years\nAnd um I I think Fallon was the original pronunciation and they would talk about this being a period of time with them or if\nThey were you know reaping the reward the harvest but preparing for the call the month of winter and so they believe that as the world was sort of transitioning\nInto the cold dead time that there was a period where the the bill was so thin in fact Europeans often talk about what they call in places the boundary with soaked in between where we are and where the spirits are that we can encounter each other\nFor at least one or two nights and ... and interact with each other and the good part was well some of your loved ones might come through but then there were also all of these creepy evil beings to come through and so you'd you'd wear a mask\nSo do you blend in with the evil ones and they'd be like oh you're one of us you know and and they they wouldn't harm you but from a more um I I think updated point of view George this also happens to be the time of year when a here in our part of the world the earth is shifting away from the sun\nAnd so uh that means not only does it get colder and darker as we tilt into that mysterious back a black void of space\nBut furthermore uh we are not being as\nA strongly bombarded\nBy the the radiation coming from the sun and therefore subtle things that might otherwise have been sort of drowned out in the noise of the sons radiation could pop a little more so for example let's say a I shine a\nFlashlight at towards you outside on a bright sunny day while you're not going to notice that as much as you would if I did it on a dark night right and so what happens in general in there but it's still there\nIt's still there but it's just not as prominent and noticeable so this is\nThe time of year when we shift away from the sun and a lot of these subtle energies electromagnetic electro static and otherwise that are associated with these spirits another paranormal entities are suddenly more distinctive\nAnd a play more of a significant role in in our awareness and of course we're we're also in Hampton this because\nWe're we're paying more attention and we're looking out for it more\nLet's take some calls here with Josh as we continue chatting I Want to ask you about Robert ... to ... in a moment let's go to Charles first time caller in Asheville North Carolina hey Charles\nGo ahead [noise] you're with us [noise] no\nHe's not let's get John and Virginia Beach Virginia try John go ahead [noise]\nAt your age ... or I won't tell you the story that happened to me like in the nineties\nNow I I never believed in ... spirits UFOs eighties and things of that ... however that Nineteen leaders middle nineties I had an uncle that had passed away and they were having a little show there's plenty of their church\nAnd I was in that close to him but I just said you know any way I ah I went I was late getting as so I had to sit in the black church was packed and the service is going on and all of a sudden I\nFelt some somebody standing behind me behind one of the person with a check and I looked up and it was my uncle had\nJust passed away and and he\nTold me he said John that your car\nAnd I wish I was shocked I didn't know what to do and then again you said John don't value car when I was so scared I had to get out of there so I got up late and what he was gone\nBut still I was you know I knew something and so I got her at home with a friend of mine and the next morning\nI call my cousin which was the son and it has to wait and asking the TV and then when you're not collectively and I'd get him back home he shouldn't matter though so he and his belt and got my car and totally changed for them that\nAnyway he got in my car when they pull that that ... ...\nIt was hit by a truck and they they weren't killed but they were extremely you know you could I mean they had ... votes in mind that too\nBut I never told anybody there is a and I was a lot to say anything about it with a dead till two of my close friends and um\nI don't let it and not with that I Wish it would have the I\nGuess you know up until now I hadn't told\nMe in the in the morning was just not to be in that car as opposed to you driving the\nCar you know well I didn't want to do that and he told me down and\nWhat you did you carry on to them no no no that was the idea\nThat they would be ... in my car but they were ... they weren't killed but that was a she only time I ever had to think like I say ... you get all the same thing as for because I have seen\nWhy does spirits come across like that in warn you\nYeah well you know John ... thank you for that that's a great call and it I Believe represents one of the most interesting aspects of the spiritual realm [noise]\nYou know scientists who are the smartest folks who among us right now who were you know the astrophysicist a cosmologist a quantum physicist they're telling us\nThat we have the mathematical models we have the experimental data to prove that all time is happening at once at least on this particular time line that the past the president and the future are all happening at once the problem is that we humans are\nSpirits in the material world it's like the song by the police\nAnd so when you are spirit trapped here in this material body you're only able to process what's happening on the timeline little by little a\nMinute by minute hour by hour a day by day week by week and\nSo on but\nOnce you are no longer in this body it seems like you're able to have an awareness of\nThings that extend far beyond what we physical or physically incarnate as humans call the presidents and so it would make perfect sense that if you have a loved one\nEspecially one who has recently passed into the spiritual realm that person may be astounded by the fact that he or she\nCan now see the future to a degree that you cannot or it might almost be like comparing the perspective of an app to the ...\nTo the perspective of an eagle ah they're both physical beings but they just have a different point of view and and when the eagles way up high he can see the storms that are coming that the aunt can't see but\nThe aunt is more sensitive to what's happening on on a lower level\nSo anyway all that said your relatives or friends or loved ones who passed over\nMy definitely be able to see beyond the scope of the temporary situation and see somewhat into the future and that would certainly be great motivation for them to come and give you a warning and in this a case drawn and it seems like that's the most likely thing that happened to you\nAny updates with Robert de haunted dull Josh [noise]\nYou know Robert at this point live like a king and and and this is very funny because you still ... ... yeah yeah I mean I I haven't seen him in a while now but\nRobert I think really became famous or some would say infamous as Robert\nBecause that a lot of people were sort of a chiding him and uh I don't want to use the word abusing him but basically there they were taking him out and cathartic Lee releasing their pent up frustrations\nOn him and ... it was when the shock wave of curses and bad luck started hitting all those people that suddenly word began to spread like okay this dog here and you know he\nWas fighting back\nYeah and it's because of that that um he I Believe now is so famous because the word has now spread for so long that if you go to see how you have to be respectful people now take it seriously

core I perfectly\nAnd he's looking at me and I start mop and they continue mop like okay this kind of eerie any pushing pretty hard and so I was wondering it seems like since I've been working there for about a month like you think it's maybe around\nOctober is that we're in the spirit to really show theirselves and he wasn't supposed to be there was he I I don't\nThink so I talked to see in a in a couple of the nurses and they told me\nThat they everyone who goes in there by their cell or maybe two or three people they feel like someone watching them and I was just wondering might huh Josh or what do you guys think 'cause like it seems to me is October 'cause it's not a full moon because it's full moon I can tell you what it gets really crazy around the hospital for whatever reason\nHuh do you know a little boy died there\nYou know I asked them and they sent from what we understand no owned died there but they said we don't know a full history\nHe tossed where do you think Josh\nWe'll call thank you for that call and yes I think that this time of year has more prominent paranormal activity for at least three reasons\nReason number one goes back to when I was saying earlier in the show about the earth tilting away from the sun and subtle energy fields being magnified or at least being more perceptive ... so that's that's number one number two is that\nHere again in our part of the world in the northern hemisphere\nMost places have a colder\nDrier environment and I know that's certainly the case in Utah\nSo that means there is a larger buildup of electro static charges so when you lay down at night and you pull your sheets up you might see those little blue sparks flying around similar to when you're drag your socks on the carpet and touched the door knob\nAnd there is a definite relationship between enhanced electro static charge and the ability for paranormal phenomenon to materialize and interact\nOr in my laboratory over the years I've been able to reproduce many of the things\nThat people talk about when they encounter the paranormal using electrodes data charges such as creating Loomis life forms making objects move without any visible source or creating the sensation of a cold spot or a cold wind where they call an eye on when\nI'm making your hair stand on end these are all things that you can do artificially with electro steady charge and yet\nWhen you go to these places where people are often experiencing extreme paranormal phenomena you find that there are these very strong electro static anomalies in the area so there's some connection there\nRegarding how that the non physical realm of the spiritual might be able to temporarily interact with the physical realm\nAnd it reminds me of how something like a magnet has this invisible field around that that creates a physical effect but then the third and final point of course is that\nThis time of year we're talking about it more I mean you go to the store you see all of these things that reminds you of the paranormal spooky the afterlife\nYou see it all on TV you see the movies coming out and so you combine those three things together and certainly it means that again at least here in the United states\nThis is the time of year when we have the highest likelihood of experiencing something ghostly spooky ... or at very least metaphysical\nJosh don't you get energized during this time of the year for some reason [noise]\n[noise] well I Do and I think you know part of that goes back to the fact that you know I was born this month and so you know that's always been a time a celebration my mom and dad have always been fantastic people who've always been a really cool arranging nice things for me and growing up in western North Carolina\nUh especially in Asheville when when the leaves are splashed with color and everybody is becoming very festive\nUm it's a great reflection of that original celebrate tore mood\nFrom the old world in fact so many people of Scots Irish descent came into the mountains of western North Carolina because they found them familiar that ah [noise]\nI every single genealogist I've ever talked to says there are more people of for example Scottish\nSo in North Carolina then there are in Scotland\nAnd we remember the first and English Settlement within North Carolina on the coast at a place called Roanoke one [noise] and so we now know that it was one of the history of the greatest mystery of the last caller\nAnd so I was in the area that I'm an enormous amount of influence\nFrom the early you know Scots Irish originated these ideas about celebrating style and um Halloween and so that combined with my birthday makes me very excited about shirt contributed to the fact ah I Love this time

stories all about the supernatural he was with us a couple of months ago with Richard talking about some haunted rock and roll that was a classic mad welcome back to the program\nThank you very much thanks for having me on\nVery background hot as a journalist get involved in the unusual in the paranormal\nWell the simple answer was I was born that\nWay on Halloween or yeah yeah oh happy birthday coming up\nYeah thank you very much so that really kind of started my interest in it I don't ever remember a time where I wasn't interested in ghost stories horror movies and the like so I just learned uh I I never really wrote about it until I started to work as a reporter\nAnd uh every Halloween I Would try to write a a a feature story on Halloween feature story and so I started to write a story about um local ghosts legends around the area where I was born\nAnd ah the reaction to that story was so overwhelming that I thought well there's really something here and so since then I've I've combined my interest in history and folklore and go stories and just kind of combined them altogether\nDid your birthday cut into Halloween or did Halloween cut into your birthday when you're you\nKnow it it sort of a made my birthday exponential I refer to it as the season of Matt now\n[laughter] I Love it is kicking off the year I Love this quarter October November December it's it is the best absolutely ... and how did you get your interest in World War two\nWell after I wrote you know I wrote three books about a music in the supernatural and at a certain point I wanted to uh find another project to place with my publisher and initially I thought I I I'm you know to be completely transparent I consider myself more of a civil war geek\nUm but I started to look around at writing a civil war book but what I found is that there's just so many so much good stuff out there already\nAre and that people have compiled a numerous books so I didn't think I could really add anything to that area of ah of ghost stories in the supernatural\nSo I just started I turn towards a World War two uh and started to research whether there were any good stories and\nAnd sure enough there were there were plenty of good stories that I could compile in a way that I I like to do it I like to do I like to ... stories with\nYou know tales of secret in cities and and forty entails so a haunted World War two ah it turned into beaches to really a deep area for me to explore and that's that's kind of what I like to do\nAny harm to the world war two were these ghost stories and events from World war one that overlapped in World War two or with these things happening during the second war\nSo most of the stories that I I compile our stories from World war two not between the wars and and they ... they can\nCan you to occur believe it or not\nWhat creates the difference between these kinds of stories I Would call the military haunting as opposed to a regular guy\nThat that's a that's a great question because um [noise] you know [noise]\nMost of the stories that I wrote about before a university ... stories haunted rock and roll go stories of country music there is there sort of a light hearted aspect of the stories compared to what I found myself into when I started to research the world war two go slower\nUm and I think when you're dealing with war and warriors and victims of of atrocities and\nWorld War two probably set a new standard and violence and atrocities so there is a deep seriousness about the material and I really want to honor the sacrifices especially from the soldiers and sailors Marines\nUh you know when you're dealing with this these acts of Vail valor on on Normandy and\nYou know uh all of those stories you want to make sure that your your ah honoring a what they they brought or the other thing that I found a little different when I started to research hunted World War two was that um\n[noise] you know you want to make sure that you get the history right I'm history serves as a backdrop for a lot of these stories and I think goes stories are are one way that people help preserve the past but\nSometimes they're not perfect in history so what I found myself doing is a lot of times is is uh finding these ghost stories and then trying to confirm to make sure that history was correct\nA you know I've been I've never looked for whether a a ... or was available to German troops in ... during the Normandy invasion but you know I found myself looking looking at those types of details so I think those are two reasons why\nThe these stories are a lot different from the stories that I worked on before\nWhat isn't Matthew above the battlefield that seems to enhance the stories in and they could be anywhere they could be I had um a friend who just went a little big corn oh we're accustomed to less than was\nAnd you know he's convinced that's haunted to Gettysburg Reno was wanted right I'm sure there are other battlefield that are but what is it about war\nThat creates these hunting is it because sadly enough these Soldiers Die so suddenly\nAnd they just still hang around what what's going on there\nYeah there there are a lot of theories about why battlefield seemed to attract these ... more so than than other places um [noise] in their ... essentially is two camps on this so you have on one hand you have the paranormal theorists\nAnd they said that this in in one case a they say that this violence and trauma of war\nAh causes these um [noise] ... almost in the event almost in beds itself in time and space it gets repeated over and over so that kind of explains what they would consider residual ...\nNow on the other hand there there are some of the arrests that also say that you know the shock of war happens so quick that maybe people have a hard time transitioning maybe their spirits have a hard time transitioning from one plant to the next that's\nThat's the other theory now there's a whole skeptical side of this too and what the skeptics would suggest is that because these areas are profoundly moving emotionally when you talk about the sacrifice when you talk about\nThe death and the tragedy that it raises your consciousness that maybe you mistake normal uh activity normal phenomena for paranormal phenomena so those seem to be the main theories behind why these battlefields are so ...\nIs there a specific battlefield that you would say is the most haunting ...\n[noise] I think the consensus wise I Would say a Normandy is extremely haunted um there's just doesn't stories\nAre especially and it might be because there are a lot of tourists are that are visiting that area and so a lot of this tourist there documenting what happens but the bunkers the fortifications are seem to be haunted one of the stories that I found a particularly interesting was that a\nA father and daughter visited the battlefield\nAnd that's part of France for people who don't know where it is\nRight yeah Normandy, France uh and uh the the father and the daughter visited the Normandy beaches and we're exploring some of the fortifications and went into a bunker and when\nThe daughter and and father said that when they came out of the bunkers they they didn't really talk too much about it but then later\nThe daughter said that when she was in there she solve these figures are these people actually in the bunker somewhere laying down somewhere looking out the window and then she started to describe their uniforms and the father who was a World War two buff\nUh immediately ... uh recognize these uniforms is German uniforms\nAnd later he decided he wouldn't press the issue on a writer right away but then later he talks to her and he brought out a book of weaponry and and uniforms in and asked her to look through it and identify what she saw\nAnd he claims that she had no access to any World War two history books she truck he tried to keep that\nAway from her because she was so young but then she began to describe the guns that were there the uniforms that were there and they all matched or what\nCould have been in that bunker at that time so you do have stories like that from a pretty credible sources that they've had these experiences in Normandy and that certainly wasn't the only one that happened in those bunkers\nThe other place that uh I talked to a German goes tonner and his name's Tom ... and he told me that uh he investigated the art dance battlefield which is in in Germany or near Germany a and a site of the battle of the bulge [laughter]\nHigh were Dan and Trina as the

I didn't want to leave our our sailors\nOut no nine years maybe for me so let's not leave aside well\nYeah I'm I'm going to make sure I have those in there so\nThe interesting thing about uh after World War two if you had these battleships\nYou had ... ah aircraft carriers and they were engaged in so many activities so much a honor that uh the sailor served in that it was a shame to just got old them or to reduce them to scrap but luckily for us a lot of\nPeople got into preserving those um\nShips those aircraft carriers and his battleships as living museums and they brought him back to different ports and and also when they brought him back to these ports they brought a lot of a ghost stories with them and and some of the ones that I collected the USS Yorktown which is now in Charleston Harbor\nUm there's a lot of activity or a witness their shadow figure is probably one of the ones they call them shadow ed and Ed's stands for enemy designated which was a World War two term for when you come in contact with the enemy\nOr there's some pretty dramatic stories of ghost hunters chasing the shadow creature around the the carrier USS Hornet I think is probably one of the most documented a ship base a haunted sites\nUh there there is a story about a man dressed in white naval uniform who are wanders around the deck some of the battle ships the USS North Carolina I worked with a uh a few a paranormal investigator from Port city paranormal\nAnd they basically told me they they have a career documenting the ... on their\nUh and of course we mentioned USS Arizona all of those uh and there there are a lot more I was finding them even as a I was starting to publish this book so yeah there are a lot of World War two ships are haunted and I'm just glad that they preserved them and have him back here ghosts and all\nJust an amazing series of events that have been happening that seemed to all of a similarity in that has to do with tragedy ... for some reason tragedy makes these ghosts or whatever we want to call them hang around don't you think\nYeah I mean absolutely that seems to be the one common element\nOf uh you know I'll say not just the ghosts of World War two but when you talk about haunted rock and roll which I investigated and even some of the ghost stories of of country these tragedies just seemed to linger it's like either the spirit doesn't want to let go uh somehow this is a\nA interaction between consciousness of reality or maybe that were just so primed um to to ... when we hear these tragedies to maybe hope that that uh the spirits go on or the spirits linger there's probably a lot of different reasons for that those are just some of the ones that I've come across\nOur special guest of course is Matthew Swain we're going to take calls next hour with him stories and questions of course and uh let's get into when we come back also after the break Matthew a little bit of your haunted rock and roll stories those are those are fantastic too\nI Love them that's one of my favorites\nAnd they just keep coming more and more and more they just never stopped like you know people like Michael Jackson who passed on now when prince and folks like that have they come back you up to ... as a ghost\n... well there are definitely go stories about Michael Jackson uh there were a few\nA video anomalies\nWhen a when I Believe his brother and believe it might have been germane was being interviewed people said they so Michael Jackson walk up behind him there are stories from a neighbor's of a former ... home owned by Michael Jackson who claimed to hear music coming out of it at odd times\nWhen there shouldn't be anybody at home so that definitely a\nMichael Jackson coasts have been seen there are starting right now a lot more good stories about prince who just died I think back in two thousand sixteen I'm\nHis Paisley Park has his recording studio several of the workers there claimed to hear people shuffling\nAround they hear voices fans have also blogged about how they believe like they've had an encounter with it goes to\nPrint out they seem to be everywhere will come back we'll talk more

Matthew I'm it off Hitler as sick as he was was also interested in the cold did you come across anything that the dealt with that\nYou know I did and I came away with a a little bit of a different perspective about Hitler in the cold ah you know initially I thought that Hitler was a a cult practitioner throughout his life\nBut what I found through my research and this is pretty controversial and I'm sure they're all people have\nHave different ideas and I'd be glad to entertain those thoughts too\nBut it sounds like Hitler's early a philosophy was influenced by a cult groups like the whole society in the real society very prevalent in a pre World War two Germany in that area\nBut what I think happened was that Hitler was of all things are not in a coal theorists but more of an incredible sociopathic nurse assistant I don't think he could think\nThat there was any type of power a worthy of him I think he thought he was the ultimate power and that the state was the ultimate power\nAnd so what you see you later is that a Hitler begins to purge a lot of it is a cult groups he starts to go after fortune tellers and astrologers so I came away with a little bit of a different opinion\nOn the cold in in Nazi Germany\nUh likewise I was sort of fascinated that\nThe cult played a much bigger role in my opinion a among uh [noise]\nThe side of the allied side so there were ... the wiccan in England who uh try to get together to uh spiritually or go after the Nazi regime or they held um meetings and the ... got together\nWith the express purpose of trying to\nTo stop 'em Germany from invading England and likewise uh and I really picked us up from a frequent guest on coast to coast Mitch or with\nYes ah the allied a new thought ... a movement those a lot of the practitioners for that group were very involved and to try and use spiritual techniques a cult techniques\nTo stop Hitler from uh from succeeding\nSo those were a different ways that ah you know when I tried to write a book I'm I'm really I Know a lot of people write books because they know a lot I like to learn a lot so I go into a some of these stories with really preconceived notions\nAnd then as I delve into it I find twists and turns that that I tried to bring out uh in in the book\nNow in your stories on haunted rock and roll told me the theme about those\n[noise] well the theme about haunted rock and roll is that I'm really when I started writing hot rock and roll and again another I listen to our Gary Patterson on your show many times uh\nAnd uh you know I started to investigate and what I thought initially was that rock and roll had this special cult power and maybe people that were into the Cold War attracted to it\nBut after writing of the country book and then revisiting rock and roll for more on a rock and roll what a ... a came away with is the thought that\nMusic is really just to consciousness raising toll ah it's used in just about every religious service are out there it's also a key part of a lot of\nUm historical movements like the civil rights movement there's something special about music that I Believe raises the consciousness of both the the listener and and the musician\nThat I think makes either people more open to things like the supernatural the cult or maybe a you know actually can kind of promote these these types of powers in these types of of of visions so that's really the theme that kind of runs through all of those book in my opinion\nWell that's pretty dramatic stuff and like we were talking earlier the current rock stars that have faded a haven't shown up yet but they will I think eventually don't you\n... yeah I sometimes this is a matter of what I find is that it's a matter of\nThese stories and these tales of the supernatural usually start out fanned fan musician to musician a person that witnesses it\nTalks to another friend and then for me it usually bubbles up on line and blog posts and then uh newspapers will investigate I'll look into it goes counters will be attracted to the site so it takes a while I'm I'm Still waiting for some good ghost stories about David Bowie for example\nJames Dean of course died young in a car accident and was in his car chopped up into little pieces and they sold the parts and apparently they were haunted [noise]\n[noise] yeah that's a the name of his car yeah he um he

confusing out the big flu virus now is called age three and two and the ... it's the big hitter especially on the the elderly but George\nThe numbers fly all over the place so the CDC is scaring us
