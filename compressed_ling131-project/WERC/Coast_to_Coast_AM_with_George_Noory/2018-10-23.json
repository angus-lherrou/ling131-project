Braun and some of those incredible mine's\nWell they had some pretty good wants to uh they had coral live a who was a great rocket engineer\nSo as Germans technology that help the Soviets to write\nWell they they captured some of the two so but\nUh as did we but I I got to tell you well I mean no I mean there's no question that von Braun and his team were top notch and and we actually got the real rocket engineers Soviets captured a lot of the two rockets\nBut they they mostly caught the second tier kind of people we we got\nWe got the ... of the crop as they say\nYeah we did um but um you know by the sixties we had developed our own rocket engineers although the German team continued to play a role through about the early seventies um I met a few of them\nWas amazing to see people who are born in the eighties for example Robert or even the nineties never had a chance to experience what a lot of us went through a lot of people who are listening to the program right now during those critical time periods I mean the moon\nAnd dean Sputnik all that stuff was just so historical ah we really lived and we have lived through some incredible time several we [noise] [noise]\nYes but I'd I'd like to see America once again to become a country whose Creigh Deeds are to be found in newspapers and not in museums just a you know and so you know like the Apollo Thirteen movie or just now the moody last man for not last man first fan\nFirst myth while there may be the last ... no one\nHere well I think it's pretty good movie by the way I just saw um\nWhat'd you think about the lack of the American flag being in that movie\nWell no they do show the American flag on more on the moon they just don't show them planting it\nOh okay okay\nThat this movie some people found it a bit slow because there was a lot in there about you know Neil Armstrong relationship with his kids and his wife and so forth but I thought it was pretty strong especially you know the scenes with the exit teen and the Gemini and Gina flight\nAnd uh the actual moon landing itself I thought were absolutely riveting and they really gave you a sense of of the risks that were taken the courage that was needed\nAnd just the and the spectacular nature of of this thing and this this this and the daring of America at that time\nAnd um but anyway I mean that's that's that's who we are that's who we have to be we can't be these people who you know\nSay well we don't know how to go to the moon I'm you know I mean that'd be like them in the sixties saying we don't know how to fly airplanes so\nGo to David the Salem mass said David go ahead sir\nI didn't ask you both and thanks for taking my call George sure thing um okay so um it's interesting to me how what you what you're talking about a few minutes ago was really played into my question we you know we've talked about you know how life could be sustained and things on Mars and already my life but do we have any plans are there any theories on\nAustin which can lead in an atmosphere where stimulating a life's just learning environment um drilling holes that were trapped gas is eating the the atmosphere with everything we have or is there any serious her\nPlans for that well\nWe discuss that earlier in the show but yes terra forming Mars the idea would be if you warm the planet with greenhouse gases she could form a lot of the costs a lot of atmosphere to help us out of ...\nI've got a book called the case for Mars which um you can get on Amazon and it talks about how we can send people to Mars how we can settle Mars and how we can terra forming Mars that transform it in the way that you are a suggesting\nBecause marshals wants to warm and wet planet which means by the way it had a thick atmosphere and um it could be made so again\nAnd you believe we must go to Mars don't you [noise]\n[noise] well I\nMust I I I Believe we should uh I Believe that it's going to be much better future if we do I believe that if we do we don't just get another planet we proved to ourselves that we don't need to be fighting over this one because there's an infinite number of world out there for us if we work together [noise]\nGood point Arnie in Roseville, California go ahead Arnie\n... yeah Hi I'm ... and I just have a question on your thought it'd be leaning towards privatization\nBut are you waiting or privatization on the colonization of the ... of the Mars or the planet I mean are you looking at just allowed to be a free for all whoever land grabs whatever they can uh are you are you with the government should be more involved in\nThe dating how a possession of real poverty as it was would be nice if we ever got a point where travel was easy\nAll right go ahead and rubber minute left so\nOkay well I'd like to see a lot of new governments on Mars I'd like to see people go to Mars and set up city states on Mars with lots of different forms of corporate and so we could see which kind of government works the best because that's how we make progress\nOn earth you know America was a noble experiment we proved the value of democracy and human rights and\nPeople all over the world came here because this was better and other countries around the world eventually copied us because it was better\nWell if if it if you have people go to Mars and they're not forced to be under the U.S government or the Russian government or the Chinese government that they formed their own governments\nThey'll go there with their own ideas of how government should be in some will be good idea to some of the bad ideas and the ones with bad ideas that are not workable those counties will fail but the ones with good ideas immigrants will walk there those places will grow and they'll become an example to the rest of

[noise]\nWelcome back to coast to coast George story with you and our guest Brandon to Marcello with us branded as a political therapist author perished psychologist residing in the north eastern section of Ohio\nHe has a graduate degree in political constantly from the University of Toledo psychological research methods from the University of Edinburgh in Scotland is research at the University of other than birds centered on yeah maps environmental sensitivity in ghostly encounters\nBrandon has been fascinated by the paranormal for years and here he is with his work called the dos studies Brandon I'm looking forward to this welcome to the show\nIt's great to George I'm excited to\nGot shot at a clinical therapist get involved in those studies\n[laughter] um well actually I was interested in a ghosts in Paris psychology before I was actually a clinical therapist yeah so it it actually I actually got a day job and then I studied the parents psychology and goes part of thing\nWell that's something then you went to the University of Toledo which is not too far from my hometown of Detroit\nOh okay yeah yeah I've spent a lot of time at the casino in Detroit but we won't get into that [laughter] how'd you do not very well\nThat's good well let's see they didn't have casinos there when I left I left in Seventy eight when was it was just a booming city but what we do have is the Detroit Lions and that's the great thing there [noise]\nYeah yeah good good teams up their sports wise\nShe'll tell us a little bit about your work and then we're going to die just social studies for what he was an overview of what you do [noise]\n[noise] well um you know I uh I have a degree\nIn Paris psychology or when I was at the University of Edinburgh I studied uh I'm basically it the environmental sensitivity and ghostly encounters um and then when I got back here to the states I got back into the clinical part of things\nAnd then that's what kind of got me going in and I'm interested in in writing a book and that's when I came out with a ghost studies\nAnd you know I'm sure the listeners to your show no it's it's um no mystery that science is sort of dropped the ball when it comes to explaining goes land counters\nOr oftentimes mainstream macadamia will explain these things away as hallucinations interpretations are overactive imaginations which you know it's not really true in my eyes\nSo individuals who have these terrifying encounters kind of struggled to find the answers and they're kind of left with reality television shows to provide insight into these life altering experiences\nSo you know there's millions of people out there including myself who were looking for things OR Books with more than just ghost stories\nTales of locations are outdated views um and that's when I wrote the book and I just thought you know I combine real life goes the encounters with the satisfaction of some new perspective and insights in the cause of these drilling encounters\nUm it the book comes up with concise and competing theories\nWhat's great about it is it's based on data rather than faith or belief\nOr even experience and you know they're ... you know these goats I been taking our interests for millions of years and if and I think we're at the point where there is becoming new perspectives on these things and that's what the book really goes over you know there's several firsthand accounts of ghostly encounters\nUm you know I spent years just getting firsthand accounts of going to anyone he would talk to me about goes normal conventions everywhere and then I started noticing similarities and that's when I came up with some of these new theories are and that's where I came out with the book so you know I really combined a little bit of my ...\nI took elements from psychological research clinical interviews eyewitness accounts and I sort of piece them together and come up with this uh these new theories and thoughts and I also review the right the greatest or the latest research in a ghostly encounters a book\nWell then you bring a dose of real science to the picture I think that's important [noise]\n[noise] yeah yeah and I think so too I mean the great thing is is out there you just got to look a little bit harder\nUm the journal articles a pair of psychological journal articles and even some degrees you know I'm narrow psychology a physicist a physics they're starting to kind of go into that realm of consciousness and\nI'm entanglement and non locality and how electricity affects us and I'm ... and what it does outside the body so there's a lot of that research out there it's just\nYou know I think a lot of people maybe don't know how to find it or when they do find it and read a research article a kind of like oh this is boring and I don't know what's going on but\nI'm a lot of great research is out there it's just a matter of finding it\nWouldn't be concluded to brag about what the ... experience might be a real big into their imagination what do you think so\nI actually think a majority of the ghostly encounters that that are out there I Believe are there's some paranormal phenomenon happening\nI'm you know I think that when it comes to ghostly encounters it's such a complex process and there's so many variables going on um you know there's\nEnvironmental stuff there's um a internal bio electrical stuff going on um but you know for the most part these these experiences are genuine\nAnd um you know obviously there's some fraud and there's some misinterpreting stimuli or whatever but I think the majority of these experiences are actually like I said genuine experiences\nAnd what do you think causes the one of the hill\nI think there is I'm In my in my view I take them more by side based view on goes\nSo that's um inside is basically um pull up to the extra sensory perceptions those types of things\nI I really think that a lot of ... counters that happen out there um the base of it has to do with um telepathy or I'm sort of 'em\nAre coming in being real sensitive to the environment and picking up something that's in the environment and other people on my main theories in the book go over um what I call a a tele path distress signals and sort of how they play a role and goes way encounters\nA so I really think that um people's ... the ... is a real or it was a real important part of a ghostly encounter\nHow important than the person as opposed to something like this\n[noise] um I I think that it's um [noise] ... it's kind of a fifty fifty thing and I know that's kind of a weird answer to say there but uh I think there's so many people out there I\nThink there's a lot of people out there there are more prone to go slowly encounters but I also think that the event is sort of a catalyst to everything that's happening so when I say that [noise]\nYou know I I think if we look at a lot of the ghostly encounters that are out there the catalyst is usually a crisis of some kind right I'm a death\nOr life threatening events\nOr some sort of trauma or something like that is the catalyst to these ghostly encounters or so the event is an important part of it it's what happens after that event um and I think when you have the events when you have this trauma I think it it it sort of there's a lot of things that happen after that\nAnd one of those things is um\nYou know emotional distress so you have an event you have an emotional distress from a life threatening you're gonna have all these emotions that are associated with it and then that leads to sort of these by energetic shift that happen inside us I mean we're all electricity and when that happens I think that it actually triggers sort of our innate ability to\nSend a distress signal to somebody else\nAnd and the great classic example of this is like the crisis aberration All right so we probably heard of these this\nIs when I'm sitting in my room on a random Tuesday night and I look to the left and there's a an\nAberration of my aunt and she says you know um I Love you goodbye\nAnd then I get a call the next day saying you know my aunt passed away right on time that I had that and I and I and I think that that\nYou can sort of see there was a trauma life threatening event with my aunt she was dying and somehow she sent 'em a tele Patrick distress signal thing to me and I picked up on it and they showed up as an aberration of some kind\nAs you say some people do get these experiences why not [noise]\n[noise] well I think it actually comes down to something I'm pretty\nMundane [laughter] I there's a lot of research out there in something called environmental sensitivity All right and um\n[noise] what environmental sensitivity as it's not like psychics sensitivity it's not like I'm chip coffee and Sylvia brown and and those types of psychic sensitivity where your mediums and\nUm you have psychic abilities but something as simple and concrete as sort of our ability to taste touch and smell and that's where the environmental sensitivity is\nI'm so those who are environmentally sensitive are simply picking up on the environment to a higher degree than the normal population so if you think about this\nHumans man you we both experienced the world differently we're both affected by and react to the environment in different ways but the physical environment affect certain people more than others and this leads to all kinds of conditions and dysfunctions\nAnd some people perceive it as good or bad I might receive one experiencing really positive you might not the same experience be terrified way the negative and then kind of you go toward demonic\nSo I I really enjoyed not joy but I have the experience of research experience

almost like a glimpse into something else and a lot of times these are perceived as ghostly encounters\nYou ever when you're doing these studies have you ever encountered something you'd even scared to death\nI'm personally no I haven't been scared that legit I had an experience\n\nA I live in sort of the country a rural area of Ohio\nAnd I'm a one morning of me and my wife was out of town and I'm One morning I had I kept getting these overwhelming feeling like something's wrong like fear like adrenaline and I was sort of drawn to the outside uh we have a four acres and upon\nAnd I said why is that why do I feel this way and my dog was feeling the same way too normally she's pretty calm in the morning but she was like scratching they get outside so\nI'm like yeah well you know my scientific brains going just take a shower and go to work and don't worry about it and I'm like you know when I'm going to go ahead and\nI'm going to follow through with this so I opened the door the dog went outside in the back yard and she sniffing around and I'm like I still got this feeling and then I looked over\nAt the pond and I saw something like in the pond floating and I started walking and then I started running and it was a neighborhood cat had gotten into the pond and somehow um you know drowned in\nThere like you know a dove into the ... you know all that stuff [laughter] but I found myself this is it's not so much scary looking back on and it's a little scary but\nSomething drew me out there you know I I go to work every day you know it's the same thing and I never got that feeling that desire to go outside but something happened and I kept asking myself what what happened what made that day different\nAnd was there is some sort of like distress signal sense to me with the cat and distress and that kind of linked with me and the dog and then I you know so that's it's not scary in a sense but looking back on it it's kind of like this so many cool things happen there it's really an amazing experience\nHow many people are normal experiences gr Brandon because the person who\nDied comes back\nNever had someone tune as business had they had to tell somebody wanted to get something done\nI you know I don't know percentage on that um\nI Would say that you know a lot of the a lot of the cases out there\nOf ghostly encounters have to do with easing are coping with a psychological injury like the death of a father or something\nYou know I'm ... you know you're sort of struggling with the death ah there's all these emotions happening um so you know the body sort of\nDo the electricity or the emotion signify a psychological injury and that sort of sets in motion of plan to sort of ...\nPsychological wound through what other whatever means possible so maybe if you're not able to cope through normal means you might use unconventional means you know and if you have collective unconscious and there are collective consciousness exist and memories of personalities and experiences of all of our humans are sort of stored in the atmosphere\nUm you might be able to tap into this field um and and get some sort of resolution like your father showing up and saying don't be sad I'm In a better place\nYou know and and I think these things I did the research out there really says that I think it's up to eighty percent of elderly people experience these um bereavement operations associated with their debt spouse one month after their death um so that's a pretty high number eighty percent\nOf the huge no yeah yeah and and perhaps these bereavement operations er visits from the deceased shortly after death are are kind of more important to our individual psyche and perhaps ... could be sort of a way the\nProcess emotions and ensure that our cycle like psychological well being of the survivor you know a final goodbye from the deceased\nCouldn't help us move on through crisis or grief or maybe if we didn't have that when the person died it might be a good way to sort of moved towards resolution and ... and when I talk to those these people that have these encounters they often report feeling more at ease\nOr accepting of the loved ones death after these operations and I think on TV usually ghost or negative negative negative negative negative but there's a lot of positive um it can come out of a ghostly encounter you know this idea of wait a minute there is something more to life where there is\nUm something to look forward to it's just not all negative and demons and things like\nAnd what have you concluded above the people who are more receptive to these guys reparations ... what's so special about [noise]\nThat that's a great question I Wish I had a definite answer for that um I think [noise] you know something biological [noise] when they put them there there's some cats out there with people who claim to be really sensitive to electricity and things like\nI Would like human magnets or something or\nYeah yeah exactly or just kind of sometimes if you if you want to think about that thing this phenomenon exist but there's\nSome really unique experimental design um you know where they're actually doing our eyes jeeze and what they're finding their their brain actually and their bodies are reacting electricity very low level so there's some sort of [noise]\nObjective evidence that they can't take more than ... other people and the general population you know so and this is true for what we all we all experience differently [noise] right and they've shown that as well so you you know I might get\nHooked with

give investors the option don't both in their IRA now explain that force when I first heard about bitcoin treated for pennies in fact there's an incredible story about how one guy bought two pizzas with ten thousand bitcoins\nThat were worth about twenty dollars at the time but here's the shocker today those ten thousand bitcoins are worth more than sixty million dollars and what stories like that more people are interested in owning it\nWon those ... pizza [laughter] and that's where you come in\nRight bitcoin is a little tricky to buying holding an IRA so we make it easy we do all the

or visit blocked meant I R E dot com\nAnd I think that's really one of the most fascinating things that I go over in the book because a lot of people have these experiences and then people kind of go well no one died there that did that so you must be mistaken or maybe somebody was traveling through or this or that\nSo I Hope that helps them sort of get a better idea of what could be happening in that situation\nLet's go to Chris in Columbus ohio Hi Chris go ahead\nOh Georgia since you're a gift there has been a in Ohio northeastern part you know I've got to ask I Believe you during the show from near the man's school reform matory\nYeah we sure did\nAnd every time I go there and there's something it's electricity and if I could I'd like to share a love story was sure\nOkay my mother and full blooded Cherokee of call been quite a few times a following ... but anyway my father died and three months later my mom she's really depressed\nDidn't know how things were going to work out you know to to kids and just before they liked woke up my father was there you came in her bedroom sit down on the bed mumps it up you have your\n... and said honey everything's gonna be All right\nBoth beautiful and the strongest power of everything is love and it was going to share that\nWith sweet mhm\nThese sometimes these stories [noise] are just emotional as well or if they do\nYeah yeah you know I mentioned a little bit before it's these aren't negative experiences for the most part in in my in the ... and the accounts that I go over with these people that uh people I've met over the years\nYou know sixty sixty seven percent I think are more positive than they are negative and it's this idea of someone coming back saying goodbye\nSaying you know it's okay um ... you know these are positive experiences in their life changing and they reaffirm the connectedness that you had with this love one and and these are important things and like we talked about before it could heal some sort of psychological wounds and help you move through the grief process\nSo this phenomenon could be used as a coping skill and there's a lot of research out there that says that sometimes paranormal experiences arts uses coping skills um so you know I always shutter when it's always negative negative negative negative goes goes goes scary stories\nLike that in real life go to Joe in the Bronx I chose to go\nGeorge how good\nA brand and yeah I wanted to ask you a question then maybe really a story about a full up are rich and I've seen um [noise]\nYeah the um the question is do you think that there is a subliminal undo channel of communication going on between the go sleep deprivation and the recipient of the ghost experience\nUm maybe perhaps subconsciously is the supplemental um communication to weigh communication going going that precipitate the a ghostly operation appearing\nAnd I had a full upper recent experience uh after my brother passed away um I'm a singer songwriter and I was having writer's block on the song and I've really destroyed before and coast to coast um my brother comes into the room [noise]\nUm he looks the way he did when he passed away in the hospital I'm short of 'em and uh it's it's during the day or at the foot of my bed he walks by and he speaks to me and says just get it done and then disappears into the wall\nUm can you may be elaborate\nAnd what could have precipitated this does your does your brother pass away or he was he this was after he passed away how long ago that he passed away a [noise] before you maybe maybe maybe maybe uh fourteen years okay\nAll right um well into your second question and we'll get back to the first so I I think it's kind of similar to the what we talked about earlier you know with the husband and his wife and and the wife kind of said hey check behind the workbench you find the pumpkin there\nThis is an idea where you sort of gather information from the environment um possibly connecting are resonating with his consciousness and communication is it happening in other words he's saying get on with\nYour song those types of things he's giving you the motivation because that's something you need at that point it's like that guy needed to find that pumpkin you needed some motivation to resonate with the consciousness of your brother and when you resonate with something it's not just\nInformation it's visual stuff as well um and the idea you talked about before as far as I'm unconscious communication between people there's a lot of cases out there like that there was one case in my book that I go over a I'm a guy wakes up in the middle of the night\nAnd he has this feeling like a dog is in trouble and he has this visual operation of a dog in the water injured and you can't communicate with a dog but he could somehow\nFeel like the dog is trying to communicate with him and they're kind of reading each other's emotions and then he wakes up cars finds a dog that type of thing so you know why there isn't physical communication or words there's some sort of like I'm understanding or collapse you're reading a mind type thing\nWhere did we get the book to go study sprint and\nUh the study is available at Barnes and noble I said Amazon dot com if you like listening to books on radio in your car you can get it at audible as well so\nBasically anywhere you can
