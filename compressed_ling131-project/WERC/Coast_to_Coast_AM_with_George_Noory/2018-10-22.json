one series of books and a documentary film by that title\nIn fact ... was here last month to talk about the latest in that series use broaden his uh his Web is net and his focus again the popularity of those books has overshadowed his original project the one that got him on the path\nOf pursuing missing persons cases\nTen years ago next month they made his first appearance on this program with me to talk about the ... project a groundbreaking investigation into the big mystery in which Dave applied many of the techniques and strategies you learned as a police officer\nWho the sasquatch legend immersed himself in it lived among the group of people of northern California unemployed the talents of a forensic sketch artist to get accurate portrayals of what people have been seeing for very long time [noise]\nWell you may have been focusing on missing for one one the last few years but never lost interest in big foot so here he is with a new work gets an archive of big foot and wild man stories and news reports dating all the way back to the IRS sixteen eighty [noise]\nAnd well I think David is probably not likely to take a position on what the answer to the mystery might be he has pulled together a pretty amazing collection of reports from eyewitnesses newspapers journalists hunters and others who've seen these creatures up close and personal ... welcome back\n... hey George thanks again for having me\nA absolutely no good times on the show and I appreciate it [noise]\nSo returning to work on big what does this feel like you're dating your ex [noise]\n[laughter] it's a kind of odd like you said it's it's always been doing in the background and it's something that's always had my interest I think it's an elusive topic that uh there's a lot of conjecture out there but not a lot of facts [noise]\nYou'd never stopped working on it does you know what I mean your focus may have been elsewhere but it's always been sort of a you kept an eye out for articles and information [noise]\nYou know I Can't say that I've committed much energy to it\nIn the last seven eight years and focused on missing people but when you're going through the archives and you're trying to pull out articles about missing people I'm always reading about all kinds of things that I see on these first pages of news news articles and such and\nI started to come across these uh [noise] these stories about [noise] [noise]\nUm something that looked like ... when you read the articles but when you read the title like Ninety percent of the time it was a wild man and I hadn't done a lot of archived work on the topic before but [noise]\nYou know eight years of digging through these archives for missing people articles I just started to pull them and put them in a folder and over the years that got large\nAnd eventually I said you know this is pretty intriguing I I think even if you're an optimist or a pessimist on the topic it's it's convincing that something over the years has been around us and it's been documented and and it shows the historical aspect that most people don't understand [noise]\nUm ... we're going to get into the specifics articles about big foot Wildman and giants and sometimes do the same and sometimes they're different but I wanted to just for those who were not listening ten years ago when you were first year you recap the ... project how you got started on that\nWhat you learned and how it's kind of got its hooks into you know all these years later\n[noise] so I I never had a dog in the fight or I was working for a technology company I was getting ready to retire and raise a couple of kids and\nTo the guys I was working with the worst super wealthy I came to me and they sent me in this room and they tell the story that independently without knowing each other when they were kids they had a big for the encounter in the mountains to the earth\nAnd they found each other later in business and you know we're sort of set a coincidence they started talking about Bigfoot and they've found each other and and were shocked that they each had a similar encounter\nAnd they said you know if you have Twenty years or if a police officer you have years of investigating an HR ... you're the guy really to give it that independent what will finance you go about it at your own pace me you know your kids raised that help us out with this we really we really want to find out\nAnd initially said no and they kept coming back coming back and they said at your own pace you can do it\nSo I I Wonder about looking for an area that had a few things first of all I wanted Internet I needed a hotel and I knew that there was Native American history with the topic that Randy and I needed it within say six to eight hour driving location from where I Lived at the time in Los Gatos California\nAnd I coordinate down the area to ... which is about thirty miles south of bluff creek where the Paterson given one film was made sixty seven\nSo I started to do some geographical research some topic graphical some weather\nAnd I started to bring us together and then I went up there and make contact with the group of police that a police background I approached them and I said hey maybe you can break down from doors for me I'm not going to [noise] not going to stretch the truth I'm going to tell the truth and every witness to come forward they're\nGoing to have to write an affidavit to what they saw under penalty of perjury and I wanted to raise the bar on the topic a little bit so that that would be no question about what was stated because they sign it and there'd be no question about it for the story was fabricated because it was done under perjury\nThe truth the reality is when you sit with a scientist who\nReads that science find the paper they know that\nThose hundred and ten sample Phyllis tell a story to phenomenal\nWhen we come back we're going to get into that a little bit more and then jump into

I don't know anybody that's claimed to have studied them in the wild walking into the wilderness and found a spot and studied year after year\nSo they have intelligence that's quite a bit different than the average animal a quote unquote that you see in the woods\nAnd even the animals on the eighth gorilla et cetera side of the equation totally different state they act different they walk different they look different\nAnd one thing that everyone has to think about it never in North America have there been any wild ape gorilla bones found ever [noise]\nBut [noise] we have had while or giant human bones found [noise] and that's that you really make you think [noise]\nYou know some of the descriptions in the articles are are made me chuckle a little bit because the writers who have no ... but the topic of course because it's new to them they're they're explaining\nIt must have been old Fred ... who disappeared into the forest a couple of years ago and now he's grown here all over his body [noise]\nThat I [laughter] I traveled with you on those and I think people are scratching to bring in some rationality to an irrational observation\nUm and I and the parts of the country where these things are seen you know get way way below zero it snows huh how Fred that decided to leave his farm going to live and that type of environment\nAnd and grow hair all over his body like that a cynic long hair you mentioned in the in the clip that I was reading there from the late Seventeen hundreds you had a notation at the bottom\nThat said maybe this is what Daniel Boone so uh I didn't see the Daniel Boone any Daniel Boone story in here other than that reference that you made but he had an encounter is a fairly famous encounter right\nThat's correct and uh I I couldn't find an archive news article about it but I saw other secondary and third level things that were written about what Daniel called I I think it was a Yahoo [noise]\nYeah [noise] and the description was pretty close and I don't know it's it sure seemed\nPossible but again if you went into the quote unquote credible archives you really not going to find that you have to really deep and and find out what maybe some explorers wrote about that they heard in which he encountered so\nBut again in tribal Bigfoot I've written about things where and explore from the latter day church\nWas coming across country on a horse and he wrote in his explorer notes that this thing came up to him while he's on his horse and looked him I die and actually spoke to him\nLarge hairy by ... he'd never seen before that matched the description of a wild man or a big foot and it came from the archives with the latter day church latter day saint church and\nIt's in there so to say that these things happen happen ridiculous [noise]\nUh the first entry the oldest entry comes to us from Jacques valet you wrote about it and have a clip from\nSeptember Seventeen sixteen eighty it was a record it in his book wonder in the sky a large black wildlife mass landed in a field releasing a huge ear covered being that we're seeing briefly and disappeared now that's the kind of thing that will drive\nUm big foot people who think it's an ape just crazy [noise]\n[laughter] they you know I I'm not sure how many people listening actually bought a Jacques book on or\nAbout this but when I was going through it [noise] I I like to think I'm a mile wide and an inch deep I like to read about different things that could be associated with topics I'm doing research on and what I read this I'm a fellow over and said wow I don't think anybody's ever heard of this [noise]\nAnd uh his book which was a Kickstarter project like a ... which kind of did the same thing with the UFO topic that I did on this big topic it was a stunner\nI again I don't think a lot of people want to hear this [noise]\nI I uh I was part of that project and um and supported it and it's a tremendous book and people can find it anywhere they should check it out we're talking with Dave ...\nBut his latest work big foot Wildman and giants archived articles sixteen\nEighty to Nineteen twenty two great stuff packed into here we're going to take a short break and come back and sometime in the next hour all open up the phone lines you can join the conversation from big foot to little feet here taking us into the break with a song from waiting for Columbus [noise]\n... open up today don't wait register online it only takes a minute [noise]\nLike on my county board of elections website at seven seven seven fat or protecting legislation for them I guess I ...

I don't remember where it is in the in the book but\nThere was a an incident where somebody's camp fire their camp kept being messed with while they're out in the woods somewhere\nSo they they waited ... worked in the bushes to wait to see what came and did it and the as I recall the creatures that came it was one or two they were short they were like ... fibers five or six feet tall not to ten or twelve feet tall but covered with hair and they were just signed a playing with fire\n[noise] so think about [noise] uh let's say a twelve year old kid [noise]\nIt doesn't have much association with fire not grown adult comes into the fire is playing with it because they have this unique opportunity that's kinda what I was thinking as I read that article from California uh I think from the mid Eighteen hundreds\nAnd I think it was a ... that knew something was messing around but he couldn't figure it out so he waited on a ridge line they came in and he saw this\nAnd the um it's not unusual that hunters and campers and other things in the woods have seen these things do an unusual things other times or they're seeing them awake playing like kids in the water\nUm it's\nAgain the behavior that you read about reminds you sometimes have children and especially when the sizes match proportionally a smaller Bigfoot you think will must be young kid [noise]\nThe attitudes are different in different reports to a generally not hostile shy want to get away from people when they encountered what they can be pretty nasty when provoked a there's a phenomenon it's reported in several these clubs where they throw rocks big rocks that humans disorder to chase them off\nA and there's one report I think it's I I forget where it is in the book I'll have to look for a of a big boy that's supposedly killed a hunter right that was the first one you've found\nOh it was ... and you know sometimes I question the credibility of some of these articles because [noise] who saw it how did they get to those conclusions um was there any evidence left behind these older articles or sometimes tough to get to the root of where they came from or how they came to those conclusions\nAnd I don't I don't put a lot of emphasis on that but in the near term\nNever found a big foot ... nowadays that [noise] conclusively killed anybody and\nWhen I started writing the missing for one one books there's a lot of erroneous information that I have associated this topic on ... with missing for one one I never have I've never stayed at that I thought that was involved in these things\nWhy because I've never read it credible article implying that they did and\nSince the four one one books came out all of a sudden people have started saying oh yeah you know this campsite these campers were killed this was happening and I get these once a year or say\n... and every time I followed up I find that it's not a credible source it never happened yet the myth keep perpetuating on the Internet and they're not true and\nSome people believe all you know it's a cover up [noise]\nBut as someone who has spent an enormous amount of time in these rural areas with these rural sheriff's deputies ... of people do not give a damn about what the federal government thinks about their behavior and trying to convince them to keep their mouth shut never going to happen they will tell the truth\nAnd you're the feds aren't going to be able to keep 'em clamped up\nSo when you hear these stories all these campers were killed by something really mysterious if it was happening I'd hear about it from these guys and they say half the time they say it never happened it's a completely phony story so\nI get emails I I can imagine what your emails or like but I get a ... ah just because people know that we know each other or why doesn't ... go ahead and admitted big with its kidnapping people and I I went up to see this a day there are some accounts in this book these newspaper clippings where\nThere are references to these huge wild men carrying all women and children\nYou know there was never any names attached to it though [laughter] no no\nNo and that's a that's the tough part of it how can you how can you leverage it as credible if supposedly they were getting carry off who shot [noise] and why aren't the names there and if somebody's writing about it I didn't say it [noise] [noise]\nSeems to be a there are instances where ... where\nA humans who are not aggressive and don't take shots at these animals are not only did they described them as a I think it's it's gay they describe ... gay and I don't think it's in the context to gay as we used the term these days but gay humor is what they said like a friendly [noise]\nAnd the number of times I have heard a hunter say there's no way I could shoot it looked to human\nIt ... I I have never heard of a hunter say oh yeah I had to kill this thing I shot it in the head or it it looked like an animal I've not heard that and I've heard the human side of it from a fireman\nA policeman credible credible sources that continually say the same thing and it isn't just one time in history goes way back in history or so there's something to this they got got skew where they said they started looking like him are apes and animals and\nAs you know Georgia's this segment of the big foot world that wants to go out and kill one\nAnd [noise] I don't have any idea why they think they need to kill one may be some kind of over loaded on testosterone but they they should wake up to the reality they're never going to kill them it's not going to happen [noise]\nThere are some are reports of where these people claimed to have killed one or they've captured a wild man [noise] and they brought him back somewhere on the ship or they've got him in jail and they invariably he gets away or the evidence disappears however [noise]\nThey may be milking cows you know what do you think about that because you know I'm going to talk to my parents\nSo they own a huge Jerry for anyone out there and talk to them and that's all I think he's eighty years old this guy's dad and he looked at him and he said you know every once in a while my cat will come back from nowhere completely no\nHe goes I don't understand it [laughter] then the same man\nTold them he says you know every once in a while I'm On the far corner my property something tells me I don't turn around get back on the horse or get back on my TV and little league and he does\nAnd then the man said well you know every once in a while I found a bucket way out in the corner of the property or I don't know how it got there [noise]\nSo um dogs [laughter] I I think when you get the trust of some of these dairy farmers way out in the middle they are going to tell you the same thing 'cause I've heard it many times [noise] [noise]\nUm you know there are some funny stories I they're not in this book but I recall I think you and I have talked about before about big what are what they eat and they'll you know they're kind of particular this image of a big foot milking a cow a sticks in my head but I mean they've been known to eat a lot of berries and different kinds of groups\nUm [noise] do they eat meat as far as you know\nAccording to the tribal people who are seen them take deer et cetera they're an omnivore and many times when the natives\nAre in the middle of the woods hunting themselves they'll come across a deer that stuck up in a tree and like a two hundred and fifty pound deer native couldn't have done it and they don't know how it got way up in the trees and it's not a tornado or hurricane zone so how did it get their\n... big wild bend the giants as the book in a moment we'll open up the phone lines are with your calls and questions and comments white flag into the break your own coast it goes to a um [noise]\n...\nFind out more about two nights gifts to log on to ... am dot com\nNews radio nine sixty W.

I Want everyone to think about what was the percentage of people in the wilderness in Nineteen sixty seven that had the ability to take film\nOr anything while they were in the wilderness it was my new topic about today nobody has ever come close to taking video or film of a foot in the wilderness for a minute to have like they got on a PG film yet today there's\nProbably close to a hundred percent of everybody in the wilderness carrying a smartphone which has the ability to catch that so I Want everyone to understand that I Do believe the person film Israel, Why haven't we caught despite that on film\nThat quality of a location and segment like they did in sixty seven\nThere was something phenomenal about that event that caused that female big foot to stay there because every other time they immediately run they won't look at the camera like this one did they won't hang around and linger knowing that people are watching him something unusual happened\nWell again not to take everything back to skin Walker day but it the the comparison is a pretty clear is that ... there was a loose if there are cameras all over the place\nIf you uh had activity in one area and set a camera up it would move somewhere else and it it goes back to sort of the question that one of the callers asked about drones\nSay you had a drone that had heat seeking technology it attached to it um the description from the tribes that you mentioned in your books suggest this thing has camouflage abilities that it can hook itself\nThe change of shapes and it can hide\nCorrect that's again one of the reasons that makes us entirely different topic to research\nYeah I mean we see it when it wants to be seen I guess\nYeah\nTry to get one more call in Tom in Vancouver up there in big what country Hey Tom how're you doing [noise]\n\nIs Tom on the ... are lined yellow [noise]\nI think Tom has gone ah okay so we're about out of time to have a great work or the title being sixteen eighty to Nineteen twenty two does that suggest that another a book of archived articles about these sightings could come some other time\nWell not really know and and just so everyone knows that this is a book that contains the actual article these aren't rewrites the articles this is the real deal Nineteen twenty was cut off point for copyright criminals articles\nOh so by more than you could print them after them you can't because they're so protected [noise]\nUh well it's a terrific a piece of work uh I Love reading it I I Want to go back and read it again because there's so many details that escaped me as I was preparing for the program but I I said some of the writing and this is just terrific\nAnd it's always great to have you on the program and I don't know when you sleep but I Hope you're taking care of yourself\nI'm always I'm always eager to be on your show Georgia and and the response I get from being on your show is out of this world good so I appreciate the effort you put into it\nWill thanks very much I appreciate it and maybe we'll have you and get Melba catch him back on here some time to talk about that DNA stuff that'd be great\nAll right Dave ... again the big foot wild bend the giants is the new book check it out if you get a chance in a moment we shift gears to talk about the true story of the worst the disaster in us naval history\nAnd the fifty year fight to exonerate an innocent man Indianapolis coming up momentarily here I\nNever\nMissed a DJ on a show just sign up for the ... ... email newsletters will be looking for ...

I thought you know someone will tell this story before I'm old enough to do it\nAnd you fast forward graduated from college and no one told the story you know the right way so I sought out the survivors and found Paul Murphy who is the chairman of the survivors organization at the time and he invited me to a reunion\nAnd that's where I actually got to me that the men who survived Indianapolis and I mean yeah I was\nA kid who was a meeting her heroes for the first time and\nThey exceeded all expectations and they took me and kind of became like family so they have a couple of years later after I had spent time with them and visit them at their homes they asked me to be their storyteller and that kind of the cliff notes version of it [noise]\nAnd land for you how did you uh hook up with Sarah on working on this project you've done so many other books I I Would imagine that being able to write the true story and correct\nWide and greet misperceptions a and strike a blow for justice for the for some of the key characters would be an amazing draw for you\nWell it was very exciting project from either way I got involved when\nI had actually been praying I'm I pray that my work and I had them to have\nAn opportunity to work on an iconic ... story and all of a sudden in two thousand eleven additive I get this email from this young filmmaker and they're flat it well what there it didn't say about her journey with Indianapolis with that\nI'm being on the Annapolis a storyteller she wanted to render the story as a screenplay and she actually did that she wrote a and a three part series and stick to a major\nProduction company and they said hey this is the best thing we found a brother that we only the mini series on but\nSo you're getting ready for\nThe train ride or I don't know how to raise a family and friends he raced out and and they contact with me\nAnd I'm no number one that I and then maybe veterans matter that I had been paying for an opportunity to do a story that like this one um [noise] and\nMy only problem was is that all she was wanting to fight and I wanted to help her right to tell a joke is that I had to figure out how to manipulate or in a way to help her or eventually over the course of several\nMonths we finally met and then ah we agreed to work on it together and we didn't really get started in earnest and a twenty four and then when we get the project and a half\nSo Sarah where you are on a campaign to right or wrong that the story had been wrong that a lot of the the people who are key players had been treated unfairly is that how you started or you didn't know about that when you started\nI didn't you know I I knew a small part of that um that was definitely\nPart of what I wanted to tell but really I mean the major objective of it was to tell the whole story of this ship you know she'd been reduced to\nThinking story or shark story\nAnd no one knew she was this incredible ship that admiral Brent commanded you know most of the Pacific war and the campaign that have participated in from her deck or that Roosevelt took her on the first cruise\nYou know us acting president ever left the country on so it was so much more like well you know everyone's gotta know what it incredible shift is less than what she did uh\nBeing sunk [noise]\nI'll tell you you grab me ... my father was at ... he drove a landing craft from those ships took us troops on the shores so of course you know the the fact that the Indianapolis was involved in those conflicts grab my attention I'm\nHim being there and some of the scenes that you describe I'm Lynn what do we start with you describe in a sort of the ... the ... version of what the world knows about the USS Indianapolis and then we'll go to Sarah to uh give us the version that did you guys have helped uncover\nOkay that would be great um Indianapolis as Sarah mentioned ... was the fifth the Fifth Fleet flagship and I'm\nA small park that a lot of people don't know is that she was the flagship at the battle of of now or where your father drove the landing craft and I'm\nIn the weeks leading up to the the actual invasion she was his the sitting in the shore of environment and during that time and march thirty first Nineteen forty five she was hit by a kamikaze\nNine men were killed twenty six injured and that was what really sent her on the faithful journey had that not happened she might have gone down in history as\nThe victorious flagship of the world wars have the specific theater I'm Victoria said okay now as well as nine other major battle\nBut instead she went back to their island California for repairs and that's where she was on July sixteenth Nineteen forty five when general Leslie grows and the other leaders the

little bit\nYes a commander ... lieutenant commander ... as I was saying we tried to present the Japanese point of view in a sympathetic way I'm\nMeaning that they were acting out of there since their conscience and conviction and so um we were able to make great use the ... um well it was it and then more sort that he's published after the war who first shift in Nineteen fifty two and Japanese language and\nIt was later published by Henry Holt in the fifties or here in America in English and\nIt was really an examination of\nJapanese submarine warfare in World War two that written from men are happy modus point of view and there was a chapter on his devoted to Indianapolis\nThat because we were looking at the larger Pacific War in the end of the world war two in general we were able to really develop his personality a lot he was the commander who cared for his men\nHe was the commander who was very very frustrated with the state of technology on Japanese submarines and really against protocol at the time because Japanese had a very autocratic top down military\nUm he went around saying on doors after ... for radar and more technology for his submarine because that means that Marines didn't have radar right up until the end of the war and so he was very frustrated because he was seeing a lot of it is rather sad commanders\nAbout Fifteen men on a floater net and those are the kinds of nets that had the cork pieces throughout the net to keep it afloat and men were spread out on this and just this huge frenzy of sharks attacked and there was nothing left\nAnd so reports like this were coming in the you know and even all the way until rescue I mean part of\nThe rescuers accounts because by the time that the rescue arrived the men were really incoherent they were able to tell or know what was happening by that point in the story but\nYou know the rescuers are reporting that they're fighting off sharks are literally punching sharks in the face to be able to pull men bored\nBecause the shark and to attacks increased as I guess you know I don't know how much sharks realized things but they said it seemed as they were pulling the men from the water the shirts um the attacks increased\nAnd you know this is I Can't imagine how horrifying that would be I think seeing one shark would give me a heart attack and imagine hundreds of them you know one of the sailors reported there were so sick they could walk on their backs you know from shark to sharks that we're underneath them just swimming there they\nCould stand on them want to kill the sailor you sort of go becoming delirious and he's looking things drugs like oh there's food all just reached knowing grabs a boot right\nMhm [noise] yeah I'm young ... and by the name of John ... and he actually took his socks off\nAnd thinking he was gonna wiggling toes as bait to learn the sharks and and catch one and then you know he kind of came to a sense is that the last minute and realized oh this is probably not a good idea but you know he was nearly out of his head at this point and put a sock back on quickly and\nManaged to stay safe you know so they\nWere doing the worst things\nSome of the worst effects Lynn are or how those people who drink the water there just wasn't completely crazy\nYeah that was really chilling to me because you know here you know if you can imagine they're they're on their ship that everyone knows it's almost the end of the war they're having this leisurely a sale they think across the Philippines see\n'em and then you know the next thing they know they're trying to survive this horrible ordeal these these young sailors who were just playing pranks on each other the day before\nAnd then by the second day forty eight hours then now we were talking about the hoarding of water but as Sarah mentioned there were only a sixteen wraps\nBetween there were there were four groups was it three groups that there were four groups of four rap or three groups of four rats in any case\nThere were four groups of four raft but then the one group split apart on the second day okay that's\nRight so so there were so any water that was available was only available on the raft and so there were only about forty men among all these hundreds and hundreds of men who had any water at all and so by you know second day in and the third day and\nThey were starting to get very desperate from dehydration and so there were some men who absolutely knew not to drink the salt water no matter how Thursday they got\nThat there were others who although they knew that the sun and the exposure and the dehydration itself was perversely causing them to lose their faculties lose their ability to reason so some of them to come to the idea that they\nCould strain the salt out of the water and so you see one sailor holding up a torn piece of his shirt\nA while the other one poured the water through it into this into his mouth and thinking that that would strain the salt will of course that didn't\nAnd then others would you know take small for it is that the sea water I'm hoping that no one would see them and talk them out of it but then eventually they would just begin gulping it like they were hoping it out of a mountain stream\nAnd what happens with this is a condition called ... and\nBlood vessels burst blood cells\nEarly from the brain um brain short circuit just like when a tree branch falls on a high voltage line and they would just go out of their heads and um they die very horrible death from drinking the water\nYou know you have the the Japanese commander who decides oh let's get outta here because he figures there's no way the ship is here by itself something else has to be around you that or it was out of sight all of a sudden and he thinks oh it must have gone away or\nHe couldn't imagine I guess in immediately that it it sunk that quickly so he leaves I'm which is I guess fortunate because they could have surfaced and finished them off\nYou have a somewhere I was a pilot who winds up testifying at the court marshal later or an American pilot who saw what he thought was a battle he ended up telling somebody about it but no one paid attention we've got to go to a break in about a minute maybe a bart Sarah you want to talk about that guy\nYeah there was a gentleman by the name of Richard With Francis and he was an army pilot he was transporting a general who wanted and you know that the general death in the cockpit within minutes late night patrol you know it's just after midnight\nAnd they see that you know kind of explosion coming from Milo and\nThere's no report coming in saying that there is any kind of enemy action though you think well maybe this is drills or something of that nature but yeah I guess it seemed kind of out of sorts for him so he said well you know report it and he did actually try to report it a couple of times\nAnd yeah the army side of things that will let the navy do whatever they're doing just ignore it\nAnd he's still want to hear a navy personnel at Guam I Believe\nYou know hey I saw this should anyone look into it and they said no there's nothing reported in the area don't worry about it and so you know\nThere's actually more to the story with that where you know they had a son\nWho you know this gentleman richer Francis have passed away but his son carried on a story and you know there he actually had diary entries of the time and at the one father and it didn't line up with it but he didn't find out and tell a few days after\nOne eight six six eight three six eight seven three five that's one eight six six eight three six eight seven three five ... news radio nine sixty W we are see\n[noise]\n\nWhen Vincent I Wonder if you could discuss for me in a broad sort of strokes are the sequence of improbable events that seemingly combined conspired to make things worse is if things just sort of drop through the cracks that made their survival even more improbable\nAh well as Sarah mentioned there with the the um\nDeparture message that didn't go through from gone to the Philippines there was a tenant on the Philippines I who had received a net thing that is\nA ... a combatant ships arrived there didn't need to be a report made well he wasn't the brightest guy in the world and as a matter of fact had received a report saying it's match that he thought well\nIf I don't have to report arrive of that and shit I guess that means I don't have to report non rattles either\nAnd then you know to be fair to the navy the entire focus was on the pending invasion of the Japanese home islands so all of these things along with the lack of a distress signals combine to make it in Indianapolis slip through the cracks\nAnd it wasn't until I pd one inch or a bomber piloted by lieutenant check when I'm just happened to be flying over the area that the survivors to find it in the water\nThere was a very poignant story you tell in the book Sarah ah about these pilots that they dropped all the supplies and trying to uh give these uh guys on the water or something they hang on to and they're they can't do any more there are other supplies they have to head back and there was one guy who's swimming way out\nIn the middle all by himself just swimming is a I don't know where he was swimming too or what he was doing but there was nothing they could do for them\nI mean I imagine that being so terrible to witness you know your did everything you could you find out there's no there's nothing left an airplane to help this loan swimmer\nAnd you know and then I Believe when they got to land they actually found one more life jacket or something they could have thrown and you know speaking to these men reading\nTheir testimonies later on it affected them the rest of their lives they were devastated about not being able to do more and that was really the sentiment and most of the rescuers you know they were out there feeling like they were playing God you know are these men alive or they you know\nWho do we take for our ship or else the VP the landing craft is full what do we do if we can't fit one more man and he's still alive you know that with a burden they carry till the end of their life you\nKnow it's war time as ... said the focus is on you know Japan and ending the war and um it was a lot of big stuff going on so things did fall through the cracks but or is it an accident that this story was kept out of the newspapers until BJ day uh then well reporters\nAre reporting on it the ... reporting on the incident at the time they've not believe it was an accident so the rescue occurred beginning on August second uh Nineteen forty five\nAnd the war ended on August\n... between the time zone fourteen Fifteen Nineteen forty five\nAnd they did not and now the Indianapolis had been thank the newspapers did not release it Washington not Washington did not release it\nAnd tell the J day until they announced that Japan had surrendered and that the war with over if you can imagine huge banner headline on August fifteenth Nineteen forty five and Seventy two point headlines\nYou know Japan quit the war is over and then maybe below the fold in a very small article you let the Indianapolis cruiser sunk\nAnd reporters that time I Believe that Washington and the navy specifically did that to divert attention away from this disaster that with you know\nYour time and\nThe button\nYou deserve a better way to watch the sports you love ESPN what people live for and all of that show

it was last year that the Indianapolis had been found a new this mission funded by Paul Allen\nActually it was about four in the morning when I received a phone call from bill Tony who was the gentleman I mentioned earlier the some commander of Indianapolis\nAnd you know bill was contacted by the navy and he called me and since there they found the ship\nAnd I didn't know what he was talking about it for in the morning of and so you know dating my faculty and you realize what was going on very quickly and was astonished I mean this was something that several people before the ... group which was the vessel that\nJapan I tell you what Joe that's quite a bit to chew on their lips let them tackle at least the last part of that question a nobody on the ship I mean really no one really knew what it was\nYeah even uh even the cap and didn't know what it was that this was the most closely guarded secret at the entire war and the most highly classified naval mission of the war\nAnd so even a even as I said even the cap and didn't know what it was only major from and what it was and his uh\nHis companion ... no one who was along to monitor the radiation so\nThere was a little chance that a Japan would have now and and\nI don't know that extra precaution with taking because ship with traveling so fast almost at thirty not that they cut it out ran any Japanese submarine that were to try to target or\nSome funny stories about speculation among the crew about what it might be a because there was a fairly conspicuous package that was delivered there and in fact as you noted in the book the the the uranium the\nThe radioactive part of it but the element of was carried on to the ship in a briefcase but there was a lot of funny stories that we are told about what might be in their right though Sarah\nOh yeah I mean again these are teenagers and they have this\nLarge crate that's delivered which is really a diversion to everything but they brought you know they see this crate come aboard and it's surrounded by a marine guard and of course there first gas is Rita Hayworth undergarments or send to toilet paper for Douglas MacArthur [laughter] you know [laughter]\nNo one guest anything close to the bottom [laughter]\nYou know I thought it was a a an odd post script sort of the the shifted self got blamed in the court marshal they were a thrashing around to blame somebody in the shifted self got blamed an all of which you would like to tackle that\nWell they were in effect blaming Indianapolis for her own own demise so in one one case in point is that no distress signal got off the ship\nSo they were saying that that was happening they followed that with the ship fault for getting hit by torpedoes and having her power you know flown out\nI'm also as a treaty cruiser as Sarah mentioned she had a single through jak that when uh all the way through a from ... stern and\nEnded in certain cruising conditions in the in the last

out there but not a lot of facts [noise]\nYou'd never stopped working on it does you know I mean you're focused may have been elsewhere but it's always been sort of a you kept an eye out for articles and information [noise]\nYou know I Can't say that I've committed much energy to it in the last say seven eight years and focused on missing people but\nWhen you're going through the archives and you're trying to pull out articles about missing people I'm always reading about all kinds of things that I see on these first pages of news news articles and such and\nI started to come across these ah [noise] these stories about [noise]\nUm something that looked like ... when you read the articles but when you read the title of it [noise] like Ninety percent of the time it will say wild man and I hadn't done a lot of archived work on the topic before but\nYou know eight years of digging through these archives for missing people articles I just started to pull them and put them in a folder and over the years that got large\nAnd eventually I said you know this is pretty intriguing I I think even if you're an optimist or a pessimist on the topic it's it's convincing that something over the years has been around us and it's been documented and and it shows the historical aspect that most people don't understand [noise]\nUm ... ... we're going to get into the specifics articles about big wild man and giants and sometimes do the same and sometimes they're different but I wouldn't have to just for those who were not lifting ten years ago\nWhen you were first year you recap the ... project how you got started on that what you learned and how it's kind of got its hooks into you know all these years later\nSo I I never had a dog in the fight or I was working for a technology company I was getting ready to retire and raise a couple of kids and\nTo the guys I was working with that were super wealthy came to me and they sent me in this room and they told the story that independently without knowing each other when they were kids they had a big for the encounter in the mountains of the earth\nAnd they found each other later in business and you know we're sort of set a coincidence I started talking about Bigfoot and they found each other and and were shocked that they each had a similar and counter\nAnd they said you know if we you have Twenty years of a police officer ... years of investigating an HR you're the guy really to give it that independent look will finance it you go about it at your own pace me you know your kids to raise that help us out with this we really we really want to find out\nAnd initially said no and they kept coming back coming back and they said at your own pace you can do it\nSo I I Wonder about looking for an area that had a few things first of all I wanted Internet I needed a hotel and I knew that there was Native American history with the topic that ran deep and I needed it within say six to eight hour driving location from where I Lived at the time in Los Gatos California\nAnd I coordinate down the area to ... which is about thirty miles south of bluff creek where the Paterson given one film was made sixty seven\nSo I started to do some geographical research some topic graphical some weather\nAnd I started to bring this together and then I went up there and make contact with Hooper police that a police background I approached them and I said hey maybe you can break down some doors for me\nI'm not going to not going to stretch the truth I'm going to tell the truth and every witness that comes forward they're\nGoing to have to write an affidavit to what they saw under penalty of perjury and I wanted to raise the bar on the topic a little bit so that that would be no question about what was stated because they sign it and there'd be no question about it for the story was fabricated because it was done under perjury\nSo I started that route and a couple of the cops there knew many of The Elders\nWhen we come back we're going to get into that a little bit more and then jump into specifics from ... new book big wild man and giants easy Harry noon and night night I mean big what ... air
