you want to go not a well I just had a scan acts that my name was all swelled up I dislocated it\nI thought well now I guess well you might as well get up move around as otherwise it's just a stove up so I have talked me into it I went\nAnd like I said it was about an hour away and we got up that direction and hung out with people for a little while and uh they all wanted to go to a bar probably I don't know maybe\nAnother thirty miles from where we were there and I was like well whatever you know I got to be late afternoon but time and the early evening and a wintertime and we got\nUp there and I got this real strange feeling after I got into this bar or they knew people there I didn't know anybody other than who I drive with\nAnd it was just weird it felt like every body in there that was in that bar we're focused on me I didn't understand why at the time you know and I thought well what the heck about\nLike a bar full of empires or something\nYeah exactly it's like well I mean I felt like a a lamb or at the swatter bright and\nUp on a rope or something\nYeah and and I I got real long term for oil and I told him I said hey look I'm not feeling good I I Need to go so they they agreed and and we left that place then they went to this other place that way out in the country\nAnd it was an old I mean this was an old bag um CD\nBar yeah\nAnd I went in there with them and to this place and that was a bunch of old\nPeople that there again I felt that often enough and the air and\nI told him I said hey look I'm all just go sit out the car\nBut these these folks who brought you there they felt comfortable right\nOh well I've known them because I've worked with him um and um yeah there are to me it didn't you know I didn't feel any threat from them it was just in the

supposed to be out\nSo we're out in the country after I go out back to the second bar after I go out and sit in the car and they finally decided well come on let's go well we go down the road a little
