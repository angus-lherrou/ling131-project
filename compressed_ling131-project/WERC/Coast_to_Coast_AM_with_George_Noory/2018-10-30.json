it really isn't that high on that ... that sort of slip from Twenty years ago right\nOh yeah I I said listen you know what you want to hassle of women they'll fill you don't do it\nBut we wish you had to take into consideration is is that women are going to run things there's there's absolutely no question about that because they are going to be the most educated I mean the glass ceiling has been shattered for a long time but we're starting to see many many more women come into the c._e._o. positions\nAnd they're going to want us all excellent and was absolutely excellent was ... and uh

that and\nI don't care listen it is what it is [noise]\nWell let's listen here here's how it works is zero to a hundred years old when you're a baby you want what you want when you want to you want it now you don't you want to free you're a liberal and then once you're about ten years old and you have a some positions that the other kids don't deserve suddenly become a conservative\nSo what you have is you have conservatives at one end of the population and you have a a liberals at the other end of the population where we're gaining a liberal every eight seconds because they're coming of age

two things you first of all I'm he called her a horse face\nShe was trying to jump start her career uh um the orange star\nBecause she had nowhere to go and needed cash fast and that warrior here's what Italians referred to as an old fashioned grease off he thought he was actually going to that he was he put Ron and possibly when um the presidential nomination for the Democrats\nUm this was sold the word self serving isn't strong enough for ... both of those guys yet and all they had was temporarily side tracked\nI'm a booming economy or tried to bring down next man but more importantly that man has kids especially a little one still at home I yeah and that little one but a young one includes and catch quite\nAnd we had a president did something so by all it can even be talked about on on on radio in the oval office while I was aiming for him with my tax dollars and everybody said oh she has a right to a private life this guy did that if he did that\nWas over a decade about so\nI don't have a problem with him saying whatever you want because you have to remember\nFrom its reactionary he doesn't start fights you look at everything from his campaign going forward he has reactionary if you pick on him he's going to come back at you that's human nature and the second thing I disagree that is sad is that\nI'm ... now I'm not a senior in high school by it and it but I'm I'm not that old either\nWhen I was a senior in high school I said that this country is nothing more than ... and it should be run like a business I have started to successful business myself is that men and women don't have time for nonsense\nYou'd get a deal done we're not going to have a needing to have a meeting that have a meeting and then to pick a committee and then that and that\nWe don't have time for that they're spending our money and so the fact that you're saying we need more diplomacy ... the death when ward\nYep home if he doesn't save money we need a businessman I voted for him because he's a no nonsense that is that anyone that would bankrupt it four times and they had the audacity to get back up and get on the horse\nI that I I have incredible admiration for people that are fighters in addition he doesn't care if people call him a racist\nBecause God Knows what than it is hard and other people know that ... ... it doesn't matter about this policy she knows school yes as I as a man on and uh and as a prize of that\nSo I disagree with you on both of those um things\nLet's get let's get his comments day not in your comments are warranted obviously and you have a right to say these things would you want to jump in\n[noise] [noise] well ... ... regarding running it but I'm the country as a business I think you need to run the country as a country that the the single biggest enemy to any country a period is corruption and the business model does not protect us from corruption\nI think one of the things that when people say you run the country as a business let me give you an example I I think you know most businesses are bottom line oriented\nYou're not going to pay thirty thousand dollars for a screwdriver toilet a fair market value or even tried to get it the last one I think when people say let's let the country run his business they're talking about things like that we're much not waste money as a nation\nYeah I Would I Would respect that I I Would I Would agree with that as well but it would also say that that our country is a republic with the constitution and the constitution works what we have the best country on earth we have the best system on earth\nAnd the thing that frightens me about it a bit of a government run like a business is that the business model cannot protect you against corruption but the but the um Republican camp that that's that's my position on that\nRight and you want to comment on do you want to comment on the president's tweeting\nYeah you know [noise]\nI I don't disagree with with um the fact that this you know porn star in it and our attorney are are self serving they absolutely are self serving what I Wish our president would do is just not areas you know this dirty laundry in public I just wish it wouldn't happen\n... but ... let me ask you this devil's advocate in by the way I've commented on his tweeting too because I I think he needs to be a little more presidential he's got some great ideas\nUm a lot of great ideas I don't agree with everything he says but I'd rather be a little more presidential more dignified when in back off the tweeting and stuff like that but\nIf he let them smoke what they did\nWithout defending themselves then what happens to him\n[noise] I I think that would in their punishment will be [laughter] what they've said and and um [noise] uh I don't know like I think what he has done his dignify\nAt the argument and I and I don't think there is one I really don't\nKnow I mean somebody got paid a lot of money to to do what they did and she got it and I mean there was a reason for that who led to it who pushed it who knows but\nThat actually demanded\nA you know their their own way but what we have now is a huge huge biggest labor force than we've

one it's going to rearrange you and you're out of it in a mini Cooper ... year history\nThat's that's where the truckers are telling me that people in the trucking industry say first time a truck takes out of school bus it's over it's it's just not going to happen you know we're we're we're dreaming\nAnd a lot of truck drivers helped unload whenever\nThey're carrying you know I've seen I've seen trucks at night stopping off at the let's say like subway in there you know the truck is parked there in the truck driver guy is loading everything in the store I mean how's how's how's the driverless trucks going to do that\nIt's not it it just not going to do it you know hey hey can I go back to China for just a minute yeah please\nOkay one of the things that that a A R is troubling demographers about China right now is there are a from a forty years old and under there about Ninety million uh um men are males\nOr without that have no prospect of marrying because there's no female counterpart because of of either gender based abortion or is simply infanticide\nNinety million where are they they're in the military\nAnd the it's the there there is just a ton and and that that is what happens when you have an imbalance in your population so that's another factor that China is dealing\nWith do you see another major more breaking oh\nNo I just I\nJust don't see any reason to do it well I'll tell you what what what I Do see is I think the future of the earth or is the Americans and that is a you know Canada United States Mexico central and South America or we're self sufficient we don't need a Middle Eastern energy anymore we don't need the oil\nWe got water yeah we've got water we've got fracking we're we're almost impossible to invade because we're surrounded by water it it just it I don't know I\nAm one of those always missiles long guinea\n[laughter] yeah yeah but I don't know it just doesn't seem to be any reason for the for for that to to to take place even even with wacko is like like a Kim Jong hut on and on North Korea I don't see that happening\nIn ... in fact I say I what I say in in Korea is going to be a unification of the north in the south [noise] do you know that the south is not having children\nThere for ... heard that oh you sound like about one to here's my concern though\nNot for my country but from some terrorist group than obtains new ... or something like that and they do it and trying to planted on another country\nThat could happen that concerns me\nYeah that that could happen but\nWhat concerns me is a demographer is if if you have a South Korea with you know what I'm saying is that even one child per couple you cannot maintain a market economy on a shrinking population you know possible it has to grow\nSo I don't know what's going to happen there with the north and the south I really don't North Korea is about ... their their rights that are just above replacement level fertility\nMichael in Jamestown North Carolina he Michael go ahead\nYes Hi uh George and higher against um Hi my question is that uh is the trend going to continue where people are moving out of the north east into like down south and at West because like Florida is now the third most populous state\nOut raking New York state and also a Phoenix has become the largest city out raking or Philadelphia\nPeople are moving to the warmer weather Kenny\n... that that is exactly correct in in in my new book the book that came out last year called upside profiting from the profound demographic shift ahead\nWe cover every single state\nIf you go from Virginia all the way down to Florida go over to ... California Nevada or a [noise] Arizona and New Mexico um the populations are going to increase the population of of Florida is going to go from twenty million to thirty million want to buy real estate bite in Florida now\nAnd just sit on it and said I ... the the uh\nUh an interesting concept is the fact that the the the senior citizens in Florida are now Seventy five two Ninety five I had a real

and for sure be my friend I really appreciate that\nWell uh yeah thank you very much and that yeah thank you for having me on on the program I I I Love this show\nI'm looking forward to this is just as you got to tell me why me with the incredible background that you have in so many different things how did you get interested and involved in the paranormal\nWell it's ... the paranormal has been happening to me my whole life it started at age four with my first paranormal experiences ... experience a near death experience and just from that point on it just the the things have been happening randomly but quite frequently\nAnd ah I've always had it on the back burner I you know I've been doing all these other things and have a lot of different interests and it's always been on the back burner but it wasn't until recently that I decided to\nFinally put these all these experiences together into a book and a and then start talking openly you know not just with a couple of friends or family others but to to students and actually I I teach a class now at the college\nI'm On the paranormal that's been a very popular just started this this semester\nA lot of people Bruce or a little hesitant to come out and talk about the paranormal experiences some of them you know pilots they don't want to talk about UFO experiences as there's been a problem for you since you've come out and talked about this\nIt it hasn't I understand the the the nervousness it or that fear even that they would have it I was a I was afraid of that that maybe people wouldn't take my work seriously\nOr or that I'd be ridiculed or the administration would find a way to maybe I I get an early retirement or something but I haven't found that to be to be true at all I I think what has happened is that people now see me as a safe person to share their experiences with and they often do so privately\nOr some of them actually I have two colleagues that are taking the paranormal class that I'm teaching 'em to two of my colleagues that after college so I it's been a very positive experience that I guess the most\nNegative thing I can think about there was um\nA friend of mine her daughter's a graduate student in history and she told her mother that uh well I think he's just committed academic suicide you know that was the perspective of a graduate student I can understand that you're just starting out in your doctoral program that's something you probably don't want to tell your your graduate advisor\nYou know as as it's happening now Bruce and as you probably know the field of the paranormal and the activities and the studies it's really growing now isn't it\nI I I I Believe it is and it's and it's gaining acceptance and it's it's always had the in the scientific community up of which you know I I I have friends in the scientific community I'm not a I'm a social scientist you know historian\nOr but at it from what I gather there there's always been a tremendous interest in the scientific community but it but a reluctance\nTo uh to do much with it in fact I think ah my friend dean rate and who's the chief scientist at ions good guy he uh yeah seven he said they're Seventeen thousand five hundred institutions of higher learning in the world and there's only fifty\nFive zero academics openly interested in studying site and some of those skeptics\nSo that's a very small percentage fifty out of at Seventeen thousand five hundred uh schools uh in in in ... or colleges and universities and from what he told me there's only five or six paranormal courses being offered in the United states right now which is very surprising\nAt one point Duke University had a department that you don't need all of this ... under GB Rhine and now it's not there anymore but there are still the J. B. Ryan Institute thank God to study some of these things\nYeah no I it's it but I I think there is and I come from this with with dean because he's doing and you know he's traveling around the world talking about his research in very actively engaged in this research and there seems to be a and I suggested to me seems to be like a paradigm shift\nGoing on of of gaining acceptance and I think people are are increasingly you know professional people are are are increasingly\nA supporting the research and and\nTalking about their experiences more more openly\nWell and I and I look at this program you know six hundred and twenty radio stations we're on we're podcasting were on the Internet uh there are other podcast himself they're dealing with the paranormal\nUh millions of listeners it's growing it's getting bigger and bigger and I think people Bruce are looking for answers that they can't find and other traditional places I\nI I think you're you're right and that's\nExactly what I've seen as people have come forward to you know colleagues and uh I've I've made a I'd make contacts with our um our custodial staff or at at that work at the college at night and they have incredible stories that I just that are just as kind of blown me away and I never would have\nKnown and less somebody had said oh you should talk to a you know Mr D or whatever he's he works in this building at night and he's got some stories so it's like they're telling their friends who are then calling me and and saying hey I got something I Want to share with you so I think it's\nI I think once more people in positions of authority or or you know academics are professional people or express their interest in and their support I think it's gonna it's gonna spread a lot faster\nWith Bruce old ... latest book is called timeless a paranormal personal history he relates thirty four issues and cases that he had and just an incredible thing because in the beginning you say that it's not that you don't believe in ghosts they believe in ... to tell me about that\nYeah I I think that uh it it well in fact it's my my my uh spirit friends who I I I Do have contact with a they told\nMe that experience is believing and believing is experience\nSo this this initial experience I had at age four kind of open the floodgates for me and even though I tried to every once in a while put it on the back burner\nOr because I didn't seem to have much control it just happened randomly these things ah it just kept coming back so they just kept coming back instead of a you know it it you know ... regardless of whether I wanted it to or not\nAnd then I just kind of accepted this is the ... this is the way my life is going to be and I just proceeded doing other things but it was always there in the background I think I was always destined to to explore this at a certain\nPoint in my life and and the last couple of years that's that has been the the point which to do this\nWhen did you have if you can remember your first paranormal experience how old were you yeah that\nI was very I I was four but I Would and uh we had traveled to northern Norway or to an island two hundred miles above the Arctic Circle my parents are are from northern Norway from that island\nAnd we were staying with my grandmother for lived there about nine months so it was a wintertime and I was playing outside and I remember very distinctly what was going on and I I was a\nI got very sick or very suddenly I I just my body was getting stiff and achy Mike I couldn't move my head from side to side my neck was totally step I had this fever coming on and I went home and I got home to the old farmhouse we were staying my grandmother's home\nAnd she had this little bed in the in the kitchen and the old farmhouse kitchen because sometimes she would you know should be baking for a long time and just wanted to take a little nap\nAnd it was too hard to go up the steep stairs to the upper part of the house so anyway I was lying down there and I just kept feeling worse and worse than my\nBy the relatives came over and they said oh this is what happened to your eldest brother and then the next day he died and somebody said oh and that's what happened to uncle ... then when he got polio you know and they would just scaring the heck out of me\nAnd my and my parents and my grandmother and um so I just I drifted off to sleep a crime myself to sleep and I thought I was going to die and then in in the night uh I I I woke up and there was\nThis really bright light up in the in the ceiling and uh between the beams and this old farmhouse kitchen\nAnd ah it I felt like I it it was an angelic presence ... it was it was very bright it was very warm I felt like everything was going to be okay it took away all my fear\nAnd uh [noise] and I went to sleep and I slept soundly and when I woke up I was completely fine\nAnd and my mother and my grandmother said it was it was a miracle and that it was the guardian angel that had had saved me so that was the first experience and experience and I never questioned it I just said okay that's\nThat's what happens and I think that's what open the floodgates and and and and also my mother was very psychic too she wasn't a practicing psychic right to see 'em\nThere's always this seems to be somebody in the family who has this ability and it kind of passes down genetically doesn't it\nI I I Believe it does because her mother was also that way she was an herbalist she was a healer so and and and this is a very remote island at that point in the sixties they're the only way onto the island was by a\nA small plane or buy a ferry boat or there was no bridge to that island so there's very remote there's no hospital so uh you know they they needed the services of folk healers and\nI uh uh was playing around it was in ah I'm up at deception pass I'm from Washington state and deception passing the north end to with the island there is a a to bridge fans that go from the mainland to\nWhip the island the north end and there's a middle island called pass island and we always used to stop there when when we went camping and we we'd run around and it was beautiful you know you could overlook the narrow channels that that that separate the island from the mainland and\nI was running around and of course in those days early sixties there were no safety fences or guard rails to speak on for the\n... ... and I was running right towards the cliff and I remember running off the cliff\nAnd then everything was I was just like suspended in in in in in mid air was like everything stopped and once again I felt this this light in this warm\nAnd the next thing I knew it was like everything it stopped and then all of a sudden boom like in fast motion I was back on the trail and my dad was grabbing my shoulders and was\nYelling somebody's watching Uber's there's a there's some helpers out there for you I Want to come back

stop if we had to stop\nA and my my mom you know so I had a special kind of relationship with my mom dealing with that and that she's the one that I think really cultivated it and I I that's where I

hotel there is one here another miles from here and she goes no no you keep going keep going\nAnd uh so we kept driving but but later\nI found out that that that particular location near Oric was only I think about ten miles away from the location where that that one of the most famous big foot or videos is from\nThe Paterson given one yeah exactly yeah we'll be talking about and that this was in fact\nThere's been yeah there's been more siting there than than any other place in in the United states as far as I understand from what the ... the uh the reading that I did about it so now if it if

had a a lifetime of activity Bruce\nYeah I'm kind of I've I've kinda been a a a lightning rod for the paranormal that's how someone described it and I agree with that description\nTell me about the open casket story yeah the open casket or the title alone kind of makes you shiver\n[laughter] well I grew up in a in a I'm In a Norwegian American community and we had this this older man who passed away and he was a good friend of the family and I he was a very very nice man and uh\nWe were at his funeral was the first uh open casket funeral it I'd ever been to and I was sitting next to my mother I'm not sure exactly what my\nFather was a he might have been there too but I don't I just remember my mother sitting next to me and as we were going through the service and you know I the widow was crying and you know the the all the emotion of it all of a sudden I heard this a very distinct voice a very heavy Norwegian accent and it was the\nMan who had died that was in the casket and he was home to me\nAnd he said ah ah Bruce it's it's it's okay I'm okay there's nothing to be afraid of\nUh I'm okay and uh I I I I looked I kinda I looked around and looked at my mom and she you know and I didn't ask her if she heard it I just kind of looked at her and she kinda nodded at me so I'm not sure what that meant but\nAh I didn't actually ask her about it but then he said it again there's nothing to be afraid of everything is going to be okay\nAnd he said it then then the typical you know Norwegian accent and uh but I was looking at him and of course he you know he was just in the casket and and dead but so I I definitely heard his voice and um it it it was kind of comforting in a way but very uh I'm not going to say\nFrightening but very bizarre it would be weird wasn't it yeah it was weird I Can't say I was afraid but it was it was very enlightening knowing that okay he's I don't think he's lying I think he is okay wherever he is and I wasn't\nQuite sure at that time\nI I I think I Know now but uh uh often times I've heard that um that people who have recently passed away do like to uh appear at their their funerals\nJust this check everybody out and see what she was there very curious I think I Would be curious to\nTell me about your paranormal class at the citrus college\nSure um well it's kinda paranormal ended up itself that the college let me do it but uh\nWell do you have to fight for it\nI didn't really have to fight that was the that was the thing now it's it's a community education course so it's not like for college transfer credit but it is not ... at the college\nAnd I am a a tenured professor there and and I think there are a little bit surprised that I I proposed it but this is part of my plan you know that started two years ago with the writing of this book so I I've always wanted to do this and I I approach them and I said well they said well we've never done this before but we think\nIt might be a pretty popular I said well I Hope so let's give it a shot and so I thought well maybe I'll get maybe twenty people in there you know maybe if I'm lucky and that's about\nThe standard size that most of these classes get\nBut ah as it turned out we have thirty five people and there was a waiting list\nI probably could have had a hundred people if we could have accommodated them in this classroom but thirty five is a pretty is a pretty good number including two of my colleagues\nAnd and these people are from all walks of life I mean just a cross section of of of Southern California or younger people and and older people of different ethnicities and\nAnd uh and and and races and just it there they all have one\nThing in common they ... they've either had these experiences a lot of them or they're very curious about it\nBut there are a couple that are a little skeptical including one of my colleagues he's no longer that skeptical I'll tell you that after six weeks and the or seven weeks in the course into the course\nUm and uh it it it's been a wonderful experience of really what it what it turns out to be is you know I I present different theories about different types of paranormal phenomena I relate my experiences they they read my book\nAnd we talk about that but the big part of it for them is having a safe place to share their stories\nAnd that's the biggest thing that I've seen that's that's what they like they like to come there and they like to share their stories and it's a safe in an environment where we all we don't judge anybody we just listen if they ask for any comments or you know what are your perceptions about this we we relate to them and\nSo it it's been a ... it's been a very bonding experience wonderful bonding experience and uh actually tomorrow we're going to have our last class and we're having a farewell dinner\nAt a haunted location here in a nearby\nA steak house which will be fine ah that's a hunted and I'm so that that that should be a lot of fun tomorrow night\nWednesday night we have our annual goes to goes to your oh Bruce and it's amazing the amount of colds that come in a ghost stories I mean there is you know it's amazing to me or scientific explanation of what you think a ghost might be\nWell I'll I'll tell you the I've had two full operation experiences\nAnd I believe that those those full body operations are just echoes or um I think there are ... what they would call a residual hunting I suppose\nThey that they weren't interactive with me I couldn't communicate with them it's not like when I you know communicate with with those that are um in the spirit world it say\nThe ... at least the full body operations that I've seen the to where I could see the translucent ghost in front of me one one was in Austria in a very uh in the Alps was a beautiful location\nAnd the other was in uh in New London New Hampshire when I was on a a job interview there before I got the job here in Southern California and uh in both cases\nIt was it was shocking to say the least but uh\nIt uh it it it wasn't interactive I couldn't talk to them and they well I was talking to them but they didn't talk back and they didn't seem to react to what I was saying\nI think their purpose was just they were tied to that location so that that's my impression that uh and my explanation for what's going on with that now it's different than when I ... a\nM visited by someone who's passed on and I might see an image of them in my mind but not\nLike out in the in the open kind of thing so I think there there is a difference between an intelligent what they would call an intelligent spirit and a a kind of a residual or experience or or residuals spirit\nPsycho can ... the ability to manipulate mind over matter\nHappened
