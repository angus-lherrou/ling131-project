Gary Schwartz at the University of Arizona noted psychologist and a Jessica us who is a very well known professor of statistics and has been doing working consciousness research\nI worked with the late ... I worked with people from from Penn State university water expert\nUm I worked with um people from uh uh I'm from Princeton University you know just really prestigious universities\nSo we'll get an all kick around ideas with them and see what's measurable and then the team will talk about well how are we going to measure this and how to set it up\nAnd with some of them you know we do it in a laboratory like with Dr Schwartz we did some seed experiments where we had four sets the seeds\nAnd we sent intention to one set of seeds and and the scientists didn't know which ones who were sending intention to so we had no real scientific type of experiment and they planted the seeds and carefully measured them so it's all done with the scientific protocol that\nThey really helped me set up because they're the scientists and then I just invite my readers all over the globe and we've had people from a hundred and fifty countries participate\nOr I'm an audience if I'm speaking in front of a large group\nTo to do the intention and I'll be made out of my uh Internet site or YouTube or own Web TV or radio you and I did one together and um and then we calculate that we wait a while and we calculate the results\nAnd the reason we wait a while is safe for the peace experiments\nIf you just do it a week after well could you know violence could go down but if you look at what's going on for a couple of years before and then look for about six months afterwards if you have bucked the trend then it starts to get pretty interesting\nYou know learn the title of your new book the power of each has to do with the number of people you put in the group the test why\n... why not three Fifteen\n[laughter] will be really came about when I tried to scale this down remember I was doing these big experiment and I wanted to know what happens if we put people in groups is\nYou know groups small groups in my workshop you know will will they heel and so this is just another experiment in my own mind and\nBut the only difference was I had you know it takes years to become a Buddhist monk or a sci fi master sure my guys were total novices there were students who never even done meditation and all they had was uh twelve minute video for me\nI was going to do when we're going to take a quick break we're going to come back and just a moment to talk more about your work\nThe power of each and some of the incredible things that can be done with the power of intention truly remarkable when Mick Jagger ... linked up for you that coast to coast day uh ... dot com sober other books the bond intentioned experiment and\nSign up now ... zone or ... ... email newsletter today at ... dot com\nNews radio nine sixty W we are seeing\nNews I'm Carmen Roberts frightening tales of survival during hurricane Michael\nThe roof ripped off um it was all that out of there and when the wind was like pulling out of that little room\nThat man and an elderly neighbor took shelter in a bathroom shower and Michael hit the Florida Panhandle yesterday was one hundred and fifty five mile an hour winds downed trees killed at least two people ... near Tallahassee and an eleven year old girl in Seminole county Ga near the Florida line\nThe sharp sell off the wall street and the Dow plunging eight hundred thirty one point spreads to Asia stocks and China pledged five percent today in Japan they fell down nearly four percent Stockton Europe already down one percent yesterday's downturn has broad based\nTechnologies that Israel jak Amazon\nTerritory a big surprise they're Fox Business network the jury will us this Fox News [noise]\n\nOvernight forecast still cloudy a little bit of rain out there sixty nine degrees the but I Love both chance of rain on Thursday clearing in the afternoon a hive Seventy six sunshine on friday audio side WBRC first of all our chief ...\nRight now you've Seventy four degrees at news radio nine sixty dealt with you we are see bit by bit\nI'm Bob ... new advances in science and engineering from the national science\nThis audio is for your review for ...

exactly the money she was overdrawn\nI'm somebody else was down to her last two hundred dollars she wanted to set up a website she had a port wine staying and wanted and was wanting to do a Web site and set up a business to help other people not feel bad about their birth marks\nAnd she's down through last two hundred dollars and she suddenly here from Lloyd's of London ... she had been a former

happenstance\nAnd you see universities are studying the power of what are they doing\nWill we did the um we did the brain study you know and then we found and as I say we compared it to things like meditation and we found that it's not the same in all brain state during meditation still makes you feel like you're you\nThis what makes you feel like you're part of something much much bigger the power of eight you feel like you're part of you you kind of feel like you're part of the field that you're not this little lonely individual anymore you're part of something much bigger and grander\nUm and again we've looked at it compared to other um mystical states and its identical to a Buddhist monk and ecstatic prayer but now we're moving forward um life university the one who studied this the ... largest chiropractic university\nUm has their nervous scientists and we're planning a study or with their biology department to looking at the immune system markers so what changes in your immune system when you do this\nBut one of the other big pieces of this I talked about it with altruism was the University of California Berkeley who did this big study of what goes on when you do something else rustic when you do something compassionate like our piece experiments\nAnd they found something incredible that goes on a with a thing called the Vegas nerve it's the longest near the body and it winds its way from your neck through all the major Oregon's\nAnd it has a big effect on um things like releasing oxytocin which is a hormone that gets released the feel good hormone when we're when we caring for babies and\nThe result of this activating is that it has a really positive effect on the immune system that when we do good or feel compassionate or ... something like that we um you know we we actually get healthier\nBut the big piece of this which is why that Middle Eastern experiment came down and the Arab started you know sending loved to the Israelis\nThey found that we need to do something compassionate like be part of an intention experiment or power of a group\nThat Vegas you're often makes us more tolerant more tolerant of people not like a ... so that was a big piece for me George because I started thinking wow [noise]\n[noise] America America is so polarized now what if we started doing intention experiments where we had Republicans and Democrats together with that\nThat would be ... to ... and that would be an interesting experiment\nWill you know we're doing on this that this someday undoing a pilot experiment like that in ... county in Florida um we're going to do something about lowering violence\nBut we've got Republicans and Democrats as part of this experiment in the same room together to see what happens to them afterwards and we're planning to roll down in a big way next next spring\nUm we're we want people you know a different political persuasion in the same room together to see what happens to them afterward\nUs talked about a mirror affect what does that\nMirror effect to me was the biggest piece of this George because\nYou know we weren't just seeing effects among the receivers that stuff and the receivers of the big intention experiment you know the outcome the biggest change all that was amazing to me with what happened to the participants in these intention experiment\nSo when we started doing these these experiments I started surveying people to find out you know what happened to them and were they able to get on the website and all that kind of stuff but more amazingly I asked them how it was for them and I'll be getting answers back like that\nUm I felt like I was part of the higher network you know my body was shivering and I was you know shaking uncontrollably and crying I felt like I was in the tractor beaming Star Trek remember these are people who are participating in their own\nHome in front of their own computer by themselves but yet they were feeling this extraordinary energy and the extraordinary emotion but more interestingly after they participated in a piece experiment their lines became more peaceful\nThey were making up with relatives that we're getting along better with their partners that we're getting along better with their bosses and they're co workers\nThey were and they were hugging strangers about half of them said I feel more love for everybody I come in contact with\nSo that to me with the amazing thing about it the mirror effect and when we did healing experiments we had loads of healing when we had peace experiments we had loads of people finding their lines were more peaceful\nSo in a way that's probably the most the most powerful part of the intention experiment if not the outcome that's pretty interesting definitely but it's more the active participation in what happens to the people it changes their lives being part of that\nWhen we're gonna come back in the moment and take phone calls I've still got a few more

when\nNo I think I think you can it can for yourself no question and you can have you know\nYou can manifest things definitely um I've certainly seen that in my own life and seen it in\nIn many in many instances but there seems to be some sort of scaling up in a group you know I I wrote about this is my last book the bond about how we are really need to be part of the community George\nAnd you know that is are are kind of birthright it's also are feeling of\nOf coming home in a way you know we were always meant to be in groups we were never ... and we were always part is supposed to be part of the greater whole we've never supposed to be alone and I think there's something about that group support\nThat group feeling that you know you got a load of people who are just wishing you well there you know intending for you for your health for your happiness or something\nThat's really powerful and you know in many cases with my master classes for instance when I put people in groups there total strangers\nAnd they don't meet in person they're meeting virtually you know they're meeting on Skype or zoo or conference call or something like that\nMany of them end up feeling like this is a batch of people who are closer to me than my own family never they never unless they've never actually met them in person\nAnd that's the incredible thing about it but it's that\nIdea of a group of strangers you know praying for you basically that's very very powerful\nHave you found limit in your studies that these abilities\nWill work for people\nOf certain age brackets assured sex or just a few anything\n[noise] no I mean you can be young and you can be older\nYou know I think that um the people who tend to do this stuff or people who are you anywhere from their thirties to their seventies\nUm it really depends on what they want in their life they I've had young people I've had older people and it it works for them I think it's all about\nUsing the techniques\nThat I teach you know and becoming a a master in tender essentially knowing how to really focus your mind knowing how to what kinds of things do intend for and how to do it\nBut also being part of that group and just meeting regularly and I think it's that meeting regularly that does the trick I mean there's a guy called Michel Dean I write about my book who is a clinical psychologist\nBut suffered from depression which such so bad that it was often suicidal and it's not a good calling card for a psychologist\nSo he had tried everything conventional an alternative to try to get over this depression and he couldn't and so being part of the group they intended for that\nAnd what they intended for was that he would find the source of his in his depression and soon after that he got a brain wave to go to a Chinese herbal is\nWho worked out that one of his liver filtration systems wasn't working and he went and got tests and they confirmed that he that he was right and as soon as that was treated his depression completely lifted but the really interesting part of Michel story is what happened\nOver the year not only did that happen but he ended up going back to his fighting weight he lost weight and he got back to his you know his his weight that he was as a young man\nHe um he is chi gung practice he was practicing she'd gone that Gump better he\nGot a writer's block and was able to start writing again um he also developed something to help other people with I think it's with depression is special I'm a special kind of technique and\nEverything in his life with getting better and even his training you know his his um his his trainer at the gym and said to him what are you doing man you're exercising less and you're more fit what's going on with you and it was like everything in his life was starting to improve\nBut he he was one of the people who met religiously\nAnd in fact one of the guys in his group Robert became a really really close with him even though they never actually physically met\nAnd there were times when Mitchell would say you know\nI had insomnia last night and couldn't sleep and Robert let's say during then I had you covered and he was intending for him to have a you know to to sleep better and so knowing you've got that constant support is really strengthening in every way\nOver the year ...\nWhen when you do these intention non experiments but when you do these intentions to do something what do they do actually I mean you sit there and think I mean what what do they do\nOkay well there's a lot of little techniques that make you a good intent or I mean you know the popular view is that you just have to think about it and believe it or ... or whatever you do\nYeah um but it's you know one thing to really keep in mind Georgia's that were intending all the time [laughter] you know and we sabotage most of our intentions we we think that we're just having\nYou know we we have a meditation in the morning we do a little power thought and that the power thought is the thing that's our intention and that's the only thing the universe is going to hear\nBut um as I wrote about my book the field [noise]\nYou know we are and meeting energy all the time we're meeting a tiny current of light all the time and our thoughts are another part of that kind of mission and we're we're kind of leaky buckets we're we're broadcasting twenty four seven\nAnd so if we have this one little power thoughts saying I'd like to have this\nUm but the rest of the time we're thinking no it can't possibly come to pass or on such a loser or I don't like my hair or whatever you know were sabotaging it and so one of the things you have to do is get used to really having a focused mind a sense of positivity but\nProbably the most important thing of all that no one ever thinks about is being specific um\nYou really have to direct yourself to a ... don't you\nYeah I mean most people think about you know we'll all do something general in the universe will fill in the gap\nAnd that's a big mistake because the universe can oftentimes ... and the gap and a really negative way you know I think of the case of Heather meals McCartney who was a Paul McCartney is a second wife\nUm she was he had lost his love\nOf his life Linda his first wife\nAnd he was mourning her and he met Heather who had been a she was a northern girl from the north of England who came from a pretty rough family and she wanted to better herself so she came down to London and she was a model\nAnd she was the glamour model and she got hit by a motorcycle one day and she lost her leg below the knee one of her legs\nBut she was very lucky and she you know she continued to model and stood up for the rights of people who had lost limbs and that's when Paul McCartney miss her now Heather meals really wanted to be famous that was something really important to her and suddenly\nAfter pull married her and it fell in love and marriage her ... she became really famous you know super famous she married a former Beatle\nBut I think you know what ended up happening is as the marriage got sour\nUm she they the British press started digging up all this stuff about her about how she had featured in porn um photos and things like this and it's just simply Heather from being very famous\nYou\nKnow mess our peak in boys list price dealer price to be happier if your car

P. Morgan has accumulated the largest private stockpile of physical silver in the world more than a hundred and thirty million ounces that's over two billion dollars worth of silver I'm sure they're not doing it because they expect the price to\nGo down the hall I guess not but could super reach higher than a hundred dollars announced\nOr if you adjusted for inflation George sober would have to be about a hundred and thirty dollars announced reach adult time\nSo we think is a one hundred dollars is well within reach one could that happen\nOver the next seven to ten years but we believe most of

sounds are much better than your old ones that's for sure oh yeah\nOh yeah back to life anyway um what kind of have to ask I've been I've been wanting to ask\nI may be off to do this with Glenn separately you know uh you know uh but uh it's kind of a unique sort of thing that I Want to add I'm related to intense and experiment\nAnd ah\n\nAnd ah so what was\nThe uh uh [noise] I I kind of it's sort of it's really sort of a strange thing that kind of goes what really well with this show because of the kind of people that kind of listening and\nI um I I figure it out something and it's a little bit weird of horse [laughter] it's not for this show I guess\nThe ah you know I I Want to live in the past I've had access to technology and fit the laboratories and all kinds of stuff you know government lab them among among others\nAnd ah you know I went to the UC Berkeley in a whole bunch of stuff but the thing is um and um\nThe uh I like to regain some access even more access to what you would probably call a I don't really like to call it that but time travel a technology and it's a little bit strange and I was wondering if\nIf there's a way to have I mean there's got to be eight people out there that you know that can um you know helped me to have access to the time travel that get me to help me to get access to that time travel technology by but just kind of in Penn getting you know for me to\nDo that is that the ruble one time we sure definitely\nI mean we have groups asked for everything you would ever somebody needs sometimes it's just\nHow do I get this or helped me discover how to heal this or you know what's the next path for me in my life even\nYou know so you get a group together and start asking for access to this technology absolutely and you know once again if you don't have a group of seven friends you can come on our forum come on our website um\nAnd you know get get that um so I Hope I Hope I Hope you do and give it a try\nAre you looking for
