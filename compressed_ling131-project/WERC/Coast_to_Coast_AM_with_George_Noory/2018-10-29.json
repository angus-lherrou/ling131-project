Buckley, Washington and I'm actually quite close to ...\nAnd the witness a minute I'm young man named Brian can failed um he sold the strange ... he was driving along the road and it was sort of humanoid with this huge wings but it was kind of Harry as well [noise] scares me and had the shining a yellow eyes\nBut they sort of the ... the hair angle combined with a large wings um you know the the the Harry Potter they in the wings kind of people said oh it's not you know it's not sasquatch because he's got wings but he kind of looks up at like\n... and um and for a while in Nineteen Ninety four it was actually quite big using that area and then like a lot of other these you know there's other cases he just sort of became part of the local legend them you know the areas folklore and so\nYou've got a lot of men in black stories women in black story you and I've talked about that before a that might be spooky here than the men in black\nAnd and then some of those cases you know they seem otherworldly just out of place\nUh you you know we've we've been accustomed because of the movies or do you think that maybe there are some secret government agents but have you ever had any indications that maybe some of them are\nSort of very human government type operatives who are operating under the umbrella of something like a men in black trying to emulate the the real mystery and figuring they can get away with it that no one will believe the witnesses who see them\nYeah well I've got to be honest with you in Georgia I'm up to five books now on on this phenomena foreign demand in black and one of the women in black and I have to say that the vast majority\nOf all the reports I get don't send anything like you know they step head of the Pentagon the CIA all the FBI and I say\nI'm a you know nothing like the the concept in the movies that typically are described as looking ... you know go on ... and ... ... white white\nUm and people talk about how I seem to have the ability to mind control the personal hypnotized them paper they even talked about when they're in close proximity to them that fateful and sick afterwards almost like a like a soup and actually infection or something along those lines\nAnd um there are cases when the men in black and the women in black and turned up in homes right have to pay for pain using wager boards which puts another angle to it\nUm but there's no doubt in my mind again um that's you know this is a real phenomenon but it's not like it's portrayed in the movies it's more sort of like a\nYou know like a gothic horror story mixed in with the X. files you know you put those two issues together that's that's how I Would sort of describe ... the ... street it's far beyond you know just guys in black suits walk\nAnd I guess I'm a gun you know\nI'm asking it into context ... with cattle mutilation is I think you know there's there's a lot of evidence that the these animal relations are carried out by something other than just um\nUm humans and helicopters are that some of them are truly inexplicable and then you have a whole other wave of them that\nSurely seem like they are humans that are carrying out the same kind of thing for whatever reasons um this is sort of leading us to where we're going in the next hour to talk about your other book on the alien abduction wells but we're in human agencies and that doesn't mean government agencies but humans\nPretend to be something paranormal get away with something that's really weird and they they do it in a way that so that there isn't a lot of serious scrutiny by people like you were people like me or rather investigators\nWell yeah I mean I think you know when you talk about with the ... you know you've got a really we won the next couple of them so much off Asia perhaps to explain\nThere is a parallel with the ... black where there's no doubt that in some cases I think that a government agencies are responsible for the day but I think it's a very small catch gray versus the the January unexplained ones and the way it was\nWhat I think it happened on a few occasions and there is some evidence to support this\nIs the over the years agencies may actually have employed the legends of the many black as a means to cover their tracks in other words\nIt might be paid for with the government to know that many black are all too real but I don't know what they are but it doesn't prevent them from using the ... the most have resumes too to threaten and quiet papal who\nWho've I may not want to have them talking about cases so the government may actually not know who the men in black really are and I don't think I Do fully\nBut that sort of lead us into where we're heading in the next hour we're going to talk about

Ronald wild man who was a delivering a vehicle in the south of England and it was like the early hours of the morning it back to I Am\nAn essay was driving these vehicles to the location\nThey the lights on the call when I was on the cars started in time to a halt\nAnd this is this'll become known as the the vehicle interference phenomena where they knew ... what's intriguing\nIs that they the British police force actually handed over the investigation because they reported it to the police found it over to a group within the British royal Airforce caused cold day a promise to the security services are sort of like the\nThe James Bond if you like of the of the royal Airforce I sort of get involved in espionage and counter intelligence things like that\nWhat's interesting is that in the ... it talks about how the they ... they promised them security services interviewed Ronald Wildman ... with the with the cops came to a halt and the UFOs in front of him and the most telling an intriguing aspect\nIs that he told the police and this is a direct quotes that he was modeled about the time [noise]\nWhich is an interesting thing because that sort of sounds just like you know the whole missing time angle of abduction low in today's world but Ronald while in the fall actually refer to him saying that\nYes he sold his UFO coming down lights went out of his vehicle and then he kind of felt a bit strange checked his watch and there was something about ... it's actually you know both\nTry completely and the file but he says he was much older by the time which I think you know you put all those aspects together that has the potential for being a significant abduction case\nI think about the contact D's and I remember reading about them when I first got into this subject than thinking sort of amused meant well there there were a interesting colorful harmless sort of weirdos um\nBut the the more you read about um the more interesting they become a course people like a

time taking the literally but when you realize that the government is really does followed them around and takes it seriously for whatever reason\nIt makes me think of like the Roberts and men or that the CIA scientist studied UFO topic and they include the UFOs themselves are not a threat to national security but reporting you up those might be because maybe the Russians could somehow manipulate a public opinion\nIs that a justification for going around people like a dam ski bathroom those ...\nOh yeah because I mean George\n... is a first book flying saucers of landed published in the early

I was wondering the first thing I was wondering when I finished this book was how do you get away with this you are a seemingly respectable guy teaching at a grade school and I wonder if you're if you're going to catch Greece for doing it\n[laughter] use me um [noise]\nNo it's um yeah how do I get away get away with it from you know a lot of people and cultural studies or people who are interested in the study of religion or\nYou know we do we do get a path to study really cool fantastic things right um people's um unusual experiences and unusual states of consciousness religious experiences [noise] a peak experiences what whatever you want to call them so\nYeah it is kind of the privilege to be could be a professor and and get a chance to just kind of how my interests and that's really ... how the book came along um\nIt came out of an earlier book I was working on that look that sort of the science of religious experience and spirituality but as you know there's something new a new direction by thinking about science and physics and cosmology and how it would be sort of fantastic scientific ideas have led to\nUm have led to at least a new vocabulary that people are using now to talk about their death experiences and and the parents isn't and even after life experiences and so on\nYou mentioned in the in the beginning uh and of course as a as somebody who studies religious studies and religion and how it interacts with the world in popular culture you mentioned in the beginning how of belief in church um a formal religion organized religion is sort of\n... around the western world but interest and spiritual and spirituality topics or has has remains strong or you may increase that that's a that's kind of a challenge for somebody in your line of work to figure out why that's happening [noise]\nYeah I think it is I think it is and um you know that's why a lot of us are trying to study these these new forms of spirituality I mean that that was really as you say that was really how I began the book with the puzzle you know the problem which is you know people still in America seem to have a lot of\nI guess would be called spiritual beliefs they are pretty high numbers in America\nI'm believing and goes for believing spirits or believe in God I'm and yet on the other hand as you say a participation in traditional religious congregations are silly Asian and traditional really with traditional religious congregations those things seem to be going down\nUm how how can we think about that how can we talk about this you know how how is it the case that people seem to have a very real\nSense of belief and other world um and spirituality and the option a really in the absence of\nParticipation and traditional congregation so after that tried to think about and\nTry to think well where where people getting that these ideas you know where where people getting their beliefs their ideas about other world and\nI'm kind of a big science documentary person and I'm I'm real you know I'm kind of like a science nerd and in a sense and interested in ... book and I think there is there's a lot of sort of fantastic scientific concepts that circulate now in our culture and I think uh you know concepts like\nDark matter dark energy or even thinking about infinity a or thinking about the the multiverse or thinking about higher dimension I think all of these fantastic scientific concepts which I think scientists themselves embrace with ... with offensive on mystery and I wonder I think those concepts are sort of\nUh the the bed for for a new spiritual infection and I and that's and that's what I Try to look at it in the book\nWell you know we we I don't imagine you listen to the program\nBut often but on this program we talk about some pretty wild stuff and I think that scientists will die hard times too late normally Georgia's\nToo late [laughter] yeah a pretty wild stuff that I think mainstream scientists generally have a tough time getting their head around a near death experiences out of body experiences encounters with other reality um you know time slips things of that sort\nOf that you you'd sort of reached out how to look for a way to maybe\nMake a bridge between science and those kinds of subjects with this understanding of\nA parallel realities other dimensions higher dimensions we talk about that those kinds of concepts on the program all the time as if it's a given day or a given but we don't really I don't think many of us know I Can't get my head around other dimensions and\nUm it it it hurts to even think about it but you take a deep dive into a sort of why those kinds of concepts are so commonly held so um that that was important not only to reach out to people like us to discuss these crazy things but also to science right\n[noise] yeah I think so yeah I think so I mean one thing I Try to do in the book is\nUm I Try to try to demystify a little bit the discussion about other dimensions and the in the first couple of chapters the book I I you know I asked the question of what it what is an extra dimension um and I talk a bit about uh I talk a bit about that and maybe I can just say worried about that for\n... for the listeners tonight yes yeah I'm going to hear\nAnother demand the idea of another dimension is not that I'm not that after ... after all I mean we have we know we have we have three directions or dimension three spatial dimensions that we live in and that's length with and height\nAnd those are are are three directions or or dimensions that there's an additional dimension that we sometimes talk about is the fourth dimension I'm sin Feinstein in that time so we live in a a four dimensional space time a world an on science I spoke about this but\nSome of the people I talk about in my book talks about an additional spatial dimensions [noise] a a direction and space or a dimension in space that's different from the other three so you know we could think of like we could we could draw a line on a piece of paper or a line of a one dimensional objects that has length\nIf you then draw flat square on that same piece of paper and has two directions or dimensions that has links and with\nAnd then you could you could draw cube I'm On the paper or you could hold a Rubik's Cube in your hand and that would be a three dimensional object has three spatial dimensions are linked with and hide and then the then the question becomes is okay what about a fourth direction um or a fourth dimension [noise]\nAnd this would be you know this would be an object that has links with height and something else [laughter]\nAnd the the phone thing else as the tricky part something else is the is the direction that we cannot perceive so if there is such a direction to reality or dimension to reality it's it's evidently not something that we can we can see 'em or perceive\nI'm so this this is the possibility raised by math mathematician and and actually others some philosophers I'm In the\nGoing back to the Eighteenth century but really in the nineteenth century mathematicians raised the possibility raised seems like kind of a strange thing to think about what ... how could there be another direction or dimension to reality\nUm you know and why would there be one well mathematicians in the nineteenth century start to use this idea within the context of their mathematical equations and the reason they do is they want to want to make the mathematics of of the universe of its forces in laws more simple and more elegant 'em and they find that\nThey find that it works um [noise] they find that they find corporate in an extra spatial dimensions a fourth visual dimension that the the mathematics of the universe is a law enforcers look better on the equations cleaner they seem simpler and more elegant um um and so on\nSo and in fact just skip forward to today today you still have mathematicians doing the same thing um you still have mathematicians incorporating within the context of their um [noise]\nThat there was another space or direction to reality and I'm\nSo happy I wrote the book just to kind of encourage people to\nThink about the possibility that above our three spaces are three spatial dimensions there might be others um that we don't see we go through our life um you know thinking that our world is the only world\nYou know maybe maybe there's something beyond\nWell it's a it's fun to to talk about it on to imagine but when you combine higher dimensions and the ...\n... it gets pretty complicated [laughter] um [laughter] I tell you what we're going to we'll take we won't jump into that will take a break first and we'll come back and get into that the inspiration or some of the stories that you tell about people who are inspired by this idea\nOf a a very sad I mean people who embrace it and they they go through trials in turmoil in trying to get their head around it as as I have a ... but

C.\n[noise]\n\nWe're back with Christopher white ah Christopher I at one of the great things about the book is is how you\nTell the story about other worlds and our our modern perception of other worlds and how it developed a through by personalizing it you tell the story of people who've struggled with getting their own hands around the world Charles hitting as one of those who\nI I guess a brilliant mathematician who went into a deep depression when his scientific use came into conflict with his religious and spiritual views tell his story yeah [noise]\nYeah yeah yeah he ... his wife is is quite a story um but you're right they're they're hinting and there's many others in the book who sort of struggle with the\nUm you know sort of like a habit being raised religious in a scientific time and feeling that they can no longer an or maybe not sure that they can any longer embrace the religion of their childhood and still feeling spiritual for sure and and having a spiritual and tuition and his ... and [noise]\nAnd wanting to find wanting to seek out other ways of of being religious and many of them turned to these fantastic scientific concepts like higher dimension that has a new as a new more scientific way of thinking about\nUm you know the existence of other spiritual level level or worlds to reality I Am headed into an interesting story as you say he he grows up he goes Oxford he he falls into this kind of depression he's not sure about anything anymore and then he\nHe makes he makes a move that I think not a lot of people would make [laughter] All right and the situation is he he embraces mathematics and geometry as a kind of a and he kind of hangs onto that as the only sure thing that there's a way in which the map provide certainty 'em to him\nBut I think is his story a little bit unusual in that sense but then he developed\nSee I'm into the future and you write these ideas have been a book called an experiment with time the book is from Nineteen twenty seven it becomes a kind of a best seller and a lot of people [noise]\nA lot of people in Europe and America read the book and get interested in thinking about their dreams hum as somehow predicting the future and you know I sometimes give talks about this in different places and I always have audience members come up to me I always have people emailing me saying oh I'd had dreams like that\nUm so you know it seems to be a fairly common experience actually that people in dreams seem to get glimpses of things that then happen a than happen in real life [noise]\nAnd then you have experiences where people are not sleeping there not dreaming and they happened in a while they're awake at time slips or day job blue or were they seem to be in some other reality and then they come back to this one ... ... ... what's the how do you how does that fit into the framework that you explore in this book [noise] [noise]\nYeah yeah exactly I talk about some of those experiences as well so in that chapter six um [noise]\nAnd then a little bit in the chapter on cs Lewis I'm as well and then I have a chapter on Madeleine L'Engle right who's the the famous writer of a wrinkle in time just recently a movie made a vat of that book but she talks about time slips um and and time travel um and so on and some of her books\nSo yeah how do they make sense is that um [noise]\nWhat time is not linear right my like my presence could be somebody else's future [noise]\nWell for sure I mean I think one thing that one thing that done picks up on his as you say that Einstein has a new way of talking about what time is which is really\nCounter intuitive and weird right I mean before Einstein people thought about time as just linear as something that just flowed out of uniform rate right we we have a sense of prime flowing we have this kind of intuitive sense that time flows forward\nUm in fact though you know Einstein had a number of counter intuitive things to say but one of them was that\nOf the ways that we experience time is probably just an illusion and the product of the ...\nImitation of her own consciousness and find equation for for the universe really lay out something that looks a little bit different but they really lay out a universe that could be called a block universe a universe that already exist\nSo um you know all locations in the universe and all times in the universe\nI'm already exist and they're all laid out in this big block [noise] we are we are kind of a passing through [laughter] happening through that that block right or we occupy little portion of that block but every moment in our path and in our in our president and in our future and in the earth's future and then our son future\nAnd and all of our defending future's all of those moments already laid out in the block at least according to the the laws of physics\nUm and and this is actually discussion Scott defending wants to look at it just got to my book but you can also look at Brian Greene for he's a professor of physics at Columbia He wrote a new book called the fabric of the cosmos where he talked about this kind of block universe so I'm\nDone and I was only laid out what does that say about destiny and free will and that sort of questions that you as a professor religious studies talk all the time\nYeah you're right you're right it lays out these big philosophical issues right like um faith in destiny and human free will and how free or are we to make choices um and so on [noise]\nUm so and we can definitely talk about those issues I mean one thing that done did um and some of the other people in my book did as they thought through these problems was they said you know I'm I think what ... what's happening is that\nYou know the fact that these future moments are already laid out somehow in a block universe makes it more plausible or makes it more possible that you know maybe the dreaming self could somehow\nLift itself up above our\nThree dimensional world or I should say ... world right because we have three spatial dimensions and one temporal dimension dreaming felt he said and lift up out of that block universe and peek into future moment\nAnd done believed that I'm using a bit of Einstein here and a bit of you know him thin and higher space philosophers there I'm that's what he believed happening some other dreaming consciousness had an additional\nA degree of freedom an additional direction that it could move in 'em and and we could talk about that as an additional visual dimension or we could talk about that is you know maybe consciousness somehow can move with an additional degree of freedom but that's what he thought and have you thought everybody everybody\nSleeping so had this degree of freedom and he also believe that every one of the cabin kept a journal by their bed of their dreams and and they followed he had a couple of recommendations for how to how to do a dream journal\nHe believes that if everyone did they would be able to see that all of all of our dreams contain bits and pieces of future events and after that I'm sort of mixed up together\nWell I get on the central question for me about higher dimensions is are there people there and can they interact with us or is it us that's over there we're going to get into that uh those topics as well as near death experiences\nOr to talk about the science is a sharman remote viewers how some of those ideas that we have discussed on this program before\nMight fit into our discussion of other world so the book spirituality and the
