I should add so that's a a something that makes this a predatory lending system by definition\nAre their predatory lending laws in various states\nThere are there are state use three laws in every state in the union and federal student loans are exempted from all of them there are also fair debt collection practice laws federal um a fruit in lending laws\nUh and these again are restricted or completely remove a for the case of federal student loans\nWho came up with this scam [noise] well the genesis of this the genesis of\nThis really comes back to sort of a swamp the beltway cup ball of bankers a which included a it started with a company called Sallie Mae which was a government sponsored entity back in the seventies [noise]\nUh and by the way one of your other guests who appears on your program frequently Catherine Austin fits\nYes served on the board of Sallie Mae back when it was actually controlled by the government and she was there right at the next is\nBut when this company went from being a publicly sponsored enterprise to a holy private for profit enterprise and she can tell you many of the stories about people like Albert Lord a bill defender for in other executives at Sallie Mae\nWho had no interest in serving the public and at every interest in making money off of this system\nSo you can point to Sallie Mae and um they're very deserving also other groups like the consumer Bankers Association [noise] uh like many of the state run guaranteed horse in the country um like USA Funds\nThese people were all in it for themselves and they saw an opportunity to make money and they did everything they could\nTo make these loans as oppressive as possible and here we are twenty Thirty years later living a under the the fruits of their labor\nWhat do you recommend for a parent who use child has a ready to graduate from high school and they want to go to college\nWell the the only good advice that I can give up at this point George is do not borrow and if you have to borrow\nDo not borrow from a student loan company so don't borrow federal student loans don't borrow private student loans from a bank that they were they were technically it is called a student loan\nBecause as soon as you call it a student loan federal or private\nYou lose bankruptcy rights are and for federal loans you lose statute of limitations you lose fairly collection practices treated lending a state use three laws all the all the rights all the consumer protections that I mentioned [noise] um so really don't borrow is the best advice I can have but if you actually have to borrow\nGo to a private bank guinea private line of credit [noise] uh and do it that way because at least then you'll have you know every consumer protection that exists for every other type of loan whatever\nHappened to the days of scholarship so they still being awarded to people\nWell you know Georgia of course scholarships and grants are still out there but the colleges have been raising their prices so astonishingly much that you know no amount of grants or even state funding cetera\nCan keep up with their budgets um you know I was just in Syracuse recently in the price to go to Syracuse University is now Seventy thousand dollars a year well I can guarantee you now you're per year that's tuition room board\nBooks um for for your course for a four\nYear college and by the way it no longer takes for years to graduate George the average time to graduate from undergrad it's now six point two year what happened\nWell again the colleges are sitting in the cat per seat vacant because there's this lending program standing behind the whole thing and the federal government and and the other lenders are willing\nTo pile as much dead on the back to the students as possible the colleges have carte blanche to not only raised their prices but also really straining to students out and keep them in college for as long as they can possibly do it [noise]\nSo it's it's the time is getting longer the pre your cost is just exploding and that's why we're seeing these just insane stories where people are graduating with\nYou know a million dollars in debt there was a story just recently where they see a guy walked out of dental school with a million dollars in student loans\nNo wonder dental a belt bills are so high\nThat's right you know and and just really hurts the broader economy when you have one point six trillion dollars in debt strapped onto our younger workers just out of college um have to charge huge amounts just to pay off that burden\nAnd you know we're seeing comments from people like Jamie ... Morgan Chase and William deadly at the New York Federal Reserve bank and many others are about how the student loan problem is really affecting the broader economy I mean when you have Ninety million dollars in interest clicking off\nThat's Ninety billion dollars where people aren't buying homes cars they're not starting businesses killing entrepreneurship uh it's really starting to be filled\nAll right we're going to check in with you with phone calls with Alan Collins when we come back\nIf you've got a student loan give us a call if you've got a question give us a call if you're an instructor at a university and he wanted to give us your feedback on that give us a call as well we'll be back in the moment with Ellen calling in your phone calls right here on coast to coast to\nCoast insiders the new version of the coast to coast am app is now available for I don't know Android ... listen live on demand anywhere anytime good at ... dot com and downloaded today\n\n\n\n... deep I'm Bob cards with the discovery miles from the national Science Foundation a team of researchers led by Massachusetts General hospital was on a different kind of sealed hung one to uncover why the man who can take a deep dive in reserve is with her lungs no worse for wear\nOn the way down ... della ... she's getting injured as their crushed\nAnd suffered loving oxygen flooding when the seal heads back up\nNot better no the fragile tissues good supper inflammation usually response by the body to heal damage yet the researchers found no evidence of lung damage in these deep divers how'd the seals\nProtect their lungs remote potentially damaging inflammatory response was saying just think people uncovered the secret sauce they tested where the blood samples from to seal\nNations the fire archive of thirty four thirty\nHe's offered any protection from the effects of inflammation triggered by a bacterial toxin result the talks intriguing barely any inflammatory response ... do the same test in human and be inflammation is fifty to five hundred times greater\nAnd when the team added serum you'll blood mouse immune cells there was no inflammatory response the study suggests seals the rooms protective compounds could be the divers and offer promising extending the survival of organs used in transplants\nHe was radio Ninety sixty tell you we are ... head on line nine sixty you we are seeing dot com\nI harsh ... leaves one o'clock [noise]\nWhat facts did he find jak Callahan Fox News and have a law to President Trump will meet in the morning with secretary of state Mike Pompeo just back from effect funding trip to Saudi Arabia and the turkey on the disappearance of journalist ... ...\nNews radio nine sixty W. E. R. C.\n[noise]\n\n[noise] [noise]\nWelcome back to coast to coast Alan ... with us we're going to take your calls as we talk about the student loans scam what was it out on that made\nGet involved in this [noise]\nI had a um I had student loans I've three reason engineering and um I graduated and found myself unemployed underemployed for short amount of time [noise] uh and I tried everything I could do keep my loans in good stead through to ferment forbearance cetera\nUh but what I fell into and what a probably forty percent of everybody out there with student loans is falling into\nA is a ... system that actually want you to default and so they will lose your paperwork they will give you bad information they'll baffle em bamboozled you and compel your loans to default which is what happened to me and my loans very quickly doubled or tripled with penalties and interest and\nAnd so I started doing research and what I found was just astonishing uh I took my my ... my findings to first Fortune Magazine ah and then I wound up top story on sixty minutes\nA and this was a peace with the Leslie stall a piece for which Sallie Mae and the federal government refused to be interviewed I might add a and so it's sort of snowball from there I unfortunately I thought this was going to be maybe a two or three year project\nTo get you know justice on this matter a but here we are low and behold Thirteen Years later and Congress has not moved one inch and I'm hopeful that'll change very near future because the numbers have become just so astonishing uh but you know we're going to need a lot of help from the people out there whose lives this is affecting\nWhy isn't Allen that people who have a rough credits\nOr have a a very difficult time to make payments\nSeemed to be the ones that get the short end of the stick in by that I mean a you've got these payday loans that are outrageous and predatory are that are geared more for people who need some money and you know they're having a tough time you've got these student loans situations in one of the worst icy are these um\nSecondary car market a lenders who will finance people who really can't afford a car because they have to have a vehicle so they'll financed them\nWith just what you said they want to default so what they'll do is they'll say All right I Want five hundred dollars down you can buy this used car\nAnd so the person the poor person gives them the five hundred dollars\nKeeps a car for a couple of months makes payments for a couple of months then defaults the car gets repossessed\nAnd they sell the car for the same amount of money if not the ... this is not more and with financing and they do it all over again and they make more money on it\n[noise] yeah that's right you know that that's a great analogy George and you know I I make a similar analogy off and I say you know student loans it's like buying a car where you pick it out you buy it online and say you know look how great reviews you go and so you buy it online you go to go to the dealership and you pick up the car\nAnd you're driving out of the dealership and all of a sudden you realize that the car has no breaks and you wind up in the ditch\nAnd you go back to the dealership and you're like hey guys you know as far as know breaks what's going on and they go well hey buddy you know what can we tell you\nYou should read the manual because this car comes with no breaks you know\nUh and this in fact is really what's going on with student loans and particularly is used as you rightly say for lower income people um\nYou know a ... what we're seeing particularly in past ten years or so is these sort of fly by night an expensive for profit colleges are marketing very heavily to um you know disadvantaged uh\nUnder privileged people\n... yeah under privileged people people who weren't born with a silver spoon in their mouth and they're getting a horrible sort of a nonsensical education is just a joke a and lo and behold they get saddled with the loans uh and this rex their life um\nI mean they should be getting more interest rates better financing deals but because their credit shot and they don't have the ability to make the payments the way most people do they get the short end of the stick and that's very wrong\nYeah you know it's a it's a real cruel irony and and just in general you know there are a means test for student loans in the first place so the only people the people that get student loans and it's about I mean let's be honest is about Seventy percent of everybody who goes to college winds up with student loans\nBut still this is a you know I'm a an economically needy group of people\nWho you know don't have a silver spoon in their mouth and\nHow cruelly ironic is that is these very people that the Lenny system was supposed to help\nUh and it's essentially wrecking their lives you know the default rate across all borrowers by my best estimates is over fifty percent\nAs Raziq greasy once once the tuition like at Harvard or Yale\nOr a it's a it's on a par with the the number I mentioned for Syracuse early is probably Seventy or Seventy thousand Seventy Seventy five thousand dollars a year and there are even more schools by the way\nUm but uh yeah the the ivy leagues are running you know they'll they'll be up at a hundred thousand per year within I'd say a couple three or four\nYears I should have pushed my kids' sports when they were younger so they do get scholarships to go to university smart\nYeah that's right well you know even scholarships really won't pay the freight anymore I mean the price even at state schools were seen annual cost of attendance of thirty plus thousand dollars a and you know the scholarships really have an increased\nUh on that scale and and so it's you know unless you get a full ride it's a very tough proposition to go to even a state school these days you know we're we're getting stories where people go to community college and wind up with you know fifty sixty thousand\nDollars apiece crazy\nSo this has just gotten unreal um this is not\nThis is not your father's a college environment you know it used to be that you could pay for tuition by working a summer job or maybe a summer job and a part time job during college well\nYou know those days are long gone um the colleges have gotten so brazen with the amount that they charge a and I should say their own salaries as well it's it's just stupid flying\nLet's go to Joe truck driving in Indiana that get us started Hey Joe go

pretty much went under and they laid everybody off and I was one of those people do so I ended up her job over here\nAnd I found one but they wouldn't even let alone and fast or if I was I didn't have that little piece of paper saying that I'm there without too well and I think also for a couple of years you know\nYou probably in more and more experienced than most people\nAnd I looked at the local school there and they were voting for thousands of dollars for oh I think it was a horse just on well you know it's like they're away\nSo I ended up going and less than ... dollars on a great little are learning to drive semi thrive and then I felt like I got ... I found out that it's not a surprise but\nLet's get your reaction to this Alan what do you think a trade schools\nYou know even trade schools are participating in the student loan program these days and so the prices of trade schools are getting jak through the roof or as well you know when you have this landing system stand behind these schools you know they can charge\nWe'll see what they want because there's all this quote unquote free money out there and so for guys that want to pay out of pocket\nYou know what are they supposed to do they can't compete with that\nUh and it's just a travesty it's it's really shutting more people out of getting an education even at even provoke Texan other trade schools are as it is you know allowing them to actually go to college which was the intent of the lending program in the first place\nTo go to Gordon sorry to hear the Gordon and Lakeland, Florida have already go ahead\nHey thank you for taking my call 'em out to publicly think Alan

cases Eleanor these scammers\nAre yes there are a lot of scammers out there and I haven't heard of this UTSA company but there are a million of them and this sounds exactly like just another one where they're looking for two things they're looking for people who are in the fall that they can assure through\nThis loan rehabilitation a scam that I described earlier where they\nMake you sign for a much larger loan and then get a commission off the top of that uh or they're just trying to get you to read your your loans and ... surgery or consolidate your loans or otherwise refinance your loans into a new again larger loan or and make a commission off of that\nSo I Would I Would rip that thing up because it sounds like it's not worth the paper it's written on\nJames truck driving in Texas

lo and behold this ... this is just last week\nI got a letter from a company called central research L L C and hope you don't mind me mentioning mentioning them in particular or what their information as a hundred percent correct the principal was\nSixty four hundred and some change there's you know they're listed a breakdown of all of the costs but I've heard\nAnd I was wondering what advice you can give me do I try to negotiate directly with the deal he do try to negotiate with these people every there's something like four thousand dollars in interest and also a few\nSounds like another scam Ellen what do you think\nRight now and first of all I Would I Would never deal with a third party collection company you know unfortunately I don't have any great advice for defaulted borrowers because they're truly is known to give other than\nHelping us fight for each are twenty three sixty six and getting our bankruptcy rates back so that they can't steal from is legally\nA but certainly don't deal with third third party collection companies I'm the owner of your loan is probably either a a guarantor or the department of education\nAt this late date I suspect it's probably the department of education so I mean if you can make an offer to them of a hundred and twenty percent of the alone no fall dude you know that's something you you can do but certainly dealing with a third party close you know like like what you describe\nIt and they get the information Ellen lucky said they had everything down to the penny how did they find these are public clearing house that has all these things out there\nNo more than likely they are sub contractors to either a guarantor or maybe directly to the federal government itself so the information they have is good\nUm but I can tell you that dealing with them is only going to add to whatever price you wind up paying so I definitely recommend I'm getting at the bottom of if you if you want to negotiate\nFind the owner of the new rather than these third party collection companies because they're only going to cost onto the process\nThat my friend that had alone with the company that went bankrupt you've never heard from them again [noise] [noise]\nWell you have to be very careful these are some beat loans there are no statute of limitations for these loans so you may think alone went away maybe it went off your credit

my loan I'd be glad to talk with you and you know what Ninety percent of the time I bet they don't have ...\nYeah that's right I'm I'm guessing that something like fifty percent typically order loans is probably even higher than that they do not have the original ...\n[laughter] not at all Allen once again thank you for the information truly enjoyed it up next aliens and the Pentagon whole war

that before off to your life event in the city which we did\nThat was right around that same period yeah yeah that was fun you did a great job there thank you\nGreat job indeed aliens at the Pentagon I Love this title tell me more\nOkay it's essentially it is a new documentary that I put out to tell the story all off and leave and taking\nYour credit gram to it but to take your life that story and and really to to try in one document tree detail as as fast as I can tell the story of the U.S government don't want any relationship with this\nPhenomenon or watch seven decades now\nLots of people have been talking about the Pentagon the CIA what's been going on there these new revelations that keep coming out Nick what do you think of them\nThey are absolutely staggering there's no doubt that they have been the biggest thing go wherever they are in the UFO community I think decade I the only story that I think comes\nLife and I would say this is the classification and release of the British Government files but the the revelation that off to decades to know and the U.S government did have a UFO program off to roll and it was run by the ... super secretive defense intelligence\nAgency I'm an Asian feel that the other day and and you're like hey for years they said no no since project to close down and we haven't been doing this the snowy ... or no investigations and of course\nThey were and that's what I really focused on in in the new film aliens at the end again to try to train angle the numerous threat to the story and there are numerous threats I mean we've we've seen the videos we've seen the talk\nOf mistreatment both the all the different players involved and maybe we'll get into some of this that Robert Bigelow a Senator Harry Reid charmed along I mean you couldn't make this stuff up\nNo you you can't make it up and how do you track all this stuff ... because it's coming from all different directions these days\nI think the answer to that one is it's very cautiously and very carefully and and absolutely in meticulous detail because I think the problem with the story in one sense for years\nPeople have said the problem is that particularly with the ... we have two little information about what's going on with the eight story with with these revelations we must have too much information and I think the public\nI mean it it's just about a case for the deep specialists or is it difficult for them but for the public eye I think it's just that confusing mass if you think back to when the New York times\nWhen the landmark story on this on\nSixteen last year and then the the three videos came out to dinner\nAnd a third one but now the public have been absolutely compounded thinking yeah well this the videos and then there's this guy and then this millionaire businessman and and the struggling to see how it all fits together and say that\nThat's what I've tried to do to take that back\nAnd and give people an overview of this\nFrom my incite a perspective of having run a similar program in the u._k.\nTold me a little bit more about the film we're getting a lot into it of course tonight it leans at the Pentagon but tell us specifically you bought your rural\nWell I took a look on on on that one and it was quite a ... for me usually I I ... it in the interview seat and then you're done\nIt is of course civilian time yourself you know you sit in the ... said a direct to kind of talks to you and you spend a couple of hours and and also the question is when you see the final product sometimes you think well well you know I've\nGot edited down to a few soundbites and I wish they'd put it in and I wish they'd taken it out and gosh I'm not sure I Would have told the story like that\nSo alien to the Pentagon and what I did this I teamed up with Warren ... from reality films and we essentially I had the the idea that I Would script that thing so I scripted the entire movie ... the I ... a million and a half thousand would I think he was\nScript for this and and so in that way I have absolute control of this\nAnd then literally I went into a recording studio you padded walls and headphones on and I knew right to the whole thing and and then I sat down in front of a camera and did did parts of it too to Cameron in that way\nIn that way although there is a director who's done a brilliant job of putting it all together um micro loan I but I was very much in the driving see having done the script and and then ... than\nWhen we look at the final pro dog no one can well I Can't say gosh this this somehow didn't turn out the way I wanted it because I had my fingerprints on it\nFrom from start to finish and that's a departure from a day to completely new role to me I I there are people of course who are used to this sort of thing or people like Jeremy coal bellicose just made a\nA a great movie but um you know I I it was a departure for may so to me to some interesting new territory\nWhat are you hoping to accomplish\n[noise] firstly I as I say really to try to go through some of the the confusion about what's been going on and just tell the complete story from from start to finish but another thing that I've I've tried to do this\nI think we've probably discussed this before but one of the big problems I think that that this field has is\nIt we know young people are interested in in the subject but they don't go to many conferences and and you know it is difficult to engage with them so by putting this out as video on demand we go on to the platforms that the young people\nNeed to watch these things on when they stream as many people do these days\nSo it's on Amazon and iTunes and Google Play and food do and video and all those\nSorts of things so that the the aim was to take this subject not not just to the conventional UFO conference crowd but but too young to get people and and another thing is\nYou know it's been a year since ... had his press conference where he\nGot together with the to the stars people um and it's been nearly a year of course since the New York times\nWhen the story I I did ... uh you know in some ways the story I think has pulled down a little bit so we'd aliens at the Pentagon I wanted to reignite this and put it back where it absolutely belongs center stage and under the spotlight\nAnd how is this organization nowadays like like you said I I'm beginning to feel as if the momentum is waning what do you think\nThat when when you said the organization M E T right\nYes um well that's a very interesting question and the answer is no one knows because in in all of this\nThe U.S government has said well he always says in the ... situations only as little as possible and we we really have very few pieces of the puzzle\nFrom the government itself which is is pretty much profit because we don't frankly we don't even know whether a chip is still an ongoing project\nI think people like Lou Elizondo ran it of course say yes it is it still has its mission it's still continues he of course all though he's resigned from the Pentagon and still has has a lot of contacts and friends that he\nHe says it's still going now other people I think have disputed that and certainly we have been told that the\nSay that they don't they don't believe in extraterrestrials but they believe these things that the money well it's just in one sense it's swapping one arguably fringe belief for another so we'll at least by these people when skeptics told they will\nBelieve this but they would you believe us in some some great Warren having with angels and demons\nNick we're going to take a break we'll come back in ... more right here on the coast to coast or you\nKnow you can show up dates with other coups wins would

another\nPoint if this congressional interest which we know Israel\nEvolved into formal congressional hearings the\nQuestion arises well where should those hearings the as I say should they should they sit in the armed Services Committee or in the the space subcommittee or the the science technology and space\nMain committee I think I think he will be difficult to get it away from the middle of

different locations around the world if that's about all coming from one place\nBut there are centralized system of course so the fact that this was a global outage suggests that there was some kind
