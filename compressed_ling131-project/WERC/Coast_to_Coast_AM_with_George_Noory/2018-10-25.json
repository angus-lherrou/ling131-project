I like to say that I'm as you I Am a citizen\nOf history and history she clearly shows that a civil war shakes around fifty\nYears when it happens most people don't realize that they're already in the civil war\nDrew ... when they go back and look at the things that have happened in the recent past they they immediately think that you know we are in a civil war\nEspecially when they're young something like ... symmetrical warfare an ideological warfare people tend to think it has to be always an armed conflict that's why the guys with what's the definition of war and I says well\nIt's an armed conflict civil wars on the other hand are are armed at times and at times they're not armed sometimes their ideological wars sometimes their spiritual wars sometimes there are warring factions with in certain groups where there'd be right or left\nHow many faction of groups that we heard the KKK the Nazis the communist or I could go down the list of black lives matter meat too\nI mean just go down the list of all of the factions are at war with each other right now none of them pulling guns on people but yet we have somebody who ideologically disagrees with Hillary Clinton the Obamas\nAnd the Democrats and they send a pipe bomb whether it be someone who is deliberately doing it to prove a point or at least create a false flag attack\nOr if it's someone on the ... on the right doing it to ... out of a left\nBut no one has even brought up the shootings of the congressman there not bringing up the other of a rice and that was bailed out in the rice and it was about to President Trump this is certainly one sided and it's there just to basically harden the resolve of the persecution complex to the left it's obviously that obviously this is what is happening\nOr a yes or am I still on yeah go ahead okay I'd also like to say that um I Believe that was Mark Twain said a patriot as one who is scorned at first but when others join him it cost them nothing\nAnd I believe firmly that that might be Donald Trump\nIt might be and it might not be a history will have to decide that they'll have to say that history decides everything there the last say Brighton,

the show for\nWith the food the original\nBut I can tell you this I Want to get to the bottom and I want to hear what the authorities have to say about this\nAnd I don't want to jump to conclusions because it could be a left wing conspirator doing this to try to make Republicans look bad but on the surface it looks like and I know everybody's saying you know Trump and his rhetoric has made\nYou know things ... he's created an environment so somebody would be induced to do this you don't know that you don't know that we need to wait and\nGet the official verdict from our authorities in intelligence communities in the United states and then the American people can chew on it but bottom line you and me both know that the rhetoric in this country\nI'm Talking about the grass roots level I'm not talking about leadership because these guys have always been you know at one and the other's throats\nBut we have to understand that at the grassroots level America is best when we can debate ideas vigorously debate these ideas\nAnd then you know come up with a viable solution to whatever problem that we're facing to try to assassinate\nFormer presidents and leaders in government is not the way to solve this problem and whoever did that whoever did it they are not\nFitting in this country they're hurting the United states of America and George I'm so glad you guys let me way on that weigh in on this because I Love my country I Love it with all my heart I told you once on this air that would get my life for the United states of America and I and I will but George\nThis right here it's got to come to win and hopefully this a wake up call for all of us for all of us to realize that if you're a Republican don't look at a Democrat is your enemy if you're a Democrat don't look at the Republican as your enemy as an opponent yes but not an enemy\nWe're all on the same team and the media\nNot not coast to coast [laughter] but the media has definitely because George you giving everybody a platform you giving everybody a platform and you've been reasonable you've been honest I've heard your commercials saying listen you know just because I let a person to say what he wants to say don't think that I'm On one side or the other\nAnd that's a proper and healthy way to look at it but George\nThe media has exacerbated this problem I Do believe that the media bears as you know a little culpability in this we've got to stop demonizing\nAnd looking at one another as we are enemies were all on the same team the only people that are clapping and I are our adversaries overseas\nAnd build on and the individual or the group that sent these packages exactly George\nTed Kaczynski the Unabomber killed three people injured twenty three others he was caught because his manifesto was publicly let go in his brother recognized it as Ted Kaczynski and turned them into the FBI\nAre we going to happen hopefully some kind of a person because I'm convinced Andre that one person always tells another person somebody knows something about who sent these packages out maybe they'll go to the public if\nThis is a conspiracy I don't think that this conspiracy will hold wax too much longer you cannot have a conspiracy like this and everybody keep their ... their mouth shut\nI think that if this is a conspiracy we will get a resolution to this we'll find out the truth a whole lot faster than if this is one lone but I Am convinced\nAnd our law enforcement uh individuals and are individuals in institutions and in the intelligence community entire US intelligence apparatus they will get to the bottom of this and who ever did this\nWhether somebody on the left or to somebody on the right because I Will say again I Will say again 'cause I Know you've got people on the right thing this could be a false flag it'd\nBe somebody on the left that did this and you got most of the media saying that President Trump still this weight shut up wait let the intelligence officials do their jobs then wants their job is completed and they've determined who'd done this\nThen we can begin as a nation to try to put the pieces back together and come together as one country we are the United states of America\nYou know every group has you know had their time to be stepped on that's just the weight empires are established and America is an empire and people are going to get stepped on but you have to wait\nAnd do things proper in order I'm thinking about the Tuskegee Airman right now who President Roosevelt said well they can't fly on a piece of it'd be one less thing but they flew it and they flew it most six more successfully and they protected more bombers than anybody in front\nOf they sure did it in in ... in when they landed white pilots went up to them and hugged him\nExactly George exactly you know we all want to contribute to the greatness of America and we're on a good path right now let this path continue unless stop this rhetoric\nThat drives us apart and and I'm not talking about Trump I'm Talking about individuals the guy at a gas station your best friend the guy who you talk to on the phone you know stop it realize we're all in the same boat together we're all Americans\nAll right bye ... teams or we will talk this week\nAnd see the rest of the story unfold hopefully Saudi Arabia's crown prince Mohammed bin Salman as described the killing of ... is a heinous crime in his first comments and some of his closest aides were implicated in the Saudi journalist death\nSpeaking at an investor conference in Riyadh that has been overshadowed by this crisis been sold them and said that those responsible for the killing would be brought to justice\nFacebook could collapse of the keys being dogged by scandals or misinformation and election hacking says the author of the twenty ... book on the company David Kirkpatrick says advertisers\nCould start showing the platform if scandals don't stop after years seemingly endless controversy over misinformation privacy and fake news\nListen to this new development and fiber optics\nCould make Internet speeds up to a hundred times faster my detecting light that has been twisted into a spiral\nThe research published in the journal nature communications can be used that easily upgrade existing networks and significantly boost sufficiency let's check in with our expert Warren Weinstein on the Internet boy this would be amazing born\nBefore I comment on that I I like to make a technical comment on the fence today um I Would I Would estimate that the probability of this being tracked down to either the perpetrator or perpetrators as a very short period of time as as being very very high\nUm for purely technical reasons I mean these are all unexploded devices that\nMeans all kind of trace evidence is available for them and they're all they've all gone are all going to the FBI the UN at some of them were sent through the regular mail through us PS\nAnd then I just wanted to know if they're from one city one location or a number of different cities\nThey probably have that all figured out already the entire ah UFP of network is highly computerized they have photos of the packages as they cross through the sorting\nThey got pictures of the person if he delivered it to the post office cameras at\nThe post offices ... I mean this is the kind of thing where where if you wanted to have the best possible evidence it's almost as if someone wants to be caught so I I think probably within a day or two days or certainly in a short period of time we're going to find out who is behind this and then some of these questions are are going to start to be possible\nAnd we just got about a minute left the optics story really like\nI I mean this is mostly a a you know it kind of future kind of issue with it more\nIt's more involving a communications rather than individuals I think the question always comes up when you when we talk about higher speed Internet is are we going to be able to afford it or they are you going to raise the bad with cup enough so that we won't use up our whole oh occasion for the month in in two minutes\nAnd where it's going to go because right now the ISPs have come to a high speed a new system in the high rent urban areas they haven't shown a lot of interest and putting them into rural areas so there's the question to are we ever going to actually see it where you live\nOr die from Lauren thank you so much will be in touch with you this week as well while a lottery ticket holder in South Carolina his scoop the largest jak bought in us history\nMega millions confirmed that was one winner for the one point six billion dollars\nLet's see how the the he's probably obviously meeting with his lawyer on accountants or she is and will figure out what's going on in a moment we'll be talking about dark forces demons with a which that's right next on coast to coast they um [noise]\n\nIf you've ever experienced heart racing shortness of breath or dizziness it's possible you could out of the ... one of the leading causes of stroke mind out before we're dealing with cardio\nThe FDA cleared personal EKG divide that just Ninety nine dollars to order the Amazon dot com and type ... that the Amazon dot com and type ... cardio mobile and in your pocket you can take it EKG anytime anywhere right when you deal with them going\nCardio mobile delivers a medical greedy cagey right to your smartphone to just thirty seconds you know if your heart rhythm normal for the atrium relation is detected water cardio mobile today for just Ninety nine dollars [noise] there's an Amazon dot com type party a mobile\nIt just like Clint loop so my first reaction was to pray the Lord's Prayer out loud and it didn't work so I you know after a few words my job locked and I felt like I had something shut into my now ...\nWith us sicker Russia will come back and talk about the ... in just a moment of coast to coast to\nCoast insiders the new version of the\nCoast to coast am app is now available for I don't know Android for dot on a boat listen live on demand anywhere any time go to ... dot com and downloaded today\nNo dog in\nThe\n\n\nNews radio nine sixty W.

lengthy um I can give you um information on how to do a house exercises um now what kind of the earth I mean are they pulling your covers [laughter] what do you wake up in the morning or how how serious already\nWhat's happening there it's like it's like I'm I wake up in the night and like you know we're talking and then when I go like in the closet no one's okay so you probably have ... what is known as the called an earth downstairs so it can be someone\nSounds like a mischievous spirit [laughter]\nIt's probably not like a theme and it's just that maybe someone who lived there before and they passed on but they haven't really passed\nAnd is it possible with her so that you cannot get rid of a certain spirit that uh just lingers forever\nWell it depends I think off the air it you can get rid of them because you can paint them as well so what happened in that case and that's a very good question Josh I'm Glad you after and there are some black magicians who will send an earth\nDown and what do you mean by black magicians I'm very much for rent on edition or a girl that\nI Know sorry clarify a magician\nAnd it can actually send you an earth down there and what they do is they will go and I'm looking for spirit at the cemetery ... who have crossed over and they will\nMake the calls just Garret who are very disgruntled either killed someone or they raped someone and then they're willing to do their bidding and so they can send us your tail\nAnd that happens actually quite frequent\nAre they under the control of loose supper Satan [noise]\nThe dark lord

Stanford shows that\nMay be the issue how some people see themselves when it comes to mathematics researchers say there is a connection between kids mindsets in learning outcomes when students struggling class we think it means they don't have a map\nBrain ... might give up the team recruited a thousand students and schools and tell us\n... fire archive of thirty for thirty\nDoing a show once in a while that was a little different so we can have some fun with it and we came up with the idea of who's behind the secret doors senior producer Tom down eyes or has been picking some guess how do you select who I'm going to try to guess who they might be the nighttime\nUh I picked people that the audience will know in that you will know because the whole idea of the shows to have fun is in this particular door show is to have fun and people know who they are but the best part is when they try to trick you aren't really creative\nI remember when the late Roger leader came on and uh I

were retiring no way right\nUh well I Am sort of retiring I I'm a much wider scheduled for the first time in ten years I have no engagement and this January November and December that believe it too much about going anywhere\nAgainst my nature [laughter]\nWell I tell you we love your stand that I got to tell everybody who might be brand new to the program when I was a Twenty one year old reporter\nIn Detroit Michigan my very first interview was with a fellow named stamped and Friedman I saw a little clip being in the Detroit News that he was going to be speaking before a group\nOr at Oakland University and I told my news director I Want to go out there and interviewed this guy who's you know you know nuclear physicists expert in UFOs and my news\nJust said I'm not paying for this this is not going to be an overtime for this you want to go out there and interview this guy you do it on your own time so I took my tape recorder out I went to interview stance and Friedman had a great interview and I've known him ever since then when I eventually\nMatured and did my night talk show in St Louis who's the gas and then when I replaced art on coast to coast stance was a staple of the program anyways and we continued and he's been at some libel dense with me I think I'm going to be with you at alien fest the end of January up near the big beer\nAnd I think so at least that's what the plans were assuming there is no getting away you know [laughter]\nSo they just stand telling me telling me what's going on in the field have you followed these days I mean you you were out there way in the beginning telling people about you ... talking about the Benny and Barney he'll case you've got books out\nWhat's the latest based on your work your research [noise]\nWell I think there's been a much wider except I think the biggest thing that's happened as we've come to realize that our vision of the world was not quite right\nWhen Frank Drake talked about there might be aliens out there you said there might be eight thousand places in the galaxy or are they going to be sending a signal\nWell the latest word against it looks like there was about one point six climates per star not bring galaxy star\nAnd our galaxy the Milky Way has ... billion stars all that means one hundred and sixty billion on it so they're all over the place\nAnd you know and that changes our picture we used to think ah we're pretty special you know there's only a few civilization ... around and we're at the top of the heap well\nOver the place and that changed our perception of how important we are of course we're not the most important things around because we haven't been around very long and it leaves plenty of room\nIn other words for others and we've come to realize that you know you get in here from ... not quite the big deal we used to think it was a hell of a primary comes from doing things differently\nSo the notion that uh you know it's going to take a very long time many years to get between stars and can't be much crepes and back and forth now we realize I look we're fusion for example or you can get\n... hours we also realize that the country a sixteen

don't know that we need to wait\nAnd get the official verdict\nFrom our authorities intelligence communities in the United states and then the American people can chew on it but bottom line you and me both know that the rhetoric in this country I'm Talking about the grass roots level I'm not talking about leadership because these guys have always been you know at one another stroked\nBut we have to understand that at the grassroots level America is best when we can debate ideas vigorously debate these ideas\nAnd then you know come up with a viable solution to whatever problem that we're facing

coast to coast [laughter] but the media has definitely because George you giving everybody a platform you're giving everybody a platform and you've been reasonable you bid on it I've heard your commercials saying listen you know just because I let a person to say what he wants to say don't think that I'm On one side or the other\nAnd that's the proper and healthy way to look at it but George\nThe media has exacerbated this problem I Do believe that the media bears as you know a little culpability and as we got to stop demonizing\nAnd looking at one another as we are enemies were all on the same team the only people that are clapping and I are our adversaries overseas\nAnd those on and the individual or the group that sent these packages exactly George\nTed Kaczynski the Unabomber killed three people injured twenty three others he was caught because his manifesto was publicly let go in his brother recognized it as Ted Kaczynski and turned them into the FBI\nAre we going to happen hopefully some kind of a person because I'm convinced Andre that one person always tells another person somebody knows something about who sent these packages out maybe they'll go to the public eye to eye\nSpirit the I don't think that this conspiracy will hold wax too much longer you cannot have a conspiracy like this and everybody keeps keeps their mouth shut\nI think that if this is a conspiracy we will get a resolution to this we'll find out the truth a whole lot faster than if this is one lone but I Am convinced\nThat our law enforcement uh individuals and are individuals and institutions and in the intelligence community entire US intelligence apparatus they will get to the bottom of this and it won't ever did this\nWhether somebody on the left or to somebody on the right because I Will say again I Will say again 'cause I Know you've got people on the right thing this could be a false flag it'd be somebody on the left that did this\nAnd you got most of the media thing that President Trump still this weight shut out wait let the intelligence officials do their jobs then wants their job is completed and they've determined who've done this\nThen we can begin as a nation to try to put the pieces back together and come together as one country we are the United states of America\nYou know every group has you know had their time to be stepped on that's just the way empires ours tablets and America is an empire and people are going to get stuff done but you have to wait\nAnd do things proper in order I'm thinking about the Tuskegee Airman right now who President Roosevelt said well they can't fly on a piece for the one less thing but they flew it and they put most ... more successfully and they protected more bombers than anybody in front\nOf they sure did in ... in when they landed white pilots went up to them and hugged him\nExactly George exactly you know we all want to contribute to the greatness of America and we're on a good path right now let this path continue unless stop this rhetoric\nThat drives us apart and and I'm not talking about Trump I'm Talking about individuals the guy at a gas station your
