you're settling with an education or see [noise]\nThis is a perfect example what I'm Talking about here you have a guy who writes for the Washington Post Eugene Scott he he tweeted out to politifact today\nAre are white males responsible for more mass shootings in any other group you hear this and and white males they also associate with the right even though there have been a whole bunch of mass\nShooters who are white males that were if anything political leftist but you know that this is this is what do you often hear I mean this is the story line this is the way that\nThey will they'll talk about all this um and\nYet when you start to break this down and say OK okay well let's take this guy the Washington Post ... let's let's think about this let's say white males are the majority of shooters in this kind of ... in this country um turns out that's not true\nTurns out actually mass shootings are essentially line up with what you would expect in terms of demographic representation of for all the different\nEthnic groups in this country but uh your ears would you find out they've never mass shootings but I'm an\nOverall violence overall violence now you get into a whole other\nConversation about some communities have a much higher rate of violence in other communities but for mass shootings it's it's pretty evenly distributed um but Ninety five percent of shooters plus I mean probably more like Ninety seven Ninety eight percent of shooters might be Ninety nine or male so as a\nRiver we're being told white males or the bad guys that we have to be worried about their the terrorists they're the real threat I'm Don Lemon says that's what that other guy was a radio show I've never heard of jazz Ninety nine percent of shooters our our mail in this country\nThe country's also Seventy percent white so if if let's say Ninety nine percent of shooters are male and a country is Seventy percent white but\nOnly fifty four percent of mass shooters are white then that means that there's a disproportionate representation\nOf other groups that are not away their shoes so so what point do people at the Washington Post and other places think they're really making about this I mean what does remember I said it pretty evenly distributed but there's actually some\nThe outlier here is not that there are so many a white mass shooters in the country\nSo why are they pointing to that I mean I don't think they really want to go down this road I also think that looking at ethnicity and when it comes to mass shootings is is a an irrelevant in and really pointless exercise a button ... flights to do this because I think of us all based upon our\nOr ethnicity as as a as an essential part of identity or whether we agree with that or or not\nUm [noise] then you get the terrorism side as an officer to make this brief\nAh that that the G George mafia are of more on from Charlottesville is talked about so much in the media it just goes to show you that they can't find wherever the worst is these white nationalist I'm always hearing about I'm not saying they don't exist and say how many are there really\nVery very few and to refer to that as a rise of of real terrorism in the country and that's the biggest terrorist threat and people like that or people like this pipe bomber guy uh we don't have the TSA because of the pipe bomb or we don't have the national\nCounterterrorism center\nAnd the multibillion now going on trillions of dollars are spent on a security apparatus for this country of all kinds because we're worried about right wing\nNationalist terrorism we have it because of Islamic radicalism All right let's be in the post nine eleven security apparatus we have is specifically designed to deal with the threat of radical Islam\nAnd I know that right now we're in a little bit of a low the terms of radical Islamic you know knock on wood radical Islamic attacks in the United states but that doesn't mean that that's not the primary threat and people who say this garbage\nAbout how the real concern the real terrorists threat the real threat of extremist violence comes from white nationalist or are\nBeing disingenuous and they don't know what they're talking about I Know that there are major a major\nDepartments and agencies that yes they they do have a they do have you know some entities that deal with you know radical\nA neo Nazis and things like that they have very very little work to do day in and day out folks\nCounterterrorism that's assigned to a you know air condition right wing nationalist and stuff they're\nInsanity that that I'm Talking about so proof it is just it is just wild just while to see this happening and you know then there's also what I see from our own side\nAnd you know I've very frustrated with us today but not not surprising at all [noise]\nYou know I Know he's not running anymore but you'd think that after all the time it's been a concern circle here's here's Paul Ryan not a constitutional scholar not a lawyer\nBut then again neither am I but I seem to know more about this and Paul Ryan among many other things in a more about the Paul Ryan a but here's what he says that the fourteenth amendment just one this is\nA very clear political and yes partisan issue right before the election we can count on on on Paul Ryan speaker of the house to come forward and this is what he does play\nYou cannot and ship with an executive order we didn't\nLike it when Obama tried changing immigration laws ... current and following the plain text of the constitution and I think in this case the fourteenth amendment pretty clear [noise]\nUm and that would involve a very very lengthy constitutional process where we obviously totally agree with President is getting at the root issue here which is on track illegal immigration\nA [noise]\nThe fourteenth amendment is not clear in that the language when you look at the language leaves open room right\nSubject to the jurisdiction thereof as we've been discussing if your subject to a four and ... if a foreign country can say hand that then that guy back over to us and we go okay he's yours\nWhich which jurisdictions you really subjective I mean this is where you started\nTo get it okay hold on a second and and also you know as an American when you're traveling in a foreign country if you're an American or you're traveling in France and and you're like a I don't want to pay any more American taxes\nWould you have to do when you live abroad by the way we do that in this country they don't do it in many other countries are ... and you say well I'm only subject of French jurisdiction now because I'm an French ... a French French joy all\nFrench soil ah I'm always subject to do their jurisdiction we'll say none of your subject or jurisdiction so you're an American citizen I saw a jurisdiction has not just about geography and that's where this gets ... that's what this gets more complicated and there are instances already where\nYou could be born on us soil and you could even be are legally but you would not be a citizen\nRight in the case of the sons of indoors diplomats who were born here they maintain their own nationality their own citizenship so that's\nA place where there's no clarity it off the courts and just for Paul Ryan to pretend that he's opposed illegal immigration when he's pro DACA he's ... this huge huge increases in guest worker programs and has just been so wimpy end immigration for so long and for him when he's not running again to\nCome out now and say this and just get a kick in the ... to the geo piece side I got to say I was I was pleased that at least at least Trump was was willing to call him out on this one I mean it was good to see\nThat are here you go Paul Ryan is from Donald Trump quote Paul Ryan she'll be focusing on holding the majority rather than getting his opinions about birthright citizenship something he knows nothing about our new Republican majority will work on this closing immigration loopholes and securing our border\nPresident Trump is completely right I'm Paul right look it's one thing that ... to come out and say look there's there's a lack of clarity on this and you know we had the courts need to take this up and it it is an important issue but that's not what he said he said you know it's pretty obvious that the left is right here but yeah that's right we want people to show up and\nGo and stay in maternity hotel or whatever it's called birth hotels whatever that is when you show up and have a baby when you're a foreigner and the whole point is to get them citizenship\nHere and you know birth tourism\n... that's clearly not with all that but you know Ryan just can't help themselves I he's the guy who clearly has all oh gee shocks\nI I think he is much more about Paul Ryan than he is about the party dare I say\nAnd and that brings it back to how I don't accept this separation of party and country because I think that the Republican Party has better for the country therefore I support the Republican Party\nIt's eight other bringing back to that formulation for a moment and then I just have one other thing here for you I Want you to hear this is Joe Donnelly who's\nA who's running in the Indiana representative a or in the U.S senator other Joe Donnelly\nHere's

shocked the many highly rated term life insurance companies we represent\nOr a blue dog Democrat and a gun toting Democrat and all this stuff but at the other day they disappoint because they're really it's a much more left wing party than they're willing to say say openly and honestly\nThe Democrats are now led by people on the left I mean when I say let I don't just mean their leadership in elected office I just mean\nThe ideology of the modern Democratic Party has gone much further to the left then people are in the Democratic party are are willing to be honest about 'em and that's why I think we have such a\nSo much just not disagreement at this point but it's like we see the world and these completely different terms what's because\nFrom dealing with a bunch of cause economies who don't pay any attention to history and think capitalism is bad I think that the government's always good the bigger the government the better and you know white males or an oppressive terrible force

the first places because Democrats have failed to come to the table staff failed to work with this president and pass legislation that helps protect our country that helps protect the citizens of America because they did not want to secure our borders they do not want to have a law and order our country\nAnd the reason that we're in this predicament if the Democrats in Congress had failed to do their jobs and the president's going to look at any way possible that he can find a legally unconstitutionally\nAnd to make sure that we're doing everything we can\nListen in a long standing debate there's good faith arguments on both sides so natural reading of this amendment which seemed to support unlimited birthright citizenship but the history\nThe tax some of the draft ... tend to go the other way and courts view clauses like misses having meaning they don't trust us dispensed them you can make a disease can certainly make a good faith arguments and it limits birth racism birthright citizenship\nYeah you can\nFew points here first of all the ... weather or the Democrats they can't have it both ways that can't be the law's the law and then being well but we're not going to do in jury and forced bad let's not being mean and what's not separate families and all the rest of the you can't have it together both ways\nAnd they went up it both ways with immigration all the time they want to say they want a strong border but they don't want to enforce the law when it comes to people illegally crossing the border they say they want an orderly immigration system but they don't want to do interior enforcement is that it should be consequences violating the law but they don't want to know when they get prosecuted\n... at home or anything else right so this is a classic and then with the constitutional aspect you would have to say\nThe only thing that amuses me more than media lives discovering the constitution is written media lips discovered the Bible you know and you know that's when all of a sudden you hear Corinthians to to [laughter] you're like wait what what are they talking about\nUh so I I I Love the I Love the\nPut songs I'm going to read you now from the book of poems\nLet's say in the ... ah yeah so this is where you see that they they have no actual principle that they are protecting or that there there are trying to Institute here because they're ... they're very literal is in a interpretation of this clause\nLet's understand is it's just not it's not clear what that means and also to take a literal interpretation of the constitution also takes into account what was it meant you mean at the time right this is where a liberal\nDoes go oh the right to bear arms you can have ...\nMillion in Brussels that's why we said arms yes at the time it was an a or Fifteen it was ... but guess what it is arms and that's why it leaves it leaves open for what arms were then what arms are now\nAh and that's why the press the press has any dissemination of information the press is not an actual printing press\nAnd the jurisdiction narrow okay well what does that exactly mean what does that mean\nBased upon the understanding at the time in what they were trying to achieve with this amendment with the fourteenth amendment\nAnd remember that the Obama administration um first of all there's all this there's all this rewriting of history now about what the Democrats have been doing an immigration for the last Twenty years and\nHere's a here's a great example of of of that\nYou have Harry Reid okay this is even before that this was Nineteen Ninety three but this is Harry Reid who was among the most powerful Democrats in the country until recently did what he had to say about illegal aliens play quibbling\nKept making it easy to be an

gotten gains they can try to think of it any other way they want they try to go with other explanations of it but that's just the truth\nAnd you know ... now you have this debate over the fourteenth

who's in media has been getting\nA horrible things centered them said about them death threats all kinds of and some of them actually get assaulted and attacked\nI can think of prominent conservatives being physically assaulted in the you know Ann Coulter was with the tax giving a speech once on camera you know people have actually been ... doesn't happen lives lives don't get it can deliver lives when they're giving speeches don't get attacked\nIt's just not the same and it's not the same mentality out there right now you know the Trump people see this is really the difference that I Know they're gonna say oh but what about the Trump supporter you're the guy was the media and their maniacs can support and you know anyone or anything\nBut I mean we hear very little about the family Research Council shooter for example but he was all about you know the MSNBC talking points\nAnd and one that you wanted to kill people who were pro life and and pro traditional family oh you know how a lot of you're probably the buck would even talking about if you go and do a you know do a quick Google Search on\nThat you'll be like wow this guy was a left wing terrorist but no one ever refers to him that way he was that's what he was he was he left for any and he actually ... so\nIt wasn't it wasn't just an attempted something or it wasn't just sending in threats he actually took the kind of like the Bernie Sanders shooter who\nDidn't try to show up at a baseball field but got caught on my way or something got there and shot people and almost killed them very nearly killed these ... so but Stewart understands this this dynamic and now now look I Am a big critic\nOf the whole John Stewart clown nose on clown nose off thing it's like you know like I don't do it I'm all funny Hong Kong and then\nOh well now let me lecture you all on the constitution in my Christiana mom poorer impression voice it's like no\nIf you want to engage in political issues you have to do and you have to be willing to defend them as as a serious person and not hide behind oh man I just have are just have the puppy it's going to ...\nWhy show beforehand you know it's all just a big joke man that's dishonest and Stuart's done lots of that you know show is all jokes and then he has on a serious guest and if it's a conservative he tries to drill them and if it's a a liberal it's all a joke joke the rights so dumb ha ha\nAnd that was what he did I mean he really just took what you already have in mainstream media a step further\nThe mainstream media is an echo chamber for left wing beliefs in ideology and what it does is create a forum and this is whether you're reading the pages of the New York times or watching CNN we're liberal ideas when that's\nThe whole point that's the whole purpose yes they give you information you know yes there is reporting all others reporting and\nYou know breaking news and all this\nBut the live idea always comes out on top\nAnd that's the last what those\nOutlets do to really serve their audiences and have a loyal audience because people want that they want to believe that want to believe that their side is\nIs is winning but the way that the left does it as dishonest they don't say we're labs your idea they say this is just reality this is just the truth\nAnd that's why I say that CNN for example long ... liberalism through a false prism of neutrality and that's\nThe secret sauce behind what the mainstream media in particular has been doing for a very long time oh no we're not liberal we're just we're just the facts man CNN apple and banana\nSlogan no that's nonsense they should just say yeah we're we're in a package of the DNC we believe in the Democratic party we're going to bring your news but we're going to give it to you for a Democrat perspective that would be honest instead of liars they're liars\nTapper liar\nBlitzer liar I mean what they're doing is they live on a regular basis Cooper all around all of them I mean Don Lemon and like all other that's a whole other level but\nYou know he's right about that the stewards right about the narcissism point and it's so clear and quite honestly I think it's pretty obvious I don't think the steward has come upon some bit of brilliance ear yeah the ... is what the narcissism is what the\nTrump taps into of because look he understands people with big egos Trump is a very very big ego and we I don't think we have to dance around that Trump is a very good testicle guy\nHe's also the leader of the free world and pulled off the most incredible election victory that we will ever see ever there's there's never going to be anything like that they use all the most unbelievable election of your lifetime I saw of my lifetime that's it there's nothing that's ever going to be like that\nBecause even if something else is kind of like in the future will be like well remember that time when Trump did that thing that nobody believes that happened\nSo I think the guy is kind of earn the right to have a bit of a you know you got to earn your ego I think that's an important thing for everyone to remember\nAnd then you know be humble too but that's one part that I don't think we're going to too much from a for Trump but otherwise she understands people's oversized egos and and this is where the media just really has no they have no response whatsoever there's there's nothing that they can come up with\nAs an answer because it's so once you get older you go oh yeah that's right\nWhy is everyone else press briefing about Jim Acosta\nWires every a criticism of CNN by
