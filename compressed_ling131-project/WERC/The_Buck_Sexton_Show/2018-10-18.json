Sorry what did that come from one more time job\nAnd I tried that and signed on junior said this clean white man had a lot to fear right now\nI play the audio for you guys did did they say anything about white men\nNope they did not\nWhat do they do here oh that's right they manufactured a pretext to of course get there\nIn all oh my gosh you know Trump and racism and go for the most sensitive

network was arrested and charged with disclosing banks suspicious activity reports tied Jew who wants to guess what investigation who wants to get us the Russia investigation what a shock\nSo\nHere's somebody who is a government employee who thought you know what I'll do to try to jam up somebody in Trump's orbit I've read today that they think it was about Michael Cohen's finances they had the wrong Michael\nCohen though there's more than one a and released this information to is believed buzzfeed news and bus we of course then there's this whole story now that's not confirmed yet but that is what I've read they think happens here I'm so quote\nThe criminal complaint against ms Edwards alleged that she leaked materials that led to about a dozen articles in twenty Seventeen and twenty Eighteen pertaining to among other people in matters Paul Manafort Richard Gates Maria Butina the Russian ambassador in Washington a unit of pressures on holding a Russian company entangled any money laundering case\nBuzzfeed reporter who isn't I okay it is a budget isn't identified the charges is Jason Leopold who was listed as an author on all twelve articles sided in the complaint\nSo here's a woman who is taking\nFinancial remember these are folks this is not reports about crimes did you say is these are suspicious activity reports this is the equivalent of releasing raw FBI background investigation and then using it for a report oh you mean look kind of like the stuff you might get for the ...\nBut this is highly confidential legally\nProtected for good reason because you can destroy someone's business with this oh yeah you're so and so it's got a few a few suspicious financial transactions you know what that means nothing it means the government flags it\nAnd then they might look into it a little bit it does not mean that anyone has broken the law in fact the vast majority of them do not involve\nLaw breaking but here's somebody who forty year old woman\nThought that she would leak this information to the press to hurt Trump and his associates that she would break her oath\nThat you would violate the law and ruined her career and now I now probably her\nLife along with it because it was justice at important to try to get Trump\nDo you remember anybody during the Obama years from the federal government who was ... it ... to go after Obama and hurt Obama do you remember anyone who was leaking classified information or sensitive information about individuals and businesses right\nThis is stuff since then report just brought on on anybody this isn't even intelligence world stuff is there are there can be a suspicious financial transaction just because you put a thousand dollars in cash in the bank you know maybe a lot of banks sale\n\nThat's why they keep this stuff so close hold that's also why the IRS actually tries to protect people's information because they understand that if ... if it gets out there it can do a lot of damage that people's reputations will be harmed\nBy this so you have to wonder how many other\nFederal government employees were willing to break the law and share information with the left wing press to embarrass the administration members there was ... from what I understand\nThere was nothing in any of this that tied to Trump was just people around him understand this though it sends a message\nSends a very clear message if you worked for Trump if you work with Trump\nYou could be the subject of this kind of government active is somebody within the bowels of the bureaucracy with high levels sensitive access could decide to release information about you too I'm not saying that will happen to you but now it's something you have to think about isn't it\nAnd it's not just people that have worked for Trump how vocal you're going to be in your support for Trump how willing or you to stand up publicly and say this and then what is the cost that you would encourage you'd be willing to incur in order to continue speaking yeah\nThey are waging a form of psychological warfare with these kinds of activities\nOh just this one oh how about the guy who ... a bunch of ... a Republican members of Congress who worked in the Congress but all their private information out there that's the kind of stuff that makes Senator Rand Paul's wife sleep with a loaded gun under her bed now\nThis isn't a one off

I mean that's what happened\nSo we're we're going to hear from the people that are okay with that about how Trump isn't able to do this but it's just so typical isn't it it's just so\nStandard operating procedure from the left and I got I got to ask Dr Gorka today Sebastian Gorka was on was on rising demand got ask them and say you know hold on a second um what do you say doctor gee I'd like to um ... good guy what do you see that the people that are always talking about Trump is too cozy with dictators\nYou just look at the actions look what he does I mean you know Trump has his way of trying to in gray sheet him so he's trying to do his own high level diplomacy with these foreign heads of state and this whole standard that they set up is nonsense a standard that you know Trump path to talk or you know\nSuper aggressively to tell everybody and he needs to hold to\nThe ... there's just not since this is complete and utter nonsense but\nThis is what they pretend is the new standard under Trump that he that he should go into meetings with food and then Kim Jong un of these others\nAnd essentially spit in their faces and anything short of that show that he's a coward anything short of that shows that he's a bad guy or you know they're they're not operating in good faith and I think that's really essential\nWe can't lose sight of that they they're not criticizing the president because they really want to do something differently it's all just an excuse for Trump rage that hey Trump bad that's what this is whether it's foreign policy the economy immigration

twenty sixteen which was quite a spectacular day in the evening I think we have a lot of enthusiasm and I keep hearing about the enthusiasm to blue wave but I think we have tremendous centers yeah\nI Do think we have a lot of enthusiasm and I spoke to Donald Trump junior yesterday and sure enough\nHe uh he is I I could tell very optimistic about how is looking for the Republicans going into the midterms you know I think that he's I'm really feeling when he's going out there and meeting with all these different people on the campaign trail\nBut you know the this is going to be very close is going to be very very tight indeed and there was one thing that Trump brought up in that same interview a I think it was that same interview that that is really got me\nA concern and it has to do with what happens if the economy takes a nosedive and if if if it's cyclical I don't think that's going to necessarily be on Trump play a clip six\n... or anything in this country or say oh this guy but there's no inflation is very low on tape Powell I think I'm like a week later ...\nIs that because the fed is ranging rate it's just too fast and it's independent so I don't speak\nTo them [laughter] but I'm not happy with what he's doing because it's going too fast because he looked at the last inflation numbers are very low\nThis is going to result in some painful stuff going forward ah this is going to be an issue\nAnd I say this there were people that were writing books right after the crash in two thousand nine saying things like you know this time is a this time is different or how this is a unique and uniquely dangerous moment in our economic history and and there was a there was a real clarity around\nWe're in uncharted territory here starting in two thousand or ... or so\nAnd I think we've been a little complacent for a while now even the debts Twenty one trillion dollars we've reached this point where there's all this prosperity Trump is cutting regulations cut taxes so much good stuff is happening\nAround the country and sure enough\nI'm what I think we're starting to see now is an understanding that there is going to be\nSome rough water that's a very gentle way I think of saying it as a result of unraveling all this all this money we put out in the system all this chewy and these things that have been done last ten years\nTo keep the economy going to try and and do you know Keynesian stimulus and you know you have people like Krugman who are saying oh this stimulus isn't enough right that was the problem them but we spent all this money\nAnd you have an enormous or a series of enormous debt bubbles\nA student loan debt trillion dollars credit card debt trillion dollars auto loans especially subprime auto loans very very high uh we're more indebted now\nThan when we were at the time of crisis in many ways and do you know deeper and deeper in debt we already burned down when it comes to national debt and we haven't really fixed any of this stuff structurally now be impossible for Trump to fix it right away but here's my concern that I'm not\nI cannot do economic prognostications I really can't right that's not something\nThat is in my bailiwick political stuff maybe national security stuff shore but\nHere's where I see there being an issue right now and ... and that's your cue John and uh all these other groups out there the\nFar left wackos\nAre considered very fringe will you'll notice that the the media apparatus in general is very slow to condemn them and generally\nUh does not seek to um you know talk about them any more than they have to and I think it's because they do have a certain ideological\nSolidarity with the right they maybe they don't agree with all of what ... does and all of its rhetoric but they liked it they view themselves as resistance to Trump bright they like it they view themselves as a opposite oppositional and willing to take action\nAbout office and with that uh\nThink we have to remember that they could very quickly become a much bigger part of the political conversation if this is the ... this is what worries me if we have a major economic\nA reset right if the debt turns into a crisis if all of a sudden we we get to the point where the rising interest rates means that we're paying more and more money just because of the money we've already spent my interest payments on the debt start to crowd out the private sector and the and the rest of our economy\nOf a ... of his boss I guess it was Lauren Michael's but it might have been somebody else screams based on quitting on not at all thing and then when he went home and it was over the weekend he realized oh my gosh what am I don't\nI don't have a job a that was a great job I made a terrible mistake and then he didn't know what to do and thought and fall and thought and then he figured he figured you know what\nI think he talked to a friend who told them and do this if I remember the story right which I might be missing some of the details and he just showed up to work on Monday I pretended like nothing had happened\nAnd it worked\nEveryone just acted like he was fine and he just you know they maybe they forgot the milk powder just chose to ignore the whole thing but they wanted him there and he showed up and everyone just went about their business no he said there was not even a conversation about it [noise]\nAh so I think that's what it was one thing she's going to do when it comes running for the presidents I think are approaches hey America let's just pretend that that whole thing\nDidn't happen let's just get past the whole DNA thing and I'm Still your progressive heroine right let let's pretend that that's the case show um that's not going to fly\nAnd we heard there from Debbie White delve a poor echo who is the descendant of the real Pocahontas Pocahontas was a real person it's you know John Smith book honest although I gotta say John I think that the Pocahontas animated Disney film is one of the weaker ones not not good\nCan you seeing with all the colors of the mountain I don't even know what that means right and that was not particularly in tune you get the idea you know what I'm Talking about some of the some of the young ones and they're like yeah I liked Pocahontas but yeah it's fine\nI mean the best\nIs it actually does you know I Know people are going to get married for this one I think you got to figure the best animated Disney movie it's tied for me between a Latin in Lion King I mean their their neck and neck I think those are those are two of the best I'm also\nPartial to beauty and the beast of I Know it's a little more for him to be a little more for the ladies but it's very well done was the first animated film ever nominate for Oscar okay back and focus back to the center of the real Pocahontas or you have it out\nAnd what you saw here was that the left has this whole framework of something that call cultural appropriation right the last has this framework where they will\nSay um you are not allowed to make the cuisine of another of another culture yeah you're not allowed to wear the ah the\nGarb of another culture\nAnd cultural appropriation let me just say is a stupid concept because all culture borrows and steals and it influenced by other cultures all the time in fact if you were to look back at what we consider to be western fashion a lot of the most well known western fashions\nToday come from other parts of the world are ... are from fabrics that we're only possible because of colonialism and I mean there's there's a lot of stuff\nSo I mean you were like oh you mean like Muslim city of Mosul for example a\n... you know getting a pattern from Malaysia getting I mean you think of as a very wide speed northern northeastern American kind of a thing but now that comes from Malaysia ah Sears sucker comes from India you've heard me talk about that before so\nCold culture is always changing and shifting and we should celebrate anything that's good at any culture right is this notion that people have a a particular claim on a culture strikes me as odd to begin with but if you're going to be policing appropriation\nThen for somebody who is as white as Elizabeth Warren\nTo claim that she was a Native American specifically for the benefits they're all but also\nReally to to to have some kind of an identity to make her a more interesting person which I think was all part of this I mean she wrote in she was a fake Cherokee who wrote into a cook book called powwow chow\nAnd stole a recipe from my real French chef and called it a charity recipe so it's a fake charity stealing from a French chef to make a fake Cherokee recipe\nWow\nThat is this is the person who wants to be the next breath the United states by the way you know there are a lot of personal failings there are a lot of things that I think I you know you could point you in any number of people and say you know that I could have made that mistake you know there's there's there's certain things that you can feel a little bit of a personal understanding\nOf it and say you know what that person may be across the line with that or\nThat went bad but\nI can understand how it got there I can understand what the circumstances were that led to it ah being that way I'm pretending or Native American for many many years is not one of them are and and I played\nThat story for yesterday where she talked about her mom and how her mom was dealing with the ... of racism because of her Cherokee family really\nTheir parents were\nOr you know the parents involved here were worried about the grandparents I guess for Elizabeth\nWarren about a maybe eighth ninth tenth generation back Native American ancestor that's a that's pretty crazy that's pretty well but\nCultural appropriation was always destined to collapse under its own stupidity and the moment that it is politically advantageous to less will try it out once again most oh no you can't do that you can't wear that kind of costume oh I saw this stupid\nHulu all these platforms are just overrun by lives can we get some normal people involved oh\nWho will add something about you know this Halloween you don't wear a costume that's offensive to many cultural a culture ancestry or whatever\nOkay so now that means no no no costumes or somebody dressed as a Native American garbage can dress up as Pocahontas you can dress up as any of the foreign Disney Princess is\nA ... and I just wonder you know what but if you're if you're a non white then under liberal rules do you have the right to dress up as anything that's not as any person or you know any entity that non white\nFor a Halloween then so is it really just white people that aren't allowed to dress up in and cultural Garp\nThat's not you know I guess I could wear Viking ... I mean I could wear a Viking thing but I don't know I don't know what the rules are and here's what offer you I don't think the left knows what the rules are either I mean I think that they\nIn general just make it up as they go along and this is just a power trip it's all a powerful member political correctness started out as a means of trying to rebalance power for what they thought were a underrepresented discriminated minorities but with time political correctness is just turn into a weapon\nFor those who want to use those groups\nAnd I'm Talking about white liberals now for their own purposes to use those groups for their own power suppose you appropriation as they stupid term but bottom line here is that if\nWhat Elizabeth Warren did knock cultural appropriation\n[noise] there is no such thing he does not exist even for ... [noise]\nI was visiting with a book about his show on home titled fraud where the retired FBI agent demonstrated a crime dislike everywhere it's called home title fraud\nAnd it's simple because all home titles are kept on line in fact the FBI guy and home title lock found the title to bucks family's home they forged id and showed him how easy it is to transfer title and lose your home had it been real this thief would have taken out loans using books home is equity\nThey wouldn't even have known until late payments were ... notices showed up and then identity theft protection we have it does not cover titled fraud look if you own a home or rentals or have elderly parents get home title lock\nFor pennies a day home title luck puts a virtual barrier around your host titled the instant they detect sinister activity there on it helping to shut it down their homes titled may already be compromise you don't know sign up and get a free titles scan and report\nAs a hundred dollar value free at home title luck dot com home title locked\nYou deserve a better way to watch the sports you love ESPN wants to live for an odd to show for\nWith the original and\nSome people still think an education from northern Virginia community colleges just settling well how about settling for the skills companies need most around here there's a shortage of nurses [noise] computer engineers in cybersecurity experts [noise] guess who's filling these jobs are thirty for thirty\nTelling you we are seeing farming have had on line nine sixty tell you we are C. dot com\nI harsh radio sci fi it's nine o'clock [noise]\nLooking for answers ...

reality of trying to deal with them\nUm and by the way ... essentially endorsing this anything goes at any cost attitude play Thirteen\nThey way they\n[noise] I\nGuess [noise]\nBut I have to have really that\nYou see she's saying and this is part of the disconnect you have from a left she saying on the one hand do you have to do to win big\nRight do whatever you got to do I mean that that's really what follows these views on this do whatever you got to do I just don't want the Republicans with\nAnd then the same time she was saying but I refused to let the Republicans you know she she goes from anything goes just wind power to oh I'm so outraged that how how rough the Republicans play this game this reminds you what we saw after Kavanaugh after the Kavanaugh\nTravesty that was televised for the whole nation is the after all that\nThe Democrats didn't take a step back and say you know maybe we shouldn't have been psychopathic about this maybe we shouldn't have tried to enrich your lipstick fashion torture remain on TV in front of his wife and children tens of millions of Americans were watching because we just really want a Supreme Court justice there that agrees with us ideologically that's all it was\nWasn't about women wasn't about sexual assault that was all part of\nThe smear campaign\nThat was the plan all along it was about power it was about a Supreme Court seat but their take away from that\nWasn't okay hold on a second maybe we shouldn't have gone quite so dirty maybe we shouldn't have taken it to such extreme lengths and engage in such represents will be hit or no they came was saying to Republicans were playing so mean\nThe Republicans were so mean to editor in chief of political\nWrote an editorial he says you know I guess the gloves has to come off though if that's the gloves on meaning Kavanaugh and what they did the gloves off I'm Sorry I mean gloves off after what they did a cabinet could only mean violence and and widespread civil disobedience and and writing in the streets I mean there's just\nThere's nothing else you know the ... if you're going to take it to the level of 'cause remember\nThey didn't just want to destroy capital ... they were talking about trying to trying to dredge up criminal charges against him oh there's no statute of limitations in Maryland oh there should be a criminal investigation all she's ready to go to the police they wanted him in prison they want her to use the state to lock up\nCabinet not just stop him from the Supreme Court they will do anything as long as it was going to destroy and they thought that wasn't enough they thought that was playing by gentlemen Lee rules\nHow do you have a conversation with people like that how do you have a discussion with people who take that approach ... the answer is I I don't know what they call you can do you stay true to yourself stay strong and when\nI'm now seeing the wisdom of Donald Trump telling us all that we're going to win so much we're going to get tired of winning we need you\nThe alternative is putting people in positions of power who cannot be trusted with it who do not act with decency who do not act in good faith do not care about the law and what's ... perhaps most disturbing the ... they don't even recognize those things anymore\nThey're so ruthless they don't even understand that they are ruthless it's a terrifying thought\nThere's a lot of social media activity out there but you know that all the stories are piled up over time and there is bias at work\nWhat if we could have a
