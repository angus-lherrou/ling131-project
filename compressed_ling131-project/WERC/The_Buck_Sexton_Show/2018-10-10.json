Oregon and in two years never my six answers now you got no idea or am I absolutely\nCertain Trump is going to win re election now but I'm pretty certain\nUm but Nikki Haley as a woman\nCertainly fits into what all these political journalist like to do it would just come up with a narrative that will interest people with speculation which I've told you before is the favorite tool now of the TV pundits and the different twenty four seven cable news networks Phil lots of speculation spilling filled the airwaves with speculation and you know you'll you'll\nNever have to worry about\nContent you'll have plenty speculation is easy and cheap and so that's why we do it and look it happens a lot on this this bizarre oh I think so and so it was going around oh I think someone's looking part of it is that it's fun right speculations also fun it can be interesting and just not worth all that much but they're saying that Nikki Haley may run on the honest with you\nI don't know I don't know you know\nNo one knows well that's for sure but I\nI don't see that she is necessarily\nI'm quite as a compelling and Kennedy because here's here's what the what did you always gotta remember in these situations are side doesn't get credit for breaking the glass ceiling our side doesn't get credit for oh this person is incredibly accomplish and a minority\nYou know in fact what it said about those who are either minority or female and the conservative side\nWho achieve high office in government is that they're sellouts that their traders\nTrader to their race straighter to their gender or whatever it may be a lot of that was said for example about college because of her vote on Kavanaugh that she was a a a gender traitor\nWhich I suppose is is now he's saying [noise] um but I think that uh you know Nikki Haley step aside today and it was a slow news day and so everybody got all frenzied about this and I'll just let the former or soon to be former U.S ambassador United Nations is speak for herself on this one of them we've got a lot of other things that will be getting into play with wealth\nHow maybe how the end of the air Mike go and that we make sure that everything is going to fight for the fair to come and fat and quaint Danny and I'm proud that part of the team now I don't have anything that I'm Around and go I think that um the main thing when\nI got an hour or six years and we got like a hurricane found in your body parts hitting a ball hitting of how I look how many\nHave had an ironic North Korea it's been eight years I think ... ...

I'm not even really familiar with I Know what political ... which is a political side left wing people a dozen bill itself as that but that is in fact what it is a\nBut he wrote a piece about how maybe more or less it's time to to take the gloves off a about how ... maybe\nOh is that time for Democrats to stop playing nice stop playing nice they were accusing cabinet of being a gang rape is during Senate hearings these people are completely insane they're completely nuts how\nDo you even look I got asked this question recently by a college kid at a at a conference where I gave a speech what do you do when people call you a Nazi\nBecause you're pro Second Amendment I said there's nothing you can do don't engage because you're talking you might as well be talking to the person who's pushing around a shopping cart with you know John three sixteen written on a piece of cardboard hanging out of it I mean that's that's what we're up against now\nAnd this is unfortunately the end result of a massive media echo chamber that has given this kind of thinking some form of of intellectual cover for a very long time that's what's really going on ... ...\nPeople think that this is a normal way to approach their problems they think this is a normal way to deal with the other side should just go completely scorched earth insane and then they to borrow from the left\nThe Democrats have normal lives they're crazy and is there crazy tactics and so what is crazy to a normal person is no longer crazy to Democrats\nI you know I\nI'm not I'm not even going to get to the the the clip I think today but somebody that I'm friends with over at a a nother\nNetwork or\nSomebody in front of the other network you were saying today that what happens when people are being chased out of restaurants that's not a mom\nI I'm Sorry that's them up if we can't agree and this was a CNN\nAnd I'm not we're not going to play that clip today I'm going to let it\nJust uh 'cause 'cause I I like the I like the person on a on a person to person level who who said this stuff but she's been subjected obviously to this kind of thinking too much and has unfortunately bought into it at some level\nIf we can't agree that the people that are changing Ted Cruz out of a restaurant or the people that are public officials who are laughing about\nRand Paul almost being beaten to death on his front lawn because someone didn't like what Rand Paul stood for\nA ... if if they're going to laugh about that if they're going to go on TV is senator Hirono did and said well you know this is just what happens\nSent meaning that people should yell at others and get up in their faces anything else if they're going to say that that's OK and that's normal we have no choice but\nTo own the lives are only choice becomes victory the only response we can have two this insanity\nIs to defeat them and do it and I don't know how else to say to enforce our political will through the system legally and legitimately upon them\nThat's it that is the ... that is the only option there's no other option you know people who think that a gathering of angry loud\n... it got an angry loud activists in a restaurant yelling at somebody and you know in front of his or you know his wife or her husband or whatever\nThese these are just the basic laws of human nature and power the left does not believe in these things and they'll say oh but look at what about the equality in in Sweden first of all they think that equality just means having a large welfare state\nUh but there's not a huge emphasis in some of these European countries that are left points to a there's not a huge emphasis on\nThe state enforcing the same outcomes for all people right I mean some people do better than others maybe not necessarily economically but some people just have happier life outcomes some people there's only so much the state is able to do\nIt unless you empower it to a point where it's so powerful that you no longer have any individual rights you you have whatever the state Danes to leave you\nUm but I suppose I'm getting too deep into this rabbit hole a\nHere's what I Would say about oh wait we've got more so so Trump will actually say what needs to be said here which is that Hillary's a loser to John loser for president never really done anything impressive and her entire career has just been writing her husband's coattails 'em and Trump will say it\nOther people right the Romney wing of the GOP\nThe Romney wing of the GOP is much more willing to sit back and take these nasty comments from people like Hillary Clinton much more willing to sort of take the the underhanded and unseemly an unfair critiques without\nPunching back in any meaningful way so a Trump is a new era for conservatives and many of you listening to the show ...\nMany of you saw that very very early on I've not just come around to it now I I consider myself to be a a warrior ideologically for the Trump way of doing politics um he\nSaid things like you get tired of winning we're certainly not tired of winning but that's not just a slogan you win or bad things happen I mean you know if you believe for example\nThat the Democrats pursue immoral policies which certainly in the case of a rosy way than there are other things you could power right on top of that then there is something of a moral imperative to do at least everything you can within the political system to\nPrevent them from having the power to enact there will uh but Hillary has gotten in the past\nAs we know from the media for a very long time that CNN sits down the center Christiana pool that Christie on whatever name as sits down with her I just said her name's obviously I ... I just don't like to say that because it increased its ... the ah not Christine it's ... and she told a friend of mine was a\nBut they'll call he'll call Hillary out he doesn't sit there and and just allow or to get away with allies and the nonsense\nBut on the issue of Bill Clinton's sexual harassment 'cause we're in this me to moment\nAnd everyone's\nAll focused in on how you know Kavanaugh in the Arab meat you is going to affect women's perceptions going into the midterm elections and all that stuff\nI'm I'm for us to read about her husband Bill Clinton what went on here and I I Want to play the answer for you and then I Want to\nBring us down to brass tacks place that\nHe said either talk about the difficulties that your husband went through the U.S too obviously you're going to be prepared to have questions about that moment in Nineteen Ninety eight impeachment um the allegations of sexual harassment against your husband have a pet to answer this question I have a pet ... for them and how do you have that\nDifferent from what President Trump is being accused of cabin on others today\nWell there's a very significant difference I and that is\nReally has\nLong lasting part of an investigation that was conducted\nIn the nineties [noise] is that\nThe Republicans starting with President Trump on down I Want to a comparison they should welcome such an investigation themselves\n\nIsn't that an incredible sleight of hand from a dishonest and dare I say only ...\nPolitician\nOh there's a big difference alright between what happened with Kavanaugh and what happened with Hillary Clinton's husband Bill Clinton one is that his misdeeds\nOccurred while he was president of the United states or\nIn the case of the credible accusations of rape on the record by women he did have sexual interactions with who did know him worth seeing him there was no question about where they were or do you ever actually occur in terms of the date and time and could they have been there all the things that we never get answers for Ford\nBill Clinton was accused of rape by Juanita broader Broderick by he was accused of sexual assault by Jennifer Flowers and these women came forward and said that he was a\nPredator a predator and\nSure enough Hillary not only didn't divorce him didn't you know\nYou say that those women should be believed she went on often against those women\nThe difference is not the investigation between cabin all and Clinton the difference is that one of them actually is a predator on the other the Democrats tried to sue me or as a predator that's the difference but Hillary\nIs show dishonest and so disgraceful that you think she can get away with well one was a long investigation and the other you know there wasn't\nOne of them was being investigated for what he did while president while governor of Arkansas the other was being being accused of stuff and when he was Seventeen year old case thirty six years ago but it still thinks she can hit hit back at Trump or quote demeaning women play\nWhat was done last night in the White House with a political rally\nIt further undermined the image and integrity of the court um and that\nTroubles me greatly it saddens me because I ... and ... has been viewed as one of the main pillars of our constitutional government so\nI don't know how people are going to react\nTo it I think given our divides it will pretty much fall predictably between those who are for and those who are against\nWhat the president's been true to form he has insulted attacked demeaned women um throughout the campaign really for many years leading up to the campaign and he's continued to do that or inside the White House\nYou know who else has has demeaned and insulted women folks\nHillary Clinton when it suited her\nAnd you know what else is true and also said here on the show ... gonna be in trouble as long as the feminist left in this country embraces Hillary Clinton the feminists left cannot credibly there's that word claim to really be about empowering women [noise]\nEvery day I have the incredible honor and privilege upbringing you my thoughts you're on this program but I Want you to have\nA platform to call your own I Want you to be able to go to a place and share your thoughts post photos engaging topics that matter\nTo you you share your thoughts and ideas with like minded patriots across the country that's worse nippy dot com comes and they'd be dot com is a new social media sites it's completely free and it does not have any bias whatsoever it does\nNot have any of this left wing conversational health nonsense it does in skewed toward the progressive side of things Snoopy dot com is all about letting you be you and yes online that means being conservative in that in fact you are\nSo go and starting to count totally free everything about her free S.
