{"month": "10", "state": "AL", "station": "WERC", "content": "Possibility of this race going for the Republicans Kim Strasser will join just not talking about what's going on in New Jersey she's a peace up on the wall Street Journal where she is on the editorial board smiling at corruption\nDemocrats tried to save Bob Menendez months after his bipartisan as admonished bitch a Kim great to have you back and it's great to be here\nAll right what's going on in in the Garden State which I always feel a certain love hate relationship for the New Yorker what's going on up there\nYet well as you said you know what's notable here is that while the entire media has felt obsessing over Texas where those numbers look at those Ted Cruz's step now like pulling away from it all work there is a racist even within a smaller margin of error and in New Jersey where a Democrat Bob Menendez\nWet you mentioned um he was censored by his colleague rather modest it by his colleagues back earlier this year I'm after he had been found to have accepted also get from a man who is now convicted felon who ran one of the biggest Medicare fraud on government an all time\nI'm not only was he accepting a lot of gifts from this guy and not acknowledging that under Senate Ethics rules\nBut he was working on behalf of this guy to help them with his business interests in Washington including done so far it's a lot of health and Human Services secretary on his bat so um he he was actually indicted for this uh the the FBI ultimately I'm Sorry that department of justice ultimately dropped the charges after the Supreme Court\nThat change the standard um on what it would take to convict him but he was honest and he's now facing a very tough race against Bob Uganda Republican businessman who's been highlighting this and it it's really driving a favor\nHow'd you say there is a a deafening silence Kim\nFrom so many of the au Jared Kushner must have some shady relationship with Saudi Arabia I I hear this people will be the all the time and I say okay well what is it and then there's there's nothing\nThere's all these whispers of corruption around Trump meanwhile Menendez who whether people want to just parse out the legality of what he did or not what he did was gross and the guy who was associated with even grosser and they're just hoping that Bush has gone on for the Democrats\nYeah many Democrats are actually out there running a campaign focused on so called Republican corruption Nancy Pelosi this summer actually handed out to her members a toolkit\nA talking point about how they supposedly go after Republican corruption trumping and all sorts of other issues none of which as you said\nThere was any real evidence for but in the meantime they just close their eyes in some cases\nActually or outright helping I mean what the Democrat that's why I called the called smiling at corruption\nAt the biggest superPAC out their image or a superPAC helping Senate Democrats\nJust decided to reroute million dollars to help Bob Menendez in his race on night they're taking away from even more important races for them or where they're trying to defend seats\nIn places where Trump won because so much trouble but in essence this is the Democratic party say hey you know what we're OK with corruption I guess there is all trail of evidence that very clear in fact the senators on record saying that he engaged in corruption but we're still going to do everything we can return to office\nYeah and I have to say that there are two areas where I see a tremendous or boxing loving to one of them is on this\nOr is it was on the notion of corruption much as you pointed out is is a talking point against the Republicans but do you have so many Democrats you start to think of it all the Democrats that have gone to prison and just in the last oh four or five years for\nIncredibly obvious and very shady corruption and that never gets brought up in in any of this discussion as I said there's always this big old Trump most you know someone starts telling me about the Mali ... that tends to be what I hear about\nBut also on on the notion of mobs I I just say I am I have been surprised and I take it very dim view of much of the of the journalists class which I Know technically you definitely are a journalist on something else but I'm pretty close to journal land\nBut most journalists I think act in a way that is really surprising to me but on the mobs Kim I'm seeing a lot of people would say you know they have no other they have no other way to make their case and these are people that write for the Washington Post\nIt's it's crazy look it absolutely unacceptable okay the whole reason we have\nCivil society we have to face it so that we don't have mob rule just because you're citing election just because your person didn't get in office or just because you lost your Supreme Court nomination\nParents absolutely nothing written in any of that formal or informal rules that our society they give you the right to shape Mitch McConnell or Ted Cruz added ... hound them at a restaurant\nUm this is the fact precisely why we have a ballot box and elections and anybody who's out there whether it's on CNN I've seen a couple on there are any way saying well eight not ma and be they're just saying what they think\nWe all know that's not true I'm saying what you think is when you write an op ed or a letter to a newspaper um or you go to vote\nOr that you know harassing people on the street and it's not and if that's the best in God and conservatives should actually feel pretty good that they're winning on the policy merits\nNow I Know that it's it's really tight and so to to ask you to make a prediction and who really knows but just in in a minute or so we have less you're Kim how to eat where what's the main dynamic you see right now in the house race that's going to determine whether it ends up being the Republicans the Democrats win the day\nBut I think the most important thing which is one hearing what mainstream media\nIs how different it is today than it was just three weeks ago okay we can already saying with complete definite proof\nThat the Democrats blown it to a certain extent a they were talking about a wave three weeks ago they messed up with Kavanaugh it's not going to be a way I think it's going to come down to five feet one way or the other right on whoever does win and aren't going to have a huge majority but I think Republicans are still and all\nRight ... everybody on the wall Street Journal check out her columns and also her book the intimidation game ... owns ... make the time forest come back soon\n... back\nYeah I I think he was smart on there with the it's going to be five seats it's going to be such a narrow margin I I don't think that we're going to know we're certainly not going to know who controls the house by the time I'm although you should listen for all of the show election I obviously but we're not going to know who controls the house I think by\nThe time this show is is over um I think it's going to stretch well I guess the polls closed around ... there's no way we would know okay yeah this is not even close but we might not even know till maybe the next morning it's gonna it's gonna be drawn out\nAnd it's going to be very very tight which goes to tell you you know they've been telling us the Trump is a fascist\nAnd destroying America and now they're praying and hoping that they can not have a blue wave but a little blue reports a little bit [noise]\nCrazy right now you got the left freaking out chases people at a restaurant\nAnd screaming at little old ladies and anybody that shows up at a Trump rally ... hat\nYou got all kinds of nonsense going on about these posts Kavanaugh rage from all the different progressive how about we all just stop that crap and drink some delicious coffee how 'bout that burn idea\nBecause that's where I Do every day I drink black rifle coffee every morning I drink it all on black because it was delicious high quality small batch roast or coffee I've made converts all of my office I'm like why are you drinking a ... when you could be drinking black wife or a company\nFounded by veterans and it's all about delicious coffee go check it out for yourself [noise] nothing cures or bad attitude quite like starting your day with the most American coffee ever black rifle coffee visit black rival coffee dot com slash Bachmann she Fifteen Percent off your order\nThat black rifle coffee dot com slash book for Fifteen Percent off like rebel coffee dot com squashed by [noise]\n\n\n\nWhen do you what a spot that burglar when he's case in your home or after easier as Sean who's Blake camera alerted him a burglar tried to\nSee if you had your college football coverage\nI at at the end of the day what happens with ... is not really that much our business or our problem\nOr we can give a diplomatic statement about it we can say this was terrible you should never have done this but we're not going to prosecute anyone we don't have any mechanism even for prosecuting anyone ah this was a crime\nCommitted on Turkish soil so we don't have any jurisdiction here to speak up it was also done in a conflict so it was done on Saudi soil on Turkish soil\nSo this is a diplomatic issue this is between nation states guy was not a U.S citizen now I Know he was a green card holder he was a permanent resident a lot of people focused in on that but\nHe's still not a citizen or he held foreign citizenship show you know why is this the president's situation primarily to handle you know why is it something where the president of the United states is the one guy who is supposed to take definitive action\nAnd we do we know the answer the answer is that is because the left wants to play this game of you know Trump is terrible and Trump is a dictator and all this other stuff or any loves dictators here's Obama's former\nPublic relations propaganda is our from inside the White House Ben Rhodes and this is how dirty he's willing to be played with five\nWhat we're seeing here Chris ... is really the continuation of a profound re alignment of American foreign policy under Donald Trump\nWhere we no longer speak up for democracy and human rights we no longer speak up for a journalist and said we call them the money is at the state and we're getting a green light not just to the Saudi regime but to any regime around the world who wants to harm dissidents harm journalists because the most powerful democracy in the world is no longer on their side\nI think it has that would Jared his son in law he's been sort of his vice Roy when it comes to dealing with the Arab world I think he feels that somehow he's in bed with this royal family over there that is sort of Romanoff phony ah family\nAh and their families seem to be locked together Jared yes it is and his crown prince seemed to be in bed together politically\nYeah ... ... ...\nOh my gosh I don't know why anyone I don't want to listen to that guy just showed desperate to hang on and be relevant he must be good friends with the management of MSNBC I don't know why people listen to him I really don't know among one of the worst analysts on TV or a total I Believe it used to be a conservative and say whatever you have to say to try me relevant at any point in time\nBut you you have there are two different versions of giant bull crap\nA bull crap coming from Ben Rhodes is that this is Trump's fault that the show the murder is because Trump calls CNN you know the enemy of the people\nUh I I hate to break it to you but you know there are journalists there are propaganda apparatus sigh in countries where journalists are the enemy of the people straight up\nIs the north Korean ministry of propaganda the enemy of the north Korean people yes is North Korean state media the enemy of the north Korean people whether the ... yes same thing's true in Iran is doing a lot of countries\nJust being a journalist did not give you some moral superiority which I Know is a shock to all the swamp dwelling journalists around me here in Washington D. C. and they really think that there's a national\nThey don't want anyone to tell them otherwise\nAnd this is she always I always get the sense from all these journalists that this is the only profession they could ever even consider having you know that that the notion of showing up to a job and just doing something else to them once they once they tasted a certain level of success in journalism is just oh it's horrifying to them\nWork with the pleads again oh no many of them have never done that by the way\nThey go right out of right out of school right into some J. program somewhere and that's that's the path anyway\nUh this is just idiocy though from roads\nAnd then you have this whole conspiracy theory about pushing her and Mohammed bin ... where ... cushion the Saudis are very important strategic player in the middle east right now that's a fact\nWe don't get to ignore that's a fact\nNew administration no administration has ever stood up to the Saudis in a meaningful way for running one of the crappy is countries on earth despite all of its oil wealth\nNo administrator no president including Obama who is balancing literally bowing to the Saudis okay so everyone needs to just blow their role and chill out on this\nStopped making this about cheap partisan points against Trump that's all they want to do it they don't care about this guy to show the they have a little more solidarity with them they would otherwise because he was not even sure he's a columnist\nThe guy was and it is an opinion writer for the now I'm not saying that means that you know anything as it happened to him but the way they're talking about it but it's like he's ... you know he he is one of them meanwhile as anybody ever writes that opinion column anywhere somebody that now get special treatment\nIn terms of the media's view of them I can tell you this much if it were a conservative who had been attacked I mean a un American conservative Lebanon attack somewhere else in the world you hear a lot less outrage about this just the fact\nIt is just the if if it were someone who are critical of fundamentalist Islam and that was the primary attack that Islam in Saudi Arabia is a destructive\nYou've oppressive tyrannical force and the Saudis took that guy out there and say well\nYou know there's a lot of Islamophobia going on there I mean you know they shouldn't they shouldn't have murdered and but there was you know there's a lot of Islamophobia meanwhile if you've been bring up the cause Yogi was and this is a fact and Islamist meaning he believed in political Islam and was very friendly and cozy with the Muslim Brotherhood\nIs like your trampling on the man's great that's that's just telling the truth he wasn't Islamist nobody he wouldn't do not as if he were alive nobody denies it doesn't mean you should have been brutally murdered\nOh I I almost left out that he also a ... they dressed somewhat up as a body double in his clothing after they killed him to try to create footage of leaving so that was the plan they they were going to try to or they must not have known that the fiance was outside because they were going to try and say that he left and that they had no knowledge and ... they were going to disappear and\nThat was the plan to disappear him and they are just really really dumb about it\nLet me give you a little bit of in jail agency insight here in terms of what I what I learned when I was in the CIA about how foreign intelligence often operates there this is a little bit of an inside baseball for you to like that kind of thing\nThere are a lot of countries that are very affected their services are very effective at surveillance and at a certain you know the regime security issues that that's generally what most intelligence agencies are\nTheir primary concern is right regime and keeping the people in power in power and stopping any threats against them most countries aren't really worried about foreign invasion most countries are worried about toppling from from the inside\nUm and\nThey get very adept to dealing with that threat but they also often operate in places where they can be really ham fisted I guess that's kinda the wrong term for Saudi Arabia but you know what I mean they can be clumsy and sloppy and get away with it\nAnd that's what I think happened here the Saudis the Saudi intelligence services the Saudi police they can be selfish in Saudi Arabia and can be selfish in other Middle Eastern countries where they have a lot of sway can't really be self sufficient turkey and that may have been the miscalculation here\nThey thought that they could get away with this and they're not used to operating on foreign soil where there is also a very by the way sluggish intelligence apparatus apparatus\nCall my son they too um strikes and may maybe it's true I mean I may be but it ... strikes me as a bit as a bit odd now I mean I Want to make fun of people's names but I mean I'm not I didn't call myself\nYou know when in G. U. E. Y. E. N. or something which is a fine name but it tends to be a name associate with Southeast Asia right I just adopted him name from another culture and like yeah I'm basically a part of that culture might as well be\nIt's it's cultural appropriation debate I was doing but ... reporters and and the left or the Democrats they're obsessed with this guy it's weird it's it's really in the realm of creepy\nAnd here is for his ... he was just one example of this I mean here's a reporter supposed to be interviewing Beto O'Rourke and this is what she says to him during the interview played with not\nObvious strategies that I've seen him in a in a modern campaign to show off everywhere all the time for every one you can be without an interruption in from the battle back much I Love you too thank you well you\nKnow there's just so many [laughter]\n\nRock star amazing ... that's a reporter it's got the Mike and and the whole thing you know star really\nThat's what you say the the the guy that disease your interview subject now like I Know people were saying oh you're so great but does anyone has any reporter uh ... from the big mainstream journalist outfits out there has anyone on the left\nOr or even in the main the quote mainstream media is down in the middle journalists the big lie but they still couldn't do it have they ever gone to somewhere with Trump like wow you're you're a political phenomenon the likes of which this country has probably never seen\n'em does anyone ever say that did they say he's a rock storming Trump's if they do it was a rock star Trump is a some kind of super human superstar right but they would never do that and I'm not saying that they should I just want to know the comparison between the two because when you take a look at it you can find very obviously that\nYou know they they buy into this mythology runs got ... ... says by the way you know always show handsome you so charismatic I I don't see it at all\nI don't and I and none of it I'm like hey guys you know Kayla gay and you know sounds okay and as the whole ... thing strikes me as kind of funny but I I guess there's a and a myth a kind of mixing here in their minds of that\nRunning a person from a red state as a down home Democrat who can speak to the whole country and but also has that kind of youth and coups charisma thing that Obama had so it's almost like the best of Bill Clinton the best of Obama politically speaking pulled together\nUm and\nI think that is how they view which uh I think that's kind of the the the way that cause they're obsessed with\nThis guy and I'll tell you this and I've seen some other saying and I think it's true they know he's gonna lose going to lose by double digits up until he's will lose by by nine or ten points they think he's going to run for president\nThat they think that he'll have a good enough showing in Texas the case will be they'll win all the blue states and be competitive in the red\nStates and he can take on Trump and I'm here to tell you that Trump would\nCrush him so bad or you book [noise]\nFox News ... [noise]\nI [noise] president\nTrump's firing up the crowd in Houston tonight where he campaigns for his former Minnesota Senator Ted Cruz discussing new plans for ten percent middle class tax cut\nEarlier the president tweeted about his plans to punish three Central American countries withholding or reducing USAID over that migrant caravan heading toward border with Mexico\nPresident also writing on Twitter every time you see a caravan or people illegally coming we're attempting to come into our country illegally think of and blamed the Democrats for not giving us the votes to change our pathetic immigration law\nFox's John jak are Democrats pulling the president for blocking a bipartisan\nImmigration reform bill this is Fox News [noise]\n[noise]\n\nThat was you know because when it comes to the flight for so long [noise] never saw [noise]\n\nFoods seriously seriously but not\nNot as cool I'm a prince choose princess we were gonna you know we must around with the parties so we're just pick it up where we left off but the issue into it now she told me earlier she wants to be from the piece from the piece that yeah the ... that's me the prince to be on the ... the ...\nTo generate a contractor something snow but the I mean did you ask her if she wants to ... [noise] well [noise] I guess not really\nOkay in case you didn't know that is a\nKind of public service announcement from Amnesty International which is an organization that apparently has a lot of time on its hands and Amnesty International thinks that people need to be told via fairy tale\nThat there should be no uh no kissing women who are asleep\nThis guy also this this it's a cartoon we played the audio from it he kind of like reaches like he's going to do a little group group thing a while this woman's passed out and you know this follows last week when you had Christian bell who is a celebrity a talent or does not strike me as very bright\nShouldn't have a fine actors I guess I don't know she kind of plays at a you know attractive youngest blonde female uh I I've never seen a really extend herself the man who cares I'm not a thespian critic\nOr a critic of the attack\nA but she said that she's worried about what will happen to young women that she or people in general including her daughter I think she said with a fairy tale of Sleeping Beauty who escaped to wake her up from her dream because that there was a violation of could send that goes on there now I pointed out to you last week that\nThe the point is really not that there's a consent issue because they were talking about which has a magic apples and somebody's in a coma from eating the apple and it is a is a fairy tale\nAnd really the only way for her to be awoken which is the storyline is by a prince to kiss her she saved her life like kissing her\nShow it's really almost like he's performing mouth to mouth resuscitation I Would say and therefore he does have consent if we're going to take it to this weird place where we are talking about this\nBecause if somebody is joking and you give the mouth to mouth resuscitation you don't have to say hey can you can you verbalize that You're Joking and I'm going to give you or you know or they're ... they're hard to stop and choking as the Heimlich hard to stop you get the idea\nAh some out to mouth resuscitation ... you know in in a fairy tale is really we're talking about here but they ran with this\nThey didn't stop they weren't they weren't it wasn't enough for them to just say I have an actress because there was another one I forget who another actress came at all I'm worried about fairy tales and the patriarchy so they're they're destroying centuries old stories\nThat is instill very basic one creative sensibility and young people but also have some basic morality entailed so good and evil and now they're fairy tales they're meant for amusement I promise you I don't know a single guy who in college age was like whoa\nBecause the handsome prince ... the girl in a coma or I can kissed this girl in real life you're like no one would ever think that nobody no human being has ever ever ever thought that\nSo this was a problem that did not exist but now they've gone even further with it and you know in that video I don't want to play it again for you because you've already heard it but you know there's some very\nYour first of all there's a curse and there's some as they make it very clear that there is some kind of crude sexual humor in there as\nWell and referring to the initial that he uses and everything and he's clearly supposed to be in title ... bro the prince and then there's there's all the the patriarchy left wing stuff is there but you know this is what the what the left doesn't\nYet grass is that they lose on this stuff they lose on these cultural issues where they are acting like maniacs\nUm and and this brings me to not just this battle over fairy tales and consent\nBut this whole ... this whole story that broke today about how Trump is ah taking is telling the D O D J now\nUm that they should this this is the story line at least a that transgender could be defined out of existence under a Trump Administration now that is such a loaded headline\nA that is such a loaded headline in so many ways one of them is that no person can be defined out of existence a person as a person and all of us have equal rights under the law as people\nOf the most American coffee

to be fifty five you heard it or for fifty five Republican Senate seats by by the end of this thing not quite the super majority of sixty although it would not be sweet\nMidterms going to be tight I mean a house rather intimate church going to be tight very very tight I I think it could go either way right now and it's going to be just a few seats that separate the Democrats and Republicans at the end of the day but Trump is an incredibly\nPowerful\nVoice in this whole debate and discussion I think that he's really making a very he's making the case very well which are the Democrats don't actually have an agenda or a platform other than trying to restore the legal and cultural ... of Obama is them\nWhile Trump is president and they're ... they won't be able to do that so this is really just going to be much more a rhetorical battling much more fighting it out in the media and nastiness\nAnd it it really is it is moms or jobs and Republicans need to hammer that home the point that I think they're on that and they're doing they're okay is that they could be stronger on this but on health\nCare I'm furious with the Republicans because they don't have a unified message and because of a couple of\nVery unreliable GOP senators we don't actually have\nA real achievement to speak of in a in the healthcare realm\nAnd Obamacare is garbage and Trump is allowing people to get out of the individual mandate but that and also giving states more flexibility in this but they need to be telling people what that means and what it does for them\nYou know they are not effective messengers

with you you can blast your music at a pool with a hundred people\nI think that's very very strange um and I think that you know it's it's something that people should not do anyway back to Mitch McConnell what's going on here and this guy was Lee at the Washington Post\nIs essentially a doesn't understand where the first amendment stops and starts and you see this from a lot of journalists which you think that people who make a living from the first amendment would have a better understanding of it but their understanding of the first amendment is they have special rights in privileges and everybody else needs to just deal with it\nUm but that's not the way that's not the way this is supposed to function that somehow this is supposed to go\nAnd for the Philly branch thing I wanted to say that we're giving comfort to white nationalism and we're uh I I hate this talking point it's so vile it's so despicable and unfair and they keep saying and all the time and it's just a way of shutting down any on his political dialogue\nWhich is why people like me and increasingly said over the last six months you know what the Russia collusion thing now they know they can't win that you're just you're just going to see that same\nThat same mentality that same insane tenacity around an issue where they think they can destroy the president\nThat's going to be a expanded to cover any number of things so that the the craziness that led them to believe that Russia collusion was going to bring down the president that same level of just was jar\nOr will now be on everything the twenty Fifth Amendment stuff the can front of people in restaurants because that was just the that was the place where you had the first real symptoms of ... from arrangements syndrome\nThe first major symptom was Russia is going to bring down the presidency it's really going to happen Trump is a Russian Jew jak Russian pond where it's just a matter of time before we prove it and now you see that because that's just not going to work\nThere now pushing out into everything else and you're seeing the same and Saturday in Philly brains they're saying that you know it's it's not a big deal that people were yelling at Mitch McConnell and remember you know what I'm saying these people should be arrested\nWere just saying they're idiots and people shouldn't do this and we should be able to share that opinion without people so you get your your opinion that's destroying the first amendment no\nIt is not it is not\nAnd uh I I just think that this is\nOne of these places where you know you either have principles you don't abide by the way I'm not skipping over we just don't have unless you're there were there were a bunch of people that were harassing Nancy Pelosi over the weekend too\nAnd they are total moron okay they absolutely should not should not or be given any respect or any you know an approval from anyone I heard somebody say they were the Proud Boys I don't know I just know that there was a video of people\nSo I'm getting over a cold so my voice has been really shaky last week video of people who ... yeah that's right I called I did the show every day I don't miss the show when I'm sick because I Love all have you so much and I can't I Can't skip a day and the freedom on\nUnless I have a work thing I have to do but that's where\nA but the people yelling a pillow see they've done nothing to help their cause a lot to harm it or if their cause is and I and I don't know what their causes I'm assuming it's just anti left wing something\nBut the left you're doing the huge favor no matter who you are if you say you're on the right and I know some people are talking false flag I haven't seen any evidence of that\nIf you say you're on the right and you are screaming and yelling people in the left now you give them the ability to say oh see both sides are doing it when both sides are doing it but that one case will be magnified so those individuals who were banging on doors and young a ... on the far left a huge favor [noise]\nI just saw the CEOs global verification network last week here in DC we caught up for a while and I said hey mark how's business he's a business is great we've got companies large and small coming to us for their background investigations and vetting and I know why that is folks because global verification is a U.S based veteran owned and operated\nBackground investigation company wherever your needs are for your age are department or if you're going to be leasing out of property to somebody\nAre unsafe and you know not the way that people should be living but that means you're going to have to have police in social workers and others come ones that are already got to come with we were going to get you off the street we're going to help you you don't just leave them there to wallow in their field because that's what the ACLU says freedom is\nThis thing as a caravan of some seven thousand migrants make their way through Mexico towards the U.S President Trump that in Texas rally calling for tighter border security we need\nThe president's been calling the march a national emergency for the U.S meanwhile former President Obama at a rally of his own in Nevada also addressing immigration there's\nNothing American about ripping immigrant children from their mother [noise]\nDon't

towards Mexico's Pacific coast with winds of one hundred and fifty miles an hour it's supposed to move north and dumped several\nDoes the brain on taxes\n\nHe's holding the line for America bugs accent is back\nWhat is the greatest threat facing this country right now\nYou might think the currency and an unsustainable debt load you might think radical Islam or Chinese\nAggression Russian nuclear fallout I don't know any number of different things that could come to mind but Ocasio Cortez too soon to be a sitting US Senator and darling of the left has a very different idea about the single biggest most existential threat\nTo the United states\nHere she is in her words [noise]\n\n\n\nThat's right we're talking about Nazi Germany now there's better be very serious I assume she must be talking about what happens when China's economy surpasses our own and we have a country with a\nBillion people that wants to be the preeminent global superpower or at least something incredibly serious that's really going to happen and be a real concern for us right [noise]\n\n[noise]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe fact of the matter is we're dealing with a radical truth no we are not oh my
