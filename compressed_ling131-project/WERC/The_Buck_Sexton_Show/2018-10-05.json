Chinese have been doing this for quite some time we don't know about a lot of these incidents or we don't know the seriousness seriousness of the incidence\nBecause the navy for quite some time has actually been trying to downplay these encounters\nThe Chinese have been acting recklessly and I think that they have sense that we're a little bit afraid of them so they become bolder and bolder the one good thing about the incident that occurred over the weekend is that the navy released a photographs of this immediately and that's important because it says to Beijing back off\nYou know under

gets awards for his movies and he made that Fahrenheit\nNine eleven movie years ago and then he thought wow Donald Trump's election was on ah eleven nine I could do Fahrenheit eleven nine and go after Donald Trump and his movie has been a miserable failure\nSo Michael Moore who believes he's one of the guys who predicted Donald Trump will get elected Michael Moore came out yesterday after the\nTest and he posted this on Twitter quote it was just to test but make no mistake about it this is the world in which we now live close quote and then he goes on to tell us\nThe final line in Fahrenheit eleven nine and he has to tell us that because nobody's gone and seen the movie the movie as Bert virtually a losing money it it was\nThe stink or from the first weekend it was released probably the worst failure he's had\nBut he said that was the last line in my movie Fahrenheit eleven nine a few minutes ago Trump gave us a preview of the state of emergency he is creating to justify the end of
