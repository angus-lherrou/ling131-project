violent [noise] don't encourage me don't encourage attacks on media [noise]\nBrain but you have to show respect for people and and the disagreements\nSo unfortunately this atmosphere of hatred is contributing\nTo the choices people are making to turn to violence there's no question about\nIt is a troubling time isn't it [noise]\nIt's a time of\nDeep divisions [noise] and we have to do everything we can to bring our country together [noise]\nWe also have to elect candidates who will try to do the same\nHillary they're talking about bringing the country together that's amazing isn't it\nYes what I think about unity and bring together the American people the first name that comes to mind is how I\nI don't think so uh I don't think so yeah here we are\nWho are we talking about these these dangerous times you'll notice that we we didn't have this\nWe didn't have this outpouring immunity from all these Democrats after the uh let's just be honest about it much more\nSerious in that somebody was almost killed somebody was shot shooting at the baseball diamond Alexander I did not see all these Democrats say time it took the temperature down let's stop calling drop a traitor what stopped calling Trump supporters white nationalist and racist I didn't do anything about it I just don't remember maybe\nMaybe my members faulty\nAlthough I doubt it\nThat was not what was up it was it now we see that the capitalize on this they try to capitalize on this right away some are more explicit than others here is the view host sunny hostage in ...\n\nI was in Texas thing with my former colleagues to CNN and and they're scared and one highly former colleagues said this is what happened when the president called you the enemy of the ... plus high and I thought my gosh you know it's it's a tone and coming from the top\nAnd now CNN has become a target journalists that are simply trying to do and we can I still don't know anything yet about where this is coming from and what the motivation than and who the person or the people are behind it until I can point to be careful 'cause we don't know yet but in general and I didn't get the ball you know did they show like hot\nAnd it hasn't gotten a bite yet\n[noise] [noise]\nIt's but it's Trump's fault you see I'm I'm not\nSaying that there's not a correlation here between or or clear link between all these different yeah these are these are powerful Democrats who have been targeted but that they've been targeted doesn't tell us why they were targeted as in the motivation the old motivation of the perpetrator and connected to the president is just\nIt just disingenuous\nA disingenuous really doesn't have any evidence there's ... there's nothing to hide this together that they think the Trump is mean to them sometimes we'll do they go to determine when Trump is not being mean to them\nDo they get to determine when Trump is finally being acceptable and he's expression of criticism of the media what are the best and most powerful things that Trump has done is a challenge the media and to call them out for their bias and their wives\nI Do want him to stop and I refused to allow the left wing media\nTo use this incident to stop it [noise]\nThere's a great in the world of people to come up with all kinds of ways to falsify their background the obvious rely on their resumes lie about their income or even the criminal background\nYou ought to make sure that whoever is doing those kinds of background checks for you is someone that you can trust that's all about professionalism\nAnd running a veteran owned and operated business here in America\nBecause that's global verification though a lot of the other guys in this space love you know people have you back or investigations and vetting still send this war can be done overseas by third parties and those are actually take credit for it and send you the bill\nKnock little verification they have reached vindication experts across the country and they were with companies of all sizes from\nAnd the fact that you know you have the vice President Pence out there he's made this he's made it very clear here's here's what they uh here's what Penn federally to play sixteen\n[noise] these cowardly acts are despicable and have no place in American society [noise]\nI Want to assure you we just for the full resources of the FBI or the United states Secret Service and they're working very closely with law enforcement officials will continue to monitor these investigations and those responsible will be brought to justice [noise]\nYeah [noise] yep yep yep\nThat's what the vice president says does that change any of the ... or any of the June you're hearing from the media and there's no\nI actually saw someone say that I was I forget that the journals another blue check you know Twitter journal person\nOr say that the Trump statement where he said there's no place for political violence in this country or threats in this country that that was the bare minimum that he said the bare minimum I'm like well does he have to give us an hour long speech recognition will will will there's going to criticize the matter what he does\nWhether it's a show gay or this or anything they just they hate him they absolutely hate him you know\nEarlier today actually there were just talking about the president's such a liar oh he's such a liar so terrible noticed you know my objections to a bomb or that I thought\nHe had bad ideas he wasn't nearly as brilliant as the media pretend that he was and he was arrogant and he was doing bad things from policy level actually don't have any personal beef with Obama like I didn't I didn't\nKnow it wasn't about Obama the guy seems like he's a very nice family seems like he's a good dad I mean there there's a lot of stuff actually I look at Obama's so you know that's that seems admirable\nBut I thought he was a bad president and I disagree with him I didn't hate him though I didn't go to bed at night thinking all that that that's come Obama wasn't some maniac but that's how they feel about Trump and now because some\nManiac somewhere we don't even know why yet but somebody somewhere sent these bombs now we're supposed to believe what Trump is supposed to be muzzle maybe here's what they were saying about him earlier in the day it's liquid for\nHow sorry the president flat out lie saying Congress was working on a plan and they were coming back before the election he gets caught the lifestyle changes this story again and says we are going to get sort of actually\nThe president thinks you're stupid the president thinks people are stupid were officially and Paris, France how\nPresident Trump tries to play to his base with outright false if\nHe's not even trying to hide his life anymore he's handled putting all out there in spreading a lot of lives about non white people to call white crowd to make a clown a lot of what the president saying it's just not true\nThat seems to me in a bit of the fat free frenzy frustration and health oxygen sales live\n\nThis is a an article of faith now have you have to say this all the time whenever asked them\nWhat what's the law what they're really damaging pernicious live what is the lie on the level of if you like your health care plan you can keep it that President Trump has told one that was done with forethought with malice and that had impact on the lives of tens of millions of Americans\nNegative impact what what is the law that winds up with that but that his crowd size was the biggest ever that he's a stable genius you know a lot of the stuff that he says you and I could ...\nNow as as him kind of joking around and talking as normal people do\nThere oh he's a liar oh he's lying you know they're they're always always jump right to\nThe worst possible scenario and never get tired of it either oh my gosh\nYou know the the left in the media they they find endless ways to reach a Lebanon the outrage meter ten is not enough eleven the outrage miracles his brother I Know I I just get frustrated with it too it's it's so tiresome\nAnd they're all their calls for civility right they're they're being made in bad faith they're not calls for civility they're not really from a lot of these a prominent leftists their calls for the right to be silent and to start getting pummeled again they liked the old order where we sit around and were polite and we can we as conservatives play by the rules\nAnd were nice and we get punched in the face and say oh that was nice but I'm going to keep doing what I Do that's what they want us to go back to Trump doesn't play that game they're not saying let's all be good to each other day defend the mobs and the restaurants we'll talk\nMore about that later they defend these tactics that it's not just that they happened and they say oh well we can't control every one they're favorable to this stuff\n\nAnd now they're saying we all have to be civil and take the temperature down after Eighteen months of propaganda diving to their base the president's a traitor or sexist or rapist or a you know a racist or everything\nCrazy going to start a war is a fascist state the stuff they've set up by President Trump it's it's like nothing I've ever seen in my life it is like nothing I've ever it truly is that there's nothing that even comes close now they're going to be the civility please come on\nWho takes this seriously is people are these people are\nReally in need of reality check him really\nGot Joe Scarborough Scarborough if I if I just can't for a minute here I don't know Joe Scarborough never met him\nDon't really care to a\nBut this is a guy who was his chummy chummy buddy buddy with the president as you could possibly be during the ... when it really mattered as a journal to be an objective for and scarred wasn't opinion guy but you know he's a member of the media and he had an opportunity to speak truth to power and all that but no he wanted to because you with power he wanted to be close to power\nAnd now because Trump has not him in Mika now\nBecause Trump is something that's not the two of them he he goes on these anti Trump\nRage rants and first during the day is on Christ like I mean this is here's what's covers that place six\nHistory will look back and Americans will look back with shame\nThat we ever had a president like this one a vet turned his back on the most basic ... not only the most basic American concepts\nAre what we defend our borders and and we should defend our borders people should only getting a here legally what Donald Trump's doing is\nNot only anti American\nI Will just say this is a guy that was raised in the Southern Baptist church\nAt least based on\nThe Bible I read the gospels that I read the good Samaritan story that I read it sounded Christ like\nYeah that's right Joe Scarborough is going back to is\nOh so Christian roots and a site in the Bible to criticize Trump I mean this guy has no shape no shame\nWhatsoever I mean he goes over at MSNBC and uh ... that\nAnd with Trump don't let them get away with oh it's it's ... of some of them will be very open about it it's not just drop its Trump voters they don't just despise the man and his policies they despise all of us who have put our faith in him to get the job done in fact they despise\nUs so much that they refuse to believe is very important if you can't understand that Trump phenomenon without knowing that he's in that role for very specific reasons we've been trusted him to do certain things that by the way he has been doing\nUm and\nTo shake up the political establishment to take the fight to the left and you push for less regulation less taxation\nAll of the things that Trump has been pushing for it and doing that's why he's there he's not there because we think that he\nNever flies off the handle a little bit maybe a little too salty with his language you know as a little bit too much of a ah [noise]\nMaybe it excessive libido in his past him and all of those things those are and it's not that we're not aware of those and it's not that I think those are good things uh it's just that on balance I Want all the good stuff the Trump brings to the table and he's doing that but the Nicole walls of the world thinks the world too stupid to make that kind of a calculation\nOr they want to hold us to the Romneys standard up put an effective Boy Scout up there so we can tear them apart and then we'll pass you on the head when we put another leftist in who destroys the economy and socialize medicine that's what they want to do\nThat's the plan I I'd rather not I'd rather not allow that to uh to happen not not on my watch if I could afford it away or\nRussia collusion fall out of the headlines tomorrow but I have George Papadopoulos on rising with me so if you want to see that very tree interview uh but I wanted to know something 'cause you know this guy's got some prison time\nAnd for what a has a felony on his record now and the whole thing is such a joke around him but here's a congressman ice it talking about this play eight\nWe're going into an election in which real wrong doing two years ago is still not properly investigated well a special investigator Mohler is continuing to indict people for unrelated crime as an act as though there's collusion when he hasn't had one piece of it then he's been able to demonstrate so\nThe the voters are going in with some very interesting misinformation or lack of information and two years is a long time it's too long and we should have deposed him today [noise]\nYep\nI completely agree with ice in one part of this whole election that we don't talk about enough\nIs how it is tainted by dish a deep state action against the president not just the effort to create this false Russia collusion narrative but also the Mueller probe which grinds along and with these trumped up oh conspiracy against the United states charges stuff is crazy\nIt's nonsense and\nThat affects voted that affects people's mindset about this president and really profound ways so you know the the left is already stacked the deck there already cheating\nIn a sense they're already playing dirty and\nWho knows how much dirtier I told you you guys remembered as I said a couple of weeks ago I think we've got another October surprise you know I started on this show we got something else that's going to hit us and I can't tell you exactly what's going on today but I can tell you that\nWell certainly a surprise um\nWe've got to have a Joe Jones joined us on the mechanism those bombs that were going to talk with the caravan so much more showgirl switching topics shortly set right there with me team you're about\nNews I'm Kathleen Maloney [noise]\nDemocracy is a\nCampaign rally in Wisconsin tonight President Trump condemning the standing of suspicious and explosive packages too well known Democrats across the country\nWas founded on mostly fiercely oppose\nProsecuting Messi gators thanked the packages were sent by one person or group because they have similar markings and characteristics all were safely intercept get news of these packages are at least partially to blame for old Wall Street sell off\nThings down any ads for five hundred\nHave basically like all of their games that senior they are resetting to last year level\nSoccer Jerry will is at the New York stock exchange the Dow dropped to six hundred eight point this is talk in [noise]\n[noise] [noise]\n\nThat was you know because when it comes to the fight for some thought never saw [noise] so the big\nStory they folks is about comics that have been sent to be in the mail in some cases maybe hand delivered I Want to bring somebody on who is a true\nBomb experts we are with us Johnny ... Jones now he is a a former marine and he was an EEO detect so he was all about explosive ordnance disposal Johnny Was was wounded in combat in his role as an E. O. D. tech\nAnd that he knows everything about these devices how they're built\nHow you tracked them and what they can do a job a great to have you on that thank you so much\nYeah thanks for having me on today\nAll right so from what we know right now let's just go to the what what can we what can we say about these devices bunch pipe bombs any signatures any sophistication or lack there of what's notable to you about these bombs\nWell you know I can only go off really the the information ... big giving and and the one picture that's out there so I Want to put that out front say it's purely speculative are just going up what we see what we hear 'em in [noise] so what we saw it looks like a pipe bomb\nIt had some sort of timing device on the outside of it was doing it for both the it's\nThe idea there is this is a functional bomb what you would have the bomb did either once that time or hit a certain time in a pre determined time in its past life it would\nTurn on a lie or sell the noise and so what you do you take the same signal that same electrical signal reroute that into a circuit that detonate the bombs so that\nOne normally the light would come on the bond at night so but normally the bell would ring and an alarm clock the bond at the age of the other way it could have been used would be to arm it so it's so switches of breaking a circuit that an arming a and arming mechanism as another breaking the circuits so the circus still open\nBut wants the army and gets closed in the next thing they closed the switch will set it off so\nWe know and and the use of timing devices\nThey're used for one or two things either to pre determined when the bomb goes off for to keep yourself as the bomb maker time\nIt away from it before it's armed and so if this bomb is a functional device which I have my own doubts that are suspicious about what I could see in that picture but if it's a if it's a functional device and we certainly have to treat it that way then we would call this a time device or out of their time to arm or trying to detonate\nAnd being that it was in a field package and there seems to be no other true mechanism of of the nation than we kind of have to believe from what we can see from that picture that it's a time to detonate device meaning they said\nYou know a certain amount of hours on that timer and when it runs up it was their radically detonate\nNow that's going to be a very I mean I I Would assume Joey you I mean this this is going to be a very\nUm ... the sloppy way to try to target an individual right I mean he assumed this was actually sent through the mail to just have a timing device on it and you'd have to be guessing when it would be you know it sounds like it's more likely could blow up still a risk to people could really could kill somebody could blow up\nIn the mail processing center in the mail man's hand perhaps or you know in any number of phase is not including the targeted individual\nWell you know it's it becomes one of those talking points where I really need to think through how much is going to divulge in detail to any audience because you just never know who's listening into certain things that\nYou know our best are best kept secrets keep us alive or not go into too much detail about how boundary made\nAbout Ninety percent of what you put into a bomb as readily available at Walmart any information on the Internet\nThere's one or two components really one specific part of the bomb that is really hard to make yourself and it's even harder to get a hold of manufactured and uh and so what we have right now is if this is a fleet of I speak meaning that it could function as as as it appears to\nThen uh then that components within the pie and if they can exploit or take apart what is there\nTo recover some of those pieces then perhaps there some signatures so specific parts of the pieces that gets\nMore easily point it's in the right direction when I Would say or were you really I'm just like an off in a shipping of the package if\nYou know the one that we're looking at now seems to be the hand delivered by courier but there's questions about the postage and was it actually put through a a delivery service or\nSomeone just hand this package that's someone outside and say hey I'll give you twenty dollars and that's the only thing we don't know and those those leads those human lead\nThe tracking the shipment that's the first place will go in the meantime someone probably over at Quantico with the FBI will utilize some tools techniques we have this safely disassembled this bomb\nAnd uh and if there are specific components that are serialized or manufactured at a very low rate from one manufacturer then that's going to give us a lot of information right there and\nFor your free quote cult eight hundred for one seven fifty four forty Lance eight hundred for one seven fifty for forty eight hundred for one seven fifty four forty\nOr go to select quote dot com\nSince Nineteen eighty five we shop you save\nGet full details on the example policy of political to accomplish commercials or price can vary depending on your health issues company another factor not available and all\nThat we can you hear and you look for in the last week although actually following you are doing this I mean I I must have ten people have been yelled at until they had to leave restaurants all conservatives is that okay with you know I Am okay with Sarah Sanders secretary Nielsen\nAnd Mitch McConnell yes Mitch O'Connell is more dangerous salmonella in that restaurant any why Hillary Clinton now when I tried and I walk up and eating out or they do but I I\nIt's not clear that there was Hillary she leans there so we suddenly being unpleasant and something being okay I'll take your protesting something you're disagreeing about you know I if I got paraded children from their parents and I went to dinner in a Mexican restaurant I wouldn't ... high endorsed certain Harlem\nSo there you have the big separation okay ah especially in a day like today where we're going to be a lecture by the left about about civility all of a sudden keep in mind that that exchange that was him Tucker Carlson show not tonight but last night\nUh that exchange was between a very senior and trusted Clinton Hillary Clinton aide to Felipe rains and of course Tucker\nWho people will say looks like book so it's bucking took\nA or people say that I look like Tucker but they don't do it they don't know anything because clearly Tucker looks like me uh but they're having a search engine you notice that that he makes it clear rains makes it clear that to him and this is true of many other Democrats are I Know\nThe harassment and stocking and mob tactics of the left against politicians are people they don't like\nThat's acceptable they don't say oh\nSorry this is just some other thing you know this is just some other group that we don't we don't endorse or we're not associated with this isn't representative of us\nThey actually try to justify this behavior and I keep having to point out to people that the the line between\nIf are at a restaurant and forty people were up in my face and I was with my girlfriend or my spouse or whatever or or even just the family members or friends\nAnd people were cursing at me and yelling at me and threatening me the line between that activity and someone getting their nose broken on either by me or\nBuy them right I mean on one side or the other is that line is\nVery thin very small all it takes is one person who thinks they're going to give you a little shy of one person who just cross easily they're already screaming your face they're already yelling at a restaurant there already embarrassing you humiliating you and trying to intimidate you\nYou really think that our for one of them to all of a sudden you know get a little shrug it a little push and things get out of control\nYou know the answer to that\nBut what so important is that the less I you know as soon as those idiots went after Nancy Pelosi I said in every other conservative that I Know and and respect\nCame out and said those people are are more on what they're doing is a disgrace and not only is their behavior wrong but by acting in that way and they they really did the progressive left it to the ... the wing of the Democratic party a big favor\nA boat\nOh by the way they talk specifically about that and rains 'cause they they have to pretend there's some consistency Rangel say as he did a Carlson oh no that's okay what did it flows he's okay put Twenty one\nSo is it okay to scream at Nancy Pelosi until she leaves her restaurant and the answer is no it's not okay I'd never okay I think what happened that she thought she was fine\nThe other day she was ... and ... she was pregnant with her any you don't see any of us up and said they asked people how many ... until you leave the palm because you have a pop use foreign policy I disagree with [noise]\nI think it all for let's say you got to ... and that's not what happened was I just don't do it because they're not lost faith in the last ...\nLook I think it needs to be said and I appreciate the Tucker set it and you know thank God that people like soccer have the kind of platform may do or they can push back on this nonsense conservative we had a\nPolitical culture and in our political culture in this country is unacceptable to a you know surround people when they are engaged in private activity now who say they're in public but I mean they're not\nThey're not out of you know they're not on stage they're not and look I think their behavior when they're on stage is bad but it's just it's just different degrees right it's one thing if you want to make a lot of noise and heckle people on Capitol Hill I think that's childish and stupid and you should get arrested but I don't think that it's\nYou know I I don't think it's certainly dangerous to the people right at the Capitol police there and there's you know those cameras there but when you're in a restaurant and you think that you know ... where does that stop\nWhat about waiting for somebody outside their home\nYou know I Wonder if the Democrats think about that can forty people wait wait outside your apartment and and uh on Capitol Hill or in what you know downtown Washington DC if you're a member of the house the Senate\nAnd and they can they follow you can they fall ever you go you know this whole notion of there in public so they can be a target of our disdain now oh they're in a restaurant I mean I really get angry when I hear them a Democrat\nSaid things like oh sorry the kids just you know enjoy their frog legs as I sit there at the table well people are losing their health care of it just is childish talking points stupidity you know you hear a lot of the older the ... or you know the roast chicken while the poor people of America are suffering right I mean they they try to create this whole narrative\nJustify their whiny childish ... which is really a very common and very widespread characteristic of activists Democrats they're whining screening children and they act\nOut and they throw tantrums and then they want the media to tell them that those tantrums are okay and the media does an important political figures I mean as much as you think this guy Felipe rains are Ryan represents names important\nSo this is this is the distinction\nThey're not hiding that they're okay with this behavior not only do they do this stuff and we really don't or at least we rarely our side rarely does they celebrate they endorse when their side is engaged in mob tactics and they really hope that the American people forget that before election\nDay [noise] really interesting study I saw this week about how people ah don't really trust Facebook that much anymore that's really not surprising is that when you see all of the stories out there about shadow banning about\nGaining the algorithm so bad it pushes progressive causes and shuts off discussion about things like the second amendment about free speech about any number of issues that are really important too conservative that's why we needed space where there's none of that\nAgenda or censorship nippy dot com maybe dot com is a new social media platform that you can join and share your thoughts and know that there's nothing getting in the way of your conversations with whoever you want you can follow people check out the news feed look at what's your favorite writers up to and put your thoughts their\n... and I P P. Y. dot com again ... dot com no censorship no agenda let your opinions be heard\nIt's the United states but that doesn't mean is that everybody is a criminal\nYeah of course not everybody's going suggesting that everyone's are criminal and there are women and children\nYou know America is such a big hearted country and our people are\nGenerally speaking so kind and so welcoming actually of outsiders and that often gets lost in this discussion that's why to remember that we we have\nWe are bringing a million people a year into the American family either us citizens or as green card holders every year a million people every single year ten years have passed we have ten million new either permanent residents were citizens in this country who are formerly citizens of another country where at least\nPermanent residents of another country\nWe're bringing people all the time and huge numbers\nThrough our legal immigration system and yet we are told that if we don't take this group of refugees were that group of refugees are this group of illegals or that group of illegal that were terrible people and we're a century the equivalent of white nationalist\nAnd those if you were listening or not white and who agree with me on all these issues you're not a white nationalist according to the left you're just a I guess the nationalist but nonetheless\nA which is you know they also think is a very very very bad thing I saw a CNN trying to make some trying to make some hay of that you know oh it's a nationalist and the giants and not think it was actually Jeff ... who who said it\nDoesn't really mean it doesn't mean not to use them to try to get them and and you know one of the anchors at at CNN or one of the correspondence whatever's oh no we know we know would match with SARS terrible terrible\nWhat he said oh of course it is um they they want to get away from the story of the caravan um because the left realizes that this is a loser for them going into the election and they're they're constantly dealing with the following tension\nOr the tension that comes from\nNot being able to tell them this is true the Democrats in general they are not able to tell the American people what they really think and what they really believe\nAnd maintain their electoral prospects in the ... they're the ones who always have to play this game on things like immigration which is why that Obama soundbite where he said you know you can't you can't sneak into this country it's not allowed or we're not going to let people just surge into into this place\nSome people as a I think it was ... to the New York times wrote oh I thought Obama was you know we're so are you know so pro illegals it's like yeah he's lying when he says that he wants to secure the border she get she can't figure that out apparently a but but you see this time and again we're the left is just being dishonest about\nWhat they really want and um you know this this was new you have a MSNBC where the guy blaming the Reagan administration's they play quid tend please say that they also\nNeed to call out the fair Margaret Traub has no one other thing I Would add to that when Democrats should it ought\nTo say is that people playing some of these countries are playing some of these countries because of conditions created by Republican foreign policy particularly in the Reagan Administration is
