{"month": "10", "state": "AL", "station": "WERC", "content": "On a cable news show when when keep in mind there's a guy who I interviewed a what was it maybe a few weeks ago who is a sports\nCaster [noise] and he said something about about boobs on he said that he you know I forget what it was exactly but he made some reference to the female Oregon that is called by some uh boobs and\nIt was a big like oh my gosh you can't say that I don't see another excuse me so this is like when she was all\nOver and it was a big problem [noise] but then you add what just happened there [noise] where there's obviously a very [noise] racially\nInflammatory language being used in and people laughing and and mocking Kanye West to look I Know that he's a provocateur tour and people have all these very strong opinions on it but\nI I think that there was a line crossed there and I'm I don't understand how anyone doesn't feel like there was a La Crosse there\nBut you also get a bit of a window into how the left at this moment in time as they are grasping for reasons that are grasping for for ways to justify a their intolerance of other ideas\nThe the rabid way which they approach trying to destroy their enemies either ... we have so few celebrities are on the right that speak or\nSoap operas alright period and we have so few people that come out and and espouse conservative principles that was somewhat of a ... a level in celebrity land says anything about being pro Trump H there's this mob yes there's that word again this mob mentality to\nTear him down immediately it's one thing if they want to say who cares but think about what a disparity there is in this realm you'll every idiot\nCelebrity I Know we talked about you know I'm not saying she's an idiot but we're talking I don't know we're talking about Taylor Swift in her effort to help the Democrats in Tennessee in all these different celebrities out there you know George Clooney I mean name one Tim Robbins and Susan surrender these these people were all just\nAbsolute hardcore left these Alec Baldwin\nAnd it was a really good actor I Wish he wasn't such a common in all of them are on this one side and then you add it all the music artists to this is always the big joke with\nWhenever there's inauguration parties like the Obama inauguration parties where the the top recording artist in the world and the Trump recording artists\nWere [noise] I don't know who's that guy told me he wasn't he one of them will pull to boot in your is that a ... that's a different song actually the different artist I don't know\nUh I also I like I think it's Clint Black Iraq them up and I roll I don't know there's some great some great country anthems that I still remember up there I should listen to more country music that's that's one thing that's\nThat is that's come out of this conversation that I Can't think of any like if someone's who's your favorite country artist John I'd I'd have to go with I don't know [noise] Garth Brooks just because he's only when I can think of off the top of my head no no she economy is Garth Brooks at no come on [noise] anyway\nUh well we don't have any of these artists and Tanya is out there and he said people are what are you talking about like yeah look I Adam Baldwin Nick Searcy a James Woods is Twitter account is awesome I mean there's some conservatives out there for sure but we have one high level music act like this\nAnd really more of a cult look he's more of a cultural icon not that I'm some big ... fan or\nIs it ... or you see John that we call and with the shorthand it must be a when it's just why eat right\nYeah that's right I work I mean technically I work for her media so I feel like I Need to know more about the music industry lingo show but it but they're they're piling on him and why was because [noise] they resent any\nLoss of their ability to have a total echo chamber on the left when it comes to or echo chamber fucking love when it comes to any cultural\nA music Hollywood figure\n... they they cannot abided they cannot deal with it and I can't deal with 'em like they cannot psychologically process it it it concerns them it worries them they don't they don't know what they would do they don't know how they would handle it if they didn't have all the celebrities that they know what I'm saying oh you're so great and climate change is terrible and\nOh all the stuff people really really do need to get it need to get a grip [noise] and uh that's\nThat's my that's one of my main takeaways from all this but um I'll just note that the\nIRS or for a moment we have a some others but so the hurricane Mike is made landfall right do we hold on to say here here's what we've got on this so far\nThe biggest concern is if everybody that uh the the people that chose not to evacuate I I spent time the last few days going up and down the coast getting people to evacuate but this is a\nHorrible horrible storm a hundred and fifty plus miles an hour a disease twelve inches of rain but the thing that people I think don't realize is the storm surge whether ... or fourteen feet it's all deadly\nAnd I'm very concerned that people are not taking that into consideration so we are ready to respond if we can help anybody now that chose not to evacuate ah they have to hunker down and take care of themselves a we have nice ten thousand people that are already free physicians that get the power back on\nBut I Am scared to death and people that chose not to go back in fact the way this is they just say her when a storm and [noise]\nThat's the Governor Scott in Florida numbers or Mike first of all obviously thoughts and prayers everybody is affected I Know we've got a lot of great listeners a lot of folks down in Florida and we just hope everybody everyone down in and say this is going to be All right through this whole thing it feels like this storm was kind of a\nKind of snuck up on people right because the the hurricane before this there was a lot of oh this is going to be a huge and we we I mean I remember seeing it way out in the Atlantic I'm like that you know is that the Canary Islands like what's going on over there and and then this one though got really big really fast one was already close to ... am I Am I mistaken him that notion\nYeah no this one came out of nowhere and usually don't get many hurricanes up the Gulf Coast right [noise] I mean it's coming up to a point where if they're not used to seeing it like clear water beach Naples like that area I haven't seen it usually it's usually from the Atlantic and write\nA better the the east coast of the four oh well I Hope everyone is All right I I'm ... I'm hearing that there's been a lot of lot of people decided not to evacuate and [noise] you know we we just like I said doesn't preserve it what what are more coming up you're in a second on the continued fought from\nKavanaugh left is still just [noise] living in this fantasy land of of they're going to raise this whole Kavanaugh situation they're going to find a way to to make it like it never happened and I just got to tell you I find that a distressing [noise]\nUm but I have a solution for everybody I have a way I think the shutdown that talk not just going to complain about them complaining about cabinet I'm gonna tell you how we can get them to shut up about Kavanaugh [noise]\nI was I was visiting with books about his show on home title fraud with retired FBI agent demonstrated a crime dislike everywhere is called home title fraud\nIn a simple because all home titles are kept on line in fact the FBI guy in home title locked found the title to bucks family's home they forged id and showed him how easy it is to transfer title and lose your home had of been real this thief would've taken out loans using books home is equity\nThey wouldn't even have known until late payments ... showed up in that identity theft protection we have it does not cover titled fraud look if you own a home or rentals were have elderly parents get home title lock\nFor pennies a day home title luck puts a virtual barrier around your host titled the instant they detect sinister activity their own at helping to shut it down their homes title may already be compromise you know sign up and get a free title scan and report\nIt was a hundred dollar value free at whole title luck dot com [noise]\nThis is talk on justice mark Reuben had it all planned out he and his girlfriend had flown down to Walt Disney world from New York and he planned a magical moment at the magic kingdom he was going to propose right in front of Cinderella Castle but the magic didn't quite happen\nAnd now robots go into court according to the Orlando Sentinel Ruben was just about ready to propose but he was waiting for some of his friends to come back from the concession stand problem was the big Disney parade was about to start\nA Disney worker told Ruben he had to move from his perfect proposal spots\nHe asked for a few more minutes she refused it was an argument the worker claims Ruben grab during threatened her a manager was called Ruben was led away to security and charged with disorderly conduct and find one hundred dollars\nBut now Reuben is suing Disney charging false arrest negligence and asking for more than Fifteen thousand dollars in damages do these guys who will respond to the lawsuit in court\nWith Fox on justice Hank wind loom Fox News\nHe was radio nine sixty tell you we are seeing Birmingham head on line nine sixty tell you we are seeing dot com\nI harsh radio sci fi eight o'clock [noise]\nTennessee in in the Florida Panhandle ... Fox News fast moving hurricane Michael now over Georgia or several tornadoes were reported but not before uprooting trees down and power lines and causing flooding in the Florida Panhandle at least one person was killed\nBut now you started to get into the weak points in our whole system the weak point being that if you have people were operating entirely in bad faith there really aren't any limits on it\nReally ... there aren't any limits on an investigation you do have a right to a speedy trial and hopefully a judge would enforce that although these days who knows but you do not have the rights we should be the investigation in fact in an investigation\nCan go on at ... at for for years on it and bankrupt you some people I Know there's some people have actually taking deals meaning they've they pleaded guilty to something just to make the investigation just to make the investigation and the process and the the trial making all stop\nBecause they they're already\nThe process is the punishment so the same way that also and Obama did this rather speaking about shredding constitutional norms Obama decided that using prosecutorial discretion he would\nEffectively abrogate immigration law and say that if you're here illegally you're not going to that you will not be deported we will create an extra legal process for you wonder you know the following conditions and he did that all under what is effectively prosecutorial discretion\nThere are lots of ways that the system can be abused if they are going to abuse the I used to be of the mind more of a I guess it's a traditionalist William F Buckley style can serve I used to be the mind up you know we have to we have to maintain the principles that he that they show quickly abandon\nBut from what I see happening in our politics today I take a position of you know we we've got actually beat them we've got to win otherwise we just suffer and hope that there'll be better times when there's plenty of reason to believe that actually things will just keep getting worse\nAnd that's why yes there is there is a part of me that especially in the aftermath of the capital and on any issue related to Kavanaugh says you've got to fight fire with fire and in this case that means if they were\nDo this thing with Hillary we got to have the da da da da de la ... told me who was fired let's remember that was fired from the FBI and is also I Believe under investigation for possible leaking classified material\nLet's let's take a look at ah at what the FBI determination would be or rather the deal Jay ... actually makes a decision not the FBI but whether to bring charges\nLet's see what the what the deejay determination is about Hillary's emails this time around\nAll bought no we we shouldn't drag the country back into that they wanted the Democrats are openly advocating for dragging the country back into that mess\nThat mess speaking the FBI by the way\nYou know Rand Paul is that a tough year year and a half\nRand Paul is holding the FBI feet to the fire a little bit on something that used to get a lot of attention including in conservative circles and that is all this warrantless spying step you'd think they'd give it all the Russia collusion insanity this would be a bigger topic here's what here's what Rand Paul to say\nWhile the FBI by largest full of good people yourself included you have had some bad apples you had Peter Struck and his girlfriend talking about trying to bring the president town you've had people bringing their politics to work\nThe concern of us who want more control over what you do and how you look at data\nIs that as Madison said men are not angels that's why we have the constitution that's where we ask you to get a warrant the information you gather in the foreign database is not constitutional and the sense that has gathered with no bar there is no warrant there is no\nConstitutional manner to that matter to that data and yet you once and then use it on domestic crime that has been our complained for years and years and years that you should not be allowed to access that data without a warrant to\n[noise] I agree and I have to say it's a little concerning the given that now on the right we are very aware of the fact that the FBI deal Jay and the intelligence community or in part weaponized against Trump\nThat there has not been any real change in how these process these work or certainly there's been no legislation to prevent this from happening again\nIn remember this all happened after we already had the IRS targeting of the Tea Party it is this all happened after we should have been aware that our political opponents in in our own country\nWe're willing to abuse the apparatus of government reporters and purposes and there's been no real change there's been you know instead of Democrats pretending like none of us really happened\nThey thought they were going to prove Trump Russia collusion all they're really proven is that the government\nIs full of some deep state leftists who are completely and utterly willing to abuse whatever authority they have to achieve partisan end so you'd think it calls for more oversight and maybe some legislation but uh apparently not [noise]\nTeam it is an honor and privilege to bring in my thoughts on all the things that matter to us as Americans every day and you know

issue of twenty Eighteen\nIs health care I've seen polling suggests this is the case that people are likely to cast votes based upon their perception of health care what is\nReally going on here what is the state of health care right now as it relates to the midterms and just in general what's going on because somebody can answer this question force over Roy is with us now\nIs the president for the foundation for research on equal opportunities also a Forbes\nEditor over great to have you\nSay buck so a ... first of all is this is this concept would you say it's accurate I mean are are we are we seeing data to suggest that people as much as we all get told by the media it's all about\nTrump's tweets and Russia collusion and Kavanaugh that it actually might be health care the tips the balance of the of the house in the Senate to one or the other side of the ...\nWell I I haven't seen any polling data fucking I've looked at it pretty closely at this particular question I haven't seen any polling data to suggest that health care right now his motives motivating people to turn out\nAh for November of having a obviously is a much bigger driver but I Will say that if Democrats are successful at retaking the house or whether or not to take the Senate they just take the house\nUm and even if they don't somehow whatever happened the midterms are going to be or even though the fuck your listeners know this was seen as the midterms over literally within hours limit turns being over what are we going to start talking about the twenty twenty presidential election in particular in this case\nThe Democratic primary for who's going to challenge Trump and what that primary is going to be all about but it's all going to be about\nWho is going to outbid who who's going to be the crude blue purists on single payer Democrats in the primary for president are going to fight over this issue and what Trump is doing in this op ed is he's firing his initial salvo for his reelection campaign\nSo ... where is the health care debate right now for ... between Republicans and Democrats as it stands today I mean you're you're mentioning or you're you're talking about where the left will go after this election whereas the left positioning itself to Democrats positioned themselves right now and and what is the Republican pitch on health care\nYou know one of the things that's been fairly interesting and you may have talked about this on your program in the past is that democratic ads about health care and the midterms are actually they're spending more money on health care as the Republicans are\nThey're talking a lot about this Texas lawsuit\nA which aims to overturn Obamacare be out by attacking the preexisting conditions provision and Obamacare\nAnd so what you have a lot of democratic congressmen and candidates saying is that Republican I'm running against he's against protecting you from a high insurance premium because they're pre existing conditions\nOn for protecting you from that move from me so there is a lot of these rape is a lot of talk about pre existing conditions in when I'm\nOn Capitol Hill I hear that all the time members asking me like you know what should we do about pre existing conditions so that that is that's the thing you're hearing a lot of it you're not hearing so much about single payer the single payer thing is really about twenty twenty\nSingle payer you think is now going to or I should say is going to be the Democratic party's official ... official position on healthcare once we're heading into twenty twenty you're you're confident that\nI'm certain of is just like repeal and replace for the Republicans right like what Republicans wanted to be against repealing Obamacare running in elections in the last ten years right similarly progressive to dominate the left wing primaries in the Democratic party\nIf you don't say you're for single payer you're not going to win\nAt all you're going to have a primary challenge so every Democrat feels that pressure from the left and frankly most of them\nGenuinely philosophically want single payer even though they believe most most intelligent Democrats believe it's unrealistic and could never happen they do feel sufficiently would they would prefer government takeover of health care system so yeah they're not going to\nThey're not going to deny that therefore single air they're going to say yeah I'm for single or they're all that time over each other to talk about how pro single payer there\nHow how accurate worthy early GOP projections\nThat I always you know oh that you've been involved this discussion stretching back for a long time but how accurate were the projections of how damaging and bad Obamacare would be you know I remember this was like the fiercest political discussion in the country back in the early days of the Obama administration has it been\nDog whistles folks dog whistles another way of saying I'm gonna call Republicans racist or something that's not racist but I can pretend it is if I say it's a dog whistle as the Reverend Al Sharpton who some will remember from when he was pedaling the yes the rape hoax\nPerpetrated by wanna Brawley who went on to lose\nIn court a defamation case settled this she than a sexually refuse to pay and it has since moved into obscurity Africa they did some update on to want to Brawley a few years ago and found that she was living somewhere and just trying to avoid having to pay anything on the defamation settlement that she\nUh she lost so you can imagine when you hear today from people saying\nOh are you blaming the victim well the court blamed the so called victim there are these so called survivor 'cause she wasn't a victim are survivors we found out\nBut let's say focus for a moment on they stop and frisk point because Trump brought this up he gave his speech was early in the week mentioned stop and frisk for Chicago and here's what they say about this\nThey won't claim that New York the most visible single place to have instituted a stop and frisk policy and it was done under Mayor Bloomberg was we know from today a Democrat Bloomberg [noise]\nIt was a Democrat he was an independent member remember when he says you those those are those speeches about the snow and then and then they would they had the interpreter and and and but Bloomberg would go into a little like he'd be like\n... Mayor Bloomberg God Bless you all you know he would do as little Bloomberg\nEspanol ... I I that was great that was great those are similar ties producer Mike Mayor Bloomberg would slip into his hundred words of Spanish that he's spoken order just let it let New Yorkers know\nThat uh you know\nThe snow is cold and they will move it we we wrap you do that was only a scene the Blasio coming wow we we didn't know what we had\nYou see the Blasio or that we buy the ways so there's the mayor of New York city in case anybody a needs to be told that\nA major city hit somebody ... was talking to housing for the homeless he's like I'm Sorry I'm In the middle of my work out it's like oh you mean that work out that you do at the gym that requires a fleet of SUVs and take you an hour from the mayor's mansion\nIt cause you liked that Jim in Brooklyn but this guy doesn't do anything all day it's an hour to get there an hour to get back he works out I guess per hour we know that he spends all of his time on the elliptical let's be real lotta stretching it a lot of electrical\nAnd then when somebody comes up to them in the gym is a public official he gets all Snoopy about it he says he's is nippy says that the man anyway um I just I'm just saying Bloomberg maybe running as a as a Democrat\nOr he was the one or he's going to run as a Democrat at least that's what people are saying as of today run for the twenty twenty race\nHe had stop and frisk what a stop and frisk alright it allows people to allow law enforcement to on\nA reasonable suspicion stop and talk to you and then if they think it is necessary for safety they can pat you down\nNow they say that this is inherently racist and the reason for that is that you have\nLarge number of these stop and frisk the hundreds and thousands hundreds of thousands of these stops that occurred over a period of many years in New York they say oh well you have a disproportionate number of\nA black and Hispanic males who were stopped and I talked to or poor padded down looking for weapons\nAnd some people say it's racist interesting when you actually crunch the numbers on that you find out that as a as it relates to the proportion in New York City of crimes committed by people who fall on the demographic of black or Hispanic males they were actually stopped black [noise]\nWhen you control for the number of crimes committed by people in different categories less than their share overall but still people say it's bad optics and they say that it looks bad and then they they point to the fact that New York is in a ... it continued downward trajectory on crime but is that\nA reality for America's biggest city has been ongoing for a long time you know this is like showing up in in the in the final\nStages of something and saying well this is this happened because I showed up but it's like the oh it was already happening in the crime was already happening\nThe only point I think it's fair to make on this is a conservative all of them did say to get rid of stop and frisk there'll be a big spike in crime and we haven't seen that in New York City okay so that's a little bit of a back road on stopping for Trump is saying let's just stop and frisk in Chicago\nAt the ACLU types and all and they freak out of a stop and frisk but here's the thing about to stop and frisk in Chicago nobody\nHas any ideas for how to make Chicago a less crime ridden place I mean the the number of shootings people think of ... and I looked at it obviously is going to get the most headlines because when you have a weekend in Chicago with twelve people killed\nOr you know more than that it's when we get whatever it is I mean they've had these these weakens with forty fifty people shot you look at the numbers shot at a low it's in a low thousands in Chicago all and people getting shot or stabbing a given year that's a lot of people\nThat are getting shot no one has any solutions or any ideas for this all I hear from lips\nAnd I get to talk to them when they come on on the hill\nTV show all year from lives is we need to invest more in schools I'm like yeah 'cause that's why the gang bangers selling drugs it it's it's because there's not enough investment a local public school would come on this isn't serious but they they have no idea is no solutions for whatsoever and what you find is that\nYou know they don't want to talk about real structural change like why do we all the studies show that the biggest single terminal whether a neighborhood if you know how many single parents are are in a neighborhood statistically speaking you have a very good sense of what the crime rate will be\nAnd that when you control for intact household meaning you know a\nA mother and father both in the household the crime rate is essentially the same across all\nUh all all cultures and all ethnic backgrounds so you can have the structural conversation about why there's a balance of places like Chicago or you can't talk about more aggressive policing and say that's raises and at\nThe end of the day this is where you see one of these liberal policies that they think they're being do good or is there protecting the civil rights of minorities but you're just going to have having more people getting shot and they have no answers to it and that that Sharpton\nHe's running around and demagogue ing well as sharp as what it does struggling\nRuns around and and demagogues and things but that that he's willing to do it on this issue with so little pushback from anyone in the media just goes to show you that some of these old paradigms just ... just don't go away\nLiberals would prefer to call Republicans\nRacist and as sharp and to just say their dog whistling then to seriously consider proposals that would save lives and this was the there was a breaking point in New York you know Giuliani came in a numbers ... numbers based policing a concert that\nAll that was done and the liberals were howling and shrieking or that too but then they realize oh you mean the city is going to be a lot safer I Hope the same thing can happen to Chicago\nI Hope they managed to get this violence situation under control that are not going to hold my breath because Democrats are in charge [noise]\nGlobal verification

emotional support squirrel I'm sympathetic on the other hand I feel like if I were there and I was told\nThat somebody was holding up my flight for a couple of hours so that they could have their emotional support squirrel handy or I might make some squirrel could Bob I might just lose it\nAnd I bet squirrels probably not a particularly tasty meat [noise] but I Would see I find out one way or
