or maybe maybe Booker\nBut they really think it's going to be Warren and you know here's somebody who is entirely unremarkable in her career we're not for racial fraud racial fraud you know if you lie about the assets you have in the bank to get a loan to go to jail you know a lot of trouble prison federal prison\nAnd if you lie about that you get it all a lot of trouble if you lie about\nYour race

won't let go she has never owned up to this she has never said it she came out and said you know what I disagree with the racial spoils system\nI did this knowing that I could get away with it because I don't believe that this is ethical you know but maybe she could claim but I also think I have enough but technically I caught technically I qualified no\nInstead she pulled this whole high

like the NFL kneeling thing\nYou know Trump is incredible at picking means areas he he it really is like a political six sense that he has he knows that he can pick things that the less just get so fired up an energized about that they lose sight of whether it's a political winter for them or not\nAnd you know the NFL nearing for example the less thought oh and and these different players who obviously we're dealing with the media narrative around this was over the players they thought that the players would went out and that all these teams would eventually allow kneeling\nAnd Trump kept poking at this ... you know you guys better stand shoulder\nBecause Trump understands that at the end of the day a vast majority of the American people want respect to be shown for the flack Moore show them that love football people want respect shown for the flag Trump knew that he understood that\nAnd when he refers to Elizabeth Warren as Pocahontas\nHe knows that the left is going to jump in all my gosh he's being a racist white Pocahontas was a historical figure we all know from the Disney movie which was by the way not one of the better Disney movies out there uh I was very does and I'm somebody who really like the early Disney movies of that era you know Lion King I'd beauty and the beast a great movie\nThe original or will he gets on radio but the old school Robin Hood where he's a Fox so great it's a great cartoon if your kids haven't seen that one of my favorite cartoons cartoons used to be way better than they are now now there's\nA the cartoons that are making for kids these days\nBut he knows when he calls born Pocahontas they all go oh he's raised they jump on this but what what a lot of us who are just normal people who are not emotionally destabilized left is what we hear is why are they why are they defending\nElizabeth Warren being called the ... you know she's not a Native American right we all understand this so why do they act like this to some big slide against Native Americans the point is she's a fake she's a phoney\nAnd Pocahontas is a very well known female Native American in in our history you know there are others but Pocahontas was probably the most well known I mean you could say she's not the most historically significant I'm sure I'm about to get an angry email from somebody\nBought the era coordination and how it was a matriarchal society and how they were the basis for our U.S Constitution\nAnd who were some really interesting were vision is out there about\nA native peoples in America and how technologically and politically

you know you can call me crazy but but with the war in thing are we going or Pocahontas\nAnd you'll notice that one of the themes we're hitting on in the show\nThe left deserves to be mocked what has

great\nUh there's also the\nMaps like such as the Iraq and the south Africa such as that\nYoung woman you know very beautiful young woman and sprayed oh in it and it was the Miss America pageant a thinker and his team usa pageant or whatever it was\nAnd and she uh she got a little caught up in her answer and didn't really know what the heck she was saying and I know what that's like you know sometimes I've gotten really tired and an ... using the lovely young woman's ... of course right I'm excusing whatever\nUm but I don't know if I caught myself but Ocasio Cortez had a moment\nThat reminds me of that I just wanted to play this for you there's so much here this was on MSNBC over the weekend this is the favorite new Congress Congress woman of the progressive left\nAnd here's the kind of stuff that she offers up in terms of her analysis of what's going on with the Congress this is going to be delicious play a clip on\nAnd you're also coming really as an outsider in a moment watching people like watching what happened today and want to storm the gates you're going to actually do that as well that's what's what's your plan [laughter] well\nI think a lot of changing our strategy around with that you know there's a lot of hype baseball and inside the beltway will use that term thrown around but\nThere are very few organizers little Congress and I think that organizers operate differently if for different kind of strategy and what it is really about organize all\nThat work organizing on some level of strategic in our actions ... bring together a coastal strategy blood pressure on the shoulders of any kind of only focus on the pressures fine but that's really interesting thought [laughter]\nJohn did you that's really interesting I Love groups have jumped through the ... what do you rather that was straight out of the Mario Lopez playbook that quip because she was like thank you very much ms tendency like lead to do this like deep voice announcer men thing after like such as Matt\nOcasio Cortez I mean that was\nJohn can you jump to the middle of that again just where she started talking about organizing could you do that 'cause I I don't wanna hear the whole thing you did I just want to hear the\nOh okay well close enough\nYeah it's like organizing is like like so what's different about organizers is with the organizing is that they organized and like outside the box and you know close the loop on the organizing of the organizational and there's like the Congress with the organizers and they're just like so much of that\nStuff [laughter]\nShe was I mean John I'm not being unfair right and that was one of the craziest word salads I've ever heard on television I think she was trying to find what you wanted to say yes that's right because she couldn't get to a point as very astute analysis I mean she she comes out\nAnd you're thinking to yourself like okay I kinda know where she's going she's a community organizer she wants to borrow from the Obama playbook of you know community organizing isn't just a way of doing\nYou know agitation at public education and pursue\nOf personal political uh goals\nRight it's not just whipping people up into a ... style mob there's something more to it than that\nBut then she just gets lost and she's ... she's she's looking for the articulate soundbite that's programmed into her mind because so much a progressive ism is really\nThis learn the language of trigger warnings and like hierarchies of patriarchy and victim allergy and white privilege and checking your privilege and there's this whole other lingo and these phrases that come with it and she's looking for ... you know she's looking to lock into that\nBut she got a little lost and then you realize like she's not really thinking about what you're saying\nYou know this is like when Al Al Sharpton does it resists we much like the resist you know you realize he's reading off the prompt or but he's not actually thinking about the words that he sang Ocasio Cortez had is uh R. E. S. P. I. C. T.\nWe should keep that as a we should keep it as a drop job just to have for you know important moments like this R. E. S. P. I. C. T.\nThat was one of my favorites uh anyway\nYeah OK either court says this is the the great the great hope of progressive in this election is that she's a part of a crop of new insurgent left wing candidates who are pushing for a\n... openly advocating for socialism catchy defined socialism now\nBut like she has an economics degree a country defined Marxism no cause she tell you much about marks or angles no\nBut she sounds right to the left and if you sound right and come from the right group right the right identity group they give you a tremendous amount of deference and that's what you see happening here uh I I Would just note that my fear\nAnd I I Know I'm On this and I'm now I'm going to be banging the warning drawing this way advanced and you're like buck come on ... great unbelievable jobs numbers everything's going so well and I agree and that's because of Trump because of the Republicans that are in charge now and it's I think it's gonna keep going for a while here is what I'm telling you though\nRight now we can mock the socialist and he's left us in the Democratic party because they sound foolish and we know their ideas are foolish and people are in a frame of mind or they will\nReason through it and understand you know anybody who is paying attention and knows anything you know are not limousine liberals and for people or people for whom politics is really just an emotional game and it's all about virtue signaling they just want to talk about how they're\nYou know ... Marxist and redistributing the wealth and everything 'cause it makes them feel good about themselves they don't think of the economic consequences my concern\nIs that we are going to have a structural economic reset because of the debt and because of the accumulation particularly of corporate debt load and you see that with all these these high you'll bonds that are ... and the corporate debt structures for some of these companies are never going to be able to actually make good on their obligations\nRising interest rates any massive\nUh well we have a trillion dollar student loan debt which is a problem I don't think it's catastrophic problem but any of our troops ... trillion dollars of debt and you have rising interest rates and I just see that at some point you're going to have a cyclical reset\nAnd that's what all of a sudden when people really get ahead and unemployment checks up even if it's cleaning out the system in a sense even if it's just a necessary part of the economic life cycle ... when people will be open to the idea of socialism in America not you not me but\nThere'll be a much bigger swath of America wants to hear about free health care free college free this free that the rich will pay the rich will pay\nA and I think that day is coming\nI think that historically\nIf you just look back I think there's a a a historical cycle that we will we will enter into here I don't know if it's gonna be the next two years but it will occur in my opinion during the Trump presidency because Trump's and the president for eight years that's all we have to be on guard for and that's why the educating of the public\nOn these issues of the economy and government interference the economy has to happen now and we have to stay vigilant we can't just mock we have to also tackled the arguments\nOn the left about socialism because when the time is right they will make a real play for global verification\nNetworks is the answer to all your background investigation and vetting company needs this is a veteran owned and operated institution my friends when you are hiring people for your business however large or small your business maybe whatever field you're in\nYou need background investigations done and you want somebody that you can trust that does it quickly efficiently and does not outsource or offshore to work or your data\nThat's why you on global verification network\nDoing this because this is what he thinks needs to happen for the country did this is real he is in fact doing public service although he's not the kind of guy who refers to as such\nBut each show important that there's somebody now who will mock and ridiculed the left because there is a certain breed of conservative\nSo I mean you might even be thinking about you know some names that come to mind but there's a certain type of conservative that finds mocking the last to be beneath\nWe should get knocked all the time we should be called\nRacist inbred hillbilly beer drinking NASCAR drivers you know because we're concerned right and and so they paint with is really broad brush and they just make fun of us\nYou know we're all a bunch of Bible thumping races you know middle aged white males that the Republican Party the left and they just hammer that culturally all the time and we're just supposed to take it\nYou know the old conservatism the kind of Weekly Standard conservatism that was dominant intermediate discourse for a long time\nThat's faded away now it's no no you're gonna make fun of us we're going to make fun of you know you're going there ... they made fun of\nBush and said his eyes were too close together and he could use a Monica one set of glasses and he's in ... and all this stuff\nThey did that for years and years Bush never really hit back nobody in the UP really hit back McCain didn't really hit back Ronnie didn't really hit back\nWe actually need somebody who when we're when we see what the opposition is willing to do will will fight fire with fire these people or clowns polo she and Booker and Feinstein and\nBlumenthal and just go to these people are jokers\nOnly it's not funny because they're really doing harm to the country and they're willing to destroy people into very dishonest things in the process\nYou know and they're delusional\nThey deserve to be mocked they need to be ridiculed they want to step in public life not just conservatives that need to sit there and take it and deal with this any more\nAnd that's this is important like right okay [noise] ridiculing what should be ridiculed in the progressive left is not just a little sweetener the Trump throws in their free speech is we need more of that we need him to own the lives\nAll during our lives we've heard the word Campbell invent\nThat I can make this putt life the gamble you want to buy a chance to win a new truck when most of us was quite innocent\nThere are some people who are more serious about gambling kind of been far more of them they can afford to keep you or someone you know as a gambling problem their views held simply called to one one and we'll get you to help you we'll be Alabama jumps along compulsive gambling\nReminding you responsible but don't bet your life on it [noise]\nFox News I'm Carmen Robert I Want to apologize to Brett and the entire capital family\nPresident Trump has jumped is Kevin I'll take the oath of office today for a second time he officially became an associate justice of the Supreme Court on Saturday and immediately started researching pending cases I take\nThis office with gratitude no bitterness\nAnd what may be a reaction to the sexual assault allegations against him he became the first justice to hire all women as his law clerk closing down from Michael residents of the Florida Panhandle getting ready for hurricane\nDamage you get three days of water in three days of food and make sure all medications are ready now\nFlorida governor Rick Scott says Michael May slammed the stayed with it as a category three hurricane with windows at least one hundred eleven miles an hour and the Houston\nAstros headed to the championship series\n\n[noise] this is a go find out if you know what all when it comes to children I'm George now [noise]\nMain one of the leading killer of us children age once or Thirteen [noise] what's the best way to protect children in a car crash [noise] at what agents guys with the child start using a booster see where it can you find the answers to these questions\nI\nCar crashes are one of the leading killer of us children many of those cats can be prevented by making sure that kids are in the right seat for their age in science to understand you know at all when it comes to car seats for your child go to the for car dot com slash the right seat and now for sure\nThat's safer car dot com slash the right seat ... by the national Highway Traffic Safety Administration and the ad council\nHe's holding the line for America bugs accent is that\nI almost forgot has said everybody happy and digital ... people ... yeah you say\nOkay All right now now I Know this is also known as as Columbus Day right okay fine I I Know that people don't like to focus in on this too much because\nWho really cares about Columbus Day and the answer is I don't know not really me I don't even know it it's not even really a holiday like John do you feel like people to even have Columbus\nThey all went off and my other job so yeah oh I'm Sorry ...\nI I just used it to John you're the ... you're you're the rock of Gibraltar of team hot man you were always always there for us\nYeah you know I I think that uh it it just for me it's just not a not a serious holiday you know it's not up there with the ... days so I Can't get that energized about it but there was a little bit of a new story here because Columbus ohio\nWhere lots of fun things happened I'm sure\nThey are not celebrating Columbus Day so they will not so the city is named for Christopher Columbus but they will not celebrate Columbus\nDay there instead celebrating indigenous people's day so I think to be consistent and John what do you think I think they should have to call it indigenous peoples town right they got to rename this is like when people in Austin, Texas want to change the street names\nAnd then I go wait a second we might have to change the name of our whole city Washington DC also has to change its name Washington D. C. would have to ... although I Will say it's a little confusing when I say I'm I live in Washington people were always like the state or you know DC\nYou know we should just call it D.C the district of Columbia that shouldn't be Washington DC 'cause it gets confusing I Know that sacrilegious because our founding father blah blah but we got a state named after him and a lot of stuff named after him he's our dollar bill so yeah Columbus doesn't call indigenous\nPeoples anymore and I like to point out mostly because it upsets\nThe last which is fun because we're we're owning lives were only lives hard these days folks freedom we embrace this because lives need to be own for their own good at this point they they need people to show them that in in politics their ideology is that new level and they need to get wrecked\nNotice I'm dropping all the lingo John\nI used to know this stuff when I when I used to be playing video games I could use all the cool kids language I was about to say you sound like a game or now yeah exactly I used to I got so good at ... I got it like this special level tournaments and fever I was playing kids in\nAll the from Shanghai to Korea to Rio de Janeiro and uh I was I was pretty nasty it the fee for anyway I was like ten years ago\nSo Columbus Day people get all upset about because if they Columbus owned slaves and was a ...\nAnd to that I just point out or why is it that we only judge and I know others are making this point you but I really I really do look at this 'cause that period of in the history of the fifteenth sixteenth century is a particular interest to me you", "show_name": "The Buck Sexton Show", "year": "2018", "city": "Birmingham", "day": "09"}
