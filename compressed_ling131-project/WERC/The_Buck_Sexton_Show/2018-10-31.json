who's running around with a nickname for the culture that has not his own okay that's interesting\nYeah well correct at least as these on a skateboard there's less of a chance for him to hit someone while drunk driving in a vehicle and actually hurt them and\nThen he could still we've seen on a skateboard my friend do you think that's not possible\n[laughter] either way whatever happens whatever the cops but the police report it was alive remember that but it was a lie\nThere you go to Scott always lie about things like that so do you have any races that you're looking at a that you think are\nWe're we're you're expecting the Republican to over perform expectations up to this point or you know who do you really let me at best question for your ... who do you really care about seeing get the W. on election night was only a few days away but I mean who who is you get W by their names are you going to say\nIt's a good day for freedom a good day for America\nRight so you have a of course you have Ted Cruz versus beta now what that is is just\nPosition recorded twenty that was the candidate a liberal journalist right now are writing the beta la Brea actually one writer shout out to the journalist right now that are that are already have that piece prepared because they do is down by double digits in Texas\nOr this just isn't going to happen for him also the president of course is who is foster campaigner an Israeli actually\nWho had a comment at twelve have followed everywhere\nHe has an obligation to try to read us up much of this tribalism and I think what he's done and I'm over the course of the last few years is helpful meant that\nThe president has not been dabbling in elimination his rhetoric at some point she doesn't dog whistle continues as megaphones to tell these tribes that they belong to him and this is waiting to violence\nThreats I got the same so how do you marry the situation with the president last week 'cause he's a national audience do say white nationalist to that he does have to take some responsibility for the pay for rent this bio climate that we find ourselves answer\nPresidents obviously races there's obviously demagogue geography condos and it's I'm ... stokes a national uh say this is all the left\nReally has by the way at the national level for why you should vote for Democrats Trump is so terrible Trump is such an awful person\nAnd what they don't seem to understand is how much that then factors in\nTo the other side beating our sides unwillingness to change any of our tactics [noise] they're not trying to convince us they are trying to strong arm us into abandoning trumpeter bending the movement they're not making good arguments they're engaging in moral blackmail [noise]\nWhy would anybody who's really thinking about the issues\nAnd thinking about what affects them and their day to day lives\nWhy would they listen to any of this they're not even saying hey let's have a bigger European style social welfare state with free college and free healthcare now and as you know there's no such thing as free so it's really a ...\nYou know state [noise] paid for health care and state paid for college which means you pay for the question of how much it who and then let the mayhem of the bureaucracy ah get unleashed in terms of price and\nAnd the distribution of care and everything else but you're not even hearing them make a real picture about any of this ... this is where we are the Democrats I think had been anticipating either a bad economy right a ... a downturn economy right before the election\nWar they were anticipating that people would become a show beaten down by the anti Trump rhetoric and all this stuff about racism and racist Republicans and they're so terrible in the show of all that stuff they really thought\nThat that would be enough I think to turn the tables against Trump but they don't understand is by doing that they're actually making the case 'cause there's only some people who are going to be persuaded right you're you're never going to you're not going to turn the tables with some ... hat wearing\nTrump early stage true believer many of whom listen to the show and high fives well if you for seeing a political movement that Ninety five percent of the professional political class had no idea what's happening and so basically an editor already occurred on election day\nRight so you guys thought Ninety five percent of the professional political elites did not\nBut you're obviously not going to change your mind based on what they said no matter what no matter what riding because you see the result but I'm Talking about if this is really a function of the persuadable going into this midterm election and a few days right we're we're a week away from finding out who controls the Senate\nWho controls the house that has profound implications for certainly the next two years I'm not on that side of the most important election of our lifetime and it's not true okay that'd be ... this off with that is twenty twenty\nIt'll be the most important election it'll probably be the second most important election of my lifetime because I think the most important was twenty six feet so twenty twenty will probably the second most important I don't think you're ever going to outdo twenty sixteen\nBut you know obviously every election really matters and and the next two years or so the tone will be set in terms of legislation and what the government's going to do by how this midterm shakes out\nAnd that's why I just think it's so noticeable but Democrats aren't even at the at the national level they're trying to do this thing and every different race will do they're trying to run a good candidate for the district right or a good candidate in that state if it's kind of a purple state\nSo they have these people that are a little centrist on some issues it's like the Joe Manchin affect how is Joe Manchin even a Democrat 'cause he likes to unions [noise] you know you look at it because he's pro worker I mean Trump is pro worker\nSo you know you get some of these people who are Democrats who might as well be Republicans there's a few of those but much more common was on the left\nOr people that are pretending to be a more centrist then they will vote to sexually fool the voters and then get in bed with the Democrats later I mean that that the more common tactic that's much more likely to be\nOr what you see happening and and that's why it's either a local local media markets stuff about how protecting protecting preexisting conditions on Obamacare and that's what this is all about but at the national level all you're hearing you get base turnout from the left his trumpet Trump is a racist these terrible\nAnd you know they're just they're never going to stop [noise] so that's why whatever they make it sound like oh if only Trump would if only trouble one what stopped being Trump and you'll like him this is nonsense words were based on\nA mentioned twenty twenty and I'll do the second most important election of of my lifetime or I like the trumpet it say about this last night and Laura Ingraham show a place that it [noise]\nSo far I like them all\nI don't see anybody right now and I should shut down\nAll I could to let me very happy with Hillary I like 'em all [laughter] I don't see anybody that I wouldn't enjoy running against\nYou know the truth is that is the truth\nIs nobody right now that Trump looks at\nAcross the aisle things oh wow I don't know if I could ... I think that person might have the you know the magic formula to beat me oh wow you know I don't know\nThere's there's nobody there was nobody that's even close I the only one who you think maybe is enough of a wild card that it'll be interesting is Bernie Sanders and I think what people figure out more about the more people know about Bernie Sanders policies at the national level the west are going to like him so that's a pretty big vulnerability\nBertie colder you talk to me the most but when you find out you're gonna have to pay Seventy percent of your income in taxes I I don't think you're going to want to feel the burn quite the way he does\n[noise] security breaches happen all the time now you may be thinking well it's usually\nIs a big company and who knows if the bad guys of the actors will ever get my information well let me tell you something\nIf you ever use public wife I guess what whenever you're doing anything on your computer you're being cracked and your private information therefore can be put at risk you can also be sold\nAnd use the ways you don't want it to that's why you won a virtual private network and express VPN is simply the best one you can get\nExpressed VPN has easy to use apps that runs seems in the background of\nMy computer phones and tablets and turning on expressed VPN protection is so simple it costs less than seven dollars a month you can do with one click\nI Know about online security I'm telling you express VPN is what you need to protect your online activity today and find out you can get three months free had expressed VPN dot com slash box that express VPN dot com slash book for three months free with a one year package [noise]\nEverything you do on line is ... there's a tremendous amount of information that people can get from whatever it is that you're doing on your computer or your tablet or your smartphone and once the bad guys get their hands on that oh man you're in for a world of hurt I Know about protecting your information security\nAnd good ... and that's why I use expressed vps expressed BBN's virtual private network with that means is that you just use expressed VPN and you don't have to worry about people getting all your private information and selling it and using the expressly being protects you run in the background or by computer phones\nAnd tablets costs less than seven dollars a month or so have you ever used public why fight and you want to keep hackers used by some senior stuff expressed be the end of the solution to protect\nYour online activity today and find out how you can get three months three and express the P.

that I think always somehow gets or other pushed aside because the politics or maybe there's just some some honest confusion on the part of those who are trying to get a handle on this epidemic\nBut we always hear that it's the priest gets prescription drugs that are pushing this epidemic for what you're telling me\n... it's it's really that these are similar to prescription drugs but they're being obtained illegally and being made illegally so ... is is that an accurate reader of what's going on here because it\nIs being made invests in Mexico it's obviously they're not being filtered through Pfizer and then sold via legitimate pharmacies to people in the streets this is just cutting out Pfizer as it from the picture and or any drug company entirely from his\nParents who are we so we know that there was a problem and we know that there was a problem with the pharmaceutical companies and that's been very public and that you know the dangers of you know over prescribing a opioids to patients even when you're going in for a debt tool\nFor dental work there was over prescription of opioids on we saw a rise in that not only with veterans but with with people across the board in the United states when when the escalation of addiction\nRates started skyrocketing\nBut what what happened was as soon as those\nIssues began to be regulated and of course the federal government stepped in Dr stopped over prescribing for the most part one of the things that happened was the drug cartels said wow look at this we can potentially be making billions off of this and that's exactly what they're doing and not just the drug cartels\nBut China China is also a cooperative this with that and all and I think we've been hearing a lot about that at least a little bit more in the news media\nAnd what they've done is they have created their own till they're owned pharmacies and and they made him look like the actual pills so some of the markings I was actually in Ohio talking to some of the undercover da ... those that are working there and some of the local law enforcement who work with the DEA\n... look these pills are almost identical you look at a Xanax it looks like a Xanax that would be made by a a a pharmaceutical company but it's not it's not a real Xanax it's not a real purpose that it's not a real actually caught\nEither way taking notes for recreational use is dangerous it's addictive and two lives lost but when you see it come talented with the enormous amount of narcotics that are being built into our streets\nThis poison and I'd sure but you you hear about this all the time but that in all it's so dangerous that in its pure form which has moved across the United states many times in its pure form could literally cause someone to overdose and die\nBy just touching it and in the documentary it's explained very well that only for grant for little grains like four little grains of table salt\nOf that no could literally kill a grown man\nAnd we've seen loads of this stuff come into the United states for example\nIn April this year in Nebraska and state troopers they seized over a hundred and Eighteen pounds at that and all and uh\nWhere did he said this is enough to kill twenty six million people when we showcase\n... and premier the movie here in Washington DC and then showcase did in Ohio which was which is really the epicenter we use Ohio as kind of a microcosm of the rest of the country when we showcase that they're one of the head of the DEA Mario and then it\nCame and talked to the audience you know the full house because Ohio is really struggling with addiction rate and he said look if I close up this theater right now\nAnd they released a small package affecting all through the air system\nWe would all be dead he said so this is no longer just about addiction this is about saving our children's lives\nRealizing that this is a potential national security threat really understanding where this is coming from and not being ashamed not being ashamed about addiction we have to come out you have to talk to our kids\nWe have to let them know without on the street\nWe have to be open and honest with one another if we're ever going to find a solution and I'm not saying we're going to find a solution to stopping addiction we have to stop this before something potentially so dangerous happened before we lose a generation of our kids\nAnd we have to face it and we have to be honest about it\nServed this this documentary tacos what is clearly the biggest health crisis in the United states are more people are dying from this than died from the height of the AIDS epidemic or the crack epidemic in this country uh when when you speak to these families obviously\nGoing to be very and people that have been affected by this in any respect it's very it's very emotional and and it's it's haunting for people there's clearly now a greater awareness of it than ever before\nWhat what is the answer what can we do about this\nI think first of all people have to find their lane everybody in ... in an all parts of the ... our communities need to find out what they can do what's their role as a parent it's educating your child\nAs a health care provider it's understanding what's going on and be able to be aware of of the potential dangers out there and assessing goes right away so we can save lives\nAnd that people we have to realize we have a problem with addiction we also have to have the right resources appropriate at the right way so that when the federal government put money\nAside for this epidemic\nThat there's accountability for it that this money isn't being funneled through the federal system through state and local agencies and and just disappearing into the ... of our\nOf our money pit but that it's actually working\nAnd that we support our law enforcement and our federal law enforcement I Believe that as this as we start looking at this on a broader scale especially with the threat of setting all especially with the threat of the drug cartels and now they're pouring this poison into our system and into our children's lives we call it not in Dane\nV. E. I. N. not in pain\nThe drug cartels are using the veins of our highways to infiltrate and move their contraband into the United states and then into our people's games in into our children's games when we have to find a way to stop this we have to work with our southern partners with Mexico\nWith Colombia with Guatemala with Nicaragua with El Salvador we have to insist that they do their part and honestly there were a few people in the documentary that brought up some great ideas you know look this is not just a criminal organization this has now become a transnational terrorist\nTime I don't know I I can I'm convinced herbal either way on this one I can be convinced of of either\nFeel like it's ... it's convincing below word Brandon what was I made up of great word the other day on the air and I can or ... or a instead of derogatory I liked that one degrow toward does not sound like a fancy word though it's French\nYeah they've got to read may we'd be out too but I I I feel like honestly it convinced ... should be a word if it's not so\nI I should check that one out it's just like decide or you know\nWe've got to have some ... and those these will be words that I come up with that I say you know cooked and we do know the dictionary but they should be\nAnd I think invincible should be is is one of them for sure about it is in the dictionary I think\nThat exactly as well get about it if that's going to be the dictionary that convinced will should be in the dictionary so where where where we are all this Oh yes that's right Hillary we all know that she's probably going to run again but this is where we get into you know one of the one of the big\nAssets that the the left has whenever they're running for office or their somebody in public life you know the public persona is when there's something get treated as a joke versus when\nIs it treated seriously and then when assuming given the benefit of the doubt by the media you know the narrative the conversation that people have based on what they're reading what they're being told what they're hearing\nWhen's that benefit of the doubt given to somebody versus when are they to be made an example of which is the obviously the opposite of the opposite effect of all that\nAnd the truth is it's a it's still very much the case that lives pretty much across the board get the benefit of the doubt and then some and conservatives just get crushed and I find that frustrating and this this reminds me of Lindsey Graham is saying look the only way to get lifted change\nIs to\nDrive them from their villages and here the limitations of their women so to speak ah here's what he here's what Lindsey says about this like looked at\nThe American people have had it with this [laughter] I've had it with it\nKavanaugh the care of that and blaming Trump for everything under the side if you want to change the way the country is going and you want to tell these people they got it wrong\nThen vote a week from tomorrow for the Republican Party the only way they're gonna changes for them to lose ... cabin on the main anything and if you don't want any more Kavanaugh character assassination\nOr then you need to reject what they did and hand them to the state they deserved they want power so badly the media is and the tank for them\nAnd the all the way they'll get it as for the American thing for send out loud and clear signal that we're tired of you tired of their tax they've had our lemming every Republican for everything\nI think this is an essential element of the Trump movement it really is it really is a strategy winning and winning and winning\nReally is a political strategy and I noticed that sounds ridiculous because it has not always the strategy no in fact Republicans for a long time we're happy to lose as long as they last like gentleman\nBut that obviously didn't get the left to act more gentle manly it just got the left to say oh great we're winning screw the other guys Trump comes in and says okay it's not going to be perfect it's not going to be pretty but if we want them to change we've got to win\nLindsey Graham is saying that too and you know what\nLindsey Graham two point oh is correct [noise]\n\n\nOr\nSome kill NATO President Trump met with protests today in Pittsburgh has he tried to offer support in the wake of Saturday's massacre at the tree of life synagogue\nThe streets were filled with people chanting and holding signs reading messages like go home Trump into words matter they say the commander in chief bear some of the blame for Saturday's shooting specifically his recent declaration of being a proud national is the president and first lady honored Jewish barrel tradition placing small stones of white markers outside the synagogue\nThoughts as Garrett penny in Pittsburgh Boston gangster Whitey Bolger killed Tuesday in West Virginia prison the Boston Globe's reporting on fellow inmate with mafia ties is being investigated for the death meanwhile Tommy Donahue the son of one of Bulger's victims says oh not\nFashioning peaceful ...\nBolger was serving a life term for multiple crime [noise] this is about [noise]\nA wider [noise]\n\nThat was you know because when it comes to the fight for some thought never stop [noise] there's a big controversy no doubt about it\nThere are some issues that get way more attention than they probably should and the media just latches onto them for any number of reasons the controversy over candy corn is something that people are now really weighing in on this this has turned into a sea by the way a brand and candy corn delicious are disgusting\nI actually am a big fan of it you would like candy court no ... I Wish that the candy\nCorn is a declaration that you have in your candy bag at a trick or treat her for all the candy that you actually want to eat right John Candy corn for me it was always almost like the ornaments on a Christmas tree there not edible they're just there to look pretty\nUh but some people apparently eat candy corn and your your among them which I find\nI Can't say shocking sorry if I'm disappointed ... it's okay it's okay you know I mean I I have my own\nYou know I ... you know that there's this video going around that shows the reason that call candy corners 'cause if you build it into a circle it looks like a corn on the cob did you know that I have seen that yeah yeah it is do we agree that that's why it is called that I don't I don't know if anyone's ever given a an official ruling on it\nBut those who were curious the first ever candy corn was made in the uh according to the national confectionery association ... men in the Eighteen eighties\nAnd Americans obviously have been into it ever since and it it's just sugar\nIsn't it it's kinda like it's it's a sugar that's been a little bit\nUm you know\nSugar flavor and I don't know I don't even know what you'd say about it it takes a week sugar it's just and nice in Chile I I I don't understand the aid to beyond someone called the Satan ear wax\nAnd it got a lot of that got a lot of attention on on Twitter or I Would just say this you know we were having a discussion today on my um we're having a discussion say on rising about scariest scary movies and I said number one", "year": "2018", "show_name": "The Buck Sexton Show", "city": "Birmingham", "day": "31"}
