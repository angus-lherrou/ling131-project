don't know what she's talking about this didn't happen cabinet never did this she's like basically that's what you can say about Ford maybe afford Ramirez and sweat Nick ... is the one who says that\nMaybe maybe he\nKavanaugh exposed himself during college she can't be sure but she called a lot of people to ask\nThem what they think\nThat's not that's not something that\nInspires confidence in her telling of events is it\nCan't be sure exactly but you know it might have been him so let's try to pile on and help ruined his life that's where mirrors\nAnd then they find some roommate or doesn't like look you could find people in college I didn't like me to they were losers they were jerks but there were some of them you know they'd probably say oh yeah a buck was you know he was bad that say whatever to trash me if I were running for office of any one of you went to college if they could find somebody especially in a really politically contentious time if you were conservative everybody\nLoves to bash among conservatives oh gosh makes you the hero of a lot of cocktail parties really does\n\nBut I think that you might see flake vote no regardless of how that shakes out and so then it comes down to Collins and Murkowski\nCollins and Murkowski Murkowski no votes I think ... realizes that she's done in the Senate if she votes now she's done that's my impression that's my analysis I could be wrong\nMurkowski though strikes me is more transactional rent or Murkowski is a little more whatever's good for forget about the Republican Party forget about whatever principle she's a spouse in the past\nSo\nThat's that's part of my concerns and then you also have this is continuing narrative in this ties into\nWhat I think is they're trying to build an escape hatch reflect you see they can't get cabin on the rate they can't convince any normal reasonable person the cabinet was above and gang rapes are that were that there's any evidence running is because there is no evidence\nBut you've got to remember then there's the Mazie Hirono senator Geraldo from Hawaii there's the approach that she adds which is just whatever we can do to\nCriticize this guy to take him down a peg to make him look small after we should do whatever we can investigate about him we should investigate IRS Mazie Hirono on the ice throwing allegations play twenty\nAnd I can't I Want to ask you about the developments we found out overnight either and leave the Donald with ... cabin on through ice in someone's face during a bar fight when he was in college you feel that that is in any way just qualifying for someone who's in a Supreme Court [noise]\nJuly we need and the island nation because there are a lot of allegations really part of LA are about how he behaves blaming truck\nSo that as well as the trail of himself as actively choir boy\nOr is there much contradicted by them may find college team over and and I go why we need an FBI and the addition like calling for one for like five\nMonths what\nI Do think that there's a strong case to be made that center who wrote it was the dumbest woman or man in the Senate I think she's the dumbest human being in the Senate that's a very that seems to me to be a strong case right now the evidence for that is clear\nWe need an FBI investigation that cab and all because you might have thrown ice into someone's face during a bar fight Thirty years ago thirty five years ago\nWho can say that and not feel like a moron and really\nDon't don't allow yourself to assume even for a second well she's on TV she's a senator she can't be that she can't be that silly right maybe maybe I'm being harsher nope you're up in our ...\nTotal embezzle total and complete a missile but\nThis story about temperament and the lines of the reason that that\nTalking point is something that I Am analyze it for you there on the show\nIs because that's not going to convince anybody you you got people that hate Kavanaugh or because you know he's a white male white male privilege and it was a front row and he's and he's a conservative and overturn roe all that stuff and you can people that say no I'm actually a constitution list and also I Believe the rule of law\nYeah that's our team\nNo one's going to change their mind about this guy based upon the alleged ice throwing into incident of Nineteen eighty four or whatever it was no that's not serious New York times doing a peace right now on how he was part of a\nParty planning or something back in the day in New York Times doing that pays whoa oh gosh and he was a college kid I mean they're they're adjudicating his beer drinking and his\nSocial life and social habits from college when he's a fifty something year old man this is what the New York times it's been reduced to a joke a disgrace times also\nHad Emily Babylon reporting on Kavanaugh as a quote reporter when in July before any this happened she came out and said she opposes him because of the threat that he poses to civil rights\nAnd women's rights I'm short too of course that's that's that's a given you can assume that\nLook by creating the storyline of temperament and oh he's a he's a belligerent drunk he was mean he's a bad guy that's not for any normal person to change their mind one way or the other than that it's all about\nGetting an escape hatch for flake and maybe Murkowski\nOh we don't want to let's put forward we agree by the flakes word is good for nothing I mean he could come out today and say I guarantee you I Would vote for capping off this has done and we don't have any more derogatory information I still wouldn't believe until the votes happened we do know guys a coward an absolute\nWet noodle spine coward\n\nBut if they can open the storyline you see how it goes oh we need somebody who's a more bipartisan pick this whole process has been tainted the country's two divided right now\nSo in response to the left waging an unprecedented partners in assault on cabin on all of his supporters and and all those around him in the entire system and all the women dressed in The Handmaid's tale costumes and putting anatomically correct female body parts on their heads as hats and all the stuff that they're doing\nAll that flake takes the position of\nOh well we should have now and give them what they want in the spirit of bipartisanship that's what I think's going to end up happening I think flakes going to be a no vote at the end of this whole thing knowing that yes you'll receive a lot of\nViciousness from Washington viciousness a lot of anger is not vicious it's completely warranted legitimate justice really from people but\nHe's playing the long game of I Want to get a book a book deal from Simon and Schuster or whomever you know a big big big\nHouse that's that's what flakes game is here\nSo that's why I I'm concerned I don't know how the votes will go I'm not I have zero confidence and their ability of Republicans in this case to do what's right one thing that just that just got released and I I wasn't sure I I'm not going to read to you from it\nBecause it is salacious that you could definitely say it is it is a salacious document sort of like the salacious dot CA\nBut it did\nI I have noticed it All right I ... I have noticed this I I Am aware of it\nAnd\nIt's the Senate Judiciary committee they released a statement from somebody that I think kind of romantic linked to sweat Nick and man oh man are there things in there essentially telling you to sweat Nick is a very disturbed and sexually\nI don't even know what the word would be you'd have to read the document I Can't read it on their family show there's some really intense stuff in there though bottom line is the woman is crazy that's that's the bottom line uh and that her allegations should not be taken seriously and and you know they they they posted up some\nActivists in Reagan Airport I see this and and they're trying to harass other Republican senators in there now and I heard this line you know how many women have to be assaulted before you believe women\nDish is a this is a fundamental problem with the whole left wing approach here eight eight collective\nVersion of justice or a collective is to approach adjusted that's at the heart of all this I Want to address that when we come back and they don't talk about the mid germs and where I think this is going in terms of red wave blue wave all that stuff third our get into the economy and\nNot being seen me women\nWomen out there on the radio one five five let's talk about\nHow we are seeing [noise]\nBoxers radio I'm rich Dennison authorities are investigating three pieces of suspicious mail sent to President Trump's defense secretary Jim Mattis and the chief of naval operations which tested positive for rice send those letters were intercepted that a federal meals sorting facility in the nation's capital\nAnd mail facility remains under quarantine and there is still no word yet if all free letters are connected in what they are being examined by FBI forensic team boxers\nTrace Gallagher President Trump defending his Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh during a campaign rally tonight in Mississippi blaming Democrats for holding up his confirmation\nGuilty until proven that's very dangerous for aren't\nVery dangerous job and I was confirmation vote is expected shortly after the completion of an FBI investigation into sexual misconduct accusations\nFox News we report you decide [noise]\n\nSmart ankle\n... discovery filed new advances in science and engineering from the national Science Foundation prosthetic legs were much improved\nBut to users loose still a major pun intended stumbling block\nTo rain every hills sterile\nWrapper on even Patrick Rome slows movement goes on certain balance some stability ... just to be for different terrain [noise]\nThey don't match with any role promotional walking but a team at Vanderbilt University is looking at the problem from a new angle they develop depressed that a smart angle that moves with the user to packed\nWith a tiny motives sensors with chip preventive action\n... stimulates my muscles all work together to sensing react to changing terrain conforming to the surface of the Buddhist contacting or remaining stationary developers say it figures out what you're doing and then does what it should it allows the user to wear an economist shoe running dress flats\nThe device just automatically part of what gives me to match room very human feel is that the team reached out to nearly a hundred potential users to understand what would make the ankle if excess the idea is for people to be able to do more of the activities they want to I tell you the food aid pun intended major strides\nTo discover more it NSF dot Gov I'm Bob course on the news radio one oh five five ... yours see\nSomething in the air\nBob ... government ...

and if that not in the house\nRepublican wave ... isn't that interesting Republican\nWave is it possible folks that just as we saw on twenty six team the geo pie in the era of Trump could greatly defied the experts in the expectations\nIn this upcoming election I don't want to get your hopes up and I I kinda want everybody listening to this to be fired up and\nBe mad mad people people who are or annoyed about what's going on they're likely or to show up and vote\nPeople that are happy to get a little complacent you know with the status quo they figure out things are good things will stay good well what are you seeing in the cabinet debacle is that Democrats cannot be trusted with power and you can have these people in charge you can't do it\n\nHave to stop them from being able to set the government agenda will be a bad thing for all of us so I don't want anyone to lose sight of that but the truth is nobody really knows what's gonna happen right now with the election the truth is that\nIt could go either way and we're over a month out from election day right our way of my as my date yeah oh no yeah months at a couple of days over a month out from election day Senate this wherever and start saying the same thing it's an eternity in politics Bob well\nJill it all comes down to turn out you know\nLobby blah all the same stuff a lot of political puns is not telling the same thing as people keep asking me I I don't I mean I\nCertainly hope the Republicans win but and you know at the Republicans do when it's not like I think the world is going to be a perfect place we don't have any problems anymore because politics is interesting it's about human interaction and\nWay of resolving conflict between people in a way of joining together to do some things that makes sense for all of us right\nBut at the end of the day it doesn't determine who you are what your value is that this is a problem with the Democrats left they get show personally wrapped up in\nHer party and\nAll that stuff I mean I I'm wrapped up in principles of their ideas that really matter to me or you know justice and truth and these things that it sounds like I'm giving a speech to be high school president or something but that you know those things matter to me\nI think the geo peas doing a good job of the country they should stay in power because they have been doing a good job suburb it's not not beyond reproach but you know there's some very very positive things that are happening that that's\nOne point I wanted to make your and in terms of\nWhat we've seen with Kavanaugh I I Can't say what the reaction is going to be because until you see the reaction then then you\nSee the reaction you're not in a position to really assess whether it's going to have an impact on it it doesn't get through Republicans better send a message for the good of the country better send a message that\nThis will not stand this aggression dude will not stand that's what has to be said\nAnd that means preventing Democrats from taking the house Democrats take the house it's going to turn into one long endless investigation and impeachment fight\nThat's the only thing that's going to be out there that's the only thing that the Democrats are really going to focus on there's no one no policy agenda that they are going to agree on\nWe'll talk later about who they think they're going to run for the presidency but we're a month out from election day and I have to say this week which\nIs hopefully going to come to a close with Kavanaugh's confirmation but if it doesn't have that could be the difference maker in the midterms\nI don't believe this other side of it I think that this is wishful thinking and the Democrats that women will turn out in huge numbers of Kavanaugh gets on the Supreme Court I think the only women who really believe the capital's a bad guy and a Kavanaugh's a you know a predator and that and that you know women should be believed all all that stuff all that clock trap rhetoric that you hear\nThe women who really take that to heart and are mobilized voters a result of it hated Kavanaugh anyway this is like all the senators are saying oh it does we need to have you back beyond us occasion and that'll decide well you decided before\nAny there's even if you decided before the hearings happened to you know coups and find something that we're never going to

thing to do usually whenever anybody asks me what's going to happen in Washington\nMy general prediction about politicians is what's the easiest thing for them to do because that's what they're going to do a this was not the easiest thing for Jeff Flake to do the easiest thing for him to do would be just a vote\nFor a cap and I want to get them out of committee and that's the end of that but he held his vote ransom as it were basically saying you can have my vote but we need a week to do this FBI investigation and that took whether or not you agree with that that wasn't gutsy thing to do it because it made every Republican in the Senate mad at him\nTapper is the most overrated thinker in the news business I Would wager he's entirely wrong here with his analysis on\nThese Steven cold there show that's absolutely wrong it is the opposite what Jeff Flake did the flake out as it were is the opposite of courage because flake had already said earlier that day that he was going to vote for Kavanaugh\nThe reason he did not was that he could not take the heat\nThat's not courage that is actually the opposite of courage that is called cowardice but notice how this is free\nThey're trying to you and this is very all top are very establishment news media they want all the little senators that are still in the mix they want everybody who is perhaps persuadable on this one when you get to the final vote process\nThey want everyone to know that you know the ones who wants to stop this process or the brave ones let me tell you what Jeff lakes calculation was Jeff Flake really really wants to be liked\nBy CNN by the New York times it's seductive these are powerful cultural institutions and\nEspecially if you're no longer going to be a politician you want in your day to day life you'd be thought of well by people who have large megaphones who have cultural influence and also by the way can pay you a whole lot of money to do a whole lot of different things that's what you want\nThat's what the self interested person is going to be concern with first and foremost\nLike didn't show courage not the harder thing to do he knows this is a scam he's not a complete moron and he knows\nThat if he were to have gone along and do the right thing he would be in tremendous hot water right now with the left with the media so what did he do try to create an alibi for himself\nI'm Still not convinced that he will vote for Kavanaugh but I Would note that even if he does vote for Kavanaugh flake thinks that he's going to be the Republican in this process\nWho when he wants to give fancy speeches in Aspen or East Hampton or wherever when he wants to be among the elite again and treated like somebody that they can stand from the right you know that they can kind of accept him\nHe will say oh well I was the one that got the one week extension I was the one that\nMade sure that there was this ... investigation which as we now she is a sham it was always going to be a sham it's late knew it was a ... so what did flake do why did he do it self interest which is the opposite of courage\nCowardice because he felt like he had been cornered by those women including a straw rose funded active if you can't even make this stuff up\nYelled at him and so he decided to make a different call that day and what he had already said in the morning same day\nLike is a self interest in power in this whole process and that won't change even if you vote for cabin on the ad because what he's doing is just created additional risk for a man in this case judge Kavanaugh who has been ambushed who has been smeared who has been slime\nIf you're a person of honor and integrity you don't allow that to continue when it's in your power to stop it that's what Jake

bumbling the food that he can't do anything right that he's terrible in negotiation that he has no idea what he's doing this is what\nThey'll tell you I'm this doesn't square with the reality though and you know I'm I'm Out here in this this conference which stands for research some of you know them 'cause I Do a podcast with their with their founder and chairman and stands where it's a it's a

can't\nDisregard the results and that's what people want to do I'm not even saying you know you're not allowed to argue that the results aren't as good as people say fine you know people want to quibble over how good the results have been that's one thing but you can't just regard them you can't say oh the economy is amazing but it's not Trump that did this or Trump doesn't get any credit for this that just\nThat's being unreasonable that's not looking at\nThe evidence and making decisions based on what's well making coming to conclusions based on what's really happening here or there and
