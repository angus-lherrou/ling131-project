{"month": "10", "state": "AL", "station": "WERC", "content": "[laughter]\n[noise]\nAntifa are you guys are ... they used to be a big thing I used to get a lot of media attention at least conservative media would sometimes talk about the left doesn't seem to want to talk about them that was some\nAudio and we play for you of the the latest and the incidence out on the uh\nI don't do it as well as Trump Trump's antifa is better than my antifa are but I don't do it as well she does\nOut on the west coast in Portland which strikes me as a strange place for that it'd be quite so much political extremism but but that's I I suppose it is what it is right that is going on there are but at you\nThese people with with his edgy for group that were squaring off against some I think it's called the group for patriots in prayer or something I I forget exactly even what the what the group was called um let me do a quick refresher on that one but you know you sure enough you had you had this uh this violent\nIncident where your protesters and counter protesters your ego bears spray and bloody brawls at patriot yeah patriot prayer law and order march in Portland you have to be very careful my friends when you see the way that these\nKinds of stories are covered you have to pay really really close attention\nBecause there's a lot of\nA political hedging that goes on there is a lot of usage of kind of weasel words and what they believe in what they take out of these descriptions for example\nJust because the ACLU and by the way I Know nothing about this patriot prayer groups I Can't keep up with all the other group it's called patriot prayer and had a lot of American flags sounds cool to me but I don't know that could be wackos I have no idea there are too many of these are little you know local political groups for me to know every single one of them\nBut I just would I Would caution you all at the ACLU is not a reliable source at all\nOr I'm Sorry peace deal you Southern Poverty law that the truth of the ACLU as well so yes you keep that keep that in the Southern Poverty Law Center is not a reliable source when it comes to deciding who is a\nA a political extremist or a right wing extremist a white nationalist any any of those things you cannot trust the Southern Poverty Law Center it has become a massive\nFundraising organization and a left wing really a left wing hate group and a lot of cases\nIn any group that has to pay a multimillion dollar settlement too much into was a for being an anti Muslim extremist when he's a Muslim is a group that you probably want to take with a grain of salt whenever it comes to these uh these different demonstrations in and how they're reporting on who's there and what's going on so that that's one part of it\nBut then there's the other which is just\nThis idea that it is a normal thing to want to show up and do these counter protests and they call them counter protests but when people show up to a demonstration right and they're all wearing black and they have gas masks and shields and and and homemade weapons\nThey're not showing up because they want to engage in a battle of ideas they want to gauge in a battle\nThey want to fight people and the fact that they showed up with their spray and there's other things tells you all that you need to know uh but I just think it's so interesting which media outlets will and will not covered as this makes for really compelling footage\nThis is a story that you would think they'd want to tell you have a almost entirely white by the way antifa radicals who are attacking this this patriot prayer group they're called the law and order group rather they weren't a march for law and order\nI I've gotta I've gotta wonder is is that just stay is that a euphemism are they actually white nationals I mean I have no idea and I know that I Can't trust\n'em I I Can't trust the media to produce honest assessments of this and tell us what really happened for example do just that they accept that there are counterprotesters and that you know the kind of approach is just like showed up and like they didn't want any problems man but you know there were problems\nWell maybe it's because they showed up in the whole purpose of their presence was to ignite some kind of a confrontation right\nYou get in a gay man they gauge it you know ... you\nKnow they're showing up and they're screaming about fascism and from being a Nazi and they wanted they want to hit people and they want to attack people and they want to do this little home videos of this because these are radical their political radicals\nAnd you know you could argue that the only thing that really separates him from a domestic terrorist organization is that to date anti has put a limit on the degree of their violence where they have not engaged in to my knowledge I might be getting something lethal action against Syria but they have engaged in violent action\nAnd keep in mind that that violent action if you have a very different very different political circumstances that could escalate it could escalate\nRather rapidly and all of a sudden a group that has issued lethality in the past\nWhen it comes with violence may maybe in a position where they feel like that is open to them and in fact that's\nThe path way that they take so I I Would just note that that's something that that I Want everyone to be aware of the ... has not been to this point\nA group as engaged in straight up terrorism it used to be that the anarchists who are money a lot of antifa\nOr the anarchists in this country we're the real terrorists I mean the the sort of when I'm In real terrorists I mean they were the primary terror threat they're the ones who are assassinating presidents tried to blow up the stock exchange that's right it was anarchists not Islamic radicals\nThere was another incident by the way I I Know I Would get hit if I didn't bring this went up there was another incident on\nA friday in New York City actually right in the neighborhood I think where I grew up in fact when I looked at the videos I could tell even the videos didn't show you much what street I think they were on when they had this fight a there was this ... this group that the Proud Boys and I've never really understood\n... who they are or what what they are I I I've heard that they have they have some I should actually probably just call Gavin McInnis and ask\nHim the metropolitan Republican club invited the Proud Boys\nAre which is called it quote right wing fraternal organization in this uh in this one piece from reading and there were two or three counter protesters that were beat up now I don't know I wasn't there and I haven't seen much I've only seen a little bit of footage but were these counter protesters who are just there to have a discussion\nI I think if you show up ... ... if you think that these are right wing radicals which obviously the counterprotesters do and you show up at one of their events\nAre are you planning to antagonize them and try to incite a confrontation or you really just want to share your thoughts do they think that they're going to scare the proud\nBoys

cultivate a certain persona with the media and to also are a little more shall we say willing to take a\nA point of view that would be well received\nBy academia and the media on a whole bunch of things on I've noticed is before generals starting to get very political and journals like we love is this tremendous I have no idea I'm just saying that I'm aware of this as a phenomenon of that for example\nA lot of the stuff that came out of a general betray us I was not surprised by it all 'cause I had known for a long time that he was a a a guy who was seeking out the media and very much trying for his own purposes to to\nCreate this narrative of betray us as the greatest military mind this generation I Would I Would just point out that before even are being brought low by an extramarital affair and the woman and the classified information that he didn't do it all the stuff that you already know about and he had to plead guilty and pleaded guilty\nOr you know he he was credited with fixing Iraq which yes the surge work but it was really are a hundred and fifty thousand troops and people that were on the front lines that fixed Iraq but his strategy or was successful there but there were some very important ingredients that were in place for that strategy to work\nI Would note that the strategy that he tried in Afghanistan did not work was not working and was never going to work and he was not really willing to hear about how that was the case\nSo while I I think on the one hand you know he gets all of this credit for Iraq well if he gets all his credit for Iraq\nWe also have to look and see the situation in Afghanistan and understand that he's not that portrays was not this uh men beyond reproach when it came to his ... certainly not beyond approach period but also when it came to the strategy\nSo that's that's why you're saying I Need to do a little more I Need you a little more analysis of what's going on here with or without ... that caught me off guard 'cause I've heard so much positive stuff about matters for so long and maybe he just rather present the wrong way recently and he just want to call him a Democrat\nI also this kind of funny that the president uses calling somebody a Democrat is kind of a a little sly ah yeah\n... you know as ed guys kind of a Democrat you know it's like when I say in my in my media life my guys okay it's kind of a communist so Trump says he's kind of a Democrat he also said as you know that Trump said that he does not trust everybody in the White House and this is\nThis falls into that category of oh my gosh the palace intrigue here you know we we we need to we need to make sure that we run all these stories about how Trump can't trust the people around him and there's all this\nStuff about how Trump is you know\nUnable to manage and he's bringing in all these people that don't have the right requirements and backgrounds and skills and everything else they love the White House dysfunction stories and anything that plays into that we tend to hear a lot about a so then I take a step back then I say hold on a minute\nGiven what we know about all the different leagues and all the people that are in the White House including\nRepublicans who are holdovers from the Bush I shouldn't say from the Bush administration but from the Bush era of the Republican Party people that are not on board with Trump at all we know that there's somebody right now who wrote if you if you believe in New York Times and\nI don't take that for granted\nBut if you believe in New York Times there is a senior White house administration official right now\nWho wrote an op ed effectively saying that we are working against the commander in chief behind the scenes to for his decision making to act like he's not really the president and to go to these\nIf you go to these extreme lengths because we know what's best for the country we will undermine the express will the American people through their elections because we know better\nAnd that's really the position that's really what they're that that's really what they're they're saying about that and this guy wrote this editorial we never found by the way the uh non editorial is never found out who this guy was the anonymous editorial writer but then of course Trump of course Trump shouldn't trust\nEverybody is White House of course it would be silly to do that and that's also why I give them more leeway than I Would in other circumstances and maybe you can say that's a little bit of you know self justifying here are that's\nConvenient not self justifying ah but I understand why he wants to have family members around because he feels like at least he can trust them\nAnd if your Trump and you've seen what's going on with a lot of not just the opposition but the people that are ostensibly supposed to be on your side of the fence people who are ... opposed to be Republicans helping you out you know your your battle buddies so to speak\nAnd how many of them have become turned coats on how many Republicans have we seen including people with some pretty decent\nRecognition within party circles I mean you're talking about like Bill Kristol the Weekly Standard and conservatives right wing or whatever you want to call them that have openly said yeah I'm actually just not even opposing trumpeting Moore I'm a Democrat\nIn that kind of an environment which is the environment President Trump is in\nI think it would be insane\nTo the president's address to everybody in the White House of course he doesn't trust ever in the White House this reminds me of some of the politicians that I've I've been able to interview in the last few months and\nI Love when they do the you know OK off the record and I'm like you're not telling me that he was really some of them you know that something you know to me it's really off the record what they're doing is saying off the record to create the facade\nOf you know I'm really giving you some access and inside here and I'm trying to build this report\nAnd then they say things that if I were to violate off the record which I never would but if I were to violate off the record it would make them look even better you know\nOff the record I volunteered at a soup kitchen last weekend and save some puppies from a burning building like is that really does that does that really has to be off the record senator so and so I\nGuess so ah and then\nYou know the the one that really contentious exchange there really contentious exchange that Trump had here with Leslie stall in this interview or had to do with immigration because I think that is the one area where the left\nAnd the the media allies that they have have felt like they've been in the strongest position\nA since the summer to just just pound Trump on this and what I think it's so so fascinating here is that they stole descent and they always do well it's your policy it's your policy to separate parents\nFrom children the border you did it it's on you it's your fault\nAnd Trump's has but no it's the law\nAnd I don't think that they even I don't think he's media critics even really understand that to say that it's the law is to say that it's actually the Congress\nThat does bear some of if not the lion's share of the responsibility for this whole situation that that that that the Congress is either a napped or cowardly or for whatever reason just unwilling to do what they're supposed to do in these circumstances\nWhich is\nTo find a way to adjust the law that it's a bad law or\nTo repeal it entirely\nIsn't really the president's role I mean this is how much damage I think Obama did to the rule of law as a concept it became normal during the Obama administration for him when he felt frustrated with Congress ... cars are was er Cox I'm like well what am I sorry\nOr he would go around them and do this whole executive order routine which was an abuse of executive orders because what he was just doing was usurping the legislative branches authority and pretending the laws were what he wanted them to be and saying well it's just about enforcing it's not just about enforcement when you don't enforce something at all\nIt's not just about enforcement when you exempt an entire class of people that are explicitly not exempted by Congress\nAnd I think that's part of this that just immediately that the the press puts aside pushes aside and they really assume I mean they really thought that they would uh they would be in a place where\nTrump and the Republicans would just get hammered on immigration they would be or they would be just crushed because of what I've been going out of the border and\nI think that they miscalculated that for a lot of Americans enough is enough they don't really want to keep being told\nThat you know immigrants or do jobs or what time it legal south folks not immigrants illegal immigrants do the jobs Americans won't do that illegal immigrants are nothing but a net positive for the economy and they would like to have some\nRe establishment of the rule of law when it comes to the border and I know that Trump has been build the wall yet and there's a lot of stuff that remains a remains to be done and I have a lot of concerns or whether it will even happen especially if the Democrats take the house\nBut all this on this issue of the border you can tell ... she just wants to oh the parents being separated from their children\nHappen under Obama it's a law that still on the books that was the law when Obama was an office and oh by the way the people that were getting separated from their children at the border were overwhelmingly explicitly trying to break US law\nOh you know how you gonna do this I started small on I turned off the notifications on my phone which was amazing you have to ... you can still go into those states that you can decide hey I Want to be active on Twitter or Instagram or Facebook but\nIf you don't have that constant stream of notifications beckoning you to those sites you have a lot more peace of mind you feel much more in control of those faces I took the phone out of the bedroom and I said you know what when I go to my bedroom I usually go in and got an hour before that I hang out and now I watch either you know old\nFriends episodes or I read a book or I just kinda chill out that was a time I didn't want to be staring at the phone and what research shows actually that's really interesting is that even if you are not on the phone if the phone is by you even if it off and there's no notification coming through nothing you are\nPerturbed you are distracted because you are compelled to want to touch that phone to want to look at that that by so I just remove it from my face I also\nDid something really simple and I was with friends I said you know what I'm going to try something for these three hours I'm just going to put the phone in my bag and I'm not going to worry about it I'm going to take an actual break I'm not going to run on my bathroom break you know while we're waiting for dinner to calm and check every possible feature on the phone I'm just going

watch the ... when you listen I'll watch when you listen to this show\nWill have confirmation of it but as of right now it sounds like they are planning to say that this was a rogue elements within the Saudi Government that's the latest reporting here\nOn the plan is for the Saudi Government to throw some intelligence official under the bus I've also seen early reports that it may be a maybe the Saudi government's position that an intelligence official decided to interrogate and it went over the line\nUm but the Saudis can't hide anymore that this guy was killed was killed in their\nCustody they're calling it quote an interrogation that went wrong that's that's the latest on that so it doesn't really seem like a there's any room for the Saudis to keep the assembling on is that they're they're caught the Saudis are in a gym here um as I should be the Saudi regime is\nA terrible and ah and disgusting government but we're not really often told that because they have a tremendous amount of sway even our own media they own a lot of shares a lot of very important media companies\nBut here's what you see the ... the painted that's going to happen it's already started to happen

possible to call dictators more than Obama did I I think it would be very hard you'd have to work really hard to do so because Obama made some very clear errors in dealing with authoritarians in

I just I I take a moment because I Want to step back and make sure we all around the same page when it comes to the narrative of the moment here\nShe the narrative of the moment from the left is that oh what Bill Clinton did then she would never be able to do now you see it's different\nBecause of this me too movement it's different now Bill Clinton's or what will be called a ... what what is left like to call them his his personal failings very common way of saying Bill Clinton being a\nPredator\nUs route I was ... just ... just you know I met on Okonjo showed a curse word the oval office but all that much much worse stuff in the oval office you know Bill Clinton's\nDisgrace\nA it's something that the left was not just they didn't just turn a blind eye to eye they aggressively aggressively and with all they could muster with all the help they could get in the media and you know people like Stephanopoulos Stephanopoulos was part of the Clinton machinery for example\nAnd he is treated with with ... he's a hundred million dollar men now ABC\nNews anchor that has to me for who decides to pay that much money it's it's just an astonishing thing it really is oh without Stephanopoulos who would watch these shows everybody would watch these shows these are platforms wherever they put in these roles is going to get a certain amount of\nViewership but he seems to get ... they excused\nFrom being a part of the Clinton machinery and Hillary who just had her clearance taken away I Want it back I mean Hillary just\nWas finally told you don't get to have a security clearance

honesty you could say the bar from Obama not a smidgen smoking um honesty she doesn't have a smidgen of honesty she's such a liar\nAnd she knows that she well she still thinks that she has a a

movement of the moment\nRight we've had black lives matter or we've had Occupy Wall street we've had these different\nA political ... revolutionary leftist movements in this country and right now it's the me too movement it will change they will move to some other intellectual fat or fashion in some time just just wait for it\nBut in the meantime they have to make sure that they don't have the weaponization of some of these things occurring\nBack on them they don't want to score and their own goals here with me too movement and that DNA blurs\nI've always felt that the enablers in this

were\nNecessary in this whole process of ... they don't get in trouble they don't really get called out and Hillary was the ultimate in that not only did she stand by her man of course as we know for

was wondering respond well to the women that Hillary demeaned did the women that were completely\nAttack verbally in the media down to their very character they were all considered to be fighters for
