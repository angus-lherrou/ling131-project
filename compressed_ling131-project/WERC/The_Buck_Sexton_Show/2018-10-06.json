used to be part of Massachusetts but that was one of the greatest duration try for it and I'm just real happy and that's all I can say\nDid you watch the whole thing yeah I watched it\nYeah I did you hear me talking about how I didn't see it first I listen to it on the radio and then I watched it later I was more impressed after it when I watched it because I realized this GOP is finally starting to get his presentation act together you know the two women in the background\nThe whole set up was just perfect\nWell you sound like a no Yankee Republican uh that's what a what do you know in the past you know she she's been you know confusing but I mean today I got to give her credit card musher just beautiful\nYeah I think she laid out a primary fishy case and why this guy deserved to be where he's going to be hopefully after tomorrow and why\nAll of the ... and hollering while it should not be listened to as a legitimate criminal charges but she also brought up I thought I really respectful case for the victim the alleged victim here not a victim of judge Kavanaugh but if somebody\nI I was showing Presley and and I'm not usually Susan Collins fan so that's a good now did you have a bad jingle to share with us\nOf course I Do I used to be the spaghetti ocean or commercial which one you're going to go way back for that that's neat round spaghetti you can eat what the school of spaghetti owes\nOh I I remember just oh spaghetti but now you reminded me than the round spaghetti you can do with a spoon\nA spaghetti owes [laughter] now\nYou're in Quincy mass and there's a lot of good Italian food and Massachusetts did your family ever ... have spaghetti os\n[laughter] I Know you can't do it and you know\nWe were not allowed to have spaghetti and a cat and my mother's like you're nodding spaghetti outer can that's a good one lady I'm putting that down spaghetti of jangle thank you happy weekend thanks for checking in John in Pennsylvania also wants to give Susan Collins a pat on the back test pseudo John\nHi how are you doing I'm gr are yeah I Wonder I Wonder if that was actually one of the reasons why this history circulated or fearful is because it's a screw the truth to power I think that's one of the reasons why Trump is so popular with people because\nSo used to all these politicians just here\nSay they want they're doing something else you're never falling off all sounds good come up to election but when somebody actually scripture and our heart is you know Congress there's truth to power before Trump that was a pretty rare thing and I think she taps\nInto that but you know forty out some of the consistency people look at the television and they're just like you know why why why would you go back to a party you know ten times where you know people will be drug to reach stuff\nThat anybody would an ounce of common sense\nJust has to say you know this is one thing I did for the media is so close up these people never get a new power I Hope everybody goes that votes coaches voted out these people that the media it'll it'll drive you crazy [laughter]\nIt's a great point any jingle you want to share with us a bad jingle that haunts you\nKnow when you just said that that other guy I was sick and then one after the ... which could have been that good stuff I guess I don't think it's a rarity more butter but it's not ...\nOh my God if you think is blood or white but it's not a long term memory somewhere I said\nOh that's a good bad one thank you that's an earworm that's in my head now to have a great weekend sir I appreciate you Michael Palca in for buck sex then just around the corner we're going to check in with match slap\nMats wife works in the White House I've known that for years from the pack the American Conservative Union he is a good conservative guy he's a Trump guy died in the wall and he makes\nA lot of sense will hang out with Matt we'll talk about today maybe we'll talk jingles next on the bus Sexton show [noise] [noise]\nInvades the pack every year his name as match slap he is the chairman of the American Conservative Union you know him and he always says his wife is more famous than he is but I Would argue that I think they're equally famous match slap welcome to the buck sex than shows or\nMike what a night to be with you\nYou know it's a it's a little bit of history I have to tell you I Am grinning ear to ear tonight oh what a speech today from Susan Collins\n... should rich have look I'm sitting here with my wonderful wife mercy and ah the end of a long couple of weeks and I don't think it's illegal on on the radio to tell folks that we opened up a bottle of wine and I was telling her I feel\nYour article beer and I just feel like we've all been through the ringer\nI Can't imagine what it feels like for the Kavanaugh's but we've all been through the rigors were very emotional and that but very important that we win this battle\nIt's it's vital that we go forward not just for the party and not just for the president not just for the judge and his family but for what Collins laid out is the rule of law and and America's legal system I think would have taken one in the guy had we not going forward and I know we're not done yet\nI Know where we're not across the finish line for about another twenty hours\nBut it's pretty much a feta ... and not math\n[noise] it really is and um you know the only thing is we've had every curve ball thrown at us in this process uh I Do think that um\n[noise] America has to figure out a way to deal with our divisions and I think of course I'm a part of sitting on the conservative side as or you might put the I think that the the left has become so radicalized so hate filled and they would justify almost any action to get the ends that they want but I think the same\nA peace loving a kind of like the Democrats that you're that were grandparents for many of us who you know I have orange is the Democratic party my family\nI think those folks have to find a way to recapture their party because it's quite ugly when I see the scenes of the Senate hallways over the last couple of days\nI think it's off the ugly and maybe that shouldn't maybe those people don't properly characterize where the Democratic party is but I'm I'm I'm cheerful that actually is exactly where the Democratic party is is if that's the case\nEvery battle we face going forward is going to get worse until the American people decide that they just want none of that\nWell here's one of the things that I brought a mad and I have a question I I have a personal question I Want to get to you before you guys get to the next year or the next can of wine or whatever you're celebrating with\nBut I Am nervous that this victory happen too quickly too soon because we've got four weeks before the midterms and that's an eternity in political life\nCan we keep this engagement in the conservatives in the G O P to possibly save the house is there enough energy to drive us forward for four more weeks\nYeah I mean really if you think about it we you know the Supreme Court should be so separate from politics that shouldn't have implications on the election but because of what the Democrats did it is the number one issue\nIn the election and I understand you're concerned about keeping the enthusiasm go but we have to think about this if we\nAs a party and were unable to make this happen and now that the filibuster is dead it just it just took Republican votes if we were unable to do this as a party then I Would be worried because I talked to too many people around the country I've traveled a lot of states\nI'm In too many people around the country still the same thing that if the Republican Party kids have to keep his promise the most important have its promises\nThen they just don't want to be a Republican anymore and I kind of share that as well I kinda felt this is a moment where my heart just can't stand for something then I'm not sure I Want to be a part of it so that we have the opposite of that we have people\nWho feel proud of their party they're proud of Mitch McConnell the proud of Lindsey Graham they're proud of Susan Collins I'm I sold it to grant a Fox is you know they give a big hug and I've been a real critical of Lindsey Graham but like a lot of these people who hated Donald Trump were never truckers and it's come around because they see Donald Trump is actually keeping his promises\nI'm going to do the same for these Republicans who kept their promises they kept their promise to support a constitutional as a Supreme Court justice than we ought to applaud them for it I think actually our movement this coalition a coalition of Republicans and Trump supporters and\nConservatives most of that coalition or or conservative I think that there's great promise now more problems than I felt at a very long time\nWe're talking to match lap or I call them a friend you probably know him as the chairman of the American Conservative Union if you've been to see back you recognize him he's also\nAll over TV even brave enough to go on MSNBC\nMatt or if you would have told me three months ago that I Would be doing exactly what you're doing praising Mitch McConnell Lindsey Graham and Susan Collins I would've said you're drunk match lap go home but that's exactly what's happened this is this is a little bit of a miracle ...\nLet's talk about ... just for a minute you're I mean it was Mitch McConnell who deserves the credit for keeping all those centers together and we had the majority in the Senate and when\nA mere Garland was picked for the Supreme Court opening that was Mitch McConnell's doing kept those centers together he kept all of them together and that's why we're where we are\nWhen you're a hundred percent correct you just outlined credit for that and he and now he deserves great credit for the fact that is ... you know not done yet a\nTomorrow or will be the second Trump nominee ticket shepherd shepherded through the Senate and under increasingly difficult circumstances and I'm going to make a production I\nThink we're going to have another one next year and a and if you thought this one was just way to get the next book is an excellent could be replacing a liberal and a and I think the stakes I think the charges will be even more outlandish and so it was the tactics\nWell I I Hope we have some lesson as you called for us to look for some kind of unifying moment and Susan Collins that as well I've been telling everybody go pick up ... millers autobiography and read what Democrats you used to be like\nYou know read about a guy who was a blue dog Democrat from the south who had reasonable approach is to a changing minds in different opinions and I think that's kind of the mold that the Democrats have lost complete touch with\nSo I I I'm pushing that in the time remaining that just quick question you'll have like five daughters you and mercy has five young young daughters\nWe do we have five daughters that's exactly right\nHow has this last three weeks been at the dinner tables in the ... house\nThat's a really great question because I've had a lot of pretty serious conversations for two older girls one is a sophomore in high school um goes to a high school that kind of a sister school to Georgetown Prep and\nThey all fuel silver lined by the\nBy the treatment of these Catholic institutions I think there's a real unacceptable a talk about Catholics of their institutions which were disgusted about and I talked to my eighth grader and I talk to them how\nThey have to be careful out there with social media and drinking and of course boys and you know all these little lessons of life which are really important to know but I also ah you know what happens at our dinner table a lot is because they see their parents on TV which they think is really a kind of like the big deal\nBut you know you got to fight and I'll tell you what Brett Kavanaugh puppy this last couple of weeks that I wouldn't have thought that was this type of person as well as I Know he's pretty\nHe's pretty mild mannered you know he's low key\nBut you know what he did when they went to what the character assassination he fought back he fought back hard and when we talk about the around the dinner table we talk about that because they see their parents being criticized at the end we tell them that we're proud of what we do and they don't have to agree with this politically when they grow up they have to agree with us now by the way life is just fed it tore\n[laughter] that whatever they want that we talk about\nThe need in a democracy to stand up for yourself and to speak your mind and I think for especially young women that's really important lesson\nWell it's important that they know they have that arrow in their quiver\nAnd also that it's not the first era you pull out every time you know and I think having a show just that he waited until he had to go there\nAnd then he fought back I thought that was a very powerful time and I thought today how did it with Susan Collins match slap I Can't thank you for taking time out of what should be a celebratory dinner night for you and your wife\nAnd I appreciate you for being a friend not only mine but of this show and the the conservatism everywhere\nThanks Mike you're a good man and I have to say that God Bless America I think we have a great future before us\nFrom your lips God keep us go in the right way thank you bat [laughter] we'll see you soon\nTheir egos match lap or if you've never been to sea pac\nWhich happens every year in the spring it's even in a non presidential election year\nIt is worth the trip if you're anywhere near DC and if you have a young person who's looking at politics and interested in politics especially from a conservative point of view it's really important that you get them involved because their training\nAnd a good information there as well All right I'm rambling on when we get back let's talk more about today I'll give you more Susan Collins\nYeah they're meow mix commercial one of the worst jingles ever but you know what we all remember it we've all gone meow meow meow meow meow meow yes I Know I'm Sorry\nUh we're also talking about cabin on we're talking about anything else you want to talk about it's a friday and Dr Rick in Maryland is checking in Dr Rick what kind of doctor and what part of Maryland\nI'm a clinical psychologist and the people in Montgomery County Maryland oh my goodness you are very few conservative strange but the n._r._a. cart [laughter]\nWow well I I understand I'm a a state north of you I'm In Maryland and I'm In the Delaware\nAnd uh I'm surrounded as if you're in northern Delaware it's blue as could be and\nI'm surrounded by socialist communist an anarchist there some nice people they just don't understand the world\nThey don't understand I've been blessed to be on a pretty ... on the faculty of procedures medical school that I won't mention um they don't know what to do with me and I am the token you know a conservative Harry in\n'em and for me what is absolutely mind numbing it how very very bright people\nCan be you know literally so brainwashed by mainstream media that ... you know even though there are no facts or being\nA doctor for it and lots of questions that remain on answered a regarding motivations and even just the ... of some of the things she said\nAnd they wait all these things\nAnd I think the worst of a judge Kavanaugh you know if I went back to pointed out\nWell I go back to everything that Chris Matthews said the day he was nominated it's only ten seconds long but this was Chris Matthews June twenty eighth of this year's\nTime for vengeance for what happened two years ago and if they don't read the vengeance now with four and a half weeks for that wants to go before the election they will not look very strong to their base and I think there'll be under attack\nSo it was all about vengeance it was and you know about revenge\nSo I just uh I'm stunned by it but yeah we all we all have liberal friends and we have to kind of be quiet around them I've been sending kitten videos to people\nIn the last two days because\nI knew we were going to make it across the finish line or I talk to you have a jingle I've got thirty seconds left you have a jingle the torches you every day\nI'm not a fan of the doctor pepper I'm a pepper she's a ... would you like the effort to I

George or a hundred percent correct and part of this starts not just a with what we talk about between ourselves but Dana Perino who I just think is one of the greatest people ever in media\nDana and she's fair to Dana tweeted out today that we just don't understand our history and I contend that because we don't teach it we don't teach American history we don't teach the constitution we just finished what was it three weeks ago was constitution week\nAnd I guarantee it the school's took the money to hand out the pocket constitutions but nobody had a real discussion\nOf the constitution no and I I'm lax myself so that's why I carry one all the time\nAnd I think that if you get judges\nOn the Supreme Court who will follow this operating manual that's been handed to them and not rewrite the laws or reinterpret the laws uh I think we're going to be in a better place and I also think this this whole success of today\nIs only part of what Donald Trump and Mitch McConnell have been able to do with the appointment of more judges that are getting confirmed in a record rate and I think what's happened there not just mad at Kavanaugh\nI think the Democrats woke up in the middle of this confirmation and what do you have any idea how many judges Donald Trump is getting appointed\nWe are screwed for decades and that's actually I think part of the anger so that\nYou just you know the judicial was always designed to be the weakest of the three branches it was just designed as a referee on the court\n... well on the basketball court right there but there there were designed to referee here's what it says if you have a disagreement about what it says we will re read it for you and tell you what the laws say they weren't they weren't there to change\nI Love the fact that you

captured Susan Collins was going in for the vote on cloture\nAnd she walked into the the uh same hallway where the robots were where these folks were and she was accosted by both protesters and reporters\nHow do you have an outlet make I mean you have to find out how to do on\nThat cap I well the I Will be voting yes [noise]\nAnd see the final confirmation vote and I will announce tonight in polls show signs of how to vote later today\nThat was Susan Collins earlier today before she delivered that epic address tonight\nWho just some magical day and again I I go back to the discussion we had an hour ago in this very radio show if you would have told me earlier this year four months ago that Lindsey Graham Mitch McConnell and Susan Collins would be the three heroes\nThe salvation of Donald Trump's presidency and the Supreme Court justice I Would have said you're on your mind\nYou need to put down the pipe\nBut no that's exactly how this worked out\nSusan Collins gave such a brilliant and measured addressed today I have to give you a little bit of a snippet of what she said talking about the process because she really gave a history lesson she give a lesson in law and logic and decency\nOur set praying Court confirmation process\nHead spinning steady get fined for more than Thirty years why can only hope that the cabinet nominations it's where the press has finally hit\nAgain spectra sat each intervention well senator side what the constitution said fights and Ken sent in ...\nI thought that was brilliant and you know we're talking to match slap earlier and Matt said that he thinks next year\nTwenty Nineteen there may be another retirement on the Supreme Court and with that retirement it's more than likely going to be a liberal justice which means then the court with a pick from Donald Trump would swing from five for conservative\nTo liberal advantage to a six three and that is going to be too much for liberals to handle that that change in the ratio would\nAbsolutely make everybody on the left to go nuts and they would be a it'd be Armageddon for them be legal Armageddon for them so uh uh the the biggest thing I think Susan Collins did today in your argument\nThat she made her case\nWas to talk about something that the left would not let us get through and that was the presumption of innocence that if you were charged with something you cues to doing something in this country if we don't hang onto the presumption of innocence\nThan it is all over for America as a as a civil society\nPrints venison since relevant to the fight consent function when any accusation kept her\nFrom the nominees otherwise six cents blurry rat I worry that part of this ... cents and could lead to a lab public faith and the judiciary and with the huge
