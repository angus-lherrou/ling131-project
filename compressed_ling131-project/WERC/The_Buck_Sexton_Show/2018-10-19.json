I was I was up Lindsey we weren't off the record but I was giving him a little bit of what I think's going to he was give me a little bit of whether you think's going on and here's the bottom line\nThe Kavanaugh effect is very real Lindsey certainly knows that because he had his proudest moment I think\nEver in the Senate defending Kavanaugh but here's what's happening and the reason that this is trending toward the Republicans at this stage of the game because you have ... Democrats are are they're running a a campaign at\nAll the local level of a or a local elections\nRather [noise] uh you know the state and and congressional level of healthcare you don't hear about it much but that's what they're messaging and healthcare help your health care at the national level they're making this whole Trump issue but really they're pushing the health care issue very hard because they know the polling showed that that actually for the people were going to vote that matters to the\nRepublicans do have had a gift recently\nAnd what you see\nIs that the cabinet ... effect in any state that's read where there's a Democrat who's trying to pull the usual you know Democrat oh I'm kind of centrist on these things I'm sort of a conservative Democrat had fake\nIs\nThat's not going to fly that's not going to work um the dynamic of this playing out right now\nIs the uh the\nDynamics playing out is that in states where\nIt's clearly a red state and the conservatives Republicans have the advantage Trump showing up for base turnout trumpet showing up to make sure the base remembers that they need to be a part of what's going on here in this midterm election\nBut the dynamics and I think is really interesting and you're not hearing you talk about the media because they're all they're they're actively wishing in a way they hope it goes away and it is\nIn a elections that are in states where it's kind of a you know a a Democrat in a in a red state you know it's a little bit of a of a close circle all across the board\nThey want people to come and speak about the cabinet ... want Lindsey Graham to go and speak because that's a reminder to anyone who's toward the center of just how you cannot trust the Democrats with power\nShowing very red in very red states to get the base out\nYou're going to have a lot of talk about you're going to have Trump visiting Trump's getting the base fired up he's going to get them to show up at the polls are great but in states where it's a closer call where it's a little more purple where there you're going to have\nThe Lindsey Graham's of the G O P showing up and saying remember what they did to Kavanaugh\nYou can't put these people you can't trust these people with power you are not being a responsible citizen if you think that these Democrats should be given any any more authority now already have all the wives the American people\nKavanaugh could be the game changer think about what a political miscalculation the Democrats made their\nThink about what that what really happened they thought\nThat they would stop the Supreme Court sheet from going to a conservative constitutional list and even if they couldn't stop it they would be rewarded by their base\nFor just going thermonuclear to try to stop just huge a scorched earth do everything they could but what we're seeing is dating anticipate that in a lot of close fought elections in suburban parts of America are a lot of Republican women\nAre worried about what happened to Capitol furious\nAnd they want to make a statement and they're coming out to vote you know if your a pink hat wearing you know meet your T shirt emblazoned left wing feminist\nYou already we're going to vote and you hate Trump doesn't matter but if somebody was like well you know sometimes I I'm a little bit you know ... with some of what Trump has drawn to it but you're you're a Republican woman\nAnd you see what they did the Kavanaugh what the Democrats did and what that would mean for the future this country going forward a lot of them\nAre absolutely fired up about this and that could be the game changer it could be the enthusiasm among center right women in suburban districts that makes this house contest it's going to be down to the wire this is going to be really close I think\nCould still go to the Republicans oh that would feel like a miracle but it could still happen and it's\nGoing to be because of Kavanaugh so folks that fight that we had to defend Kavanaugh is critical [noise]\nI've got a cup of it in my hands right now my friend black rifle coffee and I'm drinking it black\nBecause it is delicious coffee\nIn fact I've turned a bunch of people in my office and just in my day to day life in the block rival coffee drinkers\nOnce they tried to realize that this is as good as any coffee you'll get anywhere and on top of that it's a company that you will appreciate\nIt veterans that run black rifle coffee and they found that by the way and now they're all about patriotism freedom and delicious brew all day every day I start my morning off [noise]\nAnd it's you know it's very early I start my morning off drinking black rifle coffee because I think it's so delicious and I know that I can have

eight o'clock [noise]\nAnd that's going to be the ... that's the kind of decision that is going to be the very top level of any government US government any government whether they're going to let that information get out if they have a ... member it could be a human source right we don't know but if you're going to have\nProof if you're going to show evidence of this you would have to also most likely\nBe willing to say where can you know say what it is which means you're going to expose\nVery likely how how you got it [noise] ah so I I don't know I don't know what they've got quite yet um but I Do think that there is a\nVery real possibility here that the Saudis are I'm sure they're going to suffer some consequences but they're going to probably live to fight another day diplomatically on this one because they're going to say that it's just\nSomething that happened they were in control of it and you know things things go bad and ah there'll be better in the future or something like that and I don't remember the Saudis are in the region are pretty important player for us ... state palm pay Oregon\nTitle further from the morning that we ought to give them a few more days to complete that so that we do have a complete understanding of the ... which one we can make decisions about how the United states should respond to\nIncidents around ignition choking up I think it's important for all the number two we're belongs aside teen thirty two long strategic relationship with the kingdom of Saudi Arabia to continue to be important kind of terrorism\nCustody of the two holy sites are\nForeign changing alliance the United states we need to be mindful of that as well\nIt's an important ally\nNot something that we want to just discount and just fly off the handle decide that we're going to try and make some big statement here\nThere are plenty of places all over the world were very very bad things happen to people on a daily basis we can't make all of it are problem I Know that there's symbolism ear journalist he was he was a green card holder he was a permanent was in this country not the same as being a citizen but\nHe definitely had very real ties to America this was this happened on foreign soil however and so the people that are calling for an investigation I think just don't realize what all the hurdles are in place of that investigation we have no basis driven or have any jurisdiction but no basis\nFor sending any kind of investigative team and last one the Turks allow it 'cause it's Turkish\nDitch Turkish sovereignty or I mean is on Turkish soil and to the Saudis would have to allow because of the council it so you are multiple levels of complexity\nAdded into what would already be an investigation that is highly sensitive\nAnd I don't know who we think we can really trust and that whole process either I mean if we don't send Americans to do this I Would be very suspicious of what information we get an how we get it\nBut if we do send Americans um well I just I doubt that's going to happen unless they were brought along kinda riding shotgun so to speak\nVice president Pence however is saying that there will be consequences play clip than\n\nOn there will be consequences the vice president's notice that people are pretty pretty thin on details of what those consequences would be and it's because not only do we have to be concerned with the immediate Saudi response\nWhich would be both overt covert I'm sure against our interest in a whole bunch of different ways we also think about the unintended consequences here\nAnd what would happen from a major fracture in the U.S relationship with Saudi Arabia truth is we don't want to major break with the Saudis um the Saudis are in some ways useful right now and here's what nobody really wants to say\nThe scariest scenario for America when it comes to Saudi Arabia in a lot of ways is actually a revolution and then democracy um the Saudi people in charge of what\nGoes on in that country and representation in Saudi Arabia for look just remember what happened with the Arab Spring with at all it's going to be great in Egypt they're going to elect people western style democracy is going to be great there's going to be human rights and women are going to school and all these ... which I mean that was happening in Egypt beforehand but you know what I mean and it's going to be a really\nBig step forward and then the Muslim Brotherhood came into power\nLet me tell you something if they had elections in Saudi Arabia the Islamists would be in power there too and I would offer to you probably much more hard line Islamist than anybody wants to admit or or would a would realize right now because the\nClerics that are allowed to preach in Saudi Arabia right now only do show with the acceptance and the and the ... of the government if you actually had the top pulled off this thing and the people of Saudi Arabia were calling the shots and the preachers were whoever they were listening to\nUh I Will be bad very quickly and that's that's kind of a nightmare scenario it's one of the reasons why the Saudis and the Pakistanis for example get away with as much as they do in terms of our relationship with them is because the worst case scenario is not that they're mad at us the worst case scenario for the government is overthrown in either of those places and Pakistan\nBecause you have nuclear missiles in the equation it's particularly scary ah in Saudi Arabia\nWe have very few powerful military allies left the middle east is dwindling we've Israel\nAnd then\nIt starts to get pretty thin Jordan is a good ally but it's a small country not but not for the wealthy are powerful one of the Turks are increasingly Islam eyes and they can't be counted on to be our friends in the Mid East\nSaudis obviously we've got this problem playing out right now got our concerns there Egypt is just not what it once was not as reliable a partner and it's got its own problems and you look around the region like who can we turn to who will be helpful I mean Iraq we're just hoping to place doesn't\nCollapse into some kind of ethnic civil war and you got it wrong clearly is not perfectly fine to the United states so when we talk about consequences for the Saudi Government could ever be against the whole state of Saudi Arabia I mean I don't think that there's going to say\nWe want a Magnitsky sanctions against just a few individuals I don't think that would be\nA sufficient response people are talking about a hundred billion dollar arms deal uh getting shifted around and one way or another getting stop or what whatever they they end up doing\nA this these are major consequences these are major consequences and then you have to look at the other side of this which is the people who are the loudest voices on this issue many of them the Chinese people are the loudest voices on this do not have\nIt's not intelligent\nFor the president to be worked up an angry Africa show gay and chilly at least give if you want to jump out right away as they suggest they wanted to and say\nThat Saudi Arabia\nIs responsible there's going to be huge consequences and I'm going to personally yell at you know Mohammed bin ... if you said you know the Saudis say see they won't even let us do the investigation they're lying there trying to pin this on us this isn't true\nYou can't fly off the handle right away you need to look at what you guys need to look at the facts it's not it's not like ... has been kidnapped and every passing hours you know he's gone\nYou're never coming back\nSo people that are trying to create this rush this rush of action from the United states in response to this that's that's not how we do think it's not how it should be done here\nBut others go even further than max and Max Boot of saying well because Trump is too cozy with dictators all of the world a he is ... is basically responsible Steve Schmidt who I I think is\nYou know I've said before me and ... is one of the dumbest political commentators on TV but Steve Schmidt maybe dumber and it's amazing having seen having seen how he's the hero in the HBO movie about Sarah Palin's are ill fated vice\nPresidential run and they see the real difference he was a\nGuy you know I still like with the judge and the Republicans and stuff than you know murder you irrational and stuff in\nYour Steve Schmidt let let your let let let you hear how close the impersonation really has worked in\nIs the leader of a faction and he is dividing us and those divisions will take years and years and years to heal we are one people\nWe are one people we are the American people and when you say a president in the United states doing what he is doing to this country not to mention it may unraveling of the U.S led liberal global order that\nEmerge from the horror and the catastrophe and out of the death camps in the ruins of a war that killed eighty million people\nHis fidelity to democracy is Neal is Fidel each was small L liberalism is not there and you see it with his complicity in aid is complicity in the murder of a Washington Post columnist by a Middle Eastern thug\nComplicit in how complicit you ... how is he complicit what the heck does this have to do with Trump that was on MSNBC they should be embarrassed that they would air that kind of stupidity complicit by everything\nYou said was wrong everything's oh he doesn't believe in a box you really Trump gets shot down by judges in the Ninth Circuit left and right over ... ridiculous but you know because okay well see you in court\nHow was how was Trump destroying democracy how she'll do any of those small liberalism you mean like cutting regulations and cutting taxes that's that sounds like small L liberalism just the guy everything he says it's not true was an idiot [noise]\nDon't want to say mean things you just dumb\nDoesn't know any international relations either like I should stick to like\nTalking on TV about that [noise]\n\n[noise] [noise]\nNews I'm Steve Rapaport back on his mid term election campaign blitz\nBecause we are America First again it's America first\nPresident Trump in Montana to kick off a trio of rallies prior to leaving Washington the president conceded that missing Saudi journalist ... is likely dead\nIf Saudi Arabian leaders are found to be responsible the president says there will be consequences will have\nTo be very severe evidence it's bad bad I'm the\nPresident met earlier today with secretary of state Mike Pompeo who advised giving Saudi leaders a few more days to finish an investigation before reaching conclusions about to show these disappearing\nFox's Jarrett helper and at the White House the Saudis the knowledge of

for it where you say the Miller is appropriate and independent\nBut you can't answer congressman question about something you said in a meeting with the deputy head of the of the FBI at a time when he was frankly acting head of the FBI 'cause it's a company had been fired by the memo he wrote back and Rod Rosenstein was a no show last week it is something that is just not right either obligated\nAs a guy who is Senate confirmed when the chairman of the committee that has jurisdiction over your agency asked me to come to Congress and testify right here we're obligated to do that you're supposed to do it under oath and he was a\nNo cell yeah he's got time to talk to the press about the Mueller investigation of Russian\nRosenstein thinks that he's kind of a law unto themselves folks deputy attorney general guy overseeing the Russia investigation really has no problem acting like he is part of his own branch of government and really he's running his own branch of government that branch of government is the F. B. a\nSeal you ask for a miracle I bring you the F. B. or\nTo get that one but not really it's it's true that Rosenstein has somehow managed to stay in this role and\nI think it's because he knows that the hashtags\nResistance and Trump knows is to just not worth getting rid of them the hash tag resistance would call them politically and utterly freak out if in fact there was a a ... a removal of Rosenstein from his duties\nBut some people don't care\nHe got the chairman of the Freedom Caucus Mark Meadows he is calling on Rosenstein to step down at a ... a deputy attorney general\nBecause lawmakers are looking into reports about how roads and so I Want to talk of all wearing a wire to record present drop you know I really do believe that if when I was a little a little a little nobody CIA analyst\nIf I had said that I was going to wear a wire to try and trap just even the CIA director I think I Would have been scored it out of the building by ... by armed security I think they would have been like okay you're ... if I said that in a meeting in front of people\nBut for the deputy attorney general to say it and I've gone back and forth on this I don't I don't think he was kidding\nI think that became the excuse but the more I thought about it I'm not sure what the latest if you're like ... two weeks ago said he was kidding yeah but I thought about it more I don't know like I wasn't there that's all I can do is base it on the things that I've heard\nBut you know Rosenstein or has he look he's an Obama administration hold over and he's clearly very\nTight with the DEA OJ bureaucracy and the bureaucracy protects itself\nBut that's why I'm Mark meadows is finally had enough here's with Fox News reports about meadows of the Freedom Caucus she says that he made the comments about Rosenstein stepping down\nAs James Baker the FBI's former top lawyer was questioned behind closed doors on Capitol Hill earlier today about Rosenstein is reported comments as well as other decisions made by the bureau meadows criticize Rosenstein for not accepting a reason imitation to testify before the house Judiciary Committee about the record a reported comments\n[noise] you know roses ... there should be accountability there should be accountability for those people should not uh people should not be able to do and say whatever they want in a senior government role like that just because getting rid of them might feel kind of messy\nAnd that's not the only deep states kind of a deep state updates the deep state store I wanted to tell you about uh you have\nA\nThis treasury employee who is charged with leaking financial fence and reports on Trump team people\nShe was apparently arrested with a flash drive in hand here's a quote from Fox the top Treasury Department employee was charged with leaking confidential financial documents pertaining to former Trump officials was apprehended the previous even with a flash drive in Tennessee allegedly ... information in her hand\nOh my gosh caught\nRed handed or flash handed went nuts week this week but the dramatic arrest late late Tuesday came on the heels of other high profile leak related prosecutions of the administration which has pledged to go on the offensive against leakers the president has have called traders and cowards\nAre so this is now the Mayflower Edwards who is a senior official at the financial crimes enforcement network she gave a reporter bank reports allegedly documenting several suspicious financial transactions\nThis is so dirty as as I've been telling you I really want you understand this isn't leaking information that is necessarily accurate or even meaningful this is the leaking rumors in a sense that the federal government has on hand that they can look into\nThey wouldn't even have known until

our GDP eighty plus percent of our job creation as services so when you're a service economy\nThe way to stimulate your economy the way to grow your economy is to allow consumers to buy goods as cheaply as they possibly can and use the wreck their money to buy services or if they're lucky enough to have anything that raises the price of a good\nDoesn't make sense for our economy even if they're paying it to the government has a tariff it's just another cat\nBefore we close out here when I say real quick here they get from a grade on the economy eighth or ...\nWhat would it be so far well you know I'd have to qualify that I Would say on a general parents have pretty good regulations are dying and taxes are down\nBut I I gave him more credit which is pseudo credit and that is he's a great cheerleader and there is such a thing of subjectivity in in cheerleading and you know an economy that people do respond in a positive way uh this way\nBut the economy has done better but it's all it's sort of like you're doing well if you could borrow millions of dollars every every month you know so uh but the economy on the surface is good but it's not sound as not last name it's based on that and the payment will come too soon\n\nI'm sure many recognize that second voice that was Ron Paul man himself who saying it's all going to come crashing down\nBefore that you had Gary Cohn who is very much the establishment voice in and were economy is right now and he's saying you know services gotta ... it's all about services gotta keep good cheap got to get people buying stuff that you know Walmart and\nI was gonna say Sears alright piece years R. I. P. but these are very different views\nOf what's going on right now here's what I Would say about the Ron Paul uh let me let me be able to Ron Paul servers that was from an interview we did on rising by the way we're going to speak to foreign Congressman Paul [noise]\nAh [noise] he's right Ron Paul is right mathematically historically he is correct or there is a\nVery clear history of currency in a in the history of the world and it is that fewer currency always ends in disaster and financial calamity\nIs very clear that there's there's no exception it always and very very badly\nNow that\nSaid Ron Paul saying that the economy right now is not sound too much debt and all that he can be right put on what timeline\nAnd if Ron Paul is right that the economy is going to crash fifty years from now you have to ask yourself today how much do you care I Know we don't want to say oh for my kids and my grandkids and but how much do you really care and beyond that\nIf it's fifty years from now how do you leave the Next Fifty years right how do you\nTry to make money in the markets or how do you try to move on to your career and pay off your house deal with the basic financial challenges that we all have ride telling telling you that the stock market might go to zero and our our dollar maybe worth nothing which I don't I don't think that's ever going to happen but even if it were true that happened to fifty years that's not very useful information right now\nSo Ron Paul's been saying that the economy was going to crash out for a very long time and it was kind of writing two thousand eight we came up on the precipice I get that are two thousand nine\nBut I don't think that he's right right now I just\nPut his I put his words in there because I Do think that it's a long term warning and especially as we are considering now the possibility of dealing with some of the entitlement programs that are the big drivers of our\nDebt we got to remember that we're we're heading in a brand new a\nBad place might not be two years from now might be twenty we're heading to a bad place as an economy unless we do something about it and it's very hard to get the political\nWill you know look this is I go home and I'm like you know what I I really\nWish I'd get lean again enough that that I Would just see all my muscles right that'd be fun but you know it's more fun than than putting myself on that pretty strict routine of calories add calories in calories out and all that you know it's more fun\nEating a big gluten free donut when I get home at the thing they exist\nOr you know deciding to just eat half a wheel of brie that's fun right now and when you're dealing with long term projections sneak and it was in pre amazing breeze always so good when did you live in long term projections and the economy\nDoes that sound will to fancy rags debris debris delicious your is fantastic uh I was like American cheese on America jeez I'm a burger yesterday was delicious\nAh [noise] nobody wants to be the one that has to think long term no one wants to be the one that has to think strategically about this you want to deal with\nYour immediate needs answer Ron Paul as I said he's right but when we just don't know ah that doesn't mean we shouldn't take action that just means we need to be aware that the actions not going to come quickly and we should\nBalance out what are what what what risks are except what systemic risks are acceptable to our our economy to our children and grandchildren's economies\nAre and then you Gary Cohn with tariffs on China I I really hope that Trump is right on this one\nI've given up a lot of credit on the tariff issue\nAnd um I've been willing to say that I\nKnow what the I Know what the argument is against terrorists and I know the the smart set is almost always an entirely opposed to terms\nTrump has taken a different approach and I think he has earned the right to try and play it out however he can that said uh I Do have some concerns about where this is where this is going to have the economy it's been a ... a few weeks\nAnd people have ... ... people have seen some stuff that's going on right now and the economy and that's that's\nWhen you got to start really thinking about what's what's happening next because I'm telling you the Democrats easiest path to power is a recession where they turn all just raised it created on the left and they mobilize it and they're going to mobilize it in the direction\nOf socialist that's what they're going to do that is what is coming [noise] ah so\nBy the way I really do recommend you all checkout book event dot com it's a project I'm working all the ... research because I'll go where the market is going that's different from the overall
