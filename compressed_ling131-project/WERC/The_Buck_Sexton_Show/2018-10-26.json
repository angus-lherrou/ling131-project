going to see that happen and the next couple of weeks when the elections take place and the president's going to continue to lay out that case but at the same time we're condemning violence and calling on all Americans to come together\nThere's a big difference between a comments made an action taken the president is certainly not responsible for sending suspicious packages to someone no more than Bernie Sanders was responsible for a supporter of his shooting up or Republican baseball field\nThat should be a pretty pretty clear line right the standard here Asian some big shock it's not some huge surprise it's not something that we need to take a step back from an ... hold on a second ... how do we how do we do this how do we deal with this\nRight you are not responsible for what someone else does because of your politics\nYou may be responsible for violence if you directly incite violence and that's why even with our First Amendment there are\nSome exceptions for incitement to violence right if you're in front of a big crowd use are burned down that store across the street and then they burned down that store you or morally called the Boeing and legally\nLiable for that ...\nYou know but but if you say I think we should have lower taxes in this country and then someone hears that and they run down and they like the IRS building on fire you are not responsible for that okay because if that were the case I think about how that could be abused think about the way this would expand the hecklers veto\nThink about how that would shut down discussion and debate anytime somebody wanted to just credited political belief audiologist all you have to do is have one person yes that's right and false like fashion\nAct like a complete idiot\nAll they have to do and then everyone says oh she see that and it's just common by the way you see this with this is a a continuation of the debate you have with radical Islam\nThe left will always rushed through the radical Islam is not in any way representative of Islam and then any jihad or jihad is our representative of the broader Islamic faith that they will say that\nAnd then when you responsible hold on a second I mean who are you to or you'd have to declare what isn't is not Islamic member Obama sat at the un future does not belong to those whose land or the prophet of Islam one of the strangest things us presidents ever said and that kind of forum\nA but they'll fight you choose a new one that won meanwhile if some guy you know somewhere who's white named Billy Bob\nUh says something mean to somebody and and says something racist or whatever to someone\nAnd commits a hate crime that one incident is magnified by the media is oh my gosh there's look at all the hate in this country look at how hateful we there's three hundred and twenty million of us wanted idiots somewhere did something bad but he's white and male and on the right so that means that the right has to own this whole thing\nBecause because one guy said something racist because one racist incident when is it the exception when is it the norm this is a very important perception game that the media engages in all the time\nAnd this is where we can't we can't give any ground we do not have a political culture that embraces mob tactics intimidation and violence similar to what the left as we just simply do not\nDoesn't matter that this one incident this one individual has done this this has been roundly condemned we ... with ... there's not a single conservative of any standing anywhere in the country\nWho was at anything other than this was disgusting this person should spend the rest of his life in prison or work with persons it's probably one guy but we'll see\nBut on the left you'll hear well there's no there's no such thing as mobs really there's no problem with getting up in people's faces and yelling at them there's no reason to demand civility when you're dealing with a political party that his show on uncivil in his ideas according to\nPeople like Hillary Clinton [noise] the less as radical off [noise] we are the ones for holding the torch of American values and

this country\nDo not let left get away with its lives [noise] I was\nI was visiting with buck about his show on home title fraud\nWhere the retired FBI agent demonstrated a crime dislike everywhere it's called home title fraud\nAnd it's simple because all home titles are kept on line in fact the FBI guy and home title locked found the title to bucks family's home they forged id and showed him how easy it is to transfer title and lose your whole had it been real this is the foot of taking out loans using books home was equity\nThey wouldn't even have known until late payments ... showed up

Fox News federal and local authorities now looking at Florida as an area of interest as they hunt for the person or persons responsible the series of suspected bombs sent to several high profile Democrats and the other day one was down to address jak Robert Deniro package\nMy friend Sean Davis over at the federal is has the following quote Grassley is criminal referrals of ... and sweat Nick also contains new evidence\nThat sweating it has a history of making false rape charges under penalty of perjury an ex boyfriend says she explicitly threatened to falsely accused him of rape\nAnd have him deported\nGrassley has criminally referred ... and sweat next to the D.

referral is going to be tough to ignore the department of justice is going to have to look into this\nAnd that means folks that there could be unlike the proceeding that the left was so excited to use to try and smear Kavanaugh which was not a\nStandard criminal proceedings right there they could not subpoena people they could not uh take their phone records it by the way they're no phone records of take the allegations were from thirty five years ago or whatever it was just the whole thing was insane and I'm so I'm going to say this\nI Am so proud of what we did hear on the show me and bike and John the whole team and all of you supporting me when that\nReally difficult a couple of weeks especially in the early days we knew it was garbage and we ... we kept their shields Hi yes we did we held the line on this one and people notice by the way\nThere was a front line on defending Kavanaugh and we here in the freedom that we were on that front lawn publicly\nIn every possible way I was in contact with the White House emails trying to get in through the confirmation on a near daily basis\nShow 'em\nThat Grassley is not passing this thing up and saying okay you know we'll let bygones be bygones is the right move and this could this this will mean that they deal Jay now has the ability\nTo pull records you know they they might be able to see some communications perhaps between sweating egg and other people but you know this ...\nYou want to play in this game you want to try to lie and get somebody ruined and smear them you're gonna sign ridiculous sworn statements with no gr operation that nobody would be able to tell you yes or no I mean the whole thing if they can prove she lied\nIf they can prove ... he was part of a conspiracy for her July they must both be criminally prosecuted the law either matters or it doesn't there's really not a lot of room\nFor interpretation here if they can prove it now there is the possibility that they won't be able to prove that sweating collide because her charges were so vague or the statement that she swore was so vague I was at a party in the eighties and there were gang rapes and I think maybe Kavanaugh was near the punch maybe he wasn't\nBut then again she changed her testimony publicly from what the sworn statement was which is when we all knew that this was not just a fix but an obvious fix my dad was when it was clear to anyone paying attention\nOkay this really is too much this person has a problem this person is ill is sick so um and that's where I think we are now\nBut if they they're they're going to try to do two things on the left now because by the way they really don't what can you imagine if Julie sweating it faces criminal prosecution for what happened there what then we're supposed to think what the other two women just they were the ones that were really attack but Julie sweating it just came out of nowhere to lie\nAbout what that does to the narrative\nAnd I am very clear on this one for if you can prove somebody makes a false criminal allegation against anyone they must suffer the consequences because they're doing violence to the truth and they were trying to ruin someone's life is an attempted ruin nation of the human beings life that must be punished\nCrystal Gail magnum I told you this this was the uh the stripper who claimed with\nMike knife on that despicable district attorney down in Durham North Carolina that Duke lacrosse team rape curves complete fabrication a total lie which she claimed the guy was raping her who was miles away at an ATM machine and they had him on video and using his card there so kind of hard for him to raping her when he's a few miles away\nA complete fabrication they didn't press charges against her they did ... along and he should have gone to prison for a long time but they're just ... and\nShe went on to kill her boyfriend stabbed to death later on maybe she should have actually had to deal with justice of course you should have had to deal with justice perhaps somebody would be alive today not only did Kavanaugh survive and therefore due process survive with him through this process\nBut if we really do care about truth and decency and justice in our system\nIf we care about due process and the right to protect your reputation the right to face the acute the to face your accuser the right not to be destroyed at the political whims of the left for their convenience than people who lie\nIn order to destroy you under oath must be punished\nThe left is going to kick and scream over this one because it's a very bad look for them they know now will they be able to prove this I Can't say quite yet\nIs it clear to me that sweating as a liar absolutely\nAbsolutely I as I Know she's a liar not just based on statements he made a base in the contradictions overstatement if you don't say I think someone spiked punch at a party which what what was that even mean that was such a crazy thing to say in the first place he spiking much he's drinking the punch\nHow would you spiking the punch he's gonna he's going to poison we're very or get super drunk all of his male friends too so that they pass out and can't move\nThink about that she didn't she didn't say spiking the drinks spiking an entire punishable determine drink yeah maybe he was putting alcohol in it so that everybody could have some alcohol but he was the whole thing it's just it's none of it rang true it was a fabrication out of this woman's mind she's deranged she'd deranged I mean\nEight hundred additional soldiers the border of the soldiers because of policy common taught us they're not going to be doing any law enforcement activities in the U.S in here they are US military there is providing logistic support intelligence support there helping border patrol do the job but they're not the ones affecting arrests that customs and border with us border patrol rather\nUm but when people in this caravan turn themselves in at these ports of entry\nThey go into the process for asylum so that means is they get to tell their story and his boat and border patrol writes it down and try to verify what they can or immigration and customs forced rather write that down and verifies what they can\nAnd then those people after a pretty short ... wherever you can't hold them longer than twenty days because of the floor as consent decree\nThose people are released into the interior of the United states\nAnd told to come back now some of them may come back a lot of them don't but some of them may come back you know how do you know what the percentages of those who have been told that they cannot stay in the country eighty five percent\nYou know what the percentages of those who have actually been deported from the country\nLess than Fifteen Percent so\nYou know you you look at these numbers you say oh okay if you get into the interior of the United states you're basically free and clear doesn't matter doesn't matter if you don't actually get asylum\nAnd by the way if you get enough thousands of people going through this process from Honduras guess what you're going to even further delay the process but just I didn't really think that we're going to tell three hundred people that are living the United states\nFrom ... you know they came here from Honduras under this program in five years yeah you know what you can't get asylum and we're actually packing your bags to put you on a bus right now we're plane\nNo that's not what's going to happen this is a loophole they are abusing the law as it is written\nAnd we need to deal with is going to change it now I don't just want to say all these bad things and not give you some sense\nOf what could be done to fix this there are things that the president can do there are ways that we can in fact address this problem um but it will take some time\nGoing to take longer than this caravan will take to reach us\nAnd while this issue is bad for the Democrats right now\nI'm just wait until you have images of women and children at the border crying detained separate that they remember it looks bad right now because it's just this caravan on the march and that's what the images are but the imagery which is so important to the politics around this that imagery is going to change\nThe imagery assumed going to be looked at these people\nYou know the the poor to make the hungry\nAt our border women and children\nBeing treated so terribly by Trump's evil racist government\nJust like what we saw this family separation issue there is there\nAre a few ways really to address this I'll talk about those and then also some other stories and uh I might even give you the a ... a little bit of a a taste of the spicy a segment today from\nRising which trust me [noise] it's spicy they would [noise] [noise]\nOff News I'm Kathleen Maloney none of the ten suspicious packages recovered this week exploded\nWhich could help investigators find defender government official is drawing attention to what appears to be thick black electricians tape\nOn the pipe bomb sent a former CIA director John Brennan the officials that investigators are hopeful that black Cape capturing DNA fibers or print Fox's Catherine Harris telling land security secretary Kirstjen Nielsen warning that thousands of migrants marching through Mexico will not be permitted to cross the U.S border\nWe're having a attention right now to ... probably will be apprehended however I but I also take my officer an ancient cat at their own personal safety extraordinarily serious that they can't have the ability of course to defend themselves Neal\nSent in an exclusive interview on Fox is this story with Martha and like how different Fox News [noise]\n\nSomething for ... for ... and pregnant with a guy who can vote on all of our\nArmed him in your home phone were far for ballot provide fodder in front of them were from like on my car reporter for less than what a shame [noise]\n\n\nThat was you know because when it comes to the fight for some thought never saw [noise] I\n... and I think that President Harry Claire if you cannot have a link to come to this country and get kinda tired of this caravan any kind of in our country and well they returned home\n\nOkay that's true but but but\nBeing coached along the way they are being told exactly what to say\nAll they have to do was establish a record and that just means saying they don't think that's\n\nIt's it's sort of switched around used to be that Central American immigrants at the border would would ah would lie and say they were Mexican because if they were going to be detained and sent back they didn't want to get flown back to Central America because they spend a lot of time and money often do you get to the border\nAnd so they would rather just be released back into Mexico you their Central America but now that's changed because of this asylum claim situation and as long as as long as they can\nI'm\nConvinced a border patrol agent or a few border patrol agents and the uh immigrations and Customs Enforcement\nProcess that they are from Honduras um they're going to be part of this asylum deal right they're going to get brought in and letting the injured the United states and as I've been telling you that's not going to that's just there's never going to be real enforcement alright what can be done about this I'm not going to have a bucket or whatever\nThe issue the ultimately the thirty thousand foot level Congress needs to change the law so that it is very clear that asylum is that they didn't change the asylum process so that you apply in your you know in your country or in the nearest country you can get two\nAt a U.S embassy and there's a process it it should not be that you just present yourself in this way out of port of entry\nUm because you're in walking within walking distance the United states that's not that's not the way that this law should be but uh as importantly there's something called a safe third party say third country agreement\nIs well I like to tell you things on the show that you won't hear from other people because I actually read lots of things and do lots of research because if you were kind enough to spend your time with me I have a mandate to make sure that it's time well spent team\nSo the say third a third country agreement would mean and we have one with Canada by the way so this is not some ... crazy concoction and we've we've discussed\nThe possibility of this uh at the government to government level with Mexico\nBut what it would mean is that we would set up at the border but on the Mexican side of the border and were you yes we would probably have to pay for this I Know his book they should they should pay for it will go a lot faster and much more effective if we pay for it we would set up\nA centrally trailers you know a a holding facility sounds like it's a lot of tension facility but it's\nA what would be somewhat similar to a a refugee camp situation it would be a place where people you know they have uh they're they're able to stay\nSafe there's water there's food um but it's on the Mexican side of the border and we would move infrastructure down to the border so that you have\nAt port of entry courts\nSo you would start you would move the judicial infrastructure to deal with these immigration cases right down to the border\nAnd people that were waiting for their adjudication ... so that would speed it up obviously and people that are waiting for their education process would be on the Mexican side of the U.S border\nWhich means that they don't uh they're they're not able to just go further and further and ensure United States and get some you know immigrant rights lawyer to represent them pro bono to keep suing the federal government all the rest of it if their claim is denied guess what\nThey they get to stay in Mexico\nOr or the Mexican government then can can hand them off to their country of origin I put that way you prevent what's happening right now which is using the legal system and it's very important we understand that they are not illegal immigrants\nThey may cross illegally\nSo then they are in the U.S illegal at the moment that they say I have a credible fear of my safety these Honduran immigrants\nGo into the asylum process and then they're due process allows them to stay in the United states that is the law I've talked to senior immigrations officials about this is talk of lawyers about this that's how this works\nSo we need to take action here beyond just we're going to enforce the law the border that's great that's a good start but if you have this caravan of seven thousand that gets all the way even if it's only a thousand that gets to the border\nPercent chance yeah I had a line to allow and thought that ... percent chance at the time if I find all that all the things that are going on to carry that out a little\nAttacks are that at all fat having our ... and you think the cat and two it's like an incredibly special ... can get to the border\nI'm at you know on a day as well actually that's not right in fact to have to either ... or\nSo okay\nI mean Bruce or Mike right I Want to bring you it is it as an impartial observers here you know you can tell it's\nA little there's a little bit back and forth but I mean there's nothing to do crazy there right now that's a good conversation that is exactly the guy's a spirit conversation and then things get a little a little more test flight Ninety\nThere was another way that fad the Democratic party is\nComprised of racists white liberal fast track and I write that flight well let's go back and and like fat people on the ... are not aware of what's called ... park that's kind of ... about the color and the White House um why why would you ask that question\nThat has to think about like I said well why why we got to laugh at that's why don't you ask that last or for that because they can't say I had about that\nBecause you're bringing a whole crowd that young African American leader so I felt that I talk about that in fact many with light levels don't realize that you put on\nTheir way of an economy that ... ... ... ... ... ... only on how they're going to be that way I look I football had at how social that way for power shameful\nAnd that was fine that will shift away anyway I don't agree with that if I don't want to claim that are scheduled for ... stack and try to challenge Congress ... surrounded by way\n[noise]\nYeah I felt like I got a little like I look at their word yelling it was civil but I felt like a little bit tension there producer Mike yeah definitely it was fun I like watching it and I like looking at the [laughter] this is\nThe problem whatever whatever we have a segment like this and I'm like well that's not really the ... the show every book shut up people are funny [laughter] I'm like wait I thought I thought we were the trust tree I thought this was the best not to do it I think we're all going to supposed to like you know buck slap each other and I'm not even in about it\nThere's there's more there I'm like okay because the control room because I kept going beyond replay their their control rooms like we've got to go to break we got to get a break and I'm like okay I got a brick Chris was like no not done I was like damn okay here we go\nSo uh yeah it was a spicy spicy one day when we get we'll get producer Michael one of these panels man that oh man my could we\nDo that absolutely right yeah the bosses would\nNever be the film that would be the same again buck I Know exactly what Mike Mike slaps will be like new truck bomb hit it off thinking about leaving a real quiet it on him and tell them not yeah no no you do your your feisty and I know the Irish are I'm ... I'm One one thousand Native American but I'm half I'm\nGood thanks thanks right see I I Want to make sure that we got producer Mike in with\nThe with the objective opinion there because you know for me it's like I mean I obviously ideologically agree with Candice I'm and I I think that she's very talented and but I also am very ah very fond of crystal even though I think that her politics or\nOr I'm\nWrong [laughter] so you know we were just it was it was quite an exchange there and\nUm we'll see tomorrow I'll give you a little preview later on in the show of what the expectation is for a for tomorrow there might be I might be involved in a\nA shall we say more more spirited discussion tomorrow of things I might be the one that actually has to do a bit of a a bit of debating but we've got a\nI don't we don't really have time to get to the ... ... it's a fun named to say the men that guys\nThat guy's been treated\n... says well you know we we can actually do a little bit of it so I interviewed Papadopoulos we're this one today and here's what he said about the notion of Russia collusion play twenty\nGeorge what is what are your feelings now that it it has come out it's been reporting here at the hill that there was exculpatory evidence based on your conversation with an FBI informant\nThat you weren't trying to do anything wrong that you oppose any trees in collusion that that information may not have been presented to the Pfizer court what do you think about that\nOf course is for me it's a it's a very sad it was I was impressed with John's reporting but for me it was a sad day to see that uh that was not presented to the price of the court and that in my entire image has been characterized by this false narrative\nThat I Am some sort of patient zero uh about a Russian conspiracy and a a Russian a Coca Cola collusion conspiracy when in fact I have absolutely no Russian contacts whatsoever\nI've never traveled to Russia I don't speak Russian I don't even have Russian American friends are in this country so um when I found myself at the epicenter of this a conspiracy\nAs somebody who actually has no Russia contact something just to not smell right at all to me\nGeorge Papadopoulos who remember\nWhen it looked shaky on Carter Page you also had nothing\nTo do with collusion or conspiracy running this stuff but it looks shaking them as the owner Papadopoulos that's how the FBI or justify this investigation that that it was supposed to be Papadopoulos I'm telling you people who believe that Papadopoulos was part of some of some crumbling back conspiracy will\nBelieve anything don't believe anything this you\nKnow normal rational person could sit down and look at the facts talked to this guy and come away with thinking yeah that's right he was trying to throw a presidential election that\nIs utterly insane orderly and said there's just no\nRationale to write all other than it it it explains for some people or gives them an outlet for their anti Trump rage and anything that gives them an outlet for anti Trump raged they are in favor of\nSo if someone will tell them if there was a massive conspiracy to undermine the election everything and they have to believe that this total ... I don't mean that a mean way seems like a nice guy you only got fourteen days in jail we've got a felony on his record now\nWhich thanks owning firearm no voting hard to get a job\nYou know can't leave the country probably usually have road travel restrictions he's got\nAnd and also I I don't like that when he talks to me about this there even restrictions as part of his plea agreement about what he can say publicly I don't I don't like that you should be able to discuss any aspect of your case once you're once you're through the system there shouldn't be a gag order on you know once\nYour your case as you know once you've served your punishment your case is done but there was one on him [noise] so which do battle things just nuts and he was testifying today on Capitol Hill which is why we were talking about them better but it's the whole thing is just totally an orderly\nBunkers go um and I don't know how anybody can think were they were a year ago and they were just so quarter period or Papadopoulos global book no no that was ...\nSo she's making LeBron James money to do a job that a lot of other people could do quite honestly better than her for about a tenth of money\nI in fact there were other people doing the job before that we're getting better ratings and we're making a fraction of her salary people on them but executives at these places are big public companies places you know NBC and NBC Universal and they're owned by the big paramount other big a parent a paramount parent companies and uh\nYou know they could they can determine what the salary is right that's 'cause we've got shareholders public companies lots of ways to slash the money around without any Bruce or Mike oh no no no my kids say in sixty nine mill none of them like I Know that's for now that's ... I'm In a year in salary that's for her full they're paying out her full contract\nThat's what that's sixty nine mill is I'm I'm Talking about you know the or\nThe year to year so we should make a lot of money but it's like a ... she really worked at the answer was no\nUm you know they some of these people will get in touch with the corporate structure at these places and they get huge huge paychecks but anyway so then Megan Megan a had a few bumps here and there I forget exactly what they were but she oh she brought up a Jane Fonda is plastic surgery\nWhich I didn't realize Jane Fonda would be so sensitive about but she was and it was kind of a weird thing to bring up in the interview under the circumstances and that was kind of a bomb for a you know\nFor her to bring up in that way just wasn't wasn't smart and\nAnyway the latest controversy which has gotten her ousted got booted from NBC\nWhich you remember she gets booted right away for those folks you know\nSpecial sex dungeon door closed by button under the desk Matt Lauer guy was there for decades and\nWas the the the chosen one I mean the the\nFace of that network twenty million dollars plus a year I think it was actually make more like Fifteen when he was twenty five million a year they're paying ... unbelievable sum of money for a skinny balding we'd who was completely replaceable by about a hundred different people but Andy lack in these people at NBC make decisions like Matt Lauer\nIs that's all you have to do that like you you're good you know it's not about the ratings it's not about the audience really what the what the execs think in the\nIn the east sweet or the C suite the corporate suite east we should be the way it's called so Megan decided on a segment on Halloween and political correctness\nDecided to tackle the subject well that was the subject in and here's what she let's start with what she said that got her in trouble John Cleese place that clip\n[laughter]\nYou'll get in trouble if you are a white person at that time or black or white like\nA kid that was okay as long as you're trying to find that character in the country and there are places in New York with land as she got Diana Ross and she made her scandal darker than it really is I think the fact that that was way I\nCould have like an around her one day\nI I don't know how like that at rates are hollow\nSo she didn't say anything racist what she said was that\nShe doesn't think that people necessarily dressing in costume when they dark and their skin to be in costume should be considered racist now you could agree or disagree with her\nI Would note that a lot of you probably liked the movie Tropic Thunder I think it's a very funny movie I think the best part of the movie is\nUh what's his name Morton Downey junior right the guy plays Iron Man met his name William what's his name again you guys leave me out here to dry well what is the name John\nAnd Robert Robert and I'm more Robert Downey Jr and Robert Downey Jr more than ...\nYeah Robert Downey junior show so he uh you know\nHe ... he was in black face in that show I mean in that movie he was he was driven by his pretend to be a black man in blackface\nAnd they make fun of it during the movie and it works and everything's pretty much it's a funny movie you know there was no picketing there are no people freaking out about it at least not really\nAnd a movie did pretty well actually\nSo there are situations in which culturally black face has not been deemed to be a insulting and racist I I just named one now I also can understand why given the history of\nSlavery and segregation in this country in the way people used to dress in black face in in in ... [noise] excuse me in mockery ah\nThat that would be offensive to some people I I get that I'm not\nBut I'm just saying that she is not even really taking a definitive declared his position on all the she's just trying to have the conversation but because she veered away from black face under any circumstances is racist is wrong is terrible\nAny darkening of the skin is part of a costume is racist and wrong and terrible NBC just I mean they had different anchors coming after NBC just fed her to\nThe wolves on this one and then that led to this which I always find so depressing and and the whole thing is always so sad the Soviet style show trial forced apology\nI'm here is what she said in an effort obviously to keep her job one that was doomed to fail before she went on the air please play her apology\nShall I Megan Kelly and I want to begin with two words I'm Sorry\n[noise] we made her that yesterday we had a discussion here about political correctness at Halloween costumes and that conversation turned to whether it has ever okay for a person of one race to dress up as another a black person making their face later or a white person making errors darker can make a costume complete I defended the idea\nSaying as long as it as that was respectful and part of the Halloween costume it's pulled okay\nWell I was wrong and I am sorry\nOne of the great parts of sitting in his chair each day is getting to discuss different points of view and as I talk and sometimes I listen and yesterday I learned\nI learned that given the history of blackface being used an awful way by race it in this country it is not okay for that to be part of a costume Halloween or otherwise [noise]\n\nNow I could add older may get a call me up and I have a little bit of a soft spot\nFor her because she used to be nice you know started my career and having on her show and used to tell me that I was very talented and had a huge future\nAnd that I was amazing when I filled in for Rush Limbaugh and I was you know her favorite of all the Rush Limbaugh feelings and\nAnd you know so so I have a secret soft spot maybe not so secret anymore from and kill it I'm just going to be honest about that okay I Do even though I think that she turned over people and ... horrible decision by going to NBC and was on grateful for the position jihad at Fox and all the okay fine\nAnchor on television but he's definitely up there definitely close um and you know that ... this this chorus of people um and uh somebody regime when I was on a special report earlier tonight on Fox News which you can still go check out our mind if you want all I'll put the clip up on Facebook\nI reject I'm Sorry I reject out of hand\nThis this notion that there is\nEqual blame on both sides yeah there's blame on both sides but there is not equal blame on both sides of the political climate in this country are a Trump making fun of journalists who are the most pompous preening overpaid annoying people on the planet as far as I'm concerned\nFrom making fun of them is not tantamount to a fascist state\nMeanwhile people reporting we're supposed to be serious journalist reporting on the existence of a creeping fascism because of Trump's they are doing very real damage\nTo our ability to have any kind of political discussion in this country and they're\nObviously\nEnhancing the likelihood of there being ugly incidents with all the stuff that we're going on so I I just I refuse to play along the way that they want and say yeah you know what all sides of a problem here how one Trump even that this was something I Want to I Want to leave you with on this and\nThen we got to talk about Hillary in a moment here get ready for it it's coming how could Trump even comply with what they're saying here let's say Trump came out and said I won't use enemy of the people anymore for the media I won't say that any more\nDo you think that then they'd say oh okay that's reasonable yeah you know Trump toning down the rhetoric I guess he's not such a bad guy after all I you know I I guess\nI guess we've got to let it even though they would do that you know that's not what would happen that's not what they say\nThey would say oh that's not even a start to this oh he's so terrible\nThey just want to hate him\nThey don't really want him to change his behavior even if he did changes behavior wouldn't really matter to them\nWouldn't matter so I'm just note\nThat by the way you know one one little sudden I'll throw in there\nI've never really cooked bone and pork chop before and this\nWeekend I'm hoping to actually give it a try went to a butcher especially Bush or and got a couple of big thick bone in Port jobs I Want to make a little spice rubbed for them married them overnight tried to sue them my cast iron I miss talking to you all about my corner adventures it's been a while and I haven't\nHad the time to cook recently so this is the I'm going to try to bring this back because one of those things that when it's done right I just think so incredible is they shared\nA shared bone and pork chop is something special as you can tell I haven't eaten yet and I'm doing this radio\nShow and I am quite hungry\nSo that's what got me my mind my mind shifted a pork chop land because I'm starving and it's been a long day [noise] um\nBut we do have to talk about Hillary coming up your men roll call and then maybe I'll get this year in myself a\nPork chop so much more important stuff coming up so they wouldn't be the [noise]\n\nThe Fox News I'm Carmen Robert to make a political impact the definition of terrorism\nPolice say to package it found that the time Warner building today we're faults alarm federal investigators to believe some of the packages may have been mailed from Florida and they're not saying what did they believe the suspect recess banks are in Florida operating from Florida or all packages were mailed from the state\nNew York and Maryland are also linked OK success Katherine Harris urged the president sending eight hundred troops to the border\nTheir mission is clear to provide logistical support to the border patrol not combat power facts\nIs look at someone from the troops will head south within five days just a week before the midterm elections the caravan of migrants are shrinking in size but still moving north [laughter] [noise]\nClay action [noise]\nHe's holding the line for America bugs accent is back\nTeam what can I Do that will uh brighten up your day a little bit it's been a tough week for America right no question about it the market's been getting battered obviously we've got these ah bombs getting sent all over the country people are being nasty to each other there's moms everywhere and all that stuff right\nWhat can I Do that will just bring it all home and make us remember you know what\nIt's all going to be okay um well what if I told you that Chelsea Clinton's thinking about running for political office\nI see what I did there that's right I got you ready for one thing and then I pulled out another pack Joe ...\nShe is thinking about it which means she's got to do it she's gonna do it\nFolks she was talking to the journal news at a stop on the tour for her new children's book starting now you can make a difference just just try to you know she\nShe really needs more cash she lives in a ten million dollar apartment in New York or mom's worth a hundred million her husband is a hedge fund guy but you know what what whatever kind of cash grabs you can go and that's right having children's books ghost written for\nOh man oh man it's amazing she Chelsea said quote I think if someone were to step down or retire and I thought I could do a good job and it match my talents\nI'd have to think if it's the right choice for me she added she doesn't have any plans to run for office but it's something I think about as I Hope every young person thinks about first of all no I Do not want put put aside Chelsea Clinton for a second here why put aside or Chelsea and just know that not every person\nNot every person should be thinking about running for office at all okay there's there's a really very limited number of people that have the kind of a thick skin temperament\nSelf aggrandizing attitude and yes that feel called to serve but increasingly I think politicians are mostly megalomaniac um there there is an increasingly small number of people I think that really should do this and\nI think that everybody should\nI like this where I Want to talk about term limits I mean this is just this notion that we have the political class that we do and they just stay in power forever is because the system is set up to the people that determine what the system is stay in power but maybe the\nConversation about terminals will have to wait for another time I just think that the Chelsea Clinton but the notion that somebody would want to vote for this person who's never had a real job\nAre and who was sort of let's not forget according to even some leaked emails was thought a very poorly at the uh you know the foundation the bill and Hillary and Chelsea Clinton foundation where\nShe was supposed to be a a boss and a figurehead at the same time she was not well regarded there are people thought that she acted kind of like the ... boss's daughter which is what she was\nAnd I you know this is one problem are going to have on the right now and I want to get too deep into this but\nWe one thing that we have given up is for for quite a while we're not going to be able to complain about nepotism we're just not not with any not without being as hypocritical as the left is so I and I'm not saying that this is the end of the world I'm not saying it's a huge deal but just to understand that\nWhen they try to put forward Chelsea Clinton and they will there's cause the Clinton it's it's the Clinton named the Clinton brand is still so well known and by so many Democrats despite what they'll say about Hillary behind closed doors are they still think of the Clintons at the Kennedy ask dynasty they really do\nAnd Chelsea doesn't have any of the baggage of bill or Hillary baggage on baggage or just you know like to say ladies uh doesn't have any of that so they're going to trot her out\nAnd people like me will say she has no record of any accomplishment she's a brat she's never had a real job and and likes to go", "year": "2018", "show_name": "The Buck Sexton Show", "city": "Birmingham", "day": "26"}
