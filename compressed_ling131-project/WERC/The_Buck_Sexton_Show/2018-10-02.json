with Jim and you know it's kind of obvious you know with that or Medicare fraud with his buddies and you know we have enough a corruption\nLike to hear some ... some fair decent people in office that aren't just about grief\nWell I think the hardest thing about the politics today is any good person as scared off by what we've seen with\nWith a Brett Kavanaugh and how they've taken a good man and ripped him apart over a Beijing lists allegations from three and a half decades ago so why would anyone want even go through this is Lindsey Graham said doesn't make any sense\nShow me any teenager young college guys is very normal you know to be attracted to girls may be remiss construed the drinking playing around\nI mean more to more normal and say like you know rumors about windows and people like that are going on private aircraft and you know with children and things like that\nWhether it's true or not you know we'll probably never know\nWe will never know but let's just hope judge Kavanaugh gets a approved and then pass through to the Supreme Court thank you rich and New Jersey appreciate your quick check in in Memphis, Tennessee with Randy Randy welcome to the buck sex

the end of his career he made a lot of B movies including a one with Rosie Greer retired football player where Raymond lands head\nGot transplanted onto Roosevelt careers body and it's one of the cheesiest horror films you'll ever see\nIf you if you haven't seen it yet\nI'll look a premature burial but you look up I think it's called the thing with two heads and its Roosevelt Greer and Raymond land and ... also made a movie called the man with the X ray eyes which is another cheesy horror film so uh I think you would enjoy it [laughter]\nAs I was only on my list because I saw it as a child but I guess my real one is a\nFantastic good ones I mean I yeah it's one where they started to have a little more special facts involved in movies but I still go for the\nThe kind of raw naked fear that we saw in a night of the living dead but that's what makes it\nTough ah [laughter]\nOh good good well I appreciate you joining the conversation thanks for listening to a buck and and let's hold forth we've got the just what was it six weeks left before the midterms way of work to do we have to make sure everybody we know gets out and votes\nAre checking in I have time it gets to check in with John in Delaware has the thought about a scary movie and Chuck Schumer John welcome to the program\nAnd Mike welcome back to Delaware you always seem to be in Delaware when I'm listening to you like that\nWell I live in Delaware\nOh do ya okay great man okay cool anywhere near Dover where you at northern Delaware\nAh yeah yeah up in ah Newcastle county and I mentioned it earlier uh I enjoy time on the Delaware Bay when I can but yeah my wife and I lived in Delaware and the ... you live in lower slower Delaware where people have their brains and they're still conservative so I'm up in the blue\nPart of who can say\nThat but once you get down into the robots area it starts turning a little bit below again\nYeah it ... role but it's a little too close for people that don't know welcome to Delaware beach talk or the hope at Delaware a little too close to Maryland and it gets it suffers from some of that Maryland a liberalism\nYou got that right man well I wanted to say that that that my top scary movie of all time personally I Would have to go with the shining with Jack Nicholson\nYeah there's a lot at the shining is currently leading in all voting and it's a it's a great movie behind\nYou guys I just now started the show believe it or not I'm On the radio and and the box accident show just started about ... minutes to go around that\nOh cool well in our\nOwn you guys so I'm just now catching I thought the show just started ... and\nNow the first hour the shining was the leading vote getter despite my constant lobbying to have neither the living dead get the props that it deserves from fifty years of scaring the heck out of people but the shining is ethic\nIt is well the shining it's such a ... very well directed movie and uh my only complaint with the shiny\nWe thought that the Nicholson's character was weird from the very beginning and I think in order to have a real tragic character shift you have to like the guy first he was weird from\nYou did actually he came off a little bit scary or maybe a little bit psychologically stable and it's sad semi correct\nYeah yeah so ... here we are ... on a great political talk show we're analyzing scary movies but\nUh I'd asked John John what'd you want to say about Chuck Schumer 'cause I'm no fan of humor he was my senator for twenty plus years\nI just wanted to say that I have an absolute hatred for the guy and he's got a huge big out and he always said the Robin saw and they're wearing what he said today about uh the judge dairy said that he was a you know deeply deeply part is saying is there any ads\nThis cat or didn't notice judge from the carrots eight\nChuck Schumer is got a big mouth and if we don't get our little boat and we'd all you know get out there for the mid term that make things right\nAnd keep things the way they are if not better Schumer is going to be the big boss hog up there and we're going to have you here his mouth for the next God only knows how long I Can't stand it\nWell the only thing worse than Schumer would be Schumer and Pelosi so these are ...\nThat's another one like you hit the nail on the head\nThese are two very scary reality people and we have to make sure that you take someone to the polls because the Democrats are mobilizing in ways that you have no idea\nAnd despite the fact that the Kavanaugh hearings\nAnd the obvious uh the way this was organized to destroy this man in several this nomination it is disgusting I'll get into some of that I still didn't get to my network proclamation my my liberal network proclamation I Will get to it I promise plus I Want to hear from\nYou guys on your scariest movies are just around the corner and a little bit a doctor Gorka is joining us Sebastian Gorka will be joining us to talk about
