O. V. for more information [noise]\nI think that was a thug [laughter] or a or a big part of why are growing up I\nI think that was a very typical uh a gregarious a mischievous child as a as a young gotten the fights\nI a\nFrank that are\nConsumed or substances the word always wiggle my record six pack or an hour before uh before going back to class or things like that\nWhen Obama talked\nTo the media about his predilection for illegal drugs fighting in his own words there are a being a thug when he was younger\nIt was evidence of a kind of authenticity and I guess the charm now he oh yeah that's right Obama he was living living life on the wild side back in the day\nAnd he we also know that he admitted to doing cocaine which I Would say is in a different category for most people than alcohol or even marijuana right cocaine is that's a whole step above and no one had any issue with it in the media at least nobody somebody you might have been an issue with it but the media to have an issue with it\nAnd now we're supposed to be upset 'cause cabin I was drinking beer that's what this really about\nSocial behavior that involved a all kinds of illegal stuff that Obama did was held up as being cool by the way I I Know I'm just gonna say this\nIs just my my sense of it I got I got no evidence for back back in his up you know you could say maybe bucks credible when he said it's maybe not I don't believe they're bomb and got into fights I don't believe it I think he said it could be things that makes it sound cool I don't believe that Obama got into fights you can tell me I'm Crazy\nBut nope strikes me as a just I don't I don't see it I don't know and I never prove\nIt one way or the other but just when he said it is not really I don't think I don't think Obama's been at a fist\nFight in his whole life that would be my guest um but then again I'm just going based on what's credible folks I don't I don't have any evidence woman or the other just going based on what I think is credible here\nBut the double standard problem is a very big one whether we're talking about the Clintons and the sexual stuff that went on a ... with Bill Clinton whether we're talking about the way the media treated Bill Clinton's accusers versus the way the media treats lousy forty bloody borders sacrosanct why\nWhy can't we look into her past what she she's made herself a center of national attention she did not have to do this I I also have never her civic duty that was the justification for all that it was her civic duty\nReally who believes that she's an ideologue she's ... she's a left wing partisan\nAnd she thought she had a chance to take out a a game changing Supreme Court fifth vote that would have gone not even not conservative by the way I think Kavanaugh I mean don't get me started on this I think Kavanaugh is going to be much closer to Roberts and a lot of people realize Roberts is the one who saved Obamacare\nI don't think the cabinet 'cause I think happened I was going to have a kind of beat them judicial minimalist approach\nUnlike what the left goes for which is well I like this and so now my opportunity to make it the law of the land I don't think that that's what you can expect from Kavanaugh at all\nBut you know Obama's past shortcomings foibles illegal activity whatever that was all charming and grade and you know evidence that Obama was cool\nA Bill Clinton's sexual improprieties which by the way I Would say are in a whole different category of anything that Obama did I'm not trying to see I I can make these distinctions the left will say yeah capitals like Bill Cosby 'cause they're idiots\nOr you know what Obama did is probably pretty normal teenager and young adults stuff I'm not trying to say that he was I think on a fused overstating it if anything to sound cool\nAh what Bill Clinton did when he was a full grown adult in governor of Arkansas and then later president was disgusting and illegal and and horrific and the media covered forum for eight years\nReally you you look back to the way that the media dealt with Bill Clinton and the sex abuse and sex scandals surrounding him and it's what gave us the conservative media that we have\nYou could even argue that people like me even the careers that we have now and the outlets that we have in the alternative means of getting information out there exists the Drudge Report and talk radio and they exist the way they do because\nThe media sold at Seoul for Bill Clinton nineties [noise] so you know that this stuff is not distant memory is not and remember what people say oh the Clintons that was a long time ago well we're talking about Kavanaugh allegation that stretch back from thirty five years ago so I don't really want to hear the oh that was a long time ago thing now\nOh we've got more on this network of talking about the economy in Iran and what's going on with Iraq and a lot of other important topics coming up the next hour\nSo stay

I have the ...\nI was kind of\nI'm sounding a little more like George our banks instead of Hillary my my Hillary is getting a little rusty folks got into more Hillary impersonation um I did an area on impersonation out here at the confidence paddling plans you're doing yoga and stretching and everybody loved it so see already on a can appear anytime you needed to\nBut they're talking about all these different from tax schemes and here's the IRS what is so dirty about isn't it reminds me the sense of what they've done to Kavanaugh to all this has passed a statute of limitations so so they can say oh you know we we think that he's a tax cheat and a criminal which we know\nHarry Reid said about Mitt Romney not long ago as well\nAnd it was a total lie buddy centered on the floor of the Senate so he couldn't be sued forties he's legally free to say whatever he wants there\nAnd it was intended to just be a political black guy for Romney that Harry Reid gave him and that was all that was what was\nThe New York times says that Trump was engaged in these tax schemes that Trump was doing all this uh you know\nShady behind the scenes\nUm evading of what was due the government and I mean Fred drunk pure and from\nA Donald Trump as well they're saying this\nAnd we turn around and say well hold on a second this will never be adjudicated\nThis will never see the inside of a court so how do we do if they're telling the truth about this or not is is anyone really going to dive into the hundred thousand pages and also what is it a shady tax dealing really mean do they have them\nDead to writes on tax evasion no of course now they're saying that he you know did this and that and try to find all these different ways to avoid paying taxes really an avoidance of taxes is not criminal\nAvoidance of taxes is\nTaking advantage of the fact that the tax code is Seventy thousand plus pages it's a mess it's a disaster but liberals don't want to change it 'cause they like it and the government likes it and Republicans unfortunately in the Congress like it too because that's the single biggest ways that they can influence policy and engage in doling out favors to people which is the tax\nCode I mean you you make changes attacks they changed the whole country\nGot to pass legislation you need the other side for that people pay attention that can be harder changes in the tax code giving people carve outs and giveaways wise Seventy thousand pages because it's a way for the Congress to pick winners and losers and do favors for donors\nSo Trump\nTry celebrities is the way the lot of other folks do or he has in the past you I think it's good no I think we should have a flat tax\nAnd people's ... new book a fair tax whatever something like that it should be on a postcard that was one of the things that really did like about the cruise Canada see I Will say that he was very opposed the IRS and the way that it currently is constituted but it's based on Trump is just\nIt's boring it's long winded and there is not nearly as much there there is it like to think even though they've said they've gone through a hundred thousand pages\nMust be must be must get tiresome to be such a a relentless Trump hater after a while but at the New York times I guess this is just this is what\nPushes them on you know this is what gets them going they really just want to focus in on how terrible Trump is at all times however they can whenever they can and they never get tired of it you know it is also know the economy so now we're talking about next we'll get to some

somebody with a megaphone that's big enough that they can't ruin number shut them down or shout him down\nThey're losing power that's what this whole thing is about that's why they're so upset I think that's a great thing for the country I think people should be much more discerning an honest or rather discerning about where they get the information and expect\nGreater honesty in and the people giving it to them you know if CNN wants to say we are an arm of the DNC which they are and that's our that's what we do day in and day out just give you Democrat news\n[noise] ah I Would say okay this
