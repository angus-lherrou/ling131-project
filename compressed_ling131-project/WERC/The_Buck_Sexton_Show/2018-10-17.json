{"month": "10", "state": "AL", "station": "WERC", "content": "All right so does any mass of people that shows up at the border and I'll get to come in the United states why do we even have immigration laws why do we have a border patrol\nWhat is the purpose of all this\nIf lives are just going to grandstand every time and act like anyone who has any questions about just bringing a ... whoever wants to come in this country can say she ultimately here's the problem\nThat the leftist project the really the socialist or the Democrats socialist project in Western Europe and in America because there are Democrats socialist year as we know ... and others Elizabeth Warren but she's got other problems right now\nThe problem that the Democrat socialist project has to face is that they believe in open borders but they also believe in a welfare state a massive welfare state that doesn't work the Math Doesn't add up and also people\nAre willing to help the less fortunate from within their own community from within their polity right their political union\nThere is still a sense of nationhood of nationalism should I say\nWhere you want to you know I I Want to help Americans first if we're going to have a welfare state in this country it should be to help those who were Americans\nAll races grades and colors help them if they're down on their luck and we're going to have welfare state that should be but if if we have a policy of essentially anybody who shows up\nAnd has a ... a sob story about how their country has not I'm not talking to people that surely that are facing any imminent violence they just say oh the jobs here are better\nWell guess what if I show up in Switzerland and say hey that I like this place better it's cleaner it's more civilized I demand citizenship they're going to put my button on a plane and kick me out of the country never let me back and I was going to feel sorry for me\nThere is an order that country's try to maintain\nOther countries are allowed to have borders\nNot only that other countries are not expected to take in millions and millions and tens of millions\nOf people from a different culture who speak a different language and once they come to this country increasingly claimed that this country is not fair to them because we don't do enough for them\n\nI was under the impression that if you came to America you're supposed to feel grateful and legal immigrants by the way all of you listening Hi five thank you welcome to be part of the American family legal immigrants overwhelmingly do but I Do see a trend among illegal immigrants were they think that we owe them something\nWe owe them not just citizenship not just permanent residency but also all the goodies that the state can offer free health care free school free housing free everything\nEven America with are incredible economy and our economic dynamism and thank you Trump for showing us that growth\nGrowth under Obama for all the people are saying well I'm a ... show where growth federal bomb in his last year in office was like one point something\nPercent growth under Trump second year in office GDP over four percent single best measure we have of economic activity in what's going on in this country so who's the Gobi Obama corn and we will do the police\nYes there was a natural economic reset that occurred Obama made a slower and more painful and less powerful than it would have been had he not gotten in the way but he was\nIgnorant of economics I mean Obama is just not somebody who understands business not somebody who ever had to look at a balance sheet print in like the time not somebody who had to run a business of any time you know he was in the business of Obama different\n[noise]\nBut the facts facts cannot be allowed to get in a way of the left is there with all this stuff this group is going to come to the border\nAnd they are going to be in a position\nWhere we can either let them in or not and you know what the liberals are going to say let them\nIn\nAnd we're going to turn around and say hold on a second but it is their claims of asylum allow them entry into this country what we're really saying is that anyone can come and stay as long as they want anyone is allowed to show up in this country and we are effectively have an open border\nBecause all that all this required for someone who's to say the right things now the word is out now we know what the loopholes All right now the people in these communities that are coming into this country no that all these days I fear violence in my home country\nI fear violence I mean violence can happen at any one country there's a song it was supposed to be for people that are fleeing either a horrific natural disaster and by the way they're supposed to go back usually we give them temporary status for natural disasters\nBecause we're we're ... we're carrying country but we're not supposed to be Trump's not supposed to just be you know the the the fat cow to be milked by the rest of the world\nAnd that's what's happening the Democrats have no way of turning his back by the way they understand a they understand that quite honestly there is\nNo way that they can explain to the American people what it is that they really want if they told the truth to Americans would ever\nWould have a lot of folks would say oh what a second I don't think that's going to work I don't think you can just bring in endless amounts are foreigners\nNot through the legal process not go through the normal channels of assimilation that have been in this country for centuries now a joined this community that now liberals speak to specifically be illegal immigrants in this country the quote on documented joined the ranks of the aggrieved undocumented\nAnd try to get them access to the public treasuries fast as possible\nWe are Twenty one trillion dollars in debt I'll talk to you more about that later on the show bringing people without a high school level education and without English language skills by the millions is not actually\nMaking our economy stronger that is why it's an obvious lie if if Americans\nAre not\nBalancing the budget at the end of the year for the American people are actually paying as they go when it comes to government spending we really think that bringing a lot of foreigners who don't have skills who aren't going to remember I'm Talking about illegal foreigners\nThey're going to be the ones that set the economy right I don't think so I Know you know these two men is frustrating it is frustrating\nThat you're going to hear so much is going to turn into one big media sob story to oh who would drawing these people who would turn these people away\nHow could you so heartless you know Republicans with your your top hats and you're Monica is stepping over poor people in the way to work [noise] great\nOr we will talk about Elizabeth Warren [noise] Pocahontas so she is called by president that's coming

based on humanitarian concerns in other countries\nWhat do we do about China what why is it that now we're hearing oh we need to take this really strong line against Saudi Arabia because of what it did hear China's one child policy is more barbaric I Know they've changed it but the China has engaged in worse\nHumanitarian of repression than really any other country in the world except for North Korea\nAnd that's not something you're hearing much in the press right now because no serious person is really going to say\nOh yeah let's let's go after China on this issue and let's punish our own

if we can tell them whatever we want but but trying to force them to act in a certain way because that's all will be doing and we will lose a lot in the process and we probably won't even get what we want in the long run\nAnd here here's an example of what I mean\nYou have Google massive its own alphabet is the parent company of Google Now Google the massive company right Google's huge I mean

[laughter] oh they're great people just bad leadership bad later\nSo I I like everything when Lindsey Graham who say they're still the very end I don't uh I like he was\nHe didn't read it the way that it's out it I could say that I he just misspoke a you know he didn't mean that you just met her\nIran is a bad country Iran is not bad people in fact the Iranians I've had many Iranian friends throughout my life and\nAh it would be a great day to have the Iranian people in Iran able to have the same some of the same freedoms as the a wonderful Iranians that live in this country uh we've had a whole ... running chair anyway I Love\nThe other stuff he was saying about I was going to take a DNA test\nEvery Lindsey Graham is he's very much a very much a man struck by a kind of knew swagger that I think that he really\nUnderstands uh he he really understands that you've got to be willing to fight the other side you got to be willing to go to the mad I mean ... kind of mirrors my own feelings last few weeks where I've just said last few months\nYou know what as much as as much as I always want to leave the door open for the other side and I want I Want people on the left or listen to this show I Want you know honest good Democrats to listen to the show as much as they are willing to\nUh in terms of the of the ideas we can't just oppose them we got to crush the ideas I don't crush people I Want to crush ideas\nAnd that means sometimes yes as a kid say we might have to own the lives a little bit\nUh so Lindsey Graham I liked that he's been ... is that a little more swagger is I've been saying and I also\nThink that you know on on immigration and he has some interesting things to say I I I got to get him I got to get them a little more a hard line on this stuff folksy here's what he said liquidate\nTheir eleven million illegal immigrants here that came from burning the poor countries\nWhat do we do with them I Want to ... based immigration system you got to get Democrats and Republicans working together build a wall control who gets the job\nMore legal immigration moved to ... based immigration you can't ignore the eleven may and they'll never be a deal right where the Democratic party that does make a deal with the eleven may in her non felons who've been here for twenty and Thirty years once you get them in a good spot even have a new immigration system\nYou know\nI I don't think he gets it on this when you have folks I think that Lindsey\nHe's a little a little too squishy on the issue as I've been saying thank you Yale University ... nerds for backing me up on this it's not eleven million age twenty million it's twenty two zero at least\nI I don't know what we have to do to get people to understand this is nine eleven it is twenty million at a minimum\nWhich is a vast number of people\nFrom a a generally speaking from one country\nFrom Mexico I mean that the vast majority of them are from Mexico\nWhich also happens to be a neighbor of ours geographically where there was an enormous border and you know it it poses its own issues for political unity in this country really does I Know people are not allowed to national security analyst will tell you\nThat when you have a population that has\nA that has moved across the border that has fought wars over that Porter we don't often think about that but we fought a war with Mexico over that border\nThen you have a population that maintains a tremendous and ... and ...\nSo we you know powerful and continuing ties to the the what's considered the homeland of the mother country a ... you ever a recipe for stabilization you really do I mean politically minimum de stabilization\nAnd ... you know that's something that I think is a you know meet needs to be remembered here I I think Lindsey Graham was might look I\nGive you a lot of credit for the whole capital thing but as much as I'd like to just look at that and say it's all fine now they're going to get fooled and immigration again they're talking about doing this deal and the deal is going to be amnesty and then we'll see what happens for your security we'll see what happens with this request for a wall\nAnd that's not good enough that's not acceptable\nTo the lens he talked a little bit more about this deal that he thinks is going to happen play seven\nHouses have been and a half for the wall I mean excuse me five being in the Senate has been a half\nWill close the gap a duck I remember that the center Ninety thousand kids brought here on the average age of six no place else to go

that are I think I think\nYou could tell that to the republic GOP ... if it was for fun you get that five billion\nAnd it's just deferred action still are it's not a\nA but it you know it can't be it can be citizenship and it can't be permanent just okay well we're going to have a we're going to see how this goes it because you can't discuss what you're going to do with the eleven twenty million illegals in this country and Joe you have\nA reasonable assurance that you're not going to be dealing with another twenty million in ten years and if you by the way I understand that the political sway\nThat the Latino Democrat community in this country will have for even more a unrestricted immigration a project read from your from South of the border uh that will\nDo the entire debate and discussion going forward and all Democrats will see is that they will be importing masses of new voters\nWho will essentially make the Republican Party a in a way and after all they will they will be able to turn America into a one party state\nThat's the game the Democrats are flying the Republicans keep thinking about this like whoa you know maybe we can deal with some of the Democrats are

I'm keeping an open mind there's ... there's never been any proof offered that I'm aware of\nMeaning she's never been able to show text messages or emails running at you know that that that relates to the affair she just gave this description of him and you know there's another part of this and I'm just thinking through this\nHer whole description of Trump in her book it's like she wrote that description based on what she knew the media would want her to say which was just be really a ... and degrading and nasty\nToward toward the president so I'm you know I I had thought that the president this was before he was the president I thought that maybe he and I hadn't strayed from his Myrtle out here and I was willing to say look\nI care about what he's doing as president and the political movement he represents I'm not I'm not sitting around trying to judge all politicians by every every action in their lives\nUm bad especially because you know the only do that the only enforce that against Republicans they won't enforce it against Democrats\nBut there is also part of me the things well you know there's something else here it it just I I'm thinking about right I'm thinking about it I'm not totally sold one way or the other but now they they they're all focused on the present referring to a woman as horse face\nYou know I this is why I say Trump was winning and winning and winning this week and this feels a little bit like feeling a little bit like an unnecessary distraction and and not something that I Would really want the president to say button that said\nMaybe when you're when you're this when you're there's ... when you're in his position and you're fighting against everybody and and it's all an uphill battle or maybe they're just going to be these you know is it's not they're not all going to be a hits right they're not all going to be great\nSo ... that's a part of it too and maybe he's human which we all know he is maybe he's imperfect which we all know he is\nA and I think that we should be able to have that chalk\nAre among those of us who really support the president and his agenda which I clearly do and still be want to say okay I kinda wish you hadn't called some woman horse race on Twitter I just I think that that's\nYeah that's a little that's a little bit but we're we're a presence droopy that said he's been crushing everything else all week and been amazing so you know so he's not perfect he's pretty darned good though so you know I'll give it to him on that and that's I I think that's an okay standard to have for politicians you know it's not perfect who's pretty darn good\nI like Lindsey unleash you know he's doing this thing but another one who's in that category and and I take a much\nMuch softer drone on Jeff Flake too he he could have been ... himself to the ah MSNBC crowd but instead he did the right thing in the end he made a mistake he could've costs us the whole thing so I'm not saying he's not the same category as McConnell and John Graham for the or the special\nSpecial folks were this anyway I just wanted to say uh the deficit is the highest it's been in six years folks\nAnd I came into this business of conservative media right at the height of the Tea Party's power in this country and she party as a movement and I went to work for Glenn Beck and Glenn was very tied in with the Tea Party and you know I I saw this\nThis wave of a just a a restoration of concern or the restoration of concern for our financial future for just so many um so many things that all of a sudden we're at the top of the list right\nAnd and also restoration of the American founding as as a topic of conversation\nI I'm just saying we're we're not we have not done anything about this yet and we've had a Republican House Republican Congress I'm Sorry ...
