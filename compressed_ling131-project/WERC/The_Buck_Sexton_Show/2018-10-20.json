o'clock kick off on ESPN\nAuburn really needs a victory over Rome is in the worst kind a way\nThat they don't get this victory is looking more and more like the armor tigers could have a losing season this year they could go five and seven hey let's not even take it out of the realm of possibility they've got liberty on the schedule to liberty me Troy last week\nThat the game that isn't just winnable mark the check Mart right next to it on the schedule\nAlready got some tough roads to take down as they continue out throughout the rest of the season but it it starts with all missed tomorrow\nAnd I don't know what to tell the Auburn daggers I don't know what to do ... miles on gossip you're listening\nYou got to find some differences in that often so I Know you've tried to change things up you through a lot of passes ... you've done a lot of passing yards last few weeks because that run game just doesn't seem to get there\nA movie what lows that a good year so far but it's not been a great year the office of line has had an average year and the quarterback and wide receivers everyone touted\nHasn't meshed it has been jailed together the way that you would expect\nOr maybe it hasn't been coached up the way it needs to be coached up a lot of question marks about gun smells on a lot of question marks about the future the thirty three million dollar buyout that's on the table for ... mouths on if the Auburn boosters and y'all are an athletic department decided to go another way Auburn is it six place in the SEC west right now\nThe only team behind them as Arkansas\nThere were people that projected Auburn to be in the hunt against Alabama for the number one team in the west a lot of people thought\nThere's a possibility if they could get through Georgia they'd be eleven or know going into the iron bowl\nWe are far far cry from that went over and goes to Mississippi State loses twenty three nine they play Tennessee at home and lose thirty twenty four that's when the fan base starts rumbling yeah we know that God smells on has lost some games you should know lofty won some games you should do one\nBut in the end it was going to be okay but when you have to stray losses like that one of which comes to Tennessee and Jeremy Pruitt's first ever SEC victory on your home turf Auburn better hope they get a victory this weekend over Rome as if they don't\nHere's the rest of the way at home against Texas a and M. on November third on the road against George in November tense at home against liberty and on the road against the number one team in the country in the Alabama Crimson Tide\nThat is not going to be easy that's not going to be pretty none of those are going to be wins outside of potentially liberty and Texas a and M. if they fall apart\nThey should not be Georgia they should not beat Alabama not with what I've seen they've got talent they do but the way that talent has played together under the coaching that's they're they're not getting it done right now they need to get some uh ... confidence maybe is the word I'm looking for here\nOr or maybe it's just some steam behind the train something's gotta change Robert as they play all miss this week if they lose what's next do you go ahead and let ... stroke that thirty three million dollar check\nYou wait till the end of the year and ride this thing out and see what happens and say you know what if he wins the game he's not supposed to and go six and six maybe seven and five even that we can live with it for another year because of the massive number\n... ... what would you do if you were the athletic department what would you do if you were the boosters riding the checks if it's me and he falls illness\nIt's time to cut my losses and say thanks Gus but

I don't know what to do go ... miles I guess if you're listening\nOr you got to find some differences in that often so I Know you try to change things up you through a lot of patches ... you've done a lot of passing yards last few weeks because that run game just doesn't seem to get there\nA booby willows had a good year so far but it's not been a great year the office of line has had an average ear and the quarterback and wide receivers everyone touted\nHasn't ... together the way that you would expect\nOr maybe hasn't been coached up the way it needs to be coached up a lot of question marks about got smells aren't a lot of question marks about the future the thirty three million dollar buyout that's on the table Fergus mouths on if the ... department decided to go another way Auburn at six place in the SEC west right now\nThe only team behind them as Arkansas there were people that projected Auburn to be in the hunt against Alabama for the number one team in the west\nA lot of people thought there's a possibility if they could get through Georgia they'd be eleven or know going into the iron bowl we are far far cry\nAnd that went over and goes to Mississippi said loses twenty three nine they play tendency at home and lose thirty twenty four that's when the fan base starts rumbling yeah we know the gun smells on has lost some games you should know law the one some games he should the one\nBut in the end it was going to be okay but when you have to stray losses like that one of which comes to Tennessee and Jeremy Pruitt's first ever SEC victory on your home turf Auburn better hope they get a victory this week and never own as if they don't\nHere's the rest of the way at home against Texas A M on November third on the road against Georgia never pretense at home against liberty and on the road I guess the number one team in the country in the Alabama Crimson Tide\nThat is not going to be easy that's not going to be pretty none of those are going to be wins outside of potentially liberty and Texas A M if they fall apart\nThey should not be Georgia they should not beat Alabama not with what I've seen they've got talent they do but the way that talent has played together under the coaching that's they're they're not getting it done right now they need to get some ah Mm confidence maybe is the word that I'm looking for here\nOr maybe it's just some steam behind the train something's gotta change Robert as they play you'll miss this week if they lose what's next do you go ahead and let ... stroke that thirty three million dollar check\nYou wait till the end of the year and ride this thing out and see what happens and say you know what if he wins the game he's not supposed to and go six and six maybe seven and five even\nThat we can live with
