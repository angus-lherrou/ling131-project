heard somebody talk highly about a problem\nIs not the way presidents abnormally dealt with disasters chest that contrast between the voice of Jeb Bush\nAnd the voice of President Trump at the rally has to make you feel this cannot be enormously allowed us to be normal ... thing I sense of who we are as Americans I keep saying over and over again that Teddy Roosevelt said the wrath of democracy will founder if people in different regions different sections different races religions think of themselves as the other\nAnd that's what's happening now and we need leadership to bring that back together yes\nThere's a Doris Kearns Goodwin\nBird celebrated as the president or destroyed or something on the left\nTelling us about how about that they love to do that they love to put presidential historians on TV to talk about contemporary politics I always find them underwhelming to say the least and what they tell us about what's going on today\nIt's nice that a lot of them were usually with the research stuff to help them get put together an eight hundred page book that generally people don't read but I don't really need to hear their take on everything going on now because I've written a book about a president from you know Eighteen Seventy\nI don't really think that that makes them some kind of particular voice of of insider expertise on what's going on today but notice all the criticism there was was\nActually of the president's told it's the way that he speaks now I don't even mean the the content of the speech I mean he's the level of his speech and and the sound of his speech now that's the problem she saying Jeb Bush was ...\nYes Jeb is low energy this long since been established low energy jak\nTrump was giving a rally in Pennsylvania and you know when he talks about issues\nRelating to to Florida and he's obviously very concerned his commander cheaters big federal response but this is what I mean everything that Trump does Israel but when people say things

saying and everything that they're they're doing all the time\nOr it has so much to do with with from that\nThey just can't help so this is all part of the Trump delusion I mean he's the response or if you will get more of their sponsor a cane probably the next hour um but there's nothing that they can point you had in terms of Trump being asleep on the job or not you know doing the federal

it's\nIt's all about what we can convince people to do because it's it's really just a battle of rumors right it's just ... people say things there's no evidence there is no there's nothing to do is we can't we're not going to subpoena any evidence from these people\nIt was all meant to create a parallel process to the legal process that the less control\nNow impeachment is in fact a parallel process to the legal process that the left can control if they take the house and that's what they're gearing up for so whenever we tried to have the argument that Trump was not found\nGuilty when it comes to Russia collusion of anything they're going to say it doesn't matter this isn't a criminal trial Trump is guilty of malfeasance of high crimes and misdemeanors while in office of ... which is essentially whatever\nThe house of representatives decides he is guilty of\nNow they can't remove him from office\nBut the biggest feather in their cat they think going into the twenty twenty election is going to be that President Trump was impeached by the President Trump visited impeach president we have to remove him get rid of the corruption get rid of the uh you know the\nRacism and massage any and sexism and all that stuff that's going on because of Trump's they say and that's a way to the left to avoid the fact that they don't have compelling arguments on policy matters they can't meet us on the battlefield of ideas when it comes to policy so what they do is turn this into a battle\nOf reputational or a reputational fight\nOr somebody's you know the the perception of whether someone is racist or not or perception whether someone's a massage therapist or not and just oh he's if you don't vote for him he's icky which is really what they want to convince everybody about Trump all along\nBut there there's a development and his whole Russia thing today or this is what made me think of this\nThat a lawyer for Glenn Simpson this from the hill dot com I my own website where I work uh I don't want us in my own I obviously don't own a time employee cofounder of fusion GPS told the head of the house Judiciary Committee on Thursday\nThat his client will invoke his constitutional rights not to testify\n... define ... what does that get pi him take away is pie defying a GOP issued subpoenas seeking to compel him to get a closed door deposition\nThe lawyer Joshua leddy toll judiciary chairman Bob Goodlatte an electronic letter that Simpson will not participate in this committee's inquiry because it is not designed to discover the truth\n... quote consistent with the September twenty seven twenty anti letter we sent you Mr Sampson who's testimony as a matter of public record will not be participating in a confidential deposition before this committee\nSquirted lawyers for Simpson he'll be invoking his right not to testify and the first and fifth amendments of the constitution\nUh now I understand\nThat this is where people will say based on their politics well if you take the fifth you must be guilty that's not fair the fitness a procedural protection and there are times when I assure you there will be people that you and I are much more favorably disposed toward\nWho would take the fifth and we would say that's absolutely the right thing to do so it's not just that he's taking the fifth but it's that\nThere is such a clear pattern in general of people who are tied to the CIA people who were early on big advocates\nOf the whole Russia collusion theory with regard to Trump at the election\nWho want to make sure that that the information does not get out they don't want to testify they don't want subpoenas to be declassified they don't want the release of the ... information they don't want the full scope even of Mueller's probe\nTo become public well when that the situation I think you do have to ask yourself what the heck is going on here you never see a greater revelation amount of information\nFrom this investigation supported by the people that think that Trump is done terrible things\nIt's the people that think that Trump has been set up an ambush tearing smeared they're the ones they're the ones who want more information out there they're the ones who want us to be able to get the facts and get the truth\nSo I just wouldn't know that they are back in office right now because one I think that Muller\nKnows that you know to to put more kind of\nYou know Ricky ... indictments out there oh we're gonna talk some more Russian sock puppets you know they're never going to actually sit in a courtroom\nThat would look really to borrow word from before achy ready for the election so it won't be till after the election and we get more information but the the Democrats are a little bit of a of a little bit of a bind here\nBecause they don't want to over promise and and they don't want to make it seem like they're trying to throw this mid term based on all the work that they've already done against Trump\nOr I think it's too obvious for them you know so they're they're laying a little low on the Russia collusion stuff\nAnd ... the primary you know that the primary narrative against Trump is very much personal and I think they go more for the twenty Fifth Amendment lane here than anything else you know they're trying to set a Trump is just unfit for office instead of Trump is a potent puppet but\nI Will keep an eye on this and my colleagues at the hill who have been breaking a lot of these stories are they've got more coming up I really do hope and I'm I'm holding out hope\nThat Trump declassify those Pfizer documents on the investigation origin documents that that I think he should do before the election because in my opinion that could be a game changer [noise] if you've ever found\nYourself when thing at the weak sauce taste of coffee from one of those left leaning county corporate brands\nYou probably thought to yourself I wished they spent less time on meaningless

getting up in people's faces which is very aggressive which is really calling for what is borderline of salt\nYou know this is like a ... when people will do things on the street where they will follow you\nAnd get up in your face and they want you to sign something and then you know the moment that I Try to step around someone and then they try to step in front of me again that's not getting aggressive\nNow they're actually threatening my personal space right I mean you know the the line between I Want to be verbally aggressive and I'm actually showing aggression where you have to be in fear of your safety is much murkier\nThan a lot of Democrats want to pretend that is right now\nBut you even have the heroes of the world who won't won't call it out won't shouted down they won't say you know what it is we shouldn't do this they'll just say well you know people are angry this is what people are going to do is what they want to do so you know it it is what it is but that that really that is the attitude that you\nGet from them or ... you know where's the corollary so you don't have the corollary or the um the analogous position on the right when it comes politicians there is no right wing version of antifa there's no right wing version\nOf the Democrats who are saying get up and people's faces and follow them home there is no right wing version of lunatic protesters who show up wearing\n... on top of their heads and and screaming and shrieking at Senate committee hearings you know there's there's none of that\nWe don't do that\nAnd so I think it's important to take a moment for all of a say they're this isn't a both sides thing this mob mentality\nThe shrieking and threatening and crazy behavior this is a problem predominantly in overwhelmingly\nOf the left\nAnd it's going to be a problem for them at the polls unless they can lie to enough Americans and act like this isn't a problem so we won't let that happen folks we won't let them get away with

worth every penny of it I don't need that money and it's worth every penny because doing so much for the country\nYes it's it's nasty it's his it's incredible the false reporting is so incredible but honestly I'm doing a great job and that's why I have these crowds these crowds are showing up of I don't do a good job they have different is\nWhen they pick up to three thousand dollars more from taxes all of a sudden out of nowhere [laughter] they're getting ... thousand dollars that's a lot of money to people\nAnd I think that there are a lot of a lot of people who hate Trump as I've said many times\nBecause he is so far a successful president meaning that that they they hate him even more now that it is clear that he's actually up to the task I mean they they can say as much as they want about oh Trump the twenty Fifth Amendment we should get rid of him but they really despise this man because he's been\nAble to do such a strong job in the position now forget about don't say his tone is terrible he's a racist and oh my God you know bring up all this stuff\nThe country and how it functions right now is strong it's going well everything is moving in the I should say everything but in general there's a feeling of optimism about the nation are certainly optimism about the the economy but they they despise trumping I I also think\nThat when we start to value why is that we've had some of these\n... there was a couple of phenomena disease or related and and I'm just really thinking out loud on this one but it's something that's been on my mind for a while teams all share with you you have these these never Trump or types\nWho have some of them have gone straight up Democrat now I mean they have actually switch teams officially although a lot of them might as well which teams are that they can say they're not never Trump but for all intents and purposes they are\nA but why is it that they\nUm they hate this president so much and that there are so many people who come from\n... not exclusively government backgrounds\nBut I I think come from backgrounds were they've spent time in government and their of their system in of the establishment and they have this guy I really do think that they hate him because one she isn't supposed to be able to do this and I can tell you that there's a lot of people in the government\nWho really like to think that they have some magic powers of of thoughts and an organization and management\nOf that other people don't have a right to that once you become a government employee long enough because you become culturally acclimated from being within this bureaucracy to think that there's something that\nThat you know you have to be in government to understand government that that's that's essentially the the distillation of this point you have to be in government to understand that you know you have to have been in the beltway inside or or you've had to had to run for elected office time and time again essentially you got to be part of the professional\nPolitical class not necessarily a politician but part of the professional political class in order to be competed in these roles and it's just not true\nAnd I think that makes a lot of people who have power in this country a lot of people who are part of the elites and the establishment to feel uncomfortable because they've built their careers and their reputations on the notion that well you know I've you know the the the the Gergen effect\nOr work for for June presidents are ... advisory more words and ... you know ... or ... horse and buggy whip through it offers and\nYou know you get these guys who the whole their whole resume is this long stretch of government work\nAnd and different government jobs the idea of being well they must understand they must make better decisions they must know this stuff better than somebody like a Trump who just has existed in the private sector and the real world and hasn't made this cross over in India public's\nAnd I I don't think I'm over stadium when I say that there's a real resentment of this I Am when really aware of it now that I'm In the swamp in DC they really don't like that this president is able to do this because he's not supposed to be able to do this he he brings out Trump brings out\nAnd also it but this the insecurity of losers in a way that is very clarifying

Florida they're following up in Georgia\nSo the Trump Administration\nIs showing confidence and doing what the federal government can to help respond in a situation like this obviously it was a really nasty hurricane it was a two and then it came up with category for wins move really fast\nA but one interesting side of this and the first priority at first thought of everybody is getting help to those who need it and making sure that there's no or minimum loss of life for them to have been two lives lost so far but as we know it can often be the aftermath where much of the damage is done in terms of the human cost\nOf but hurricane Michael a hit and you're used to be this I guess you'd call it a gentleman's agreement\nA gentleman's agreement among politicians that are when something like this goes on you will you will see the political attack ad that was not the case here folks\nAh you had Ron disadvantages rival Andrew Gillum getting hit with some uh some ads you had a the the democratic superPAC that trying to help Bill Nelson and Florida take down his opponent governor Rick Rick Scott they called him a shady\nMillionaire and the ad by the way John I'd like to be a shady millionaire that sounds like fun you know\nBeing a millionaire would be great but a shady millionaire sounds like you're the kind of millionaire that has parties on a yacht and had a little too much fun so\nI think that sounds good to me but they're they're running these these attack ads um and and people are pointing out that that this is a different thing than what you you would usually expect remember running attack at the rain jacket in the state that is getting just battered while it was getting battered by this hurricane and they're running ads\nSpecifically on the opponents inability to respond to the hurricane\nSo usually you wait for a politicization of these things and then with hurricane response is fair game to criticize politicians for I'm not saying that but usually you wait for the politics of fly into into literally the storm has passed\nAnd in this case the uh the candidates are running these ads even while the while the storm was was overhead and people were trying to either bad down the hatches or or or wait until they can return to their homes by word of the footage of it is just the devastation I I Know that\nYou know the the news channels because it's there is such a visceral human reaction to seeing you know we all think what would it be like if I lost my home over to feel like if I had to flee a natural disaster like this and so when you see those images you're immediately drawn to it\nAnd I and I know that there's something of a of a news cliche here with\nAll the coverage going on of of a of a hurricane like this but there there was this political backs Georgia which which I think also\nA illuminates how tight these Florida races are people are going to look to the Florida governor's race a and between Gillum and ... and Scott and they're going to look to the Senate race 'em and they're going to try to extrapolate\nFrom that for the implications for the presidential race and twenty twenty you know the idea here being Gillum who is a a young African American guy mayor of Tallahassee very progressive very left wing I think would be really damaging the state of Florida with the policies that he's opposing and he's one of these guys who's\nYou know he if he's not outward I think he is for single payer outwardly so I I should probably but if he's not outwardly for single payer you might as well be a but you know they they certainly are drawing some comparisons between him and Brock Obama he's young he's telegenic he's African American\nUm and and that's what the progressive base wants to see in their new candidates they want to see\nYou know minority representation they want females they want a ... and specifically for those reasons you know conservatives ... we like having people from all backgrounds but we just like having the best people\nUh identity politics is is such a big factor on the left these days that they really get very excited about this stuff but the Florida races are going to be very very tight and and so tight that they're not wasting even a single day while they're getting slammed my category for hurricane\nTo take the ads or take the negative ads off the air so\nI think that gives you a sense of of where that all is and uh I I Do believe Scott is going to pull it out but\nYou guys gonna make are going to make a close very close\nOh I've I've got something by the way

I I haven't read yet how but I I Would guess they probably you know tortured him and beat him to death\nA brutal murderer and then just remembering his body putting his body parts into bags\nAnd disposing of them in fact one Mideast based paper although it's it's funded by the country so it's you know take it with a grain of salt one Mideast based paper claims they have a source telling them that the body parts of ...\nSo the anti Saudi journalist that's been murder that's missing has now turned into this global story his body parts may be buried in the residents of the consul general of a Saudi Arabia in Turkey so this guy's centuries of senior Saudi official may may have these body parts barriers backyard\nAnd this is crazy folks I this is if you read about this in a fiction novel you'd say come on\nThat so that so outrageous not only is this not if you know this is not the kind of guy you can disappear\nAnd I and I want to get into a little bit of well what does that tell us about the Saudi motivations are by the way the Saudis are saying what we'd expect which is of course you know they think that he left and they don't they don't they don't accept any responsibility for this nothing happened this is all crazy conspiracy theories\nCould assume all that um but and then that'll give it some of the complicating factors here but the Turks have\nPretty good intelligence and police forces and plenty of surveillance cameras and other ways of figure out what went on here and for the Saudis to do this on Turkish soil instead of trying to lure ... back to Saudi Arabia if he went to Saudi all bets are off we wouldn't you know he would have just disappeared and nobody would know\nSo they did this in Turkey a well keep in mind that a cause show he was a permanent resident of the U.S now he had gone into a a a self imposed a self imposed exile of sorts here in the states but that the Saudis would do this just show brazen\nAnd now you have all these different politicians you'll Lindsey Graham said there'll be hell to pay you know I like Lindsey now is you know hey I like Lindsey did the right thing and the Kavanaugh hearing I'm I've always been okay with Lindsey Graham but now I'm I'm pretty pro Lindsey\nBut people are saying is going to be held to pay a seems increasingly likely that the Saudis will just deny deny deny but the overwhelming weight of the evidence is that this was a a brutal\nBroad daylight you know ours assassination\nInside a diplomatic facility on another country's soil this is the kind of stuff that that you do cut off\nYou know relations with a foreign country for because they believe that this was most likely order and at the very top of the Saudi Government or at least there was consent for given at the very top levels of government props by NBS himself\nThis is crazy this does not happen and people will say oh by the Russians yeah the Russians have engaged in assassinations of critics and and but they they are tend to be ... former Russian nationals\nThey've done in the u._k.
