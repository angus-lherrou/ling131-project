[noise]\nThe greatest president my lifetime with the possible exception of Donald Trump will see how it how it goes we'll see how many years in office he has hopefully eight and we'll see what the full measure of his accomplishes look Reagan defeated Soviet Union and probably save the planet from annihilation so that that\nThe ... that's a tough one to that's a tough one to be that's a tough record to\nCompare against but Trump so far is doing a pretty remarkable job in his own way but I play that for you just because I I think that it is helpful for all of us in fact I I Would argue that it is necessary for all of us to remind each other those of us who are conservatives\nThat as our movements and our ideology our belief system our principles\nAre rooted in a respect for the individual individual rights human dignity human life liberty that's that\nIs the foundation of our of our belief system that we're all stars and so true anti Semitism and true racism and I say that with a qualifier true because we know the left calls everything anti Semitic calls everything racist I mean they're they use it as a political ...\nTrue anti Semitism and racism and uh\nAnd and and bigotry is not just non conservative eighties and cheap set a goal to conservatism\nBecause if we are not all God's creation in doubt by our creator with the nail in a bubble rights\nAnd if we're not all equal in the eyes of God and in the eyes of the law then there was no such thing really us conservatism edit conservatism as we know it in this country does not exist it it is not possible to be a conservative\nAnd believe that a white person or any any black person or a black person than a Hispanic person and a white person at that that they do not all have equal dignity equal rights equal worth as human beings\nAnd as citizens of this great nation so\nWhen the last try so hard to create\nThis perception that people who are conservative I I Can't speak to the right means the right\nIt would mean meaning all of it I was at its peak the write in general terms but you know there are some fringe elements of the right that you that that day 'cause of themselves and the right and you'd say well hold on a second in what meaningful way are they conservative though\nYou know this is where you start to really get into what is right wing and left wing even mean\nYou know if you are more in favor of individual rights if you were about the individual instead of the collective I left in this country is all about the collective and there are about collective guilt collective identity collective economics they are collective is\nThey believe in groups they believe in\nThe common good as defined by a core of elites that all speak in the language of equality in commonality but leave as elites in separate from the masses but use the envy and antagonism of the masses in order to\nBeat the other side politically which would be us we are the individual is we are the individual rights we're all God's creation and we're all\nHuman beings in this struggle together and should help each other\nAnd respect each other at each other's rights and dignity and life and that has an obligation on all of us um when when they try to make this case that racism and anti Semitism and these different ... and bigotry exist on the right I just I\nHave a a real feeling of uh of outrage at that\nBecause it's show on true and so unfair and I think that the reason they push it so it's not just because it works it's dirty politics but it is useful for them\nOr it is a shame that so many of the\nClasses that the Democrats view as victims whether it's just the working poor or African Americans or a or Hispanics Latinos women whatever the group maybe it's a shame that so many of them have been propagandize to such that they they really believe that I Know this from talking to them\nThey really believe that conservatives are racist they believe that\nAnd you and I said you knowing that that is a lie it's not true we're not racist in fact we're the ones that are always advocating for people of all races to be treated equally under the law is the left that advocates for disparate treatment\nIn the eyes of the law based upon race based upon skin color based upon not even real but perceived gender they're the ones that want\nThese differentiation and then they turn around and say that we're the ones who are obsessed with with race and gender and these other differences among among human beings\nAre when at the end of the day I I think it couldn't be any more clear that our side the side of conservatives unconstitutional is are the ones that advocate for individual rights and the dignity of all people and\nThere has always been this effort to rewrite the histories of the ... the two party this is why Democrats you get so\nHere I said triggered when it has brought up that they are the Democrats are the part or a party of slavery segregation Jim Crow just go down the list it was it was historically always the Democrats Democrats\nHave been and are the party of the mob mob mentality the mob feeling how does the mass feel how does the masses view an issue what did they demand what did they show what where's their rage directed that has been the aid that has been at the core of the Democratic party there's always been\nAn intellectual straining conservatism that has been first and foremost about the American founding the constitution\nAnd the rights of each and every individual and the natural\nLaw that underpins all of this that it's not really just about what the founding fathers status at the founding fathers were able to harness a sense of what is a universal and eternal truths about human beings what is always true about people what is always good for society\nTo promote and what does always necessary for society to try and prevent to condemn\nThose universal truths are at the heart of conservatism\nAnd so it's just [noise] it is the ... opposite [noise] of a true conservative [noise] to believe that a person is less than because it's going to call it the person is less than because of gender [noise] less than because of religious [noise] that is not who we are [noise]\nAnd I know that you know that and I know that that I Do think\nThat is worth sometimes taking a step back and just\nVerbalize exactly why that is the

I guess I Do know but it frustrates me that the left just dismiss this out of hand we really do just want to save lives\nYeah that's where it gets dismissed for civil or is it just because it's the truth it's just like the left most dismiss off things that are the truth it is a simple\nObvious solution that would obviously solve the problem and therefore the left is forced to hate it because they have to live in a world of make believe we have armed guards\nEverywhere we truly care about everywhere you truly want to protect the place that the target or potential target as an armed guard side of it or ... that\nCold security that's the norm that's the real world but even bringing up an actual solution is just going to get your reactions a horror from the left who they think the only solution to disarming every law abiding citizen\nI just can't imagine the circumstances where I'm In a place that\nGenerally speaking a lot of people do not you know you're you're you're not expecting a sterile it depends where you are right I I don't know what it was like in this Pittsburgh synagogue I'm guessing probably none of the you know none of the parishioners are ever arms or you know I don't know another congregants I shouldn't say river arm\nUh but I Know there are some churches in the south where I was people are All right I mean it it depends on where you are\nBut the the idea that this is automatically a bad idea I think it just goes to show how ideological out of the reaction to this is because if I'm sitting there and I see somebody who's got a side arm\nAnd that's that's either a law abiding gun owners showing their side arm war is trained security or or be perhaps off duty law enforcement the last often ever goes through my mind is oh well I'm less safe now Jesse I mean there seems very basic\nWell it seems basic few bucks because you are CIA and you have comments that you you acknowledge the way the world really is\nBut I I one thing I have come to grips with is how frightening guns of anytime dar for those who have never experienced it never held them never shot one never been taught the basic safety about them it really is a terrifying thing for people who don't know they look at it\nAnd honestly it sounds crazy they see the thing is just going to start shooting\nAnd ...

I you know I've been saying all along and you could tell her that\nShe knows she's not supposed to let that out right now she knows she's supposed to hold back a little more it's not supposed to go there and not supposed to be you know obviously pushing for her own future and the White House at this stage of the game\nBecause she comes from a damaged political brand\nOut but you can't help herself Hillary Clinton\nAs I have said has a hole in her soul the only thing that will fill it in her mind is the ultimate power of the presidency\nAnd there's nothing else that you could ever have or could ever do that would make what she has been through because I'm sure she views yourself as a kind of victim and a and I'm a martyr for the left wing progressive causes politically speaking you know she stood beside bill she allowed\nSo many people to uh bash are all these years I mean I'm saying this is in her\nIn her mind the only thing that is just the only way that justice is done is if she becomes president United States and I I've been saying it and I just want to make sure that I'm very clear very on the record here\nWhat happens is that the Democrats if they take the house marchers right into fights over impeachment that becomes\nThe whole discussion we're just going to be fighting over impeachment really for the next Eighteen months\nAnd then the narrative is that the only way to set right what they could not get because they will not have two thirds of the Senate so they can't remove Hillary but the only way to set it right would be to make Hillary president finally to break\nThat leg and finally\nPut her in a position where she gets to be the president of the United states\nI'm I'm not the only one who's banking is Hillary yourself you could tell it's like well I mean\nI'm not saying I'm running I'm just saying that I really want the jobs bill and nobody is more qualified\nThan I Am I mean this is this is the kind of stuff you say when you want something that you know you're not supposed\nTo walk and or at least you're not supposed to say you want it\nBut that's where we are with us she she has not given up one bit she still thinks\nThat this is the way that it's all going to go and and what a what a a a a crazy story and her mind has got to be for running against Brock Obama losing run against Trump and losing\nAnd in the end though in her mind justice prevails and she sets right the world and you could tell that she said oh you know there's so much work to do and her\n... her mind set her attitude is alright America you know I'm the one that's got to fix fix the mess that\nThat Trump created and oh by the way you own this to me you owe me the presidency that hasn't changed one bit and she is very much still in that mindset so I Know it's a little early but\nKeep in mind that next year or this coming Tuesday went out yeah next Tuesday is next Tuesday the midterms will be over and the presidential election will begin a next Tuesday is when we start to talk about who's really going to run the Democrats are I think about what you're going to have a huge deal the candidates on the\nDemocratic side I think you're going to have a a massive field of all kinds of people including some real characters I'm not totally convinced that I have a nod he still thinks that or doesn't still think that he's going to Ron I'm I'm not convinced\nAs crazy as that may really be to anybody who's living in the real world I Would not be surprised if you did in fact have an ... candidates see I I could see I could see that happening and I think that\nYou look at some of the others out there Elizabeth Warren probably still going to run again focus conscious herself still going to run because she thinks that in the Arab Trump\nAll that matters is that you deliver for your side and no matter how humiliating her whole fake Native American or deal may have been she thinks that she can still deliver\nA socialism for America that's that is what the fights going to be make no mistake about it this is going to be about this election will be about socialism the last election was about the crony corrupt\n... Clinton's that was quite alliteration but you know what I mean the last election was about the progressive media elite establishment finally getting getting the upper cut that is so deserved after all these years\nAnd the next election is going to be socialism\nNo doubt in my mind it's going to be open forget about the kind of Bernie Sanders cuddly I just want free school stuff is going to be open a Seventy percent tax rate kind of redistribute the wealth reparations for all kinds of historical wrongs a massive\nGovernment intervention the healthcare markets open borders so that you can dilute whatever pain the productive citizens feel by just drowning out their votes with with new arrivals are that's going to be with the next elections all about a and what's with that in mind by the way that I think of some of these\nSome of these never Trump ... are just getting crazier and crazier you know that they've gone from Russia collusion and now they have to find something else to justify their their hatred and I mean Max Boot I feel weird even talking about him because he's such a weirdo and show in significant\nIn terms of his influence and his thinking in the in the conservative movement in fact the only influence you have to get us into wars that we're a at least in one case very bad idea [noise] um but you know he'll just slander Trump with stuff ...\nFox News on that crowd Breitbart and infowars and the Daily Caller Republican congressman there been vilified George Soros for years and basically because George Soros is a rich through and so when they talk about Soros they're talking about\nA rich Jew who is in control of everything for when they talk about global us which is a trend that first right when ... when Trump says global as right wing extremists fear germs this is the Republican dog whistling which has gone soft and you're right it's not just ... a lot of Republicans it's a lot of folks have Fox News they really everything that he's saying is the only issue in their\nLives near by the way everything people don't refer to anti Semitism when there's criticism of Sheldon Adelson who is a very wealthy Jewish Republican donor that's apparently not anti Semitic this notion that global is some kind of dog was a global as is a term it's been used in international relations\nAre for decades and has nothing to do with someone being Jewish ... Jimmy Carter was a global is I mean there there are lots of people that you could look at an refer to historically that work for you then as globalism nothing to do with Judaism or certainly with anti Semitism um but booth\nRealizes that if you're going to go to the other team it's not enough to just say I don't like Trump you have to say I despise Trump I hate Trump I'll do anything I'll say anything I Will bend the knee and beg forgiveness from a left and be a turn coat and slander all my former friends and allies I don't know how these people sleep at night\nI Can't imagine turning on all the people that I respect and work with a known now and and ideologically in line with\nAnd later just turn around because it was convenient for me and\nCall them ...

not an easy thing to be number one it\nAnd the drama they bring to the table I mean they did that ain't I mean imagine if you look so miserable they've noticed that when they're on air how happy they look yeah well you know generally like to go through life bucking sorry\nGenerally being double home Rutgers is a bad start to things I'm just\nPutting there you go there you go just putting that out I Know I Know I Try not to go to personal but you know that's not good that's not a good thing that I'm not a\nWhat's the word bad karma karma was\nSpeaking of um I have no good transition here but you know she because I was like wait NBC CBS they're both networks other than that and they're both full lives but CBS had this uh this segment about\nHate speech and taking down hate speech and\nThis has been one of the issues that as you know I've been talking about for a long time here where we you know you you have this chorus particularly on the left of oh you've got to get rid of certain kinds of speech on\nLine um and and you're not doing a good job of it and then we find oh wow you mean it's going to be abused and that they're just going to use this to shut down conservative statutes shock\nNo one out but that's what ends up that's what ends up happening a time and again and so they they they can't get the true anti Semite soft line that can't get ISIS and these other groups\nAre to be taken out of their their\nThe cyberspace but they would they can do is is all of a sudden have second I'm pro Second Amendment groups that find their Twitter accounts or their Facebook accounts the activated but here's part of this a discussion and I have a slightly different view of this in terms of what the actions of these platforms should be ...\nYou can be radical online\nOnline has already been supported by our government that we believe that after nine eleven when people had access to ISIS supporters and those who are trying to radicalize yet isolated individual as we know now that Facebook Twitter and YouTube all had agreed with that have worked with the government can take a lot of these videos down\nWhy not when it comes to right or left wing extremists on line\nWell for one is very hard it's hard to identify what is extremism it's hard to identify what exactly is hate speech words are very complicated and different context in a particular case of powers\nYeah it's very easy to identify what he was doing he should have been found that should have been taken down but as a general principle it's very difficult to identify what\nIt means what is not hate speech and to set foreign policy it's not that\nIt's difficult and we know that if we give them any leeway on this issue it will invariably be used to the detriment of conservatives it it will be a situation where conservatives\nAre the ones who find themselves the rules will certainly be much more strictly enforced against the right if they are enforced against the left at all and ... and here's you know a very good example of exactly what I'm Talking about is the fact that Louis Farrakhan\nStill has lots of social media are still is able to spew his hatred and tolerance and this is also why I just find\nSo much of the media's effort over the weekend to try and create this narrative of right wing extremism is responsible for all or almost all of the anti Semitism in this country when that's just not the case not the case at all and you\nKnow here are the kinds of things that Farrah Khan who\nYou know gets deposed in photos with rock Obama when he's running for the presidency remember that oh that's right journalist hid that in the public because they didn't want us to see what was really going on there\nAre but Farrah Khan is still treated as somebody by the media who should have and does have a voice he's not the platform he's not pushed off of all the different social media outlets but here's the kind of stuff that minister Farrakhan says play fourteen and one\nWhere you recognize say\nAnd one where you see the panic zoo\nAnd the synagogue of Satan which has many races in it [noise]\n'cause they and then the the the whole world\nThink about what they're going to say\nWhen they have been so\nAnd come clean\nOn mass\nWhenever you read that God\nHas told the Jews to here and ...\nAnd they said I hear and I did they\nDisobeying God\nPretty gross pretty clearly anti Semitic the St panic Jew Farrah Khan says and he's still somebody that prominent Democrats\nCan hang out with in public can can speak with whether it's commentators were politicians are you'll notice that you don't have Democrat\nPresidential contenders asked the way that the way that Republicans were asked about David Duke loser that nobody cares about nobody gives a
