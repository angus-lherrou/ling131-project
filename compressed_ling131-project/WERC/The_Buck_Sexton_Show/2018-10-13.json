{"month": "10", "state": "AL", "station": "WERC", "content": "Analysis with with no degree in psychiatry never meeting Tanya but just watching this on the news you got a lot of analysts talking about this one to the White House feel like this was a pretty big success all things considered\nSo the White House staffers I mean the ones who are most concerned with policy or all obviously a bit annoyed by it because they they're saying you know why the president and detracting away from his great we with Brett Kavanaugh but the ones who are a bit more culturally attuned know that you know more Americans saw that clip with Kanye eight and anything else\nAt the end of the day you know if you were to go around and\nAt at somebody like universal studios like they used to do to you I'm On ... on late night shows and be like who's Brett Kavanaugh most people are not going to be able to tell you but I can guarantee you people saw that clip with Kanye West so from the president perspective\nIs using the star power of ... in order to talk about you know talk about criminal justice reform it really was kind of a\nI have a hilarious moment in the oval office although ... it was funny to be behind the scenes I was in the at the White House while all that was occurring and I saw that the pool they select group of reporters that day come out from the oval office and they were just I mean they were blown away you could see it on their face and they were just\nSaying this was wild and one of the camera guy told me that in the thirty years' that he's covering the White House Thirty Years' day to day it never seen anything like it\nI can believe that [laughter]\nThat's probably I think that's probably as a safe bet or what are we expecting tonight at Trump's out in Ohio I mean he's he's kind of the secret weapon on the campaign trail for the GOP hadn't into the midterms isn't it\nYeah I mean ... the the amount of coverage scrutiny that his rallies get it's just an automatic boon to any candidate who is running because people have actually told me that for other campaign that one of the things they love about when the president comes and you get national TV coverage you know when does and that last time that\nA you know some house candidate in Ohio six\nIs going to be getting in a ... major Fox News viewership and and the president directly plugging him that helps with their donations it helps with their brand awareness it's free media it's one of those things that the president\nOr the president loves doing relatively using the bully pulpit\nTo push candidate in terms of what he's going to say I have a pretty good idea\nYou know he he's been having your saying campaign rally now for basically the last two weeks almost every single night he's got one tonight he's got one tomorrow night he's had one I think five nights prior and it it just it's a it's an hour long its rockets he talks about the flag he talks about\nHis record North Korea he loves to bring people inside the room and it just it's a very high energy environment\nYeah I've certainly picked up that there is no low energy Jeb vibe at the Trump rallies of that is that is absolutely the case of what what are we what are we expecting by the way on on the policies on for for next week is there anything that that that you think is going to get up on the radar either from the White House side or do do we know they're really going to\n... or ... rather some of those documents Trump talked about that if anything we should be prepared for this coming week\nYou know I I I don't think that there's much that we should look for just because lawmakers are all out on the campaign trail they were desperate\nThat last ... last night to push through those judicial nomination so the Senate could go home everybody's focused on re election that being said uh you know in terms of on reduction that's something I you know I've been asking a lot of questions about at the White House\nUs resident about that right I mean you ask them about the reactions the oval\nYeah absolutely I I ... a week before you did I think and and and I you know that's something that we've both been interested in but the issue is that he had he had kicked the issue over to the inspector general and I asked their standards about that in the last press breathing that we had and she refused to commit to a timeline of before the mid term so\nFor now I don't think we're going to be seeing anything in terms of those on redacted documents and I really don't expect you know knowing the inspector general horror with he he is very uh very cognizant of of dropping things and politically sensitive times and he does take quite a long time in order to do these reviews so it's probably not coming anytime soon\nWhat's the best part of being a White House correspond to be in the White House all those are\nThe best part is just being able to see I mean it can be they're up front to to get yelled at by it rock like we were yesterday or somebody said one of our what our colleague where we were just standing there I mean you're you're standing there waiting for these people to come in and you shot questions at a\nAnd a ... somebody ... Mr Iraq which I thought it was why they called him Mr rock and he said Mitchell rock are you going to fire or do you think Trump should fire Jeff Sessions he said he should fire all view before [laughter] [laughter]\nThat's amazing so by the way you know usually as as a as a New Yorker and as a journalist I feel like you've always got to take the um\nYou know act like you've been there before attitudes all things so I I Would very rarely be like oh here's a here's a person of of prominence let me take a selfie with him I Would judge no one for going up the kid rock and beyond that 'cause I have a selfie 'cause this kid right [laughter]\nYeah exactly it it's it's like that's it day to day stuff it's you know oh if Jim Brown is here kid rock is here uh you know Tom Brady Rob Gronkowski or you get to meet people and talk to people that you you'd never your wildest dreams\nWould be able to do and then at the other on the other hand you also get to talk to the president the United states and you get to ask him questions on the most consequential issues of the day so\nIt will be the most fun president in our history to get to have a conversation with I mean I Know you were in the oval recently I was the over ... recently it's a it's like the Trump show you really don't interview them so much as you try to guide this this one man phenomenon as he is speaking\n[laughter] yeah it really is a force of nature and and it's like you said you you you you you'll throw something out there and he'll latch onto it and then he'll he'll flip it around three hundred and sixty degrees and then go another one eighty and another direction and you you try and flipping Ninety two a little bit of where you want to go and you just see what a gift\nAnd that that really is exactly how you say it it's it's\nWe we love to tell you know and the press it it's just one of those things where you can always get an honest answer out of ... it's it's hilarious I think yesterday or two days ago somebody asked him\nAnd said have you talk to the Saudis about you know this current situation with this this missing journalist probably murder journalists and he just said I don't want to say that yes [laughter]\nWell\nYou know who did you talk to you that I don't want to say but at a very very high level and he just started going into all of the discussion there is the vote you know what you see on TV is absolutely what you get in person\nThe other ones that give me one favor soccer can you spread the word over at the Daily Caller where you are the White House correspondents that bucks accent as an open challenge to anyone on your ping pong table there can only be one and I think I Will come out of the octagon the Victor\nOkay yell spread that where it's definitely not going to be be terrible but I oh okay I have a few ... that we could put up against you you\nYou tell your Daily Caller ping pong champions that that the ping pong champion up the hill dot com wants to peace or are you spread the word\nCrap All right All right I meant saga good work as always have a great weekend we'll talk to you soon\nThanks for having me buck\nJak outsiders latest Daily Caller dot com team could break we'll be right back\nI have seen one of the things that make the show so special is the exchange of information\nThat we have day in and day out I get to talk to you use email you call in right to me\nAnd that means that we're constantly learning from each other and we're also able to share or conservative values and spread all kinds of ideas but you don't want to be locked out from social media sites for doing just that if you want to social media sites that doesn't have any of the left\nWing biased none of those quote conversational health moderators none of that stuff Snoopy dot com is for you\nI was a totally new totally free social media platform it allows you to connect with other people post whatever you want and it's a place where you can enjoy the freedom of expression without suppression from administrators it's a place where discussion is valued at a place where your opinion matters\nSniffy dot com rejoined for all set up your account today as an I.

discussion in this country but has to say that either he's he's crazy which strikes me as a a really underhanded a nasty way of of well undermining his argument\nBut then when you when you listen to some of these kinds of you said it's not that he's crazy it's that\nYou could maybe say he's crazy like a Fox I mean it's it's that he actually hit home with some of the things that he was saying when the when I went back and and read the transcript today and spend a little more time listening to some of the soundbites and when you take away all the\nYou know the the sort of flashing lights pomp

less crime for the in depth analysis through all the numbers on that\nOr give put plugs to people that are friends with the show but the\nFact that he said this upsets oh many liberals they hate\nWhen anyone breaks ranks on the issue of guns because guns are such a a simplistic issue for stupid left wing Hollywood social justice warriors to feel like they're really brave and strong on\nAnd they live in this complete echo chamber of everybody knows that guns are so bad everybody wants to get rid of guns because guns kill people and they won't engage anywhere beyond\nThat I mean I I tried to
