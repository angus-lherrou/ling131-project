not a lot out there as far as hard evidence yet\nWhat do you make it on that bill\nWell yeah the citizens for responsibility and ethics are the ones that requested this investigation and the timing of it is what is what the brunt of all this about this was done on Monday and then she resigned yesterday what this is all about\nIs she is she being cabin odd again is that is that what we're seeing here well\nNo these are actually true these are not the allegations that are on true if you did accept a flights from three North Carolina businessmen on private aircraft\nThey were friends of hers
