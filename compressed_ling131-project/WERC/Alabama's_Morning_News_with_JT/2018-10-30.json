thousand troops to that the U.S Mexico border getting ready for the invasion and he said look many gang members some very bad people\nAnd they would not be allowed to enter the United states unless they went through the legal process this is the invasion of our country and our military is waiting for you put in a tweet yesterday joining us now builds NPR correspondent following this when so\nThey're going but uh there's some restrictions with our military as well which I just don't get\nYeah they will be there and a support role JT but it's still a very strong message the president is sending to immigrants who might be thinking about coming across the illegally it's not like you're just going to be able to jump the jumped the fence and uh and be able to come into the United states\nOver five thousand troops beginning to arrive as we speak in staging areas down south\nAnd they then we'll be redeployed do areas are deemed to be most important along that border but it's not like we're going to be stationed along the border with rifles trained immigrants coming north\nOr they are they're basically to assess the border patrol and there will be a ... there will be aircraft as well helicopters fixed wing aircraft with night surveillance equipment to help out the border patrol just to make it much more efficient and make sure that illegal crossings do not happen the president\nBasically telling these people look if you want to continue to try to come to the United states you can you're going to be in a tent city along the border it may take months for you to go through the asylum process and it's going to be a much more strict asylum process that you will have to go through\nAnd having said that you know they already\nAre we're seeing this caravan decrease

that I just wanted to get out here for a better life\nOr you're going to hear this term a lot operation faithful patriot is what this thing up being called\nAnd um as you mentioned bill uh the fact that these border patrol agents are doing their job and we're just there to assist by putting up wiring assisting with people that might need medical care and not really going as law enforcement still Scott me scratching my head if we're sending troops ... get out of control\nThey turn these joke books and let them act like law enforcement they're there to protect our borders period this is an

Israel Israeli ... Israeli people I mean it was\nHorrible President Trump has been more Israel friendly than any president in recent history and to call them re is anti Semitic just laughable because his son in law and

Alabama's morning News I'm Jay tune joining us now ... who is just an incredible a greater producer and host of a big hit podcast called lore uh this is pretty awesome here are arrogant morning bin ... how are ya\nI'm fantastic and I wanted to talk to you about your project you've done a bunch of them too and you're also the executive producer of the law or TV show on Amazon and uh you know this is from a producer Walking Dead and you you are really\nA quite the creative guy in quite the uh I I guess you would say successful guy in this genre here and you've got the Salem witch trial a pod cast going right now tell us all about this and what's going on\n[noise] well you know there are moments in our history um ... it whether it's global history or history our country that people think they understand you know they they think they can wrap it up in one or two sentences and and put a bow on it and that they understand it and what we realized is that there are these\nEvents that just made the exploration and when you do that you you realize that there's a lot more to the story so instead of wrapping sale Michelle's the up and and two sentences are going to spend twelve or you know thirty five to forty five minute episode just digging deep into a chapter by chapter\nYou know a lot of people said you know when they saw this about the the Salem witch trials going on in this was a Kavanaugh story but not that I'm just getting a so the Salem witch trials ah reality it did take place and there is obviously been books in the movies about this so\nHow does the pod cast a differ or does it and which directions do you go with war and also cabinet of curiosities both or or the or the delving into the Salem witch trials\nYeah you know I mean lord is ... well that it's more than ... style every episode you different topic and chat with the scared it's twelve episodes on the same topic but the the idea is to stay in that that\nTell the story and to provide as much of the historical context as we can you know and so for example we tend to think of the Salem witch trial just happening in Salem but it actually took place in a lot of communities around there they just get a lot of the trial there in Salem um people were feeling afraid threatened by events going on in the world you know there were\nThere were wars with the Native Americans in the French further up north into the middle of the southern part of Maine and those battle coming closer and closer to the Olympic that refugees from those communities were coming down south and living in St Louis so yeah the outside contacts coming into this little town story and a\nSilly incident like this and spend four episode\n... that's what gives us the freedom to explore all that context\nYeah when you dug in deep to this and started looking at it as well it was a crazy time for the what took place here and obviously all of this was a it wouldn't happen today just the laws would not allow it to you know how they went after people was just insanity uh so so\nWhat do you attribute to why it took place back in the day and you know what started accusing people of being which is in this area\nYou know there's no simple explanation which is why we have to spend twelve episodes on it but we don't want a big reason is because the colony of Massachusetts was set up with a charter sort of like a it's a legal document says what you can and can't do and it describes the laws\nAnd the events took place in the little period of time between\nThe guy that the king and England in the charter and throwing it away\nAnd before they got their new charters sort of this law was time where they didn't really know how to do things and they had to make it up as they went and being Puritans and being very religious people that sort of what they lean back on and so for this it's the perfect storm of it that she did the conflict up in Maine the loss of a charter\nUm people are afraid and then in the midst of all of this they get a brand new leader of the\nYou know the whole community and the governor of Massachusetts who has a description that sounds eerily familiar he has no political experience that takes place at a time when we have a lot of climate change and um the winters right usually harsh and the economy was rough people will be taxed too much and all of this stuff\nAt the gather into a perfect storm\nWhile I Can't wait to check it out and Mickey our guests are with the pod chest you can check it out right here with the I heard radiolab downloaded it's free to download and one last question is there any truth to the rumor that ah Hillary Rodham Clinton was in fact related to uh one of the Salem witches back in the day\nSo I'm going to show my cards here [laughter] it's like well
