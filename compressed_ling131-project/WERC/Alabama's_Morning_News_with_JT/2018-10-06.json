and I said okay without getting myself into help\nPayment literally get are included in paying payments Oh nice okay right so the story sucks [laughter]\nSo I'm now ... years later a at last year she I got my job and she gave me the payments and I realize that even though I don't get started off\nIn the corporate world I don't make enough to to pay for the car so my story kind of like a lady that called the NFL I Know\nYour guidelines that I Need to get rid of the car but I don't know how to go about doing that I get my leg you know it's not in Iraq so thick yeah and it also fix so she\nMentally ill and they don't like is she mentally unable to make it legal decisions\nNo she's not mentally eight she's he's mentally able she has a virus that if the credit so that's why he was able to get the car in the pain that she did\nSo here's the thing she tried to do a nice thing for you and she did it in a really stupid way and so now you're both stuck right\nBecause you ...\n... more it's not gonna hurt your credit at all your ... it's her credit that we're worried about we want to do a nice thing for her 'cause she's sick and not able to deal with this so uh what she probably knows more on this car than it is worth I'm guessing\n... are adding Kelley Blue book steady was a word around close to twenty thousand if it and he found out\nIs worth close to twenty thousand would have voted against it\nI Want to throw like ... like twenty thousand now okay or does your ... to have any money [noise] she retired but\nNot really so she couldn't afford it okay All right\nWell I'm sure you guys are in a pinch us is very uncomfortable because here's what needs to happen she needs to sell this car because her niece can't pay the\nPayments and when\nShe sells the car she's going to lose seven thousand dollars on it what are we going to do with that\n\nDo you feel obligated to pay that\n\nYou're not legally are way I Do\nThink that I mean I Know what I Do get the credit excepted it I Know I'm at fault for not\nYou know how old are you telling me what do you make a choice without jeeze\nOkay well someone's going to find the seven thousand dollars to put with the twenty thousand dollars that you get from you\nThat she gets from her by her to pay the car off so that the buyer can get the title and that's going to leave you and her\n... is going to leave her seven thousand dollars and the whole if you want to help with that you can um where I'm mediating this I Would say you both did something stupid and I would ask you to split it\nThat she each thirty five hundred and thirty five hundred and let's get the car so if she's too sick to handle the transaction have her sign a power of attorney over to you for the title\nAnd then you get the car sold and um how have her come up with three thousand five hundred and you go borrow three thousand five hundred and that's your penalty for being engaged in this and her penalty for being engaged

just had a baby two weeks ago and she was living with a man\nWho had family his wife had died and he had three small boys to to make it short she\nFind a way a lot of things that you shouldn't have one is taken out a couple of title loans on her car a road rubber check as credit card debt so to make a long story short she's got quite a few collection agencies after her\nShe can't be clear with me right now about how much she really knows I don't know I Believe I think it's over forty thousand and less than eight I'm not I'm not sure but she's racked up a lot of dead last year she\nIs almost thirty four she will be next month [noise] my my question to you is she has no money I Do not want to pay her death um what does she said these collection agencies I mean literally she has nothing\nIs nine year old is she still living with this guy you know he's in a halfway house he was on drugs were not as kids\nHis kids are now with one of his sisters and his mother\nSo she now as a single mom with a new baby on her own\nRight deep fear in Arizona gave myself and my husband the responsibility of taking care of the baby now and go wherever she wants but baby stays with me\nOkay so now moved in with you yeah she's living with me the ... the baby on the mother correct\nOkay good good that's good news okay good so here here's the thing that um ... what you tell the collection agencies is is that she has nothing and so for now they will get nothing\nAnd that she's dealing with bipolar and you know you date she is what we in the business called judgment proof\nOh absolutely can sue your pants off but they can't if you don't have any pants and that's what it amounts to okay\nWell that's what I was thinking that he wasn't you know her boyfriend had said to me well I didn't make lead find anything that she wasn't aware of it but she can't make those decisions is what I've told them\nWell she she you know we've got to come back to that in the second book let's assume that debt is valid for us it's not that much and it'll probably be good for her to work our way through it when she gets back on her feet\nShe might even got a job right now I Know yeah I Know\nWhat I said when she gets back on her feet mentally emotionally is working\nYeah we're going to let her let her um probably reap the rewards of her stupid ... in the middle of bipolar okay now having said that I work with we work with bipolar for years people who have bipolar always end up in financial counseling goes manger\nScene with from in the past year and I realized she probably had her biological clock ticking going well mom and dad have always told me I shouldn't get pregnant oh he's mad because she's on two different every day so she's been at for a while your\nBottom line and asked them line is is that with good counseling and with the proper balance of medication not over medication but not under medication um that that she can live a very normal life and make good decisions about everything child rearing financially and everything in a\n... you know but it can happen it can\nHappen to show what happens is is that she's got to stay plugged into a properly balanced medication regime and plugged into counseling she has to want to be well\nYeah and if she does that then she can\nForm a very good life and we have folks do that but to the extent that a bipolar person doesn't do those two things you are never going to have a financial situation is solid yeah because when they go manic they just go bananas\nOh I Know I Know that I was in control of her checking account for

and got into all kinds of stuff they shouldn't have gone into so Facebook freaked out because ... was even with this problem was me\nYeah yeah JT this is really bad and I think because of everything else going on in the news people didn't really may be paying close attention to how bad this really is but we're talking fifty million Facebook users maybe more maybe as much as Ninety million I'm ah we're\nA and packed it by this uh you have a situation where people were able to or hackers were able to get into people's accounts without their password there was a glitch there were a couple of

really right uh but\nYou don't do enough you know things and people were able to kind of fake it and log in as he without your password looking into a a profile page getting private information like uber they people you're related to\nUm I think that you wouldn't normally show the whole world is a big question mark over okay well how much do they really get what was it just it on her ability that was discovered or or or is there someone out there with all the information ready to use it against us you know as soon as they investigate were just left with more questions\nYeah like for instance this was not my bank account they broke into this was my Facebook account so I started thinking about even if they got in there what's the most damaging thing to get for me my email address or my birthday and I mean there's really not a lot of security problems are going to Facebook or go\nOkay well there's a lot of personal information right so your birthday\nOr some people put their phone numbers and if you start to add up all the little things someone could build a profile about you to maybe apply for a credit card or or just general identity fraud so it's it it just makes you feel

Facebook logging with Instagram that's where it could have also had a connection or any other apps that maybe you don't have a password for you to log in with your Facebook account\nAnd then they find all these little trails somewhere some point they may lead right into your brain in terms of you are oh let me ask you this they did do a reset ... security issues Facebook's to Ninety million users I did not get the the reset did you\nI I did not um but if you did a good chance that he or among these people that might have had their information taken and uh I I think Facebook's already been on
