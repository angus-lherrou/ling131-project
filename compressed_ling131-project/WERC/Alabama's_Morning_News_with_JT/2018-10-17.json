something it's called acute flash at ...\nIt's a FM for short and it's it's concerning for a couple of reasons and the CDC issued a warning about it yesterday up for this reason number one it seems to target children Ninety percent of the cases are involved those Eighteen and younger and the average age of those\nContrasting this illness is said to be four years old you know it really targets younger children number one that's a concern second part of it is right now they have no idea what causes it\nIt could be a virus it could be an environmental toxin it could be mosquito borne it could involve genetic factors so right now they're continuing to try to isolate the exact cause of this but\nIt has been either confirmed or under investigation in uh over two dozen states nationwide including Alabama uh so uh this is something for parents to keep an eye on and right now the CDC and medical officials are saying that\nIf you or your child suddenly develops a weakness in the arms and legs or or or has trouble talking seek immediate medical care right now there is no treatment for it but they can start physical therapy protocols that might be able to minimize some of the effects of it which right now range from a quick recovery\nFor children who might go through this to continuing paralysis that will last for some time while\nYou know these are talking about how young these kids are the majority of them\nAs you said the around four years old and the the limb weakness and the muscle tone reflexes and they also say look at their faces they've got to you know to get some islet drew been going on or difficulty you know moving their eyes are difficulties swallowing the\nImpaired breathing it's this has got to be a scary situation where these parents and your right thirty states have been\nConfirmed was suspected cases of this how long does this virus last ah when people got and that and what can parents expect to you know the battle through it is\nYeah well like I said it ranges right now there are some that recover fairly quickly after experiencing this others' experience prolonged paralysis and require ongoing care and physical therapy as a result so are there really is a range of reactions to this and a range of recoveries\nAnd what can you do about it well right now medical officials are saying\nDo the same things you would do to try to stave off a cold or or the flu number one get all your vaccinations is is not related to any type of vaccination number you\nFrequent hand washing and number three if you're in an area where there are mosquitoes and make sure you have mosquito protection\nKids are coming through this though we don't have any deaths because of the situation well there has been one uh ...\nYeah uh so it it is a a a
