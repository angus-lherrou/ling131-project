medical center into Hoover but and I thought that's where it was going the mayor wanted as there are there were opposition to it coming to who are and you were one of those people opposed to putting it in over ... why is that\nI checked the necessarily opposed to putting it in or out with the host of paying a twenty million dollar bounty to really take jobs from one day brings city to another and it became evident real quickly as we became ... we began talking about this and the public space that rather than the current crossings where the mayor was proposing to put it [noise]\nBut I didn't want it twenty million dollars and in fact they didn't want to twenty cents\nI just did not want this facility in the middle of the neighborhood so paying for it or was that they will break or

you know dollars to the table for the city of Hoover in the long run\nI think there's no question that they would have brought it would have brought a huge benefit to us over the long term I guess the question we have to answer is what the benefit were and what the right place for it\nClearly in my mind it wasn't worth of twenty million and I don't think they had enough council approved or support to even vote on it at that price so uh in my mind it wasn't worth it you know paying any amount for it to put it where we were going to put it rather an artist writes cough\nOr some people have said
