Court is back in session today eight people show up there not nine\nJustices we did not get him confirmed so the FBI just takes it every now bill right\nYeah that's where we are now and the boy after all the drama on friday the move really was made to satisfy Jeff Flake\nA ... and we will hold this investigation the the White House says we're going to let the FBI do they do which thing we're not micromanaging anything they will talk to a several people who are allegedly were involved in this or may have something to say about it\nAnd uh and then they will report back or not again assuming any guilt or innocence here but they will just report back on what they had discovered in what their investigation shown up but the truth is Katie not a whole lot can be done and just a couple of days work and uh you know and like I said at the beginning this is really something just to\nKind of a as a swayed judge Jeff Flake or at one we had to the full Senate so yeah back what will happen this week is FBI all come back\nAgain the committee has already approved him a show the appeal come back with it's a it's an you know it's a result of its probe and then then we'll go on to the full Senate\nYeah I'm here is Lindsey Graham talking about this FBI investigation was\nThis was about delaying the herring keeping the seat open past ... terms so could they failed and twenty twenty there are no rules when it comes to Brett Kavanaugh honored Obama's election he got to pick out her mind Kagan they don't want to honor President Trump's ability to pick a fine man\nYeah we knew there was a couple of you know folks ah two or three actually Murkowski Collins Republican senators are we're on the fence on this whole thing Jeff Flake obviously was front and center on this and he's the one that came out and here's why he asked for this FBI investigation\nThis is limited in time and go and uh it's appropriate\nAllegations is or is\nThat we ought to let people know there was also the\nCar and uh so the president kind of things that this might be a blessing in disguise at the end of the day because they're not going to find anything yeah right\nI mean when it when it comes out and said okay we went through the FBI investigation\nOr nothing will be shown here it according to what a lot of people are believing now what more can come out and a couple of days investigation so ah the president then says there is no reason to delay any more let's move it forward get Brett Kavanaugh on the Supreme Court\nYeah and President Trump over the weekend speaking loud and clear about take let's get out and vote it's time to get these Democrats are out of office here I think this will fire up the base for the Republicans do you\nYeah I think so uh yeah and there's been a lot of talk about how the Democrats are getting fired up for this election well this certainly brings to attention the influence of the Democrats can have on on policy down the road here so I think it's important and the president pointed out\nThat we need to get out and vote in the mid term elections so I Would imagine we're going to have a huge voter turnout uncharacteristically for a non presidential election year\nYeah quickly President Trump on Kavanaugh\nVote for judge Kavanaugh is also a vote to reject the ruthless and outrages tactics of the Democrat Party mean obstruction is mean resist is for the last Eighteen months Democrats have spent every minute trying to overturn the results\nOf the last election not about the yeah he's a spot on right there and I I think Republicans will respond and get out and get fired up I Know the Democrats are showing polling numbers it looked like they are going to be out there as well but you know I I think this will certainly a rejuvenate the Republican base well this is going on\nIn the United states and Canada now confirmed yesterday they've got this deal of the new modernized trade agreement between us and them good news for the president\nYeah and uh and this is a victory for the president he had this deadline in place in while there wasn't a whole lot of progress over the past couple of weeks all of a sudden over the weekend bang things happen and\nThe couple of things that were really the big issues involved here were were settled now I mean the United states wanted there to be a settlement a dispute settlement mechanism dropped from this new agreement Canada want it to stay and had been in NAFTA it stays in\nBut on the other hand and more importantly to us ... dairy farmers will get more access to the Canadian dairy market out of this and there will be a quota placed on the number of vehicles that can be exported to the United states\nOr gives Canada room for a little bit of growth there as well so we have an agreement so we will have a U.S Mexico Canada\nFree trade agreement which is huge because Canada and Mexico combined our our largest trading partner by far in the world\nGot it all worked

number thirty thirty\n[noise]\nThis is Alabama's morning News I'm Jay joining us now make up our correspondent following what's happening with the cabin on destination in the FBI investigation now so I'm Michael good morning\nGood morning at the shocking to nobody JT the finger pointing and ISI\nContinue you know we had to eat that she said with the testimony last week in regards to Kevin on board this weekend when you sign off on getting the FBI investigation then you've got\nThe they said we said element of this where we now know President Trump has promised to get the FBI free rein in its probe but then the New York times came out on Saturday with an article saying that the White House asked the FBI the only question\nFor witnesses showing some form of limit that then Dianne Feinstein\nWent off to say hey listen we demand a copy here that says this year a committee of the written directive that you guys in the White House that to the FBI is to what the scope of the investigation is going to be in the White House goes no no no no no we didn't do that you only scope of the investigation came from\nYou guys in the Senate and so the finger pointing continues to go back and forth here in regards to who called for what while this investigation goes on\nAny chance that this investigation might go both directions meaning Kavanaugh and Christian Ford is the\nInsinuation is this was all orchestrated by Democrats George Soros and those in the resistance so perhaps his might uncover some correspondence perhaps emails text messages between her and the team that wants to keep this man off the bench\nIt indeed that is the case and we know that Dianne Feinstein office is going to be investigated to determine if this leak confidential letter from Christine Blasey Ford\nA kind of came from that area also we know that Tom Cotton is calling for uh people investigating the lawyers there for for possibly misinformed is such an in depth investigation Jake he would indicate you could probably come up with a pretty good amount of that stuff\nAnd and we've already heard from former FBI Director James Comey the FBI agents can come up with a lot of information in a week period of time\nTom Cotton areas allegations against Kevin ISIS completely falls\nThese allegations are completely an supported by any evidence what evidence there is thirty six year old claim all support judge Kavanaugh is denial but then the Democrats have disgrace this process and the United States Senate and the orchestrated smear campaign of character assassination they run they can stretch Kevin\nAnd he also said that the Dianne Feinstein office is going to be investigated to determine whether or not that you know they leak that confidential letter from Christine for the detail all these allegations so I mean she could be in some hot water if that turns out to be the case she says absolutely she didn't do it tonight at the vehemently\nRight right um I Wonder how deep do go into the investigation into the Democrats are missing or are they going to completely focus on what's happening with the Kavanaugh I mean they do intertwined and there has to be some sort of you know this dot follows that a dog now look what we've got a year with these allegations and\nThe fact that the council of the committee rather have the her yearbook as well\nAs his during that whole process last week and\nThe Republicans refuse to bring it up and and go there so perhaps this could backfire on the Democrats\nOh absolutely and and with that if they're still really pushing the Democrats seem to be this level of well you guys are even talking to Julie sweating she was the third woman that had the allegations again running it's like having a\nIf you're not even investigating her than what the point of this investigation but you already saw Mitch McConnell kind of highlight this concern about going back to two thousand where there was a a from a company that she was working at miss miss a sweat\nWas working at that there were some concerns about charges in regards to some sexual assault charges and sexual concern charges there and sweat Nick being as we know represented by Michael ... loves himself a camera and a story a visit these are completely bogus stories were almost dismissed immediately but\nYou know it was said to me if you're going to conduct a thorough investigation and you're going to bring her into this conduct a thorough investigation on her and have that information ready to go as well\nYeah I think we all learned some things about Julie sweat and who is the third woman do use of Brett Kavanaugh sexual misconduct she was sued back in two thousand for making false accusations of sexual misconduct against co workers and for sexual misconduct of her own through although the case was dismissed or she's got a bit of a history doesn't she\nShe certainly has questions right it it brings up questions and brings up concerns that brings that something that you should go well that should be investigated why don't we look into that and see what's happening there before we begin taking on whatever her allegations are as some sort of reward of law or at least in the Democratic side thing\nYou should really investigate those accusations well let's look back at her and see who she is before we do that\nAlso I understand in some of the investigations in her in the past that uh the the claim that sweating it said she graduated from Johns Hopkins university but then a subscriber subsequently or they learned in school had no idea who she had no idea\nThat like ... what's her name again can you spell that again right we have no record of her whatsoever here ...\nSo a little credibility I Would think comes into play in this so I think you know at the end of the day he does get confirmed this will be over next week some time but uh\nYou know what the resistance they'll pull out any stop they can to keep this from going all the way through and or at least get into the midterms and then hopefully they think they'll get over a get the boats and take over again in the house and\nUh it's just unbelievable I your thoughts on what you're hearing on whether or not this confirmation actually goes through\nI think everybody just waiting to see how this investigation is going to go and how in depth but if but at the what seems to me at this point that barring anybody stepping aside for a concern of some sort of a background check here you're looking at probably this time next week of having the vote on the Senate\nFloor as to whether or not Brett Kavanaugh becomes the next Supreme Court justice and right now I don't see any reason as to why he should\nThey are a very good Michael
