not about military activities it's not about election interference yeah it's about drugs uh yesterday there was a hearing by the Senate caucus on international narcotics control\nAnd that the spotlight squarely put on China in relation to the\nOpioid problem in this country specifically ... which is responsible for overdose deaths in this country\nThat a total nearly thirty thousand in the last year in the United states alone so ah if China is the main producer of the ... and the chemical components to make the drug and of course spending has medical uses as a pain killer and the anesthesia\nBut the illegal trade trade and ... also very big and getting larger and China is seen as one of the problems here\nThat they are not regulating what's going on there and the illegal distribution of Bentonville is becoming a bigger and bigger problems and and maybe more disturbing is reports now J. T. that China may be cooperating with Mexican drug cartels in order to get fat no either into other drugs like heroin or cocaine\nOr fentanyl itself being formed into synthetic opioids and brought across the border and the southwest United States\n... the ah the war on drugs is just never ending and I'm not surprised to hear that the Mexican cartel may be involved in all of this as well I mean they're close to us that they realize the access to our borders pretty easy these days\nAre getting a little tougher with what the president's trying to do but uh\nYeah China trying to get it in themselves of finding a little bit of difficulty being you know geographically undesirable for this nation to just whip it across the border so why not partner up with the number one drug pushers or

the be best initiative and also it's also a showcase according to her office for the work of the U.S agency for international development\nSo a child welfare is a big thing with the first lady and that's a big part of this trip as well\nAnd it's a it's a bout of what we call soft diplomacy\nShe is there a in Africa not only promoting her initiatives\nBut also uh trying to smooth the waters in relations with\nAfrican countries if possible it's something that first ladies do uh normally put this her first solo overseas trip and so far what we're hearing in our first stop and gone to is that people are describing her as a warm caring individual she's gotten a good reception but as you say JT not to the magnitude that you would think a a Michelle Obama would get\nShe ought to be covered like night and day on this and the whole United States should be behind her and proud of our first lady but the press and the media and the liberal left shutting it down and it's disgusting it really

is Alabama's morning News I'm Jay to President Trump was at a\nRally and a smoker the media yesterday and also believe that this vote will happen by the end of the week to come to confirm Brett Kavanaugh\n... a lot is going to depend on what comes back from the FBI in terms of their shells number seven investigation but I think that just very well\nLike they'll have a vote by the end of the week and it will be a positive up\nYou know maybe Saturday joining us now Michael ... our our correspond has been following the situation you're Michael good morning so\nUh the FBI wrapping up today which means we could have that vote friday probably Saturday but ah who says the FBI's wrapping up all I'm seeing is sources what source\nThat kind of what we're looking at here to Jay ticket morning or hearing is that the wall Street Journal reporting that the although the FBI had until friday to complete the investigation GOP eight and a person a million with the matter expected to wrap up possibly as early as today could be tomorrow but in either case seems like it would be before Mitch McConnell's friday deadline for the vote but again\nYou got to kind of take that with a grain of salt right you're saying that GOP eight and a personal familiar with the matter of doing it I Will say this\nAnd FBI officials are saying that this investigation has been an all hands on deck moment where you've got\nSome of the younger FBI rookies and younger guys coming in to take over some parts of the investigation the older senior guys who are really good investigation happen pulled off of cases to be put on this case and see if they can't get this information done as quickly as possible so\nI guess it's possible that this has been a really expedient situation but I Know as we've mentioned you've had some Senator Schumer one of them saying that this isn't possibly an in depth FBI investigation that everybody looking for\nAnd Schumer he said he wants to release all their findings to the public when it's over\nThere is a growing consensus in the Senate to win the FBI investigation is complete the findings should be released publically\nWith any personal information\nRejected you know it's interesting that he's calling for these findings to be released Feinstein want her to keep it secret then you've got a couple of Republicans don't really agree on releasing keeping say\nIt's so weird to see this go back and forth like that you had\nA even Senator Lindsey Graham saying he'd be fine if all this information was released I think the concern that Feinstein had had everything to do with privatize information if you were attacked that what the problem go ahead and get that information out there\nI don't think America would feel comfortable with everything that we've seen with all of the nation of these stories about throwing eyes or letters from Nineteen eighty three and how much somebody had a drink wouldn't\nSeem like it didn't have an ending if you don't get that FBI investigation and get a test kind of ... otherwise you just leave us hanging\nYou know yesterday and boy I'll tell you the president's taken some heat from a lot of people on the left on this and people supporting Christine forty was at a rally here in Mississippi in the south yesterday and they're all saying well he mocked Christine forward for claiming she definitely just had one beer even though she can't remember the details listen\nI have one right I Want to be\nWell you think it was it was one of them I'm good how did you get home I don't remember

but I had one of the room and a man's life is in tatters a man's life is shattered\nNot to mention what his family is going through here and even the prosecutors the Republicans brought to the hearing\nAfterwards said you know what if this were a trial I Would not be bringing any charges against him there's just not be evidence there and that's that's the president's point from the beginning of this whole thing\nThat there's really no recollection from her there's really been no real corroboration in fact a lot of people were shooting this and you know nothing is really come as far as hard evidence goes to say this guy needs to go away\nYeah I mean nothing that we've seen is clearly that's the case I think this pretty okay you've seen a lot of the never Trump Republicans coming coming out since those comments were made last night from President Trump saying listen\nThis is going to make things incredibly hard for people like Lisa Murkowski called to go back and face their female voters with the president mocking her like that but then also the question of you you had President Trump come out after she gave her testimony saying that she was a very credible witness and now you got him marking her\nI Know he's frustrated you know he's frustrated we've seen this thing go on and on and on with no result at this point and also that you mentioned no proof I think that's what really came out last night\nYeah and here's the other point the president made yesterday and it's a good point too yes maybe the folks at the rally what would you do if it was your kid accused like Brett Kavanaugh\nOf you know I think I've had many false accusations I've had it all I had so many and when I say it didn't happen nobody believes\nMe yeah I mean it's guilty until proven innocent in this case which is bad seven Seventeen Alabama's morning news thank you Michael Bauer\nBreaking bread big event coming up here surely about a week and a half or so a Katie back with a
