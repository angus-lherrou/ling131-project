Alabama's morning News I'm Katie yup Brett Kavanaugh officially sworn in\nLast night or yesterday with the president ended up before everything got underway President Trump's first apologized Brett Kavanaugh for the treatment he and his family received during the confirmation process\nBehalf of our nation I Want to apologize to Brett and the entire Kavanaugh family for the terrible pain and suffering you have been forced\nTo endure joining us now builds emperor correspond has been following this from yesterday's activity a bill as this is going on still the protestors are out there but uh it's a done deal now he is on the Supreme Court\nSure as a begin to hear cases immediately on age discrimination case in the case of an endangered a frog in Mississippi some of the first cases that he will here but he has taken his place\nOn the on the bench along with his colleagues on the Supreme Court\nAnd of course they will welcome him and it's amazing that he is well known among the other members of the Supreme Court or just due to the fact that some of the legal opinions that they have had to examine of heads and they have supported his legal opinions for the most part so he is tremendously respected JT by the other members of the Supreme\nCourt yeah Brecht Kavanaugh says that he's going to be a force of stability on the Supreme Court for years to come\nI take this office with gratitude and no bitterness on the Supreme Court I Will seek to be a force for stability and unity my goal is to be a great justice for all Americans\nI'll tell you what while this was going on you know we still have these crazy protestors out there bill and a reporter from buys told another report yeah protesters admitted to them that they've been paid the costs scenes these protests against Kavanaugh\nWe talked to one woman who works for ultraviolet was paid she helps people in the right way is to be able to confront than there were paid there were people who are paying to try to harness that energy in a way that makes it all and that we ended up\nSo uh what do you think bill will continue to be a a a side show who is Kevin ... all the way through the midterms is or you think this is going to kind of die off at this point\nWell it should fade away just how quickly it fades away remains to be seen I have a feeling what we're going to see here are relatively quick fade away here before the midterm elections but then\nAny time you have any type of controversy all\nCase that comes before the Supreme Court having to do with the women's rights or executive power I think you'll see the same thing again you'll see some paid protesters are showing up to at the Supreme Court to again a voice their opinions but\nYeah this has been from the very beginning the orchestrated protests even during the first hearings involving Brett Kavanaugh orchestrated protest involving paid protesters\nYou know and it'll be interesting to next time the president has an opportunity to nominate another one will it be Amy Barrett\nWho's quite the conservative and they say even more conservative Brett Kavanaugh will this all start over again with the you know deception and lies at the Brian talked about with Brett Kavanaugh will they smear her and try and I mean it's just insanity what's going on there All right well while this is going on\nA who took Kim Jong own and replaced him with a look like this is crazy I I mean it's a good thing or does he want to be a Christian he's invited the pope to come visit\nI agree with you JT you got to be saying who is this guy and what did you do with Kim Jong il had because it is really a completely different person and yes Kim Jong on will invite Pope Francis to North Korea and this will be an invitation delivered by\nSouth Korean president Moon Jae in when he visits the Vatican next week\nSo uh the invitation has been made and whether the pope will go or not remains to be seen I imagine they will uh and uh but it's interesting because North Korea traditionally has discouraged any type of involvement in organized religion or fear that it could create social unrest\nAh so you're right this is a complete change the philosophy\nWho would've ever thought that we'd be in this position today not only with North Korea reaching out in a smiling Kim Jong il and saying oh yeah I'm I'm willing to give up my nuclear arsenal or all the way to inviting the pope or to North Korea this is this is a tremendous change of events\nYeah I Love it built thank you so much I appreciate it and according to the United nations report North Korea is officially atheist and strictly controls religious activities in fact\nNorth Korea considers the spread of most religions dangerous but Christianity they say is considered particularly serious threat because it provides a platform for social and political organization and interaction outside of the realm of the state and you'll lose control of everything and I don't

Michael ah so what's the latest going on over there\nWell Katie it is that strengthening developing an eye this morning we'll develop into a cat too\nAs he goes through today and then that's supposed to form into a category three wind up to a hundred and fifty maybe a hundred and twenty miles per hour then making landfall in the panhandle of Florida maybe late morning early afternoon on Wednesday couldn't come very close to Panama City\nAnd then it's going to get picked up by a front is going to be moving through here and a jacket northeast word on Thursday across portions of Georgia and then enter the Carolinas so we will see actually more impact here from a front\nRather than anything from Michael\nJordan thoughts on what's happening with the flooding afterwards and the storm surge\nWell you know the key is to track any wobble to the east or west can really change things anything on the eastern side of that center which could come in and across Panama City you're talking about the greater amount of storm surge that could get up to eight to twelve\nFeet now around Panama City that down\nWe'll see at least four to eight maybe hire a get a wobble and that track would be critical either way it's not good news for the Gulf Coast Mara very\nGood job pre she at the update and a Governor Scott down in Florida telling his residence or be safe and listen to the back seat evacuation orders of ...\nAre we seeing mandatory evacuations being ordered and counties across the panhandle if you're under an evacuation order this into a don't wait\nThey also talked about how strong these winds are going to be\nThe panhandle parts of the Big Bend will likely the winter next to a hundred and ten miles per hour ... seats\nGood thing to say to hurricane force winds at Seventy five miles per hour yeah and\nThe flooding once again probably gonna be the big issue there or wherever it lands or instill a they're looking at Panama City beach or the way that I Know you and I've been talking about the possibility of us going back down to the holiday inn resort in Panama City beach this weekend\nUm but ah we're in contact with them waiting to hear more I think they're waiting to see exactly where the track is looking what they're gonna have to be dealing with there may be something where we don't necessarily go down\nAnd really promote what a great resort that is but maybe just maybe send you down for an update as to what happened on on Wednesday tomorrow or maybe this weekend to see what's going on as far as you know power outages and\nI think that's why I mean it gets question yeah I really don't the Panama City having\nThe huge flooding issue that like we saw with the Carolinas because this is going to be a fast moving storm this is not going to be something that comes in lingers right ran I've seen models that safe Panama City is going to get as little as three inches of rain in this yeah so you're you're not going to flood with three inches of rain\nThat on the other side of the coin you know they've got to it at least warn folks that there's a potential that surge being right eight feet which could seriously impacted area\nIf it shifts west any I've seen things that are almost like fifty miles west or east of Panama City beach that are getting a foot Eighteen Inches of rain so if it goes any further west they can be in the brunt of it but I really see this moving more eastern in more into the what are they caught the hump of Florida are on the panhandle right there ... I I\nThink that's going to be the worst is it maybe port St Luke or a port St John or a ... well as we've seen with other\nStorms in the past uh twenty four hours can make a difference and a lot of things with strength the direction and so they are anticipating landfall sometime tomorrow afternoon I think\nThe strongest wins in the Panama City area we are going to be around noon tomorrow\nAll right we'll keep you posted no doubt all day long on six fifty six Alabama's morning News Let's get a sports update now from WBRC\nFive six years were Carly good news bad news for like for instance ... good morning here's what's happening first while they're still number one day lead but Asian at scoring ... fifty six points for God that's the bad news find deep as a backdrop on digs is up and definitely with a foot injury\n... males on I mean the media today in Lebanon amber tigers haven't rush for a hundred yards in the last three games there is concern on the plane NFL Drew Brees as I said now number one on\nThe NFL career passing yard is Liz ... three hundred and sixty three yards last night he's over Seventy two thousand yards passing Peyton Manning for number one all the time and I think beat the skins forty three Nineteen other NFL News Baltimore claim Cyrus Jones up a waiver wire are Gary steward unimportant visually dumped by the jets\nFalcons quarterback Matt Ryan had an ex ran us what those X rays are negative major league baseball the Braves lots of the Dodgers let's say six to do brave season has done the problems in the end they'll see as for the third straight year Boston beat the Yankees sixteen to one day lead that A.
