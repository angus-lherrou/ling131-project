It's MORNING you\nRight now we have sixty degrees in Tuscaloosa and the same in Birmingham this is Alabama's morning news\nMedia worse for your job as a tool and equipment is a store for serious power to electrical pressure washers generous compressed more stuff into northern to any women's wars or visit them online and nose in a tub [noise]\n\nSix twelve is the is Alabama's morning News I'm Brandon filling in for Jay team while his daughter has a baby this morning I Can't wait to hear all the News Let's go now and talk\nWith our national correspondent build them for about uh the mess that's going on at our southern border and bill I just have a question about this because all of the sudden you know this seems a little odd to me\nIt's three thousand quote unquote migrants that's not what they are they're illegal trying to crash our border\nThree thousand of them\nAll of a sudden trying to come here\nThey're calling it the march of the migrant and there's even one person that says and she's a her name is Andrea Fernandez she's twenty four years old she left Honduras with a newborn baby a five year old daughter and a seven year old son\nAnd her quote is we're going to drop in on Donald Trump he has to take a sin\n[noise] yeah I ... yeah the timing is interesting all news ... ... ... it started off as about a hundred fifty people in the town of San Pedro Sula on friday and there were numerous warnings number one Mike Pence came out and said look\nI I don't come right and he ... he called on the presidents of\nHonduras Guatemala and Mexico all to repeat that phrase to them down there to stay home because uh they probably don't stand much of a chance of getting into the United states then ah Guatemala's president said we're not going to let you across the border\nWell they've gone to the Guatemalan border or they were met by police there and uh and after a couple of hours of police let them through say they got into Guatemala or they went through another police road block\nAnd a and they are continuing on and you're right as well do about three thousand now and you know what's the most interesting part about this later they're still a distance away from the United states but uh if they continue on\nBoyd they'll reach the U.S border ... writer on election day\nAnd there we have that\nYeah yeah I don't think this is grassroots at all I think this has been organized by the Democrats I Do remember when\nPresident Obama used to ah leaflets were dropped down everywhere all over south South America hey come to the border\nAgent read to kill us this is so obviously blatant they want to bring their kids they want a film kids being quote ripped from the arms of their parents\nUh you know and things like that but here's the sad thing if they make it here that I think they're going to be led end they always are\nWell what will happen if they do if and when they get to the United states or they will have to go through the normal procedures at the border which means that the that they will be detained or they might apply for asylum they'd have to go through the regular things there but ah they will be detained they could be turned away they could be deported\nOr so or Mike Pence has told them that and we are getting some help from Mexico Mexico has already informed everybody that look\nA they have a strict visa laws in Mexico visas they say must be requested at the council it's not at the border and they said that immigration rules are always observed so Mexico is helping us out a little bit on this whether they will be able to slow down this caravan remains to be saying\nI mean look they said that they are going to try to seek refugee status in Mexico or pass through to the U.S the woman says we're going to drop in on Donald Trump be asked to take it sent\nThe whole Mexico thing as a sham the whole thing is a sham and this president of Mexico I remember when he was thinking about running he made a couple of remarks about\nWe're going to overwhelm the southern border the United states they're not going to be able to process all of these people so we're going to overwhelm the border\nJust to you to be able to get in there so I'm I'm curious to see what happens but I think we all know what's gonna happen they're trying to paint President Trump is this person who doesn't care ripping babies from their parents the use you all\nUh I I just don't know if it's going to have any effect or not because when you are warned over and over and over\nAnd you still try to calm and you're bringing newborn babies that San ...\nYeah ... and you're right that they had been warned to over and over ... first by a by this country then by the country of Guatemala and now by the country of Mexico all getting warnings and so you can't use the argument\nThat uh they were not aware of what may happen to them when they get to the United states border or they're being informed all the way from the very beginning\nRight it looks like activism gone wild and they're using their children as tools so we will see what happens and of course how the liberal media plays it builds them for you are the best thank you so much for

them now so\nWe're seeing that she released it but it's in correspondence with something else 'cause she released the DNA test but she also released a website and a video that all looked to be at this point Leah like it's it's a it's an attempt to neutralize President Trump calling her Pocahontas but then also by the way she looks like she's going to run for president twenty twenty\nEarly Show that\nThe early look at what this all is here but she's saying that President Trump does a charity of her choice to cool million dollars a based upon statements he made at a rally back in July\nAnd that uh she's saying that you know when President Trump said he contributed a million dollars her favorite charity if she took a DNA test and show jak Native American roots because he said at that point of the only proof yet with a high cheekbones\nUp a great great grandma because I got that right that's great\nAnd uh she's gotten the proof according to Stanford University\nA biomedical science

percent title of his shirt\nProblem is according to the Cherokee Nation which she just outraged\nNot the problem is that there is no DNA cast for Cherokee what she has claimed to be in fact all of this came from Mexico Peru and other countries not Native Americans\nActually according to the scientists all comes from before the the even to the degree they said that there is no way to study for what tribe you maybe if you're not you're Cherokee if you're a recall any of that you can't tell that\nBut basically the Native Americans distinct population in Siberia Seventeen thousand uh twenty three thousand you into the Americas around sixteen thousand years ago all the way down to South America during that time frame\nSo all they can study forces indigenous population that has this
