{"month": "10", "state": "AL", "station": "WERC", "content": "Twenty percent would be my guess George but important thing to remember is that there are there and they certainly believe that we exist and so the the old game is is that they don't want us to know that they're they're they want us to think that this is our own feelings\nOur own thoughts and some of it is all of the violence author is not caused by demonic spirits and negative spirits\nAre but certainly there are there to amplify and right now everybody's got a target on their back everybody\nHow did they possess how did they take over somebody's body\nAnd work on them for on people for a while you leave these things happen over a period of time people who are depressed people who move into a home a and there's a lot of negative emotional\nEnergy drugs or something\nI practice something called modern actresses and\nAnd that is that came out of the idea when I started going into people's homes I I found out many years ago that ... homes because people have lived in there that generate both positive and negative emotional energies which are unseen but we feel them\nAnd they accumulate in the environment and demonic spirits actually feel stronger and become stronger and these kinds of environments and so do negative spirits\nAnd so they are or attack people and homes we don't take care of our homes we clean them\nWash windows when you move into a new place the carpets paint everything but we don't clean the atmospheres and so essentially were living in other people's emotional energies and so demonic spirit's just play on that\nAnd they come into the our environment\nAnd generate huge amounts of energy that is negative\nAnd the air thickens with emotional energy especially negative energy it thickens and so it's easier to transmit negative emotional energy hatred both kinds of negative thoughts and emotional feelings when the air\nIs thick with emotional energy and so I get calls all the time from people who you know say hey I just moved into this new home apartment whatever and it doesn't feel right\nI don't know why but you know the kids are crying the dogs are barking in a certain area or we're just getting into more arguments why is this happening and so modern extra citizen deals with the idea of that first the negative emotional energy has\nTo be removed by\nSomebody like me from the atmosphere of the home that makes the spirit weaker than I deal with a negative spirit or that's the second thing that I Do that's modern exercises different from traditional actresses and in that I don't always go after the spirit first\nSometimes I cleared the atmosphere to make them weaker and then I attack the negative spirits\nAnd you're not you're not ... you're not a priest has an effect would you do\nI Would not say that I'm not a priest I Would say that I'm an independent priest say sharman priest exercises I don't belong to any particular\nReligion because I work\nPeople from all different religions or no religious at all people call me who are agnostic atheist\nEverybody calls me and that's the thing you know you don't have to belong to a particular church to call me and a half of your home cleared\nAnd these days I Do it by distance as well because when I was going through homes and doing strictly in person and work for the Internet ever came about\nUm I wasn't touching anything anyways doing personal clearing so it wasn't touching anybody anyway it's really it's not necessary there's no such thing as as a\nDistance on a non physical level doesn't matter as long as you have focused each one of us is a complete individual\nAnd so anybody can be cleared from anywhere if you know how to do it\nAnd it it it has to be done you know we we move into apartments like I said and there's lots of emotional energy from maybe people living there for Twenty years forty years a hundred\nAnd here's where people are from around the world it builds up it accumulates and parents need to be [noise] you know times are already in the homes from time to come into the home they sense of\nFamily that's having a problem because of emotional energy in our living environment and they're ripe for attack and so it may be a professional habit we're one and I then I teach people how to\nMaintain the clarity of their bodies ... or energy field\nA and also how to maintain the clarity of the living environment so it's kind of like having your carpet cleaner come in first and then you can simply cleaner all carpet once that's done\nSo it really is something we all can do to a certain extent and something I think we all should do I'm not going to be around forever and certainly there are great exorcist and every religion I'm not the only one\nA qualified exorcist and just about every religion but they but they don't work for people and other religions I get that all the time you know that people call up and say well like I called you know a local parish even though I'm not you know I don't belong that religion I'm not Catholic\nAnd they won't come over and help me I Hope everybody so I that's why I don't belong to any religion but\nI remember

the time from people who you know say hey I just moved into this new home apartment whenever it doesn't feel right\nI don't know why but you know the kids are crying the dogs are barking in a certain area or we're just getting into more arguments why is this happening and so modern exercises and deals with the idea of that first the negative emotional energy has to be removed by\nSomebody like me from the atmosphere of the home that makes the spirit weaker than I deal with a negative spirit or that's the second thing that I Do that's modern exercises different from traditional actresses and in

said and there's lots of emotional energy from maybe people living there for Twenty years forty years a hundred years depending on where people are from around the world it builds up it accumulates and\nSpirits need to be\nDealt with you know sometimes they're already in the home sometimes they come into the home the sense of family that's having a problem because of emotional energy\nIn our living environment and they're ripe for attack and so it's it's best to call maybe a professional to have a clear at all at once and I then I teach people how to\nMaintain the clarity of their bodies their energy fields or and also how to maintain the clarity of their living environment's so it's kind of like having a carpet cleaner come in first and then you can simply clean her own carpet once that's done so it really is something we all can do\nA certain extent in something I think we all should do I'm not going to be around forever and certainly there are great exercises every religion

[noise]\nThese are some moments from this past week's Alabama's morning news with GT on news radio one oh five five W we are seeing this\nAs Alabama's morning News I'm Jay too now than hurricane Michael\nHas moved out a lot a lot of damage left in the wake up all of this Florida governor Rick Scott describing the damage Esau\nI think as they get these things all over the place and there's no orders that that was like yeah there's a lot of lot of just about everywhere\nMan unbelievable I'm seeing the footage on the Mexico City area there in the panhandle of Florida but uh it really looks like a tornado came through as opposed to hurricanes so it's like ... and just I mean toothpicks thrown everywhere joining us now Michael Bowers been following all of this we're talking about billions of dollars and the cleanup efforts right\nYeah and and the cleanup effort on top of all of that JT we know that it's it's taken awhile that's hard to even just quit roadways to get to and from a couple of hospitals in Tallahassee and and the reason I had to in front of not just the people who need the emergency services bought\nThose people that were in the hospital held up during the storm that need to evacuate and get to a better area to get their care so that was trying to at least that's what the first responders doing this kind of a priority there but there's still portion that you're looking at it video footage of Mexico beach and you're thinking why am I there's a certain part Jay to go\nI feel like I could see Rick Grimes and Michelle I'm from the walking dead fighting zombies that kind of devastation it looks like they're like a post apocalyptic look\nEven somewhere Seventy miles north east of that and in Mariana Florida there's a one guy a lifelong resident says\nThis looks like a bomb and not a hurricane my town and then that seems to be kind of the overwhelming feel here and we're getting the daylight over the past twenty four hours and\nAnd frankly understanding that there are towns right around sort of the Mexico beach area that people cannot get do they cannot get first responders in there either by air or water the only way is right now and even that so difficult they're not able to get people in there and this could be days possibly even later next week before people get in there as first responders\nYeah and we're certainly a familiar with what looks like after a tornado in this area numerous tornadoes have come through especially big one a and and when you\nDrive through those areas is just like ... leads devastation with trees snapped like twigs and houses it brought to the ground in rubble and bricks and cars Jaycee with\nThat that's why I think they're telling us we're going to have to keep an eye on it and not get too comfortable with the death toll which has written we've had in the last half hour a new note of new numbers as far as the debt pogo loving people have died from Michael and that includes now five deaths in from Virginia where they've had severe flooding as well but\nAs Governor Scott has pointed out they haven't gotten to a lot of these towns they haven't gotten a lot of places the first responders who have to look through it not only check on the people who are calling for emergency help but also those people that haven't been able to do with it they may just find in the rubble of some of the homes\nYeah I Do think that death toll probably going to go up and uh you you heard the one guy describing what it was like he tried to get out but they closed the bridge down there and he\nCould not get out he survive but listen to him describing it is you know small little\nTown muses our little town so every restaurant stone every stores known and then all my neighbors and everybody's home so [noise]\nUm [noise] when you think about it [noise]\nYou know these ... who use or how do you do\nWow I mean you can just hear them is trembling in his voice and just the sheer lost that is you know gone down there I mean there's it's weird how these storms work to their there'll be complete devastation and right in the middle of it there's a house that standing you know\nI don't know slabs cement slab you can see the deterioration of explosion of the house and then one standing next to that looks like another one but it's just a wall from that um it's crazy how these storms work\nGovernors Scott also talking about the crews doing search and rescue now\nSo we have over a thousand people doing search and rescue we have I think it's Eighteen people are that have offered him to be deployed to law enforcement\n... thank you for the update this morning it's a seven Seventeen and obviously these people are going to meet a lot of help in a I heard radio cares and
