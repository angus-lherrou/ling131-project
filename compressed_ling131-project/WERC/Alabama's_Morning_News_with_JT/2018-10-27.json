fiction come true but then when you get past all that kind of the bells and whistles of it all you have to ask you know then we really want to do this and\nThere's an even deeper question that I raised in the book and that is with all the genetic engineering were doing and you know the extent these the extinction efforts are do come under the category of genetic engineering\nWhy we're doing in is something that's never been done before\nAnd that is we are elevating recessive trade\nAnd we're gonna traits in other words we're flying in the face of the very forces that have created these

you don't don't mess with Mother Nature or something like that\nYeah it's not nice to you and I was not nice do Mother Nature\nThat one yeah it's not nice I forget what it was Russia was margarine I it was very mired in for a merger and right yeah I mean we all know margarine is not so great for that exactly but\nYou gotta wonder that because we are doing this we now have the ability of elevating

to science you know billions of years of evolution right where we do that if we take it on or who was going to be the casualty I'm thinking we are\nNow you know this is the ultimate question and I I mean you know I was reading the DEA extinction thing and\nI'm not sure that if they brought back quote unquote a wooly mammoth what we really wouldn't have is just a wooly your elephant\nYou know but much in the same way that we have a sweeter orange right where we have a a a a ... year peach or something that people do by\nFlipping genetic codes around here there and I'm not saying that that

that I think you will love hear the story of demand from the train\nAs scary as that story is um it's still not as scary in some respects as some of the things that are happening in science and that's

then the thing with the pencils\nI I don't know your ... believe me there there's a lot to talk to a and about coming up on coast to coast am and we'll start with Michael\nGuillen who is here the end of life as we know it ominous news from the frontiers of science is his new book but you might know him better from an ABC News or from the History Channel where he hosts the show or from his other books including a novel they'll know prophecy a he's in LA guy or you are you a dodger's\nFan Michael well uh you know what I grew up rooting for the Dodgers are but I spent a lotta years in Boston\nAnd Harvard day of my son was born in ... and I don't know kind of caught between a rock and I are [laughter] I understand that that's why I asked at a at a later on a\n... you are obviously you you achieve great heights both in academia and in media and you are amongst I think in the lead group\nOf science\nReporters people who actually write nonfiction about science in into very accessible way or we put you in the same category as Mary Roach are you a fan of hers\n[noise] you know I I I'll be honest with you I'm not familiar with Mary\nRoach oh you're missing missing a lot to really tell me and you know she's a she's a frequent guest you're in the very very entertaining and she writes I'm always about science and so she lives to explore particular subjects and\nSo her book on for example what happens to the body after we die called stiff or ... or packing for Mars in which you talked to she tried to learn what we like to go to Mars and all the things that would happen and she just I Love it\nYou know she's great and you'd really like her in this kind of ... it was reminiscent to me a little bit on how you were getting into the subjects because you handle it with a very\nUm [noise] a very non scholastic approach it's the science is there but you know anybody can follow these stories in everybody probably should if you want to get a glimpse into what the future is all about the students to be a great gift for\nFor Christmas if you if you have a a young scientist and you're on your list some urban old scientist for that matter but looking ahead you know I have you pardon the pun I was just talking about Larry King and he was he was talking about he he believes he's a big believer\nIn cryogenic [noise] yeah yeah a lot you know there's also that famous baseball connection with you Ted Williams family in ... but I mean I what what\nIs the science these days on something like that and how realistic is this would disappear for somebody like Larry King do hope that he would be able to come back again and take his place behind home plate in\nThe few huh [laughter]\nWell first of all thank you for the kind words I I have spent my entire life communicating science I Try to make it as interesting as I can you know I spent fourteen years at\nA ABC News as you indicated good morning America twenty twenty Nightline and you know you have to you have to make things interesting or they'll give you the hook basically [laughter] uh I've kind of cut my teeth on that\nAs far as cryogenic says concerned you know it's interesting you bring that up and I've covered the cryogenic story over the years ah you know they're in the stories that Walt Disney had his head\nA frozen and ah with with the hope one day of uh of being brought back to life the head being the most important part because it carries our memories or thoughts and so forth and so on\nBut you know I got to be honest with you that's like old school um what I ... in the sense that now with what's going on with robotics and so forth and so it's more likely that um\nWhat Larry King is going to want to do is you know before he kicked the can uh you know he's going to want to upload all his thoughts and memories or onto a super computer and then downloaded onto a very realistic robot so\nThat Larry King [laughter] can ah can remain behind home plate you know indefinitely into the future but I'm Serious\nYou know in in my book um the end of life is you know what I deal with these four big topic areas or the first is the worldwide Web the second is an artificial intelligence robots that third it has to do with privacy and surveillance technology and the fourth has to deal with genetic engineering so\nBetween genetic engineering and artificial intelligence robots man I'm telling you Larry King is going to be around for a long long\nAnd I was reading some of those sanctions and I thought that was interesting because there really as you said when he was very I think you mentioned like ... once the book and there's not a big emphasis on it\nBut there is still this hope that people have about preserving their essence and and then that becomes a course a full debate about what we're is the seat of the essence of us you know we used to think the soul was the heart and the head contained all of the you know the the computer works but\nBut you do you how realistic is it ever in any near future that we would be able to upload thoughts in dreams like you might expect from Minority Report being able to capture them and then put them into something else\n[noise] I think it's very real or in I mean you know and and and you indicated about the my book being about the future but but the truth of it is it's it's\nReally about what's going on right here and right now even as we speak and ... and labs all over the world uh I tell for example the story of Iran mosque or being very very involved well you know he's involved in driverless cars who's involved in outer space and going to Mars and\nFor ourselves a world that can either be grim or great\nAnd so I think one of the things that can help steer us one way or the other is to call upon the fruits of human spirituality out for many many years I was pretty much an atheist and the sense that all I cared about was science I grew up in east LA\nWith the dream of becoming a scientist since the second grade really\nAnd that dream took me to UCLA then on to Cornell where I got my PHD in physics and astronomy and then as I said on the Harvard where I taught physics for about eight or nine years and so\nIt was during my grad school years at Cornell when I started asking myself how does this universe that I've been studying come to be an expert in the wisdom and Buddhism and a Islam and transcendental meditation and Judaism\nAnd finally um I met this girl this girl came into my life and she challenged me to read the Bible and I was interested I was like five or not I I just thought it was just too familiar to prosaic\nBut anyway it's changed but it was a game changer for me I don't want to get into all of it so I have become a man of faith faith I'm a\nChristian and I take my face very very seriously and so when I say\nWe need to call upon the fruits of human spirituality I'm Talking about ethics morality religion ancient wisdom whatever your faith system is I I don't particularly care even if you're an atheist phase system there are some innovations in this book\nThat I think we need to reflect on and say okay just because we can do this stuff should\nWe then that's where we go with the next pitch the classic study so much so that the pope rodents fetus at ... on it just because we can should we will find out what's on Michael ... list next on coast to

thing I don't want your house payment to be much more than a force of your take home pay is about a third of your take on by today but I think when I had my four oh one K. back in your ... on this four oh one K. it sounds like\nSo I'm going to temporarily stop the four oh one K. your house is not the problem you're toys or your problem and your student loan as your problem\nA hundred thousand dollars worth of toys when you make Seventy five thousand dollars a year as backward\nGuy because they're all going down in value shouldn't have toys stuff was wheels and motors that add up to more than about fifty percent of your take on gay or fifty percent of your income now you did just cut your income down substantially when mom I came home I got that part\nBut still you were over you were at a hundred percent even when she was working\nSo you got too much tied up and things going down in value that's a bigger problem than your houses and you're staring down the barrel of a fifty thousand dollar debt that you need to clear I Would say you ought to clear that and\nIt's probably gonna take you three years in the setting if you stop everything vacations eating out and for one gays and sell a toy or to it's probably still gonna take a weapon on which way you sell but um you know I'm getting all this debt\nBecause it hasn't benefitted you number one number\nTwo I'm getting out but even if it had benefitted you even if you've got a fifty thousand dollar you were raised because of it I use that fifty thousand to clear that that the first thing first order of business but I really don't think your house was the problem I probably would sell some toys\nA no no I Would sell some toys I shouldn't say that so lightly um that's where your problem is you've got too much invested in depreciating assets\nAnd on your houses it's generally OK I temporarily would stop my four oh one K. and I would beat on this debt with a hammer until it's gone\nBut I Want you to do once you're rolling stock and stuff with motors and it to be less than half your annual income now if you say your income coming up very dramatically in a very short order and you want to hold a couple of these toys or something that's fine but still you need to keep it around fifty percent or less\nA because you just got too much juice tied up and stuff that's going the wrong way it's all going down you look up and that hundred thousand dollars were stuff can be worth fifty thousand about a blink of an eye\nAnd then scratch your head and wonder why you're broke you know you got stuff going the wrong way so yeah I I think you I'm probably got a pass on something that you\nWe were going to show which was the house and you got surprised by me Sonya toys but uh you know whatever you want their toys but that's what I Would do if I woke up in your shoes and oh by the way\nI'm a boat in a car guy I like anything with a motor and it just about but that but the problem with all of it is it goes down in value\n[noise] and so it needs to be a small percentage\nOf your world Rob is with us in Bend Oregon Hi Rob how are you\nKnow great Dave thank you so much for all the stuff you and your

don't do all the work I have people have people doing the work for me\nCool that's better than you are just doing all the work and owning your job I got you okay right very gray\nSo now I'm going to land not now I Hope to work on your business not just in it okay good\nRight and so when it comes to compensation for the employees is it better to give them more money or or benefits or how do you balance that\n[noise] well when your brand new and small you don't have a lot of choices the benefits of are ridiculously expensive\nAnd so um you know like for instance health insurance when when you have less than ten people you can buy health insurance cheaper than you can for them okay and so I'd rather just get more money and let them do what do they want to with it or they buy health insurance through their spouses work\nRight attaches to that for all that kind of like ... different benefits are very difficult for the business without that are twenty people are less but you can give them other benefits that are not corporate tied benefits like treating them good like tree in my family being there when the baby is\nGoing to the ... or send them flowers or the grandmas funeral and you can treat them like human beings we don't get treated that way\nAmerica this is that Iran [noise]\nLet me tell you a story about two families that are very much alike and a lot of ways both families have two working parents in a couple of young kids each is dead and the struggle to make ends meet but they're starting to make headway with their budgets and smarter decisions with money\nThey have dreams and plans and the only real differences that one family is the right amount of term life insurance and the other doesn't\nBig difference if one of the parents die\nAnd that does happen their wellbeing would be destroyed\nPaying for the mortgage utilities food and other bills would be impossible let alone saving for education or retirement that's why every day I talk

Would do is stop the baby steps and pile up cash if we get wind that he's really going to get laid off how much I'm noticed do they usually give him if he's laid off [noise]\nUm [noise] I don't it's

I fall asleep on all our\nFamily members I'm In the process of switching my wife and out of term insurance ... what are we do with our three kids whole life policies should we keep it as is change it to term or cancel it altogether cancel it all together\nIf you need life insurance on the child it would only be enough for what we call final expenses God Forbid a funeral\n[noise] and\nTen Fifteen twenty thousand bucks as a child rider on your term policy would cover that if you want to cover that if you've got an emergency fund and within Fifteen or twenty thousand dollars in it I Would self insured through that\nChildren we love them they're precious they're everything they do not create financial benefit\n[noise] while most often\nI had a friend who had a kid a diaper commercial he created financial benefit but most of the time kids costs money they don't make money\nAnd so our goal is to take care of them not for their passing to take care of us\nAnd so the only cost you would want to cover it would be God Forbid and the event you lost a child would be a final expenses cost and you usually have an emergency fund if you're following our steps in Europe the baby step three to do that and you won't need to do that\nWhen you're switching you're so I'm cancel the whole lack policies on kids they're sold to you as a college benefit but your child will never see the front door

pretty sad will hear from the owner there and drama at the Birmingham City council meeting\nThe other stories anymore and ...\nThere was a shocker right thank you Lee appreciate your J Reynolds joins us now from day treats on dot com to take a look at our money and the market overall I think this since the president's been in office J uh we've seen the marks do pretty well but uh\nIt dropped off a little bit now and and the fed continues to kind of take the heat on that so what's going on and where are we this morning\nWell where the futures are pointed up about Ninety points which is good but you're right there's been a lot of focus on the fed and in part of that is because of Canada return of volatility or to the market or you know I've talked over the years about the volatility or fear index\nI'm a ticker symbol is V. as in Victor high acts it's not a stock you can buy or sell but it's an indication of\nHow concerned investors are over the next thirty days and over the last you know pretty much this month it's been up considerably sometimes up as much as Seventy percent\nBut we're seeing swings on the day where the market might be down to ... percent up three percent down one percent and we're seeing this back and forth volatility a lot of people are asking why and right now a lot of people are pointing a finger at the fed and especially the trumpet administration saying that they continue to\nRaise interest rates and they're kind of blaming them for what's taking place and look as you know I'm a big fan of the president I like most of his policies I really don't understand the why were pointing a finger at the fair they told us last December what they were going to do this year\nThey're simply following along with that pre determined playing and they're trying to stay ahead of you know the growth of this economy\n... when it all started to you know what's the timing of where it began\nIf you look when the volatility index picked up it was the first weekend of this month October fifth uh and then on the eight and if you look at a calendar to see what was going on in the country that was dominating the news that week it was the Brett Kavanaugh\nA Supreme Court mess and I I think that is Wall Street was looking ahead at the mid term elections\nThere in a pretty good idea which way things weren't going to go one way or another I suspect they may have thought that the Democrats were going to be looking at taking back some of the seats and you know Wall Street could care less who wins the election they're going to position their players accordingly and go from there\nBut when that happened there was such a response from the Republican side of things\nThat I think that really cast doubt on the mid term elections and I think that's one of the factors among many\nThat helped to interject a lot of volatility or uncertainty into this market because now all of a sudden you don't know which way things are going to be going in the midterms and if it's one thing that you and I know Wall Street cannot stand hits uncertainty and a lot of people are saying it has to do with a lot of other factors but when you look at the timing of what it all started\nOther than the you know the September jobs report that came out on that friday the fear\nThat showed up on employment at his lowest rating fifty years that's the week that everything started going crazy and it could very well be the case\nWhere a very good Jay ... campaign to James Alabama's morning news with GT is only on Birmingham local news trafficking whether

very exciting ah like I said we need we need more than ... ... just to kind of feel some of this a void here so I Know this will be a full service that venue is not just going to be\nNow there'd be like one of those ... bases where you can host of it they will be a um it will be a just like some of our other bigger projects it will be a full service than you\nI Hope they keep parking in mind on his well you'd seven hundred and fifty people in that area all of a sudden street space and started to run out\nLetters are All right let's take a look and see what's happening here with the Alabama posting some big increases in employment in the workforce\nYeah this is a very big news I mean if you look at our history coming back from the recession I mean our our job growth has been kind of modest uh over the years we haven't really had a lot of sustained just large scale success or starting to see that change over the past thirty a past twelve months we've got thirty five thousand jobs in the state\nUh now on the interesting side that that is the number of employed unemployed individuals on the state or it has also been a rise in the past twelve months but if you look at the closure that's not really that bad of a thing and the reason is because our workforce is growing and that's something that economists have been saying it very very critical for the state over the past year workforces up more than forty two thousand people\nA that's a good time we have a severe workforce challenge here in Alabama and that's a that a lot of states are facing but we need more people in the workforce and it looks like we're starting to see that we're starting to see some people who maybe were out of the workforce coming back in\nThat's a very very positive signs so it's not really that concerning to see the number of unemployed people that given those trends but when you combine it with the increase of ... with an employment increase in the workforce\nThat very positive and looking at here what's happening in Birmingham we've added about twelve thousand jobs are ourselves in the metro area over the past year which is another positive time we did that we're doing that are pretty
