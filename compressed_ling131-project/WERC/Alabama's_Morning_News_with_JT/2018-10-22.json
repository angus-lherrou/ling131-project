over the weekend and are talking about this invasion is coming from our southern border he's\nBlaming Democrats for lack of progress on immigration reform the Democrats don't care that a flood of illegal immigration\nWell bankrupt our country and joining us now builds up for our correspond has been following what's happening with this massive caravan of migrants coming our way and it doesn't look like they're stopping and it's growing every place they go they're picking up more and more what are we up to now nearly ten thousand bill\nYeah some estimates habit as high as ten thousand people J. T. and uh the big bulk of this group is now in southern Mexico we all saw the pictures all over the weekend up them accumulating at that bridge between Guatemala and Mexico are they became impatient\nWith the process there Mexico was trying to uh rent the asylum\nTo process to as many people as possible but many people ended up either swimming a rafting across that river even push down fences to get across and now they are in southern Mexico where ... Mexican authorities have now I started a a a new technique here J. T. they started putting buses along the route\nTelling them that look anytime you're ready jump on the bus will take you to the asylum processing center a but to many people have been unwilling to do that saying that it'll just result in them being sent back to their home country so uh there are many who still say we're going to continue on until we get to the United states which is still over a thousand miles away\nYeah when you claim asylum it's not a process where you're allowed to choose the country you want to go to it's like you leave your country that you don't like and you got to find the nearest port to get into and that's it it's not like hey I'm On my way to the United states through two or three different countries admit correct\nWell ah what Mexico has done in the past a kind of a enabled them to go to the United states and seek asylum because what they would do is they would grant them safe passage\nPermits meaning they could travel through Mexico and get to the United states and request asylum so uh it's been a problem with Mexico as well however\nThey seemed to be getting their act together a little bit but they are truthfully overwhelmed JT they don't have the staff they don't have the ability to handle a you know thousands of people at the same time crowding ports of entry while\nWe certainly do and the president has discussed sending our military down there when you see ten thousand people coming our way it's like an almost invasion of troops coming into this country and weeding out criminals they say they're trying to do that through this process that has malarkey horse you know that's just crazy the I think they can do that so any discussions on the president\nFulfilling that promised about sending in military to these\nKnow our borders yeah there are there\nHave been discussions about this or the president talking to his advisors about it and it's still a ways off because uh they like I said this group as a thousand at least a thousand miles away from the border and it'll be a while before they get there an JT what Honduras Guatemala and Mexico have been unable to do\nMother Nature may have a hand in here because we've got a hurricane about to hit western Mexico a strong hurricane it's north of where the caravan is but what they may run into what conditions they may face down the road\nOr could hamper them as well well I I just pray that does something intervenes here and it turns these people away from our borders in droves just like they're coming our direction there's this is going to be this could get very ugly pretty quick here because these people\nThey are playing right into the Democrat's hand the Democrats are sending pregnant women what these what these crazy people that are trying to rush our border here this is going to turn into a big political move\nHere right up close to the uh you know the terms ear oh look at the president now pregnant women being taken away and put in cages I can hear the dialogue right now\nAbsolutely and there is no easy answer for the president I mean either way if he puts military troops down to the border he'll take some criticism for that but\nUh something we'll have to be done because this could be this could end up being similar to what you see in Turkey near Syria where you have just up thousands and thousands of ah of migrants try to get across the border was set up camps and you know we don't want that situation\nWhile the dialogue that needs to be a lot there's a legal way to come into this country and there's an illegal way to do it and the president needs to get the rhetoric out there let's show the footage right now what it looks like in Europe when the open borders policy was put in play\nAnd it's not working criminals come into the country and this is unbelievable how many people are doing this this was well organized and I guarantee of the Democrats had a big hand in this the president also said listen I got a solution for
