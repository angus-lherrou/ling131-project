happened we just junk going to allow the process to move forward ...\nUnfold joining us now bills in far correspond has been on this story as well as what's happening at the border first on this one or bill I'll tell you what still we really don't know much about exactly what happened do we\nKnow we don't and Mike Pompeo was playing it very close to the best in his comments yesterday and\nAnd he should be because ah ... you know one\nA little detail one way or the other could really inflamed the situation and a valuable alliance that we have with Saudi Arabia and it's a very delicate situation now one thing I thought was interesting you didn't mention at all yesterday the Turkish investigation they seem to be leading this investigation into the disappearance suppose a death ...\nAh he talked about the Saudi investigation so\nUh you know there are those that say if if we are depending on the Saudis to investigate themselves I\nI I'm not sure what are the conclusion will be but I think that bump pale is strictly playing this close to the vest he didn't give us any idea exactly what uh what is going on or what he heard from the Saudis or the Turks\nWhile as palm pale wrap it up he is now headed down to Mexico to discuss what's happening with this massive\nCaravan of folks headed towards the board of the president yesterday threatening to shut down the border has to\nSee what's happening with the border where people are coming up in ... and we have to stop them even though the laws of terror was a terrible our laws are terrorists laughing stock all over the world and we're supposed to stop people with\nLaws that are in very good will window than anybody else could possibly even saying that\nThere's no doubt about a bill that the Democrats are to blame they have this whole thing about the Letterman or their ... their votes I mean who are we to be mean at the border here\nAt president even said that yeah the Dems are to blame on this\nThing I wanted to do that and in order to get that done because the Democrats will vote for the military they don't like the military and they don't like law enforcement you know like borders\nI think he may send military bill a you know I hear a lot of people say that would be horrible\nThat'd be that awful law that we'd have with the military at our borders were not one of those types of countries well you've seen the photos and the video of all these caravans of folks coming our way it's going to be ugly\nThe numbers are pretty incredible JT when you look at it in September over forty one thousand to undocumented immigrants apprehended at the border of the August ... numbers were almost thirty eight thousand of this caravan ... would we have coming up now four thousand which pales in comparison to those numbers for a September in August\nSo there are an awful lot of undocumented immigrants showing up at the U.S border now as the president put out the message loud and clear\nIt looks like Mexico however\nHas a plan or that they are now going to ask the un high commissioner for refugees to help out in this situation and you really have to wonder\nWhy the un hasn't been involved in this before so they are going to be requested to get involved here are set up shelters along the southern Mexico border to try to meet these people as they get in those who have valid visas will be allowed through those who do not do not qualify will be turned back and sent to their country of origin\nSo a a a plan sounds good whether it can actually be followed through on remains to be seen that's why palm pales going down there\nYou know and we act like they've got decent border security and Mexico on their southern border I mean from what I understand it's pretty weak as far as security goes ... bridge and a couple of rivers and they don't do a lot to stop these folks from Guatemala and Honduras and El Salvador so\nHas pumped pay on our president to discuss this they want and Mexico to date take charge get these people away from our border because if they get to our border the military may be standing there waiting for them isn't it amazing though the timing of all of this that\nAs these people walk and drive their caravans that they might get to our border oh look the day before election\n... it is pretty amazing the timing on this whole thing one other thing that Mexico has done here and cooperation J. T. or they have agreed that if people do are able to evade all of these things they do they want to set up and get to the U.S border\nThe United states can now turn them around and say go back whereas in the past we had to let them across had to hold them detained them until their cases could be adjudicated here now Mexico was saying go ahead turn them around\n... well I Can't wait to see what happens on this and I hope the president does stand firm with the military and our Bill thanks so much of a good weekend six Seventeen Alabama's morning news a few good games in the SEC this week it will take a look berets leap from CBS Sports joins us next Alabama's morning news\nHas decisions on how those\nClouds so to see we'll\nHave your jury for gas on Halloween more anytime\n[noise] one use radio one oh by the mom rule\nThat was on the line and this year's election [noise] this is just as Tom Parker\nYou also how the left his mom's trying to tear down just as Kevin\nThey want me to be next after for Thirteen Years on the Alabama Supreme Court has a strong independent conservative voice has taken on beating the Southern Poverty Law Center and been outspoken that ruby weighed in on murder of them were wrongly decided [noise]\nAnd I'm a strong supporter of President Trump and his efforts to put more conservatives on our federal courts to left his mom doesn't like\nThey want judges who overturn our laws and look the other way when the left his mom tries to destroy ... this is just as Tom Parker\nFor chief justice I'm asking for your vote to keep Alabama's gorgeous place where the rule of law was respected and not where the mom root\nChief justice mocks lemonade pre to Montgomery three six one one one [noise]\nSee as just warehouse for oil changes new shocks to know spray jobs best prices on brand name passenger in my truck tires and more every thing to keep your car running better as does warehouse tires Hoover end Gardendale\nTires save money and maybe this is going to hire log on to make those higher dot com\nTrafficking whether together in one minute on news radio one oh five five that what you we are seeing a\nFour by friends of David ... twenty five thirty to cross a place to stay the hills Alabama three five to six\nThe choices clear for house just been forty seven on November sixth Republican David we learn David has a long track record of leadership and his professional career ending his civic community and political endeavors now David Wheeler wants to take that leadership to Montgomery as pressure on the Alabama Republican Party David we stood up to corruption\nLeading the effort to force my cupboard just stepped down as speaker and Robert been linked to resign as governor David will vie to expand\nVocational training to create a more skilled workforce for Alabama and he will ensure our teachers and parents who set our children's curriculum not Washington and David Wheeler is a pro business consensus builder who wants to reform government vote Republican David Wheeler for house district forty seven this Republican day because I care about\nThe picture was perfect the ring was perfect\nYour significant other will love it do to diamonds direct today it's your choice the basic mounting that's free to the most intricate designs available today thousands of choices you will not find anywhere else dimes direct celebrating ten years is Birmingham direct diamond in poor mountain brook in ... village\nJoined the most colorful conversation it's not going to be a blue wave it is going to be a red suit nominees radio one oh five five WBRC\n[noise] six thirty news radio one oh five five WBRC I'm Jay too that mysterious illness that resembles polio maybe here in Alabama leaders got more in just a minute but first trafficking whether together here's captain Karl\nRove to a good start this morning the weather is not a problem so far things are moving great if you're heading up sixty five\nThrough Shelby County up through Hoover and home would\nFor fifty nine moving okay no delays on high twenty two leads iron Dale fifty not do trust will look good as well\nIf you're getting started around ...

congressman or I Want to talk to you about\nThese midterm elections that are right around the corner what are we four weeks away here now and that you talk about the blue wave versus the red wave and who's going to show up who's more fired up and you know I'm looking at everything that the president has done and the country is really\nOn an upward swing it economically with jobs with protection a I Can't understand how you find fault with anything this president's doing and all the Democrats seem to be offering or just resist and hate no matter what forget the fact that I'm getting more money in my paycheck forget that my family is going to be safer because he wants to protect our borders\nForget the economic growth it's going to really improve my neighborhood march city\nWhat are the Democrats bring houses possibly going to be a blue wave I don't think it is a blue\nWave yeah this was a choice between results on one side and resistance on the other ... between people are trying to bring order back to America and people that want chaos\nIn the American people don't want resistance they don't want chaos\nNow here's the big problem there to problems the first one is a national news media is against him and we can't win that fight that just the way it is they're going to be against us no matter what we do they go and find a way to make the other side look good and make us look bad the second problem is if you look at how much money's being spent\nWe've got three hundred million more dollars against our democratic candidates we have against Republican candidates\nThey they've got a a an enormous amount of money over a billion dollars that they're spending the cycle we're spending seven hundred Maine which sounds like an enormous amount of money to me but it's three hundred million less than the Democratic got more\nAnd remember it's focus so we're not saying that money in Alabama because we're a red state right so all that money is being focused into these other purple states and so some of my colleagues are being bombed by money but even with that\nOur polls not the stuff you were saying the national news me that they're pushing their narrative right our polls are holding up now we're in some tough fights I'm not going to make light of it\nBut our guys are fighting ... really strong fights are waging good campaigns and their polling is starting to look up in the last couple of weeks and I think it's the Kavanaugh effect\nFrom your constituents how much do you hear about health care [noise]\nAnd I hear about health care from people who've I've been hearing from for the last five years who are dealing with the incredibly increased costs for their premium them for their out of pocket costs for deductibles and the light and they want us to fix something\nNow what's happened with the Democrats is is there ... Democrats even in my district become to come after me and say oh you're trying to get rid of protections for people with preexisting conditions which is not true I mean that just a ball face law\nSo we've got to make sure that we're putting out their appropriate statement of the facts now here's what they want they want Medicare for all Medicare in its present circumstances is running out of money and you know years\nSo they want to take a program that's running out of money that our seniors are dependent upon and blow it up without any more money or I guess they've got some planning puts more money but they're going to put an enormous amount of money into it\nIt's not going to work well you know both that ain't nothing free you know if I had heard somebody said hey free lasagna for the next three hours I'm getting in line\nBut that ain't freeze somebody's paying for that you know so yeah I agree that the the plan but the socialist in the left part of the Democratic party is offering about free this and free that is a total disaster at the end of that once if in fact even ... you know him you know get that implemented\nWell what they want to do is to take the tax reform plan we did last year we cut everybody's taxes in reverse that [laughter] and then take that money and put it into a program that still won't have enough money into it to take care like I say our seniors and put their money in this program for years\nWhile Republicans really need to get something going with a plan for health care we couldn't get it done yeah first go round but I think we got to come up with some we got it done in the house yeah it it it just got hung up in the Senate and at the late Senator McCain\nAll right well speaking of the Senate you run a percentage there and I'm thinking about it are you thinking about it we don't have to make any official announcement here not quite yet and I'm not quite right but ... I'll be honest with you I've been traveling around the side I'm In Birmingham today right now we're talking about\nThese issues and a talking with people about my disappointment a lot of people's disappointment with senator Jones yeah I mean he voted against judge you have an aunt or his ... for the Senate was for gun control he voted against the pain capable abortion bill which means he wants a\nPeople to get an abortion even after twenty weeks I mean he doesn't match up with mainstream Alabama\nAnd I think we need to give an alternative I Wish you the best and if you decided to go that route thank you ...

impartial media and you know historically you've never had a totally impartial media but that they're in our past there have always been\nA reliably\nUm accurate reporters are people who who took seriously that responsibility and I'm not sure how many of those we have any more particularly in the mainstream media\nReally has changed a worst I've ever seen I think\nIt's a in a representative or a republic ... which is what we are ...\nAre the people who were represents and government or the way the media handles things and I think it's it has become dangerous and it it they have got to the point where they incite people rather than unite people\nAre inciting violence now you've seen what's happened with Ted Cruz and others that are attacked in public I mean no matter where you go if you're a Republican or do anything to support the ... you know the president's agenda you get screened it I mean look what happened with the cabinet confirmation process\nWhat happened to us on the
