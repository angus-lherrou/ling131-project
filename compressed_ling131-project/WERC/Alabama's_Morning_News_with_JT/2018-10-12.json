there's ... died a little bit more on ... and just a minute for joining smell build them for [noise] talk more about what's happening in Turkey bill good morning\nHey good morning Jake two yeah we got a couple of things going on here that we could have developments on today a number one not the case of the American pastor Andrew Brunson who's been held on terrorism charges since that coup attempt in twenty sixteen he's in court now and\nCould be released today in Turkey of course we'd been working on this one for a while and there have been reports NBC reported that there had been a deal made that brunch and could be released today and some charges against him drop in exchange for the U.S easing economic pressure that included some sanctions on turkey so that could be\nIn the words as we speak well wait and see if\nWe all have to kind of caution with that because you know there were some other negotiations were going on that kind of collapsed at the last minute so you know I I think it's a toss the coin with what's going to happen with this guy\nYeah uh to me it looks like we ... it ... were very optimistic about this happening right a button but you're right Jay too you have to take this as it comes because before we been on the verge of this and and things kind of evaporated at the very end\nA couple of ah you know international stories for turkey right now you've got bad one with the pastor now they are Turkish officials say they've got uh some evidence that or this or Washington Post contributor was in fact murdered and chopped up\nYeah and they say they have a hard evidence meaning that they have recordings of the murder of ... within the consulate in Istanbul when Jamal cause Yogi went to that consulate in Turkey the Saudi constantly in order to get the paperwork to marry a Turkish woman\nA week we saw the surveillance video of him going in the Turkish officials now say they have recordings of the actual murder now in a lot of consulates around the world\nHost countries will place listening devices in there that could be secret a covert operations they may have to reveal that they have done this here but that they may have hard evidence that he was murdered inside this consulate\nBut tell you the turkey has a great opportunity to come out smelling like a rose in both of these international situations and they also have the option of going the other direction on this as well so in the balance a couple of different international stories involving turkey\nWhile all that's going on Kanye West went to the White House and speak with our president uh\nOh I Love this listen to this where he says that the Trump it makes them feel like Superman\nI have a lot of mail energy and my home\nAnd also a ... a\nMale energy doing all that beautiful\nBut there's a time where you know something about [noise] you know\nJust made me feel that the guy that he didn't get to see my dad all the time like\nThat was it was something about when I\nOff and they feel like Superman made a Superman I was ... the hero\nBut [laughter] ... is an interesting character and I got to tell you he is really upset in the Democratic party is I mean\nOh my gosh why are they are the rent yesterday by Kanye is a memorable one for a number of reasons but yeah the Democrats are upset about this that\nAre such a display would be made in the oval office or the White House you know what the premise of this gathering Jake he was a good idea for the president uh I was supposed to be a forum on policy issues like a prison reform violence in inner cities like Chicago and manufacturing gang influence and such\nAnd and they did touch on some of those issues problem was with Kanye West yeah he touches on those issues but as quickly off to something else as we heard yeah I think\nKanye West is a a good guy to having Trump's corner he is a very very big in the black community is also I mean super international star but I'll tell you what a he's got these Democrats squirm and then you know they used to love them and now they have in fact\nSome democratic strategist believe that a county is actually a pretty good thing when it comes to the president's influence in the black community a dying or Janine rather Braley who's a democratic strategist told Fox News that\nDemocrats now he Kenya because he isn't telling the party line\nPresident Trump is a disruptor in the political world Kanye is a disruptor what the Democrats monopoly on black voters\nThat is why you have Democrats like Maxine Waters saying that ... and shut up because the space out of turn when you look at the policies that are helping Americans and helping black families this is what the Democrats don't want black voters to understand this is why the Democrats have Kanye West they loved him\nBefore he supported President Trump and they don't want to talk about how\nA black on employment is at six percent how the roll back in taxes and regulations are lifting all boat and how they were more job opportunities in our country then there are people to fill them and that is why they are demonizing and criticizing Kanye West because he supports President Trump\nYup and I'm telling you what has to walk away from a lot of folks these days especially in\nThe black community where jobs are looking good of the the the income is looking good tax reform itself to all of our paychecks so yeah Mm she nailed it didn't see them at six Eighteen Alabama's morning news big event coming up a week from tonight\nBalkan park museum spirits cars and cigars were going to be

P. joining now Kevin\nLanding in our movie critic take a look at three movies opening up this weekend Kevin good morning let's start with goose bumps to is this a kids movie or can everybody enjoy\nHe I think everybody can enjoy this JT you know a lot of folks like the goose bumps book series and this is\nThe second of the movies made from that Jack Black in the heck is RL Stein it is the author of the books and so what did you get the movie basically the kids find the books they open the book Dr Read the book the characters in the books come\nOut of the books and they come alive and so that's what happens here and there is a two boys that I get a hold of one of ... books they open it up as about Halloween and slap a character in the book comes I kind of creepy all sort of thing\nAnd he decides he wants to family so he kidnapped one of the boys bombs and then he gets the which is involved in it gets all that kind of how do we need stuff going on it you know so if you liked the first one again this is a similar Hollywood not coming up with a brand new idea it's a little creepy for the average kid\nThat goes a little bit dark but it's a PG movie and so yeah the Jack Black is always is always entertaining to watch this kind of\nAre a very good another movie opening up this weekend about Neil Armstrong the ash movie called first man do you like it\nI Do like a day and that's when I got a little feel to it this is based on the book\nA first man the life of LA Armstrong written by\nJames Hansen who is a professor here at Auburn University so he's got a kind of a local legend he's also co producers for the film but this is Steven Spielberg movie that just kind of tells a story you know Armstrong was a kind of a recluse she didn't folks didn't go on they didn't know much of a story and so this is the one interview on the one a book\nThat's been written about him with his permission and it's pretty intriguing character we all know the astronauts were kind of all different\nFlamboyant lifestyles well didn't but if you're a lot of those other guys and tells what got to take the Gemini program and it takes you on into the Apollo in the moon landing and those kind of things and it's a great historic look and very factual and I thank God I think folks will enjoy this movie\nExcellent I'm Glad to hear that I I I really like a kind of looking at in the background you know people are done great things and uh you know what their life is all about so looking forward to that one and the third one to take a look at it this weekend a bad times at the el royale now I this looks a little rough kind of a Quentin Tarantino movie but there's something about that\nDraws me in like I really wanted to go see it as any good\nIt is that kind of a movie ... and I watch the trailer you go okay this can be a supernatural or film or this could be you know but what it really is is you got seven strangers who end up at this hotel that it's an old rundown place on the border of Nevada and California\nAnd the seven strangers all have their own story you know you've got a vacuum cleaner sales and he got the desk clerk and he got the priest you got some criminals and you know and they're all they're together they all got a backstory this kind of their one shot at redemption when they show up at this hotel\nAnd they just kind of go bad to worse and and that's Jeff Bridges does a brilliant job in this one as well as the Dakota Jon Benet Jon Hamm great acting so yeah it it is a ... it's an R. movie it is an art plus movie there's no doubt\nThat this is going to be a harsh watch you're right it it ...\nWell Quentin Tarantino feeling at the end and Wes Anderson kind of came together on this is what you're going to get so it it is it is it is a thriller uh it got the mystery to it it's\nVery much in art house type of film so that's what you got this weekend for more on these or other movies that are out today\nGo check out Kevin the movie I thought how
