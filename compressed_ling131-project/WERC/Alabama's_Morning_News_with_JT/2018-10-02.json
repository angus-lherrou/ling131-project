NAFTA with an incredible new U.S Mexico Canada agreement called us MCA\nAbsolutely looking good uh they're redoing everything into it is going to be much better I'm much more even killed for everybody involved just like the president is trying to do with the terrorists and the trades around the world joining us now builds imprinted talk a bit more about this morning bill so what does this mean now for American industry in businesses\nWell there's a couple of big things involved in this number one is the uh the dairy aspect of this American farmers American dairy farmers will have more access\nTo the Canadian market are so much so that Canadian farmers are up in arms over there saying they were thrown under the bus by the Canadian government in order to get this deal done so it's good news for American dairy farmers and as far as the automotive industry goes improvements here because\nUh right now are under NAFTA sixty two and a half percent of the cars value had to be made in North America right now that goes up to Seventy five percent plus\nOr at least thirty percent of the labor involved in manufacturing a car must be done by employees making at least sixteen dollars an hour or here's the thing on that American workers make over sixteen dollars an hour auto workers\nAre but in Mexico that is three times the prevailing wage down there are also either hey you're going to have to pay them much more or be and but the more likely scenario\nThose jobs are going to come back to the United states which is which is good news for this country so overall I think any time you get to have an agreement with your two major trading partners and your neighbors to the north and south that's a good thing and you get a benefit for American workers and farmers as well\nYeah I think jobs it would improve the American jobs for sure and I think once you get the agreement like this with Canada and Mexico a when it comes to the trade agreements this opens the doors for other discussions and other worldly issues where they're all in the same team to begin with\nIt makes it seem like okay we're friends we can talk about this issue or a bad issue here well\nAbsolutely and one thing that will be talking about is a tariffs on Canadian steel and aluminum exports to the United states that was not dealt with in this deal which was a little surprising but they say that will be addressed elsewhere and and you're right that opens the door for other friendly discussion\nCharlotte's talking about the gas prices now too I don't know if you've been noticing but they seem to be climbing up a little bit here I mean summer's over you would think that All right everybody's back to school vacation travel is done but are they are kind of hovering a little bit higher than they'd been lately\nNot so and there and your Birmingham area there about the highest they've been in four years or ... even though you have the benefit of some lower gas prices many other areas of the country\nAnd there's a there's a good reason for this everybody's looking at oil prices Brent Crude one of the benchmarks is now eighty five dollars a barrel and that could shoot to over a hundred dollars a barrel\nIn a short amount of time this all has to do with Iran and new sanctions that will go into effect on their oil exports beginning on November fourth\nThat's a million and a half barrels of crude a day coming out of Iran the number three OPEC producer or if that is reduced drastically or even disappears as President Trump wants to do that means we're going to see a spike in oil prices and don't look now JT but dead gasoline maybe over three dollars a gallon\nNot again not a good boy I'll tell you what your travel outside the state of Alabama and we went to Tennessee

T. sexual misconduct we've had the extensive history of involvement in legal dispute including a lousy what's your next employer accuser falsifying or college and work history on the job application\nThis is somebody who is completely accustomed\nTo throwing out accusations on some level but also\nHaving a difficult time kind of backing those things up which I felt is exactly what happened when I was interviewed last night difference from what she was saying last night on NBC\nCompared to what she said it her sworn statement earlier that Michael ... to put out so initially whatever that there's nothing that I Can't believe you're even she talks about how she may have actually witness some abuse from judge Kavanaugh at one point in\nTime I saw him Push Girls against walls a human potential stumbling some land to them and knocking into a wall he pushes body against their he would grow them\nYou know with her background a is a witness if there were ... if this were a court case or credibility doesn't seem all that strong based on our past and I'm not sure a judge would allow the attorneys to bring up incidents in her past or just focusing on this particular issue here\nAnd I keep hearing from everybody\nThat is really not buying this whole thing and I just believe that this is the Democratic ploy to keep ... off the bench at all costs\nIn that you know just because they say it doesn't necessarily make it so uh the evidence seems to be what's missing here and all we're hearing\nAre these women that are coming for just saying this is what it is so therefore you need to believe this and therefore he needs to go away what\nI think that's probably reflected here and why the FBI thing they don't want to investigate or on on some level I think they probably been able to see where her background has led and what she's been\n... water related reality reality isn't mind's eye and what it is when she comes out to testify on some level whether it's a business case our case against Kavanaugh saying we just don't want to get involved in that right now\nShe also said last night but she remembers Kavanaugh being a mean drunk\nHe was very aggressive a very sloppy John ... drunk uh I saw him a go up to girls who paw on then try to end you know getting a little Hansi touching them private part\nUm when you look back at a\nBehavior of a kid that was in high school or college in these parties were girls and guys show up in a\nYou know I'm not going to say that this doesn't happen every day at a frat house in any given time cameras across the country ah it aggressively touching women when they don't want to be touched is completely wrong um but\nWhen there's a lot of drinking going on and uh you know let's just call it the guys and girls you know get a little more permission us when they're drinking and innovation start to fall away and things happen and then the next day people sober\nUp and go who may have gone too far is that is to get a little walk a shame in them yeah\nIs that what's going on here or are these people all part of the resistance do you believe at this point looking at this from a distance\nIt's hard to say at this point and it's all it was going to be a little bit on the more difficult than it is it that weren't FBI investigation into her background you would probably get a much clearer picture of what she's lying about where she wasn't involved in things and and what\nMight be definitive at that point otherwise it's just kind of laying out there in weight with just do the history of that but I think the reality here is that I think it's it's it's somebody who believes that they've got some kind of a story and I don't think that they actually can back that up so I think we almost have to kind of light that up and say well that let's go back and focus on things\nThat could be an issue and the FBI I've just got a couple of days left to get that done on Mitch McConnell wants to cast a vote on friday\nWell you know you talk about what people believe to be the truth and if people are delusional and they suffer from them you know that disorder than what they believe is really true to
