Washington Post contributor and the Saudi Arabia a government year President Trump told the media yesterday he's working with a palm pale and bomb pales working with the leadership over there get some answers\nTo change that a vast going to be back probably late tonight or early tomorrow morning but he spent a lot of time with the crown prince and he's going to have a full report and\nPresident also confirmed to the folks here yesterday that he's requested this supposedly the evidence that the Turkish officials have against the Saudi Arabia\nOn video\nUntil it is at the church for his where we've asked for it if it exists\nNo I'm not sure yet that it exists probably does passively does uh I'll have a full report on that from my when he comes back wow\nAnd joining us now builds in for a course one has been following there's so many twists and turns in this thing and uh I don't know if you've heard these inside stories are going on on the torture that took place and\nA one I guess I'm Turkish newspaper they're saying that uh he was tortured in the office of the Saudi Arabians consul general in ...\nI mean this is getting ugly they painted the walls afterwards because apparently blood splatter was everywhere I mean what what do we know for sure yet it doesn't sound like much\nWell we've heard all of these reports including there was one earlier report JT that\nAh after Jamal 'cause she'll be was allegedly dismembered uh and then his body parts were buried in the ... outside the home of the consul general the residents of the consul general in Istanbul of course all of this has yet to be proven in fact there was another late report that maybe ass it was used\nTo get rid of the the body parts I mean there are many many and and as you said there's so many twists and turns in this investigation so far it's hard to figure out at this point what exactly is fact\nAnd what is the speculation on on the part of many people and the fact that we have yet to hear a this audio evidence that turkey says they have also cast\nAnother interesting aspect of this whole thing whether turkey a did indeed get this audio because of illegal surveillance equipment that was inside the Saudi consummate ah so yeah this investigation we should be given\nTo learn more today because Mike Pompeo will check in with the president today they will meet\nTo go over what palm pale learned in his meetings in Saudi Arabia end in Turkey and interesting development there too as well JT in that\nUh my palm pale we saw the pictures of and smiling and shaking hands with that the crown prince and ah apparently the meeting didn't not go ... along those lines that palm pale really pressed him on a on what happened here and said that he's got to own up to it\nIf indeed he was involved and he said he's got to come clean on all this so uh the the measure the response from the United states was maybe a little more heavy handed with my palm pale there\nYeah I'd say a ... a dicey walk because we're not talking about the leaders are you know Syria you're we're talking about the Saudi Arabia officials here and they're supposed ally relationship with the United states in the oil implications and the big money that they're writing checks for to the United states for\nYou know different products and things that we have a agreements set up on so yeah this is this is a big deal here so\nWill the Saudis cooperate with Tom pay on the president because of the relationship or will they develop the attitude that hey you know we're we're big we're big cheese over here too so don't be pushing us around you guys need to walk away from his investigation\nWell what's interesting is this comes at a time JT when Saudi Arabia is in the midst of a new initiative that they call shouting twenty thirty is the brainchild of Mohammed bin Salman the crown prince and it is basically designed to diversify their economy to reduce dependence on oil based economy and go elsewhere\nIn especially tech\nThere was a whole branch of their state oil company now aramco that is dedicated to investing heavily in tech ventures so they are in the midst of this\nThis real uh evolution and their economy and as far as trade goes they want to become the dominant Center for Middle East trade because of their strategic position between the Persian Gulf and read say\nThis could damage that availability to do that and uh as evidence of that next week we're supposed to be this Davos in the desert conference led by again the crown prince is a future investment initiative conference already we have a lot of\nBanking leaders banking officials business officials bailing out of this conference so the ultimate resolution of this investigation and maybe more importantly\nThe U.S reaction to it could really deal a blow to the future plans of Saudi Arabia yeah this whole thing seems to me that we've got the Saudis\nBacked into a corner here and they're going what do we say at this point how do we get out of this thing what what can we possibly say that will save face and level and save the diplomatic relations and the economic potential for that country\nThat they're in a jam right now so yeah more or

know\n[noise] [noise] [noise] affects property values and and kind of\nBrings you point out that maybe some other businesses don't want to be around these types of businesses so it could potentially

stereotypical for doing\nWell do you believe that opening up too many pawn shops and pay the loans stores or it could be a problem for neighborhoods\nLike opening up anything uh too much can be a problem we see that and other businesses I mean we got a lot of vacant storefronts throughout our city and we're actively recruiting businesses to come in to this just seems to be a very broad brush

you've got a lot of a big portion of the community that doesn't\nOne of these stores does that bother you\nWell Jay two issues where they are located or the ... other than that we were considering to we will vote on that put much higher regulation stricter controls on where they\nAre anticipate that ordinance will pass with unanimous consent and get feminine and what it does that will allow us to take a closer look and make sure they're not located and older established neighborhoods like our living it'll put them in a in a district\nWhere it's more commercial and not right next door the
