I remember they hidden no one wants to admit to the pollster because you know they're going to get torn down so people don't admit so it the number is probably higher\nYeah um and now the Democratic blue wave that everybody's talking about there's other polls say no oh\nNo no no Democrats or this NBC News Wall Street journal poll found that uh\nThat uh once cushy advantage they have been some key house races are not real it's it's tighter than it's ever been no in fact bill ... who's a GOP pollster who conducted the survey said this whole thing is a barn burner right now there's a switch that's been flip and they are engaging in the campaign\nAnd the process the Republicans so depending on where you go what poll you're looking at the numbers are all over the map but uh I'll tell you the early voting numbers I just don't understand early voting numbers if if you had the opportunity to vote early ... would you take a do you think this is a good thing or not\nI I'm not sure why they do that a\nBritish way to have you ever voted early in election or have the opportunity to vote early for any particular reason for anything\nI mean it was offered up in Georgia quite a bit when I Lived there yet why is that why why do they do that while but here's the voting day that's when you go vote it's made for a lot of different reasons the majority of which are maybe people cannot get to the poll on voting day say you are\nA senior citizen with limited transportation options or if you are a ... or somebody that works out of town and stuff and having to go through an absentee ballot so they just open up a window and go you can vote anytime inside this right period of time yeah it's it's it's a span of two weeks I Believe I think that all up and up yesterday early voting for for states that have it so\nWell Nevada for instance I'm more than four point three million Americans have already voted there and they've got the results are already in the Nevada secretary state indicates that there's a strong democratic showing across the board and the state\nBut when it comes to the actual voting numbers ... with everybody voting I'm not I'm not sure that that number still going to be real and if there's data that they're putting out there is completely roller fake news you know just a\nIt's a it's a headline it's it's a way to just push another story and realistically if if you're looking at it from that point of view it's saying to the Republicans say there's been a lot of Democrats already come to the poll you better go to the poll on election day or else your candidate will lose yeah\nAnd and the St Paul out there forty nine percent of the registered voters\nIn this poll say they disapprove of the job for the Trump is doing well how do you argue with what's been going on with the president protecting the country putting more money in your pocket with the tax guy because\nThey don't like him that it has nothing to do with them it does yeah\nIt it's not about the job it's about the person that's ... that's exactly it identity politics and that's what you're going to see in twenty Eighteen that's what you're going to see in twenty twenty that's what you're gonna see for the rest of our lives as long as social media and the TV media and the way things are done you're always going to see identity politics one out\nBut the spin from the media and in the papers to put these data\nYou know numbers out there they say disapprove of the job he's doing has nothing to do with the job\nThey just don't like him period don't like his personality also any question about president oh do you have to continue with the sentence I don't need to hear what you're talking about you mentioned President Trump put me down for no I don't even know what
