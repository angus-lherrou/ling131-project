Thirteen it's Alabama's morning News I'm Jay Z well I'll tell you what the\nPresident's got himself a little hot potato and does and it was Saudi Arabia what to do it does not look good that the\nWashington Post contributor Jamal cause show he goes into this conflict and then ah does not come out and apparently there's some video or evidence that he was cut up and murdered former CIA director John Brennan says it's very hard to believe the Saudis have nothing to do with this\nDisappeared when there is a video evidence of him being at the conflict the Saudi costs let a diplomatic mission on to the full control of Saudi Arabia so they're denials ring hollow\nAnd joining us now bills in for to take a look at all of this and see where we're headed next bill good morning so the Saudis are saying basically hey we don't know what's going on here we are in fact we are going to put together will investigative team ourselves with the leader of turkey so we're stuck in the middle of he said he said on this are we\nYeah and this really flared up a little bit over the weekend JT when the president said there would be severe punishment if the Saudis were involved in this down to ... because she'll be they immediately shot back and said if the United states would impose sanctions or create other political pressure they would respond with even greater action now\nAre the Saudis have kind of backed off of that since then their embassy releasing a statement saying they appreciate the U.S administration for rush refraining from a jumping to any conclusions in this case so they've kind of backed off of that a little bit but still\nThis is a mystery that uh that that has to be figured out here and uh you're right the Turks\nAnd the Saudis are going to start a a joint investigation in fact it is underway today or they're going to search the Saudi consulate in Istanbul something that\nThe Saudis first agreed to then backed off off on it would not allow investigators and now a joint team is going to search the consulate\nAnd try to determine if a if there was any wrongdoing with Jamal 'cause she'll be inside the consulate now a where it goes from here is anybody's guess but I'll tell you this much JT\nIn this dispute if the United states and the Saudis ... gauge in any kind of back and forth the Saudis are holding an awful lot of good cards in this poker game a number one after completing that huge arms purchase from the United states the president doesn't want to lose that and number two of course they hold that oil tap\nOver there the leading producer and OPEC and already Justin speculation that there could be some type of tension between the United states in Saudi Arabia oil prices are going up\nYeah and in addition to that here in the United states Marco Rubio's out there saying look if the president doesn't act Congress will act in fact we've got some companies that are pulling out of this upcoming investor conference for Ford Motor company's German built for and says he's going to cancel his Middle East trip so\nWell I'll tell you the both sides of this or or I'm feeling very strong about both directions on this the Saudis obviously denying any involvement they want to get the investigation going as you mentioned do we trust that investigation with turkey or is that just rhetoric\nYou know what a ... there's one mysterious thing to me turkey has said that they have a hard evidence that they're audio recordings of the actual torture and murder of Jamal 'cause she'll be if they do why hasn't anybody heard it yet yeah why has it been presented to the United states officials or anybody else\nAh so that remains a big part of this and and what is going on here maybe turkey does have this but in order to produce it they would have to admit that they have surveillance equipment inside the consulate of another country are so many you know there are a lot of things involved here\nEven if it were to be true and they've got the video and they've got the sound and they all they have the ... they all have all the evidence President Trump still dealing with a political hot potato as you mentioned the uh the deal that we've got
