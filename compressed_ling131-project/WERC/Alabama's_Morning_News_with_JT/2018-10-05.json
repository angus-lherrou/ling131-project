let's get the voting process going on in the confirmation of judge Kavanaugh the FBI report\nIs done in into the Senate to Mitch McConnell said the FBI did not corroborate any of the allegations\nWhat we know for sure is the FBI report did not corroborate any of the allegations against judge Kevin and the second thing we know for sure is that there's no way anything we did would satisfy\nThe Democrats are they've always got a reason while the goalposts needed to be moved further down the field farther down the field and uh nothing we could do which is by them and then I Would imagine they're going to\nTry and move that goalpost again today and tomorrow in probably next week some time build them for joining us now our correspondents been following this so bill it's time to get her done and let's get this voting process going\nYeah the Jaycee the Democrats may try to move that goalpost but I don't think they will be able to will get that procedural vote going today this is just about to say okay let's get down to it now let's say an debate and move on to the boat\nThat's expected to go through today but it's important to remember that just because of senator would vote yes today does not necessarily mean that they will vote yes tomorrow I now having said that you mentioned there and Mitch McConnell mentioned it there that\nThe FBI report from all indications did not contain any corroboration to the allegations against Brett Kavanaugh so even those senators who were thought to be the key ones Jeff Flake Susan Collins Lisa Murkowski\nHave indicated that they are satisfied with the report and felt that it was Thoreau enough so while they have not gone so far as to say we are yes votes it kind of puts them on that path so right now you're looking at to Brett Kavanaugh up probably being confirmed\nAnd the ... vote on Saturday one thing that remains up in the air is the status of\nA Montana Republican senator Steve Gaines whose daughter is getting married this weekend and he says he well right now what he's saying is look I Want to do two things as weekend I Want to walk my daughter down the aisle and I want to get a new Supreme Court justice confirmed a so Kenny do both of those things\nI it remains to be seen rarely he says they can hold the vote open for him until he returns but he says he will be there as needed to cast a vote for Brett Kavanaugh will see what happens here\nBoy you're talking about two are very important things in a man's life this young again but I got to tell you his daughter out and do better scheduling your

we've got Mike Pompeo hinder the far east not the middle east Japan China what's on the agenda for him\nYeah and this was a trip that really was a a trip to North Korea but it has taken on a kind of a whole new angle here JT he'll be in Japan Saturday and Sunday talking with prime minister all day and other officials then Sunday he gets a face to face it down with Kim Jong on in North Korea\nThere'll be talking about the denuclearization and a lay the groundwork for another summit between the president and Kim Jong il and\nThen he goes down to South Korea Sunday and Monday then on Monday he stopped in\nBeijing this should be an interesting meeting especially since the United states now has a lengthy list of grievances against China ranging from trade all the way down to a illegal drugs coming into this country from China then yesterday vice president Pence delivered just a scathing speech on China\nAccusing them of various different things in fact he says a ... ... what Russia is doing pales in comparison to what China is doing and China has one goal to get rid of the president of the United states so\nThis has kind of inflamed the situation with China wasn't

movie and Lady Gaga and Bradley Cooper his new movie stars born Kevin Flanagan now joins us to take a look let's start with what I think probably gonna be the big when you tell me venom the new marvel movie\nIt is a day and you and I both know that these kind of fans couldn't care less what critics bank they're just going to go because they're not in a more open it up with that um character I I'm not a huge fan of that um as a character a little creepy a little scary\nBut anyway\nAnd this one so he's got that they're there you can learn a lot about Cindy in this movie if you don't know what one is the enemy you learn I doubt you'll ever learn about him in science class but anyway these are things that came on an alien spaceship that crashed on earth ah the guy that runs all white foundation\n... talking great the c._e._o. ... he's going to be a bad guy even though he's got to figure out how to save the planet\nAnd ... and our hero get infected by us and the other thing that he ...\nHe becomes venom he merges with Cindi I\nDid that for me but if you're going to\nGet a comic book that gets up on the screen he's scary it's not through her manner Spiderman but speaking of Spider Man they threw the credits and you will see it the clothes were either man got up promoting his new movie and so anyway\nIt's typical marveling if you like that you gotta like\nAll right so this is not a twenty Eighteen version of anaconda some big snake going through the ... and the goal has\nBeen no object\nSo for just mindless entertainment uh this'll be a fun movie or would you not go see this at all\nIt's going to get from people who grew up with your kids like typical bar oh\nOkay you're not item and kind of film I'll tell you a movie the Judy really wants to see I kind of want to see this went to Lady Gaga looks amazing in this with Bradley Cooper a star is born the remake now what are you thinking about this one\nYeah we're so we've got a history you know in Nineteen thirty seven we had a movie they go to start over and then we had a musical about Twenty years later and then another Thirty years later Twenty years later we had the musical with Barbara Streisand it Chris Christopher said\nWhat Bradley Cooper got excited about this project it originally was going to be Clint Eastwood as the got pregnant and got put on hold and got turned around\nBradley Cooper fought for now he produces a direct action erode some of the music for or this isn't really going to be I think there's going to be a lot of awards come toward this movie but if you the original story is\nKept true Willie Nelson son uh collaborate in a lot of the music and then the ... ... ... ... it's got a lot of why a lot of field you know\nThe story for star is born you're not going to do better than Bradley Cooper and Lady Gaga is an awful lot of great Lady Gaga fan normally\nBut in this role she just she does a great job and so I definitely recommend this on the wife and I you know

fan of Chris Stapleton right I I'm a fan of turtles Simpson of Jason is ... the named Dave Cobb might not mean a lot to every body he's a producer on all of those albums he's the guy that helps bring that music to the screen\nThey contracted Dave Cobb a Bradley Cooper did when he got the the green light on this move right and right in the first call they made was ... he helped write a lot of the arrangements for this movie there's a lot of country influence behind the screen on this it's not just Hollywood there's a lot of Nashville\nAnd a lot of truth country behind\nYeah and I think you make a good point too it's not the polished new pop country that's out now this is legit you know ... you know dirty dusty boots original country and Bradley Cooper is actually part of\nWriting some of the music is well this was his baby he is a definitely invested in a number of different angles not just showing up on screen to look good with a Lady Gaga\nBradley Cooper every few years seems to have a movie that opens the eyes of the ... I didn't know he could do that I didn't know he could do that you had a the one where he played the American sniper when you play Christie I always\nKind of like a Matthew McConaughey when all the the different roles come on you go wow he's really good\nI ...

that you're very thoughtful about it and what might come up new\nUh they're going to wait till the last minute I've been in that same physician so I'm not going to hold it against them for not announcing ahead of time\nJust for senators could make or break Brett Kavanaugh's confirmation all eyes will be on Republican Senator Susan Collins of Maine Lisa Murkowski of Alaska Jeff Flake of Arizona\nAs well as West Virginia Democrat Joe Manchin a nominee must get a simple majority of fifty one votes in the Senate to be approved and forty eight Republican senators have already said
