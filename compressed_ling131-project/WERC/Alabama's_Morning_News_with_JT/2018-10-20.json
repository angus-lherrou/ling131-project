jeopardize our dominance in space or satellites of course the Chinese have an anti satellite capability they're shooting literally for the moon and they're building a capability to put a space station up very shortly\nNow they're doing the types of things that maybe twenty Thirty years ago we as the United states we're we're talking about I'm beginning to do while they're rapidly catching up and you know this has caught our attention that's why\nYou know the president and the Pentagon\nAnd wrote a national defense strategy that focus like a laser on Russia and China as\nUntrue competitors are near peer competitors across the board and it's not not just the military it's economic it's diplomatic ah it's all these other areas that\nShow national capability and national power and we're finding that our adversaries are are doing quite well thank you\nHow concerned should we be with the fact that Google arguably one of the most powerful companies in the world I knew a monopoly on the

leadership in Beijing and yet that's exactly what they're\nDoing I supposed to a certain degree because they see a rising\nChinese economic power and they want to be part of a the success of that a country you know they will you know by a lot of estimates or be the world's leading economic powerhouse by twenty thirty five you know somewhere around there um and\nUnless something dramatically happens in a very different way they're going to achieve that and they're going to have\nA leverage using what I outlined earlier the belt and road initiative which is pouring hundreds of billions if

know I see the the Internet and what can be used and what can be so yeah there are strategically doing some very bright very smart things\nUh but when you look at their autocratic regimes and their

thoughts are on how we should proceed or how the United states where the Trump Administration should proceed\nAh with with Saudi Arabia and how that plays into all of this a sort of his do Cold War scenario\nYou know it's never simple as that and the cars so sugary situation is is tragic uh but if you've been watching Mohammed bin psalm psalm and you know the crown prince uh you know he's

technology they're totally dependent upon our arms that of course now they could go to the Chinese are Russians but they don't want to because are typically are much better I think the big question and that part of the world one is oil\nA and and how are they going to use dollars in the future but also Iran Iran is not to be a ... with then of course that their their major adversary against the Saudis\nAnd the Russians and Chinese are all lined up with Iran and were lined up with a Riyadh a regime\nUm they're all ... they they've got um you know a way of doing things that are certainly in the west we're not all excited about uh but the reality is that um\nYou know a friend of my ... you know my friend you know what the expression and Richard a friend of my enemy is a you know my friend

C. P. international limited\nIn Alexandria, Virginia based company where his primary duties include working on multinational programs for the department of army and since October of two thousand and two colonel McGinnis has been a member of security Donald Rumsfeld military analyst\nGroup and his brand new book is called ... and the alliance of evil Russia China the United states and a new Cold War has the mystery of the end times finally arrived Bob McGinnis welcome back to coast to coast how are you\nI'm doing well Richard thank you for having me this evening\nMy pleasure let me throw a couple of uh items that you very quickly and one is that we are we are hearing that us national security adviser John Bolton is reportedly\nAre pushing the president to withdraw from a treaty designed to prevent a nuclear arms race between us and Russia that would be called the ion air for the intermediate range nuclear forces treaty which has been in place since Nineteen eighty seven your thoughts\nOf course the Russians or suspected and I think I'm a lot of people would agree in violation of the Nineteen eighty seven I treaty because they have\nA not only build practice the use of ballistic can cruise missiles that have a range of five hundred to fifty five hundred kilometers in violation of that we've tractor cruise missile recalled nine and seven to nine or that has um\nYou know not met the criteria is violated the criteria now of course John Bolton is on his way this coming week over to Moscow to talk about that but they're also Richard going to talk about\nA possible renewal of a twenty two new start and you know President Trump said I'm ... weeks ago that perhaps we aren't going to renew it and that should be a a a really a a shot across the bow of Moscow ... concern to solve it\nYou know that is cutting back dramatically a nuclear weapons and\nTo Fifteen hundred and fifty are deployed strategic warheads and about seven hundred vehicle so you know this is important in a world that I Believe has really cross the line to a new Cold War because the old Cold War is all about nuclear\nHolocaust and the threat posed by the Soviets in the U.S\nWe're entering a new era right now\nI Want to also dial back to September when Russia began its largest ever military exercise with three hundred thousand just think of that three hundred thousand soldiers or this was a a a drill with China\nAs a rehearsal for some sort of large scale conflict it was called the Vostok twenty Eighteen drills just this kind of really illustrates how China and Russia are aligning themselves perhaps against the United states\nWell it does and in fact a really yesterday you had the two defense ministers from Russia and China met\nAnd they're getting ready to uh jointly head a commission on military technology um that is of course being shared a significantly between the two we just sanction the Chinese for buying\nA fighter jets from the Russians and also the S. four hundred a surface to air missile system\nAnd the the Vostok Eighteen exercises you indicate you know I had three hundred thousand a soldier's thirty six thousand\nA armored vehicles or at least a thousand bombers some of those strategic bombers um in fact flew off\nThe east coast of Russia straight at the United states you know practicing what I Would consider bombing runs against Jimmy a clear air force base and Fort Greely Fort Greely is where we have the mid range nuclear anti\nMissile capability and we have and we're growing that mostly because of the north Korean threat but of course the Chinese have a rising capability and the Russians has never gone away\nI Want to ask you whether there was an opportunity last after the fall of the iron curtain the end of the Cold War when President Reagan had essentially vanquished or when he called the the evil empire the Soviet Union\nA and then later assurances were given to the Soviets or the Russian Federation that NATO would not encroach one centimeter towards Moscow and of course that was violated some might suggest that the United states was poking the bear and given their\nTheir passion for for for a nationalism in in the former Russian Federation um coupled with the ascension to POWER UP some who might some many who we would suggest as perhaps the greatest Russian leaders since Peter the great\nThat that this was an opportunity last that that that the United states provoked the Russians and they could have been our lives but now here we are what are your thoughts\nYou know I think you're correct Richard huh we did poke 'em and of course we've continued to do that they considered a Ukraine or the breadbasket of Russia\nAnd of course they're continuing to fuel the anti key of a civil war which I call in the eastern part of the country and that's after having seized Crimea and of course two provinces in two thousand\nAnd eight from the republic of Georgia and they're pushing back against the Baltics against Poland Hungary Romania or the entire a former Soviet satellite regimes\nAh that's something that I Know when Mr Yeltsin the new president after Gorbachev stepped down\nCame to this country met with Bush Camp David [noise] we had the opportunity to do more than just give them a few crumbs we could have brought them into the fold and I think that that really is you indicate ... you know fueled the rise of Vladimir ...\nAnd you know ... of course has captured the imagination of the Russian people and as a direct result has really fueled\nNationalism and patriotism in a way that a ... they're somewhat um I Would argue blind to perhaps what the West is looking at because\nAt perhaps we ought to amend our constitution much like the Chinese did this past year and allow potent in this case to serve\nBeyond twenty twenty four because he was just elected of course ah ah this past march you know they're beginning to see that we need longevity and we need to have the capability to\nAh keep the momentum going in and they feel confident that ... is doing that much as the Chinese are feeling confident and president Xi is well\nYou're not exactly painting prudent as an evil adversary and yet the the title of the book is alliances evil so why why should we aside from the fact that the Russians have a vast nuclear arsenal\nWhy should we be fearing prudent and an alliance with China\nWill what they're doing is they're weaponize eat everything against us you know if you look at political coercion predatory economics\nStrategic extortion information warfare um covert action you know I I could go through every one of those Richard and there was a long history and in fact an alliance of evil I go through sixteen indicators in which those things just\nCome out alive and they they like blinking red lights\nAnd they suggest very strongly that yes they're representing their interests and in fact Russia and China are collaborating just like the Russian prime ministers have been rushing Chinese leaders have been meeting here recently and their parents ministers just met you know for taking time over the top\nSorry for the interruption I gotta jump in here will pick

and a decide whether or not we're going to continue to allow these people to bring a new businesses joining us now to talk more about this councilman Casey middle road to propose this resolution Casey mourning\nMourning and so uh I Would imagine a lot of people are happy about this and the fact that it might bring you know property values down if you put too many of these stores in certain neighborhoods or you know and some people would actually said certain element of customer base comes in which is\nNot really appealing to future businesses it might want to build in the areas so we've got to protect the area and only allow some of these certain types of these businesses but obviously there's some other council folks that are opposing this saying this is government overreach so\nWhy did you bring this resolution to the table where does it come from the people come to you about this\nUh ... yeah thing on many residents have has been a ... or this or for a long time a long before I

answer your question a councilman or on the sort of shoot your\nEye you mentioned that redevelopment is really the main pushed behind if you have the master plan that you're wanting to implement over the next year\nIf that's the case in the moratorium is on these three types of businesses why not just put a moratorium on any new business license if you're trying to implement a master plan and you can get that kicked off and then you can issue business licenses as the master plan is going into effect\nThat we've identified a these types of possibly being detrimental to further recruitment of
