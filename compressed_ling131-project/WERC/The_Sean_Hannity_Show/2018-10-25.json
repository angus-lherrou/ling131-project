trustworthy enough to go\nAnd you [noise]\nOr whatever procedure that this particular specialist is going to proceed with um\n... you know so now I I wouldn't go to the doctor or I Would get comfortable with that doctor one of the two I'm now may be that that's off putting enough because it's kind of a weird request it may be that that is off putting enough to you that you just don't want to use this doctor but that in what you said in the email\nSometimes I hear people say you know I I'm not going to tie that\nChurch because I don't agree with things that are going on at that church\nBut you're going to trust them to spiritually train you you're going to trust them with your children's sold in Sunday school class you're going to trust them to influence you on your view of scripture scripture and your walk with God\nBut you don't trust them with your money well let's just dumb so into the system that's appalling\nYou don't trust them enough to touch you don't trust them with money but you trust them with your soul\nThat's just weird it's\nJust a bad idea so that's the thing now I have at times with the church that I'm attending while I'm watching\nThe misbehavior of leadership and I've taken a little time off of tithing and set it aside little bit to see how this was going to turn out but long term if I'm not willing to give their I shouldn't go there\nIn the same would be true of this doctor story here and is with us in Baltimore, Maryland Hi Ann how are you\nI'm great how are you better than I deserve what's up\n[noise] I paid thirty ... well not paid off but I paid thirty five thousand dollars in less than a year good\nFor you on TALK ... thank you collect student loans listening to you and then I was in a car crash and the money thing going for medical expenses\nAnd um\nI Do things a lock my motivation and also and the other thing is\nI found a great deal I have come out of body um problems with my car and I found someone who is willing to do do it for cheap high and I want to get that we've had that but it it's going to be eight hundred dollars\nAnd you don't have eight hundred dollars\nWell I have this I Know you're not gonna like that but I got it I have a thousand dollar emergency fund the IRS gets hit me and they ... they are going to get that money [noise] um I can save up\nI mean I thought you were out on a debt oh no no no I'm not out of that well just paid off their I've already five thousand and less than a year but now that was torn my student loan that actually I have\nAnd you didn't pay the IRS before you paid\nYour student loan\nWell that that came out and now where I that I haven't I'm getting paid park in the mail from my CPA half a fan tend to pay for that for a marked on right now\nMhm solid now mhm\nOkay and so you have one thousand dollar saved for emergencies is all\nYet but I I have I got a credit card and I know you don't like credit card and I don't normally use credit cards but if you're an extra Twenty one lie and I can use that credit card eight hundred dollars a month\nUse it for what ... found out about a repair which is eight hundred dollars yeah yeah\nI ... and I mean that\nThat's so backward from everything you've ever heard me say I'm appalled that you think I Would actually respond positively to that ridiculous statement\nI mean really you just called Dave Ramsey and said I Want to use a credit card on the air\nOkay well I take that back [laughter]\nHow many there is Lee you are going on here no I mean you've got you've got to think about an hour a day Ramsey things but you need to think about what how do you want to live your life here's why you lost your motivation is you're inconsistent\nYou need to say in your mind and in your heart of hearts and you need to grasp intellectually and spiritually that the shortest path to wealth and generosity and stability in your finances sustainability is to get out of debt and stay out of debt and at that point you're saying I'll never borrow again as part of that\nRegardless of what I Need to have happen now you had a car accident did you not get an insurance settlement for that\nNow they're saying that there was no no ... or damage to our vehicle\nAnd they're saying they don't believe that it um the crash injured me but I I'm actually had pain before the crash occurred so I'm I'm just paying for myself with my health insurance\nOkay but I'm Talking about the car wreck the U.S or you did not get any insurance for the damage to your car\nOh yes I did I got five hundred dollars I paid for my students are\nOh okay\nInstead of putting it on the auto body repair which now you want to do yeah so this repair is very very minor an eight hundred dollar a bump it's not our okay\nSo the eight hundred dollar repair the reason I Want to do it now because it's a great deal because it's not it's damage that I've been driving around with for a long time let other damage yeah\nBut then I may or may stop if we're not going to that it was a few thousand dollar let me stop for a number one I'm not going to tell you to borrow money you knew that for you call me right\nNumber two this is not an emergency smaller margins it's a great day it's not an emergency I don't care if it's a great deal it's non emergency\nAnd you don't have any money except what's in your emergency fun now and you've got the IRS breathing down your neck which is a lot bigger deal than a bump on your car\nAnd so now you didn't clear up the Irish and you need to save up the money to fix the car if the guy won't do it in a year from now for eight hundred dollars then when you actually have the money then you just want to be able to do it with him or you just missed that deal but so uh\nUm ... you know one thing I have learned is that when I Am impulsive\nAnd when I make quick decisions on something based on something I feel like I'm being emotionally drug into it's almost always a bad financial decision in a lot of the things circling around this conversation to have had the field to them\nAnd so you need to slow down get yourself on a very strict plan in lives that plan all the way out regardless of what opportunities or crisis has come into your life anytime there's a problem you just get\nBack on track back on track back on track\nAnd when you stabilized that you're going to stabilize not only your money but a whole bunch of other areas of your life but it also felt like a dog chasing it's to tell you where you just been going in circles\nAnd that's what's going on I can hear it I can feel it and talking to you you're going to be All right but that's what you need to do and no we're not going to use a credit card to take advantage of a bargain to fix your car\nNow with the Irish boys and men are now and is not an emergency so we're not using the emergency room on and being\nVery clear principles and slide them just like a lot of them to everyone else [laughter]\n[noise] but you get to do it because you're thrown up\n\n[noise]\nHey it's Boise production officer for the show and he's a little over two thousand and Eighteen [noise] go download our

during that time I started off making Seventy and ended about making Ninety three thousand why don't good for you what do you do for a living or I oversee marketing for a software company and I also started my own company during the\nProcess that okay good for you what kind of that was the forty eight thousand dollars you bought\nEverything mainly student loans um I also had a student loan or a car loan out I also had four one K. loan\nAnd then also had to pay some taxes to the IRS\nOkay she like normal oh very normal a little bit of ... out there and just kind of ... along yeah and I'm making decent money but got a big pile of debt and I don't feel like a written oil\nWell I I'm a travel junkie and so whenever I realized I couldn't go on all the trip that I Want it and yeah\nBroke and it kind of you know was horrible about being on a trip and not being able to afford things to eat\nHere and so what happened twenty two months ago\nI was traveling with my boyfriend at the time seemed to be my husband ... and ah he the year before had paid for a trip for both of us to go to Costa Rica which was great yeah um so I was going to pay it back and say hey you know I'm going to pay for our trip next year ...\nUm and then realize I can actually afford is um airfare whoa I had to go to and say hey can you can you purchase your own airfare um\nSo it was kind of that you know and then also saying I made good money and I couldn't do everything I wanted to do\nSo much too much money to be this broke exactly so what'd you do\nUm I got really serious actually read the total money make over about six years ago mhm end started to to become ill intent started to understand some of the teachings but then um the twenty two months ago is really whenever kicked in going in\nThis stupid why am I taking so long to get to that 'cause I'd started and then stopped and then got back into it so that's when I write you know I had my lovely excel spreadsheet also use every dollar up I'm so we started doing all that and plus my company started to um do smart dollar at all\nFor coming up the Becker okay great so they talked smart dollar yep which is going through the whole class as an HR benefited your company yes very neat and so that gave you about the time you were disgusted in ... an airline ticket while law smart dollar appears from the ...\nYeah and actually um to circumvent and I and I think when we go through this process you start to get really creative ... so one of my passions us to travel so I became a national speaker and had other people pay for my travel I was just working the entire time um but I still got to do a lot of my travel well also working on my income end\nRun around the country or smoke\nYeah that's not bad at all I'm a professional eater I Wonder if I get them pardon me for that\nYou'll be surprised what people will pay for a no\nThey ... when you get creative it's exactly right so the company teachers more dollar you're going through it you get your income up with all the ... gigs you're traveling and getting paid you know software on the side you're doing your work Ninety Ninety thousand dollar job and what is the secret to pay off forty eight thousand dollars for the dead and twenty too much\nSo I'm I'm a marketer um my one tad bit is don't pay attention to commercials or social media boat because that's the second you start to see the restaurants on commercials or the cool stuff that people are purchasing and showing off on social media you start to have that why should have with the Joneses have\nSo don't put as much weight into what you see that all the markers in the world that are really good at what we do if it's trying to get you to purchase something outside of your means ... shut off the that device to shut off the TV shut off the apps shut off the social media um and do something else which time\nAbsolutely they all the ritual cruise book love your life not they're not what it's all about his don't compare your life to other people's highlight reel on Facebook yeah very cool good for you and what did you do did you cut your spending did you sell stuff did you live on beans and rice what'd you do\nUm I so I sold some things I did a garage sale and really I Want it to get rid of the clutter in my house\nAnd um I actually created a marketing campaign around my garage sale so I titled that um shop of ... turned minimalist and I did a full fledged marketing campaign around it and also created posters to go in my yard and I had a poster of you with your face on it that said they ran the he's making me so much stuff [laughter]\nSo um that's funny and they bought a comment on that or there was oh yeah a lot of people\nThe second thing is can you be dead free everything but your house in a year I'm Sorry in two years within two years if you can ...\nTake an extra jobs up so much stuff the kids think their next beans and rice rice and beans don't see the inside of a restaurant unless you're working there are no vacations busted and be debt free scorched earth and be debt free\n\nIn less than two years then you would keep your car even if you owe more on it then it's actually worse 'cause you're gonna pay it off and you're going to clear it and you're going to own it it's going to be all through all done\nRight that's where we're going to end up you know\nIf you owe more on your car then it's actually worth and you can't it's going to be more than half your on your income\nAnd or you can't pay it off inside of two years then you do need to sell it how do you sell a car that you're upside down on that you owe more on your car than it's worth in that case if you need to sell it you've got to cover the difference\nYou owe twenty thousand dollars on the car the car is worth sixteen you can sell it for sixteen but you've got to have the other four to put with district stand to get the title from the bank in order\nWhen you get the title to the ... in order to give the title to the new owner and so where are you going to get that other four thousand dollars if you're upside down by four thousand dollars well you would have to in that case [noise] borrow the four thousand dollar saves the four thousand dollars\nOr talk the current lawyer Linder on the car and letting you sign a note for the four thousand dollar difference that will only happen if you had like a credit union or a local bank won't happen with the big bang or car loan company General Motors credit is not going to do that Lexus motor credit is not going to do that\nAnd so on so that's what you do hope that helps\nOpen phones a triple eight eight to five ... five two to five you jump in we'll talk about your life and your money John is with us in Detroit hey John how are you\nA good day how are you better than I deserve what's up\nWell thank you for taking my call the few um my wife and I are avid planners and we are planning our next move here in the next few years I'm forty nine and she's forty six\nWe don't have kids um and we're thinking about moving to the Las Vegas area over the next\nTwo to three years we probably are playing for an ... um my question to you is we're looking in because we do a lot of travelling um ourselves and so we're not sure it looking at a condo\nOr an actual having a home would be a good idea and what's your what's your opinion on condo um 'cause we are planning on whatever we purchase we're planning on paying for on that we have no market\nAnd that's good okay opinion on them regarding what value increases are what\nWell uh [noise] you know facing the sort of thing because let's say we we buy a condo um we're looking we buy kind of over three hundred thousand\nUm monthly dues are highly thousand or something like that um if you don't waste of money I'm used to go into account of versus a home we're just not sure what the right financial election would be\nWell no it's not a waste of money um the benefits are as you said you don't have to deal with the exterior maintenance and when you're traveling you've got neighbors that are close and if something or curves obviously you could\nYou know or have the next door neighbor or the person near you have a key and that kind of a thing there's a lot of possible good things about owning a condo\nAs far as they as far as a condominium increasing in value\nA everything that controls the value increasing on real estate there there's three things location location location right right and and so is it a is it a condominium in a good area\nMeaning to an area that's a stable growing that values are increasing a good neighborhood neighborhood that people considerably a desirable place to live\nA ... and so I Want to I Want to buy a condominium in a fairly a ... area or in an area that is you know right on the edge of a rapidly growing edge of an established area that kind of a thing for from a ... British resell standpoint okay\nAnd you know if you do that you're going to get similar growth in value to what you would in a single family in that same neighborhood\nSame families to do a little bit better there is a little bit more market for them and there is condos but you know uh if you're in an area that's accepting of condominiums you'd be fined and Vegas will be fine with that now having said all of that then the only downside is what you mentioned earlier\nAnd that is the H away and the handling of the budget of the ... I wouldn't want to investigate because you are a planner the budget\nAnd um how they're doing with the ... way budgeting let me give me an example I had a condo come I own a rental or a many years ago when a condo complex that they had budgeted no reserves to replace the roof\nOkay now the condominium association is responsible for the exterior maintenance which would include the roof replacement so they come up with a several million dollar problem because the roofs are going bad\nRight and they'd done no planning to get rid of it so guess what they did a special assessed every body and the place in addition to the right to waive fees to keep because they had to have Ruth ... Lincoln all over the place exactly\nBut that devalued the condo and spoke to cash out of everybody's pockets\nOkay and so if you look up and they've got no reserves for parking lot replacement no reserves for exterior maintenance no reserved for roof replacement in their budget\nAnd you know when you're looking at a complex is ten years old you got a problem you're walking into and so the thing you want to look at their the deferred maintenance is hidden down in that age are way reserves budget\nThe second thing you're going to run into is a and I'm In a bunch of joys own a bunch of real estate I hate H always right generally speaking the people that want to be on charge of the ... way or the people that are in charge of nothing else anywhere else and their Barney Fife\nThey would drive you freaking nuts absolutely and there are people that need a life\nNow there's exceptions to that but by and large or you're going to run into a lot of that\nYeah I'm currently currently live at home or the issue right now and I'm the president of your thumb [laughter]\nBasically [laughter]\nI said at our you know\nI I stayed at the civically because I Want to run into a firefight kind of situation very very\nBright guy than what you say you know there there's a lot of that it's not it's not a hundred percent truth thank goodness I hopefully your novel on you know about that at all [laughter] but that's what you want to watch for is the politics\nOf the association I'm In one eye joys of barrel suing each other and it's just on the whole neighborhoods are melting down you know just ridiculous and so you just hit it you got to\nMatch what you could get into you know if you're the president so she was she already knew all the stuff I was just talking about them as far as I'm even reserves in a situation things there that you've got to have reserved\nReserved covered [noise] so that's all you gotta look for [laughter] that's fabulous Ramsey show\nHey guys this is James

staying there that is what clarity does clarity gives us confidence to step out\nAnd then clarity allows us to have courage once were on that path in life throws its curves at us because it will and uh you could just be assured of that and yet when you face the doubt and fear and the pride is where you retreat back to clarity\nWho am I what was that created to do simple formula that we use\nWhat do you do best or your top towns what do you love to do most what work brings you enjoy the sweet spot for everybody exist where your greatest talent you read his passion intersect in other words I use what I Do best to do what I Love to do most and here's the deal folks as I tell my callers everyday\nI don't have the answers you do\nThey're inside of you the answers to this somewhat mythical journey\nOr actually within you you have so if you're scared if you're confused stuck give us a call triple eight eight to five five two to five triple eight eight to five five two to five let's go to Nelson who's on the line in Fall River Massachusetts Nelson how can out\nHey parent anchor taking my call\nGerman how can help\n'em right so um I don't know for a while and I figured out my Wi Fi which is\n... apparently it um creating an editing helmer found okay and uh I Want you to talk to a ... okay I'm In research I found a video marketing firm real close to me\nAnd uh I kicked him out on linked in and you know they're ... they're linked to a buddy of mine that I've known high school\nAnd I'm I'm here to get some coaching I don't want to go up because it's a very universe ... heard my call and gave me a great uh hey\nAlso will have you talk to your buddy that are that is at least connected to this company on linked in\nA I I haven't spoken about uh uh you know where you live nearby\nOkay well that's the first the first step is calling up saying hey uh I'm interested in learning more about this company I see that you're connected them on linked in what is your connection how strong is it that's the first thing\nBecause he could have a strong connection or maybe it's just a random connection or it's an old ... you see what I'm saying\nSo you are in um urine staged too\nAnd that is full on research and so you found and identified one company that does what you want to do you mentioned the proximity principle to the Dave Ramsey show letters you haven't heard that it's important to clarify what that is the ... the proximity principal says in order to do what I Want to do in this case\nNelson wants to do a film an audio editing production work so in order to do that he's got to be around people that are doing that in in places that it is happening so here you're next steps after you talk to your buddy and see how strong connection is\nThe next thing you want to do is I'd like to see you come up with a a bigger list even if it's three or four local production companies or or companies that are in this space okay 'cause you know where to look in your area so look and ideally I'd like to see a list of three or four companies that you we circle and say I need to learn more about those companies\nI Need to get in proximity now the other thing I Want you to do is I Want you to start talking to your buddy other people acquaintances uh who dabble or work full time in this space and I think you could probably come up with a list of those people as well\nAnd so you need to take 'em out to lunch or take 'em to coffee and you say hey listen this is the ... this is the place I Want to be in\nAnd so I'm here to pick your brain into areas number one what was your path\nWhat are some areas that I could get better and where can I grow uh what do I need to learn who else do I need to ... do you have any relationships you know of any open jobs this is a very simple conversation it's going to yield something positive\nAnd so this is proximity and didn't even if there's not a fulltime job available ... and this is the this is the part that I Want people to get that are in your similar situation\nLet's say you do all of that and there's not a position that is right for you at the time\nYou're sort of needs to be you know Mr Monday's great again and that's really what I Want to and I want to work for myself I just don't know how could make the jump from\nLeaving my current job on not excited about it all to going to the mall or their career is completely different field that has nothing to do with what I'm currently doing\nGotcha okay well let's talk about where you want to end up you want to eventually on your own business so let's let's identify that dream what is that\nI'm currently there's this kind of [noise]\nI Know it got to focus on one thing but I have a degree of work development and I have a passion for developing weapons on\nA credit card companies and and just doing maintenance for companies [noise]\nUm but I also have a passion of uh Dave Ramsey teach anything I've done the financial coach master courting and I would like to come up with practices you know maybe financial coach at home and saw it and I'm just completely different America focus on one thing I just don't know\nExactly I should be focusing on right now in the end and it's hard for somebody else it give me that after\nNo well I think you have the answer I think you know the answer I'm going to put you on the spot\nOkay\nI Know that you're passionate about Dave Ramsey needs help change your life and so you'd love to help others get some of that change that's what's really drawn to that but I ...\nYeah I I and I think that's fine I think you have multiple passions link passions could be on different levels and I think you could maybe do some coaching on the side for extra money\nBut I heard you grew clearly and definitively say that you always love designed and Web design and I think that that's the work that brings you great joy if I could snap my fingers and give you a job doing that right now how would you feel\nAll through right now do fantastic of course I'm sober\nHere's the deal so there is a pathway to getting there what are you doing right now what is your job and how much you're making\nA right now I Do a commercial laundry equipment return her toga laundromat owner\n... what do you make 'em ah about sixty five thousand a year but I Do a lot of overtime work in and out of town you know it's really kind of what can they burned all I Know you've got to overcome All right do you have that out of town trouble\nAre what are you completely out of debt what your situation there\nAre also embarrassed to we started with about Seventy thousand and right now we're down to it though are Eighteen thousand you know we started after years ago\nThat's awesome where you've had two babies are cash for a ... we have a lot of medical expensive come up that we've been working for a while now but [noise]\nUh Josh aren't given up on the planet oh listen but good\nThat's incredible you're doing great what's your pay off day you've got an idea in mind if if life doesn't keep throwing some ... and everything stays the same when do you think you pay off that Eighteen thousand\nA bomb march march or April ... next year where that's where we're headed out\nOkay so here's what I Want you to see\nFirst things first your current job I Know you're ... you're working hard but it's making a huge difference and in less than a year from now you're going to be debt free and then after that you're going to put an emergency fun together and get through baby step three how long do you think that's going to take\nA look when we're probably eight month old for six months for good ... murders in front of like about six months\nI agree with that Josh that's not that much time for you to bite your lip and be the study he wrote that you're being right now and get yourself set up to make this step not asleep but a ... so my other question is let's focus on the future so how much experience do you have with Web design\nAll I have a lot from the past but I you know with technology everything advances All right we're that I'm kind of out of the loop on that as far as the code and stuff but\nBut one good thing I have um a corner if I'm a very quick learner Dr phil motivator started right and wrong or worms and stuff like that too much so\nUm but as far as your knowledge I mean I've I've got a lot of knowledge\nThat's how I feel just a Josh here's the deal so you've got some experience which is great so you're you know that you've got the skill set this isn't a skill issue this was a train issue so you're the number one homework assignment\nToday is to go find out what qualifications you're going to need for the marketplace to say I'd hire Josh to do Web design that's that's number one homework assignment what additional qualifications slash training education do you need and I don't mean college because I just mean getting\nMore equipped and getting up to date to make yourself marketable\nFind out what that is that when you find out what that is the next question is how much is this going to cost me\nPlenty actually\nThen the next question is based on my budget based on getting out of debt and everything that's going on in my life if it's going to cost me this much much financially how long will it take for me to complete that qualification which will then make me qualified and marketable to do the role I wanted\nJosh ... that's all you got to do because once you get the answers to those questions that's your plan\nYou understand you just\nPlug and play at this point All right to continue this much I'm going to say this much money I take this class this course and then you begin to practice proximity and talk to people who are in the Web design space in Winston Salem North Carolina\nWho's hiring Web designers or this could be companies that hire internal people or maybe it's a marketing group Asia you begin to identify targets now this is all happening\nJosh while you're paying off debt\nAnd this current sixty five thousand dollar over time gig is not going to burn you out any more 'cause you're going to change your attitude to warn of gratitude which is this job is setting me up to step easily\nAnd triumphantly into the role that I ultimately want to ... do you see where that is you see that about a year from now\nIt may be sooner if you get the qualifications sooner and you can get a Web design job that's going to pay you sixty five thousand or sixty thousand after you've paid off the debt it's a game changer all of a sudden Josh you wake it up on Monday morning fired up and feeling so white you're not even sure if you're sitting in the car\n[laughter] ... yeah but I mean you can see that can't you\nCan I can see how it is what you're saying that it makes me my my attitude trained already and I'm I'm Glad I called you and I'm Glad you got to get a clarity that I\nWill listen me and I'm Glad you called because I think there are millions of people that just heard your story and they see themselves in your story\nBecause you've you've got it figured out [noise] and and it's just\nComing up with a basic plan Dave Ramsey has been giving people plan for twenty five plus years\nAh folks there's five stages to ... and the dream one discovery who am I what do I want to do what I Want to do it next research you just heard me walk Josh through research what I Need to learn to be able to do what I Want to do that after I figure out the research what I Need to know who I Need to know\nUh what I Need to learn who I Need to know then we're going to move into\nActually embarking stepping out in making something happened practice that proximity prince will get around people they're doing what you want to do get in places where what you want to do is happening that's the embarking you're gonna start knocking off those mini milestones in those goals\nYou're going to begin to achieve and as you achieve your\n... going to step into that dream role of the role that you were created to fill the world needs you to perform and that's the final stage\nOf realizing the dream that's meaning waking up like Josh wants to wake up he's dread Monday morning how many have you dread Monday Mornings there'll be a shame that Seventy percent of Americans no longer [noise]\nThrilled to sit in for Dave Ramsey want to thank day for allowing me to do this career ... sank are preserved James trials in our associate producer Kelly Daniel but mostly you find them thank you so much for listen this is that they ran for sure

Fox News local state and federal investigators try and narrow the surge in the ... can suspicious packages tend to high profile Democrats factors going off scot with more line\nAnd I don't think any libertarian ones Donnelly to continue because he's basically the Chuck Schumer Donnelly of Indiana\nDoesn't represent Indiana values um and I think the president going there's going to help ah hopefully brought in Indiana a will be watching and waiting the whole time they don't look to let me tell you what the worst news is in the you know we've been watching all this happened\nYou know all of this in civility that we've been monitoring and the silence who's been deafening it's just been especially deafening from Democrats and the news media\nThey've been unwilling to criticize things they obviously should criticized and it's been going on two years this this is not a new phenomenon of takes on different forums\nIt all started with Madonna I Want to I Dream an awful lot about blowing up the White House and deteriorated from there and deniro wanting a punch the president and the face and Joe Biden wanting to punch the president taking minders yard and then fight it out and Duke it out\nYou know this is the Democratic party Hillary can't be civil Eric Holder kick them\nWe watched what's happened to Pam Bondi\nSecretary Nielsen Sarah Sanders entered kids Ted Cruz and his wife Mitch McConnell and his wife multiple times boulders now being thrown through the office window of Kevin McCarthy the house majority leader I mean and there's been virtual silence\nAnd we have this terrible incident that we have been watching\nIn where you know these suspected mail bombs or you know thank God of the ten that have been sent a they haven't even confirmed fully that they're real bombs I assume that they are thank God none of them went off\nBeing sent to several prominent Democrats around the country we do have one instance where Republican is being threatened we did up the the two instances of Minnesota with two Republican candidates were punched one guy got whole ... from the ... behind that a concussion that's going to keep him out of commission for six weeks\nYou know we're living in times where the hypocrisy reeks the media Democrats they only care about Russia collusion if Russia collusion involves Donald Trump which it does not\nBut then when they see all the evidence emerging that Hillary bought and paid for\nRussian lives by funneling money too from a law firm to weigh up research group that then hires a foreign national that makes that won't even stand by you know his ridiculous stories of hookers\nUrinating in beds in Moscow and Donald Trump years ago in under rosy says I Can't confirm any of this is just you know well fifty fifty um it's raw intelligence what do I know\nAnd then that's still becomes the basis to commit fraud on Pfizer court and then it's still becomes the basis of you know these role upper echelon not\nRank and file big difference you know the structure the pages the ... the ... of the world et cetera you know all writing Hillary's exonerations she should have been put in jail or tried but then she gets to continue then she spends the money on the Russian dot C. A.\nAnd then when they can't be Trump even by disseminating those lies to you we the people well then they go the next step their insurance policy which is even though Lisa paid said there was no evidence of Trump Russia collusion and struck said that\nThere is no there there well then they start immediately strategy leaking again the same Clinton rushing dot CA and that becomes the basis of the appointment of Robert Mueller\nAnd then we go off investigating people's loans happily applications good grief\nIt just as pathetic but they only cared about Trump Russia collusion media ignored that\nThen the media when it comes to judge Kavanaugh and the new cabinet standard which is guilt by accusation all that to only is applied towards Republicans\nBecause I haven't heard ... Harris Spartacus or Dickey Durban or you know a Senator Feinstein or any of them ever demand an investigation an FBI investigation into Keith Ellison\nThat's fairly recent and we're real evidence real text messages a real tape real doctors' reports none of them have said we need an FBI investigation into him\nThank goodness the people of Minnesota paying attention that matters\nYou know again it's it's it's there's just hypocrites\nOnly care about Republican Russia collusion that doesn't exist not Hillary collusion they only care about stopping cabin all but not stopping you know Allison are not stopping the recent allegations based on the cabinet standard we'd be calling for FBI investigations into Corey Spartacus Booker\nOr Bill Clinton himself up we're going to go back forty years\nAnd the rape allegation with Juanita Broderick it others\nAnd then we take it a step further you know they only care they don't care about violence the threatening violence against the president you know listen to this montage of everything that you know just a small one I can go on for hours of all the things the media didn't get all worked up about ... [noise]\nYou cannot be criminal with a political party that wants to destroy what you stand for and what you care about that's why I Believe if we are fortunate enough\nNot the criminal with a

someone as information about any of the incidents this week in New York\nWe don't underestimate the difference even one person can make towards our collective safety and neither should the people of New York city I Want to reiterate as I did yesterday as they do any time we talk about far reaching investigations of this nature or any other kind that nothing we do in law enforcement we do alone\nFor a joint terrorists taskforce comprised of professionals who agencies you see here today and others were investigating all of this with great precision and I can say with certainty\nThat we will identifying the rest of the person or people responsible for these acts make no mistake\nLyrics cities intelligence and counterterrorism kind of terrorism capabilities are second it on every day
