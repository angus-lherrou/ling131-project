T. S. D. in my house\nThey these things just don't mix\nYou know it doesn't mixers too much going on this thing I feel stressed out just talking to you about all of it and I don't have to deal with it so I see what you're facing I'm so sorry but that's what I Would do and that's what this shows about what I Would do so I can do whatever you want to your grownups but um I I\n... who you're not gonna pay is not the answer who you're not you\nAre going to pay a mom and dad because you're going to do that I Would guilt and your co pay the Irish or they're going to come take stuff um you put her student loans or hardship for all you can decide not to pay the credit cards but eventually you got to get this mess cleaned up\nThat's going to come back to roost Anya so I'm Glad you're in some attribution where Steve and if I can help you further you call me back anytime Lewis was in Palm Springs California Hi Louis how are you\nGood how are you did better than I deserve what's up I'm\nTrying to advise my mom she she uh\nShe just completed a few and she is out of debt except for her mortgage um shoot God Nineteen thousand dollars cash in the bank\nUm another thousand she would be getting shown from a an investment she's trying to a cash out of what she potentially will have about twenty five thousand dollars cash\nI looking at her budget I figure about twelve thousand would be a good three to six month emergency fine okay she got about\nA potentially Thirteen thousand dollars extra cash it in three years old mhm she liked retire at sixty five ... she has a hundred and Seventy thousand dollars in a four one K. mhm um I just got her set up to do a automatic withdrawals into a ...\n... ... that thing out at sixty five hundred a year and\nSo she's right now for ... she'll be investing Fifteen Percent of our income into retirement mhm um I projected with that with a Fifteen Percent out of it about ten percent to be a little conservative I figure she'll be at about eight hundred and fifty thousand a ... and\nOkay All right I'm ... and so this this um move down in house you're moving more than half of house\nUh it sounds like a ultimately but even if you rent for six months or something you know I moved back in this price range or you know it wouldn't if you worry wouldn't make any sense I'm ... and so this move down to half of the house is probably a three to five year plan\nCorrect\nOkay All right because you're going to do something to get your income back up\nA without having to completely sacrifice your soul at work I get that part I'm not asking you to do that but I also there's a there's an equation out there that's floating around in the culture that I'm kind of working against subtly and that is is that in order to be happy you have to make less money\nAnd that's not an equation I'm going to participate in\nThat angry because that usually means that you just didn't go do something that God designed you to do because you were afraid\nAnd I don't participate in sphere so um but again I'm not trying to destroy your family or anything like that this is a sizable step back for you all in order to take big steps forward as long as you don't take this sizable step back and settling in and make it your life\nThan I'm cool with that that's kinda where I'm saying so hope that helps a good question and a courageous decision on your part to do that James is with us in Rochester, Minnesota Hi James how are you\nI'm pretty good thank you for taking my call sure what's up I'm ah [noise] well I I got married last year got your book is the

thirty and she's twenty two so she's kind of going through I don't know a front page he makes twice as much as I Do a year and uh it's hard for me to say no we can't go out for dinner or you know we can go to the mall for a day um because you make so much more than I Do [noise]\nI'm Sorry I lost your ability to vote in the household based on the economics\nAt it [noise] that's pretty lame no I still have a vote at I I like it just is not as well as hot as my she just got to you got one\nIt kind of that that's how I feel that's probably not how she feels at all okay\nI'm In ... were among those that's not a good way to have a relationship but you should not make decisions together based on who makes the most money has the most which that's not a good plan especially when one of you starting in the other one's twenty two\nOkay so you got a little more life experience could we agree on that\nThat's right okay good and that's not to say she's in up to twenty two but in this case uh apparently she is so uh in in this particular subject so how are we going to this year's started talking about what we need to do we don't need to go to the mall\nWe don't need to spend so much money we need to get a day you start talking about what after you read my book instead of talking to her about how and why\nYou sit down together and dream and say what if we were out that\nWhat do we have no doubt at all\nWhat what what if we had a million dollars what would we do what could we would we travel would we give more generously to causes what what do we do if we had a million dollars well what's the shortest path to get to that dream\nOf being able to do those things the shortest path is to live like no one else so that later you can live and give like no one else the shortest path is to be dead free and living on a plan in adults devise and plan and follow it children do what feels good\nIt's a sign of maturity to learn to lay pleasure emotional\nMaturity whether you're twenty two

Dave\nHey good to have your math how can I help\nFill my wife and I we have to do that but\nWe um we have that on our house and we plan on how in the house next spring should we pay our house\nSo soon as soon as the weather breaks you putting us on the R\nWell yeah like like four months\nProbably like may or June\nOkay All right so like six months plus or minus All right um [noise]\nOkay it doesn't matter much um the thing I Would do though is if you put the money into a savings account and stood up a a lecture on the house\nAnd you have to like write yourself a note that shows like metal yourself a letter that comes June first assist if the house is not up for sale put this money on the house\nOkay so in other words if you waffle on this decision and the money gets spent on a bass boat it wasn't a good plan\n[noise] okay 'cause that's what happens to loose change it tends to find its way towards an impulse purchase if we change our direction on the sale of the house and I want it thrown at the house\nIf um\nIf you're going to keep the house but for six months it doesn't matter\nTo the other part of my question would be what we at sixty nine thousand currently in savings account does say we don't know how much that America is he would you put towards the mortgage\nAnd emergency fund she'll be three to six months of expenses I doubt that your expenses are that high\n... you know okay so what would it take if you lost both of your jobs or what would it take for you ought to pay your bills for a month\nFor a month mhm um\nEat keep aligned get on it or do\nYou keep the lights on that kinda stuff\n\nI'd say three to four thousand\nOK so three to six times times four thousand six times four thousand twenty four thousand she'll twenty five thousand of the ... the most you should do okay which leaves you about forty clear\nOkay forty forty five clear um and uh to throw at the house and what's the balance on the mortgage\nTwo hundred and eight thousand okay yeah\nSo hold that in an ad to separate those two accounts by the way I'd have a twenty five thousand our account in a money market and not have a forty five thousand dollar account in the future house paid off house Fonda or paid off ... fun\nOkay you know if you don't put a sign in the yard by the first of June take that money on that account and put it on the house okay if you awful and changed\nIn your decision which are allowed to do you're an adult by the way our way my name is a winner who who's up okay Monica is up well who's up\nJust just make up your mind I don't care [laughter] I'm getting signals from the booth that um we can't repeat okay boy [laughter] San Antonio\nAnd sorry to interrupt the reason why I'm nervous because I'm not able to build it back up as high as it started so it makes me nervous to take a big chunk out okay how big is the Trump made about a third\nSo twenty grand at other sixty yes okay\nWell the emergency fund is there in case there was\nObviously an emergency captain outrageous here right so um but but if you think through your single\nAh yeah I'm divorced by divorce okay I have a I have a son already but I stayed in case I re Mary mountain the option to have more ...\nAnd how old are you thirty nine okay All right um\n\n[noise] there's two there's two things that are bumped into my head and they're ... they're they're both are working against each other okay so I'll just say I'm Out loud all the ... and it was just process this together a little bit okay thing one is I tell folks not to use their emergency fund except for emergencies\nGuy thing too is this is very very very important\nTo you obviously it is and uh I mean it's it's ... and you have\nA window of time you know uh so I guess when I'm going to do is I'm going to shop around and and make sure I've gotten all the possible ways to pull this off there's twenty grand the best most efficient most reasonable most safe\nWay is there a Fifteen grand methodology is they're thirty five grand methodology is or other things that I 'cause I don't know anything about this at all um I mean other than the ... you know the high level understanding of it but I'm\nBut I'm going to ... to gather more information anytime I'm buying anything for twenty grand I'm going to learn a lot and you may have already done all that but I'm going to I'm going to really push it on the research always the more options you have when making a decision the better decision you always make you follow me during that time I'm also going to just be piling up cash like crazy\nLike my hair was on fire let's just keep adding an adding an adding an addict but the other thing that comes into my mind is forty thousand might be an adequate emergency fund for you\nAnd that's the ... this is not an emergency we could say that for sure but I\nFeel like I feel like it it\nFeels like it is but it's not an emergency it's not a a it's not an unexpected event it's an elective\nLuxury that's very\nVery very emotional and very very important ... and that's a reasonable statement but but I I think if I'm In your shoes I might declare forty thousand my emergency fund\n\nAnd then I'm okay because the catch most of what would come your way what kind of an emergency would come your way that would be more than forty thousand and extended unemployment will be the only one that would\nRight\nI mean ... ... ... I mean I assume you've got good healthcare coverage\nIdeal but they won't cover it because\nI don't know like talking about that I'm saying if you had a major health issue\nYou know that that would that lead up forty grand but it wouldn't really wouldn't I mean you to get to forty grand if you got you know the ... co pay that's a lot and I thought that'd be a million dollar expense you know so I'd be very and I think you're okay at forty grand\n\nAnd if you declare that then we don't have to declare there's an emergency I'm I'm just process in this with you because I'm trying to figure out what to do it\n[noise] okay um\nThan if you want a superior emergency fund backup later you can do that but you don't have to feel like you've violated\nA ... a principled process to do this then\nOkay that makes me feel better is that logical to you I think so yeah I think though\nHave you got a good friends or family or pasture or something like counseling you and walk in with you on the just the whole process on this and the decision making and everything\nYou know not doing this in a variety of them do what [laughter] I've been told I don't have to worry about it but I Am [laughter] Bye bye good counsel was that what you're saying not necessarily good counsel but friends and family say oh you know your\nFamily and I are wary about who would crap I'm Talking about somebody that loves you enough to look in your eyes and go really seriously what are you doing here I mean our our yes you should do this you know but it's not just a I mean if somebody really thinking this through with you're not just casually over coffee going\nGood accountability good counsel in the multitude of council there's safety and that's what I'm looking for but I I don't I don't hear anything holding me back here in your situation\nVery interesting question though very interesting situation thanks for calling in and we appreciate you being a listener Rami is with us in Columbia South Carolina is that Rami around me\nThrow me high romey high how can I help\nYeah I um I wanted to reach out to you I was recently cold call and buy a kind of a a major insurance provider and they were trying to sell me on a some insurance products so I'd like you know term insurance and with ability which I agreed with and that I needed\nAnd um but I don't like the prices they quoted me were rather high so I went ahead and you know reached out to one of your recommendations and whatnot and got some uh some other quote that were a lot better mhm and ah and I reached back out to them and mentioned it to them and they had mentioned yeah well those are those are kind of like that those insurance companies aren't good their\nUm their their ratings are high financially you want to go with the home or hire expensive\nInsurance companies are going to they're going to be around in the next Twenty years you know I'm going to show you know I was like oh okay um so I Need to buy you may think described as the Mercedes of ensuring the by just said if you don't want to be in like a you know a Chevy yeah I thought I wanted to get your thoughts on that [laughter]\nWell um that's an absolutely ludicrous way to solve the objection okay there are there are financial ratings for life insurance companies if they do not meet a certain level of financial criteria the state that you're operating in will not allow them to sell insurance they're\n... they're almost broke the state will let them sell in your state\nYeah they have to make minimum criteria to just financial solvency you to do that number one number two if you have terminal life insurance and your term life insurance company goes broke\nOne less you're sick and can't get insurance you just go buy more insurance it's kinda like if your car is your check the financial stability of your car insurance company lord no [laughter] right now I go broke you just go get another one\nYou know if you've got a recipe and progressive goes broke you just get a different one you don't think about this progressive have the money to pay my claim\nYou know but you can look I Am best ratings of someone at Zander insurances website and they are all financially solvent as much as this ... that sell any of this stuff that's a that's a complete line of BS roam around me is what it was\nOkay well that makes me feel a lot better 'cause I yeah I went ahead and went with the the less expensive option anyways it's like well I wouldn't the guys like I wouldn't do that from my family and uh\nYeah you wouldn't know the ... and by the way you called called me yeah [laughter] right right yeah that's when they called call you that's just one thing right there but [laughter]\nYeah yeah if you were doing investments with them if you were doing the whole live life insurance with them which we don't recommend that you'd be a lot more concerned about the stability because you have a savings account they then\nThat's a lot more important than it is but one time\n... ... the author you said thirty eight a minute ago\nYeah third well try to do a quick math uh All right\nSo here's the thing I don't want your house payment to be much more than a force of your take home pay is about a third of your take on by today but I think when I had my four oh one K. back and you're pretty helpful late jamming on those four O. one K. it sounds like\nSo I'm going to temporarily stop the four oh one K. your house is not the problem you're toys or your problem and your student loan is your problem\nA hundred thousand dollars worth of toys when you make Seventy five thousand dollars a year as backward\nGuy because they're all going down in value you shouldn't have toys stuff with wheels and motors that adds up to more than about fifty percent of your take on gay or fifty percent of your income negative just cut your income down substantially when mama came home I got that part but still you are over you were at a hundred percent even when she was working\nSo you got\nToo much caught up and things going down in value that's a bigger problem than your houses and you're staring down the barrel of a fifty thousand dollar debt that you need to clear I Would say you ought to clear that and\nIt's probably going to take your three years in the setting if you stop everything vacations eating out and for one gays and sell a toy or to it's probably still going to take a weapon on which toy you sell but\nUm you know I'm getting out of this debt because it hasn't benefitted you\nNumber one number two I'm getting out of it even if it had benefitted you even if you got a fifty thousand already are raised because of it I use that fifty thousand to clear that that the first thing first order of business but I really don't think your house was the problem I probably would sell some toys a no no I Would shelves from toys I shouldn't say that so lightly\nUm that's where your problem is you've got too much invested in depreciating assets\nAnd on your houses it's generally OK I'm temporarily would stop my four oh one K. and I would beat on this debt with a hammer until it's gone\nBut I Want you to do once you're rolling stock and stuff with motors and it to be less than half your annual income now if you say your income coming up very dramatically in a very short order and you want to hold a couple of these toys or something that's fine but still you need to keep the around fifty percent or less\nA because you just got too much juice tied up and stuff that's going the wrong way it's all going down you look up and that hundred thousand dollars were stuff's going to be worth fifty thousand about a blink of an eye\nAnd then scratch your head and wonder why you broke you know you got stuff going the wrong way so yeah I I think you I'm probably got a pass on something that you thought we were going to show which was the house\nAnd you got surprised by me showing your toys but I you know whatever you want or your toys but that's what I Would do if I woke up in your shoes and oh by the way I Am a boat in a car guy I like anything with a motor and it just about\nBut that but the problem with all of it is it goes down in value and so it needs to be a small percentage of your world\nRob is with us in Bend Oregon Hi Rob how are you\n... thank you so much for all the stuff you and your organization view um I've got a question I have traveled in the past the way of employment I've gone from jobs where I had to wear name K. two jobs that were possible careers to owning my own job\nAnd now I'm at a point where I'm starting a business and I wanted to be employee base\nBut my question is for that new\nOne is an employee based business\n[noise] well that that's one where I don't do all the work I have people that I've had people doing the work for me\nCool that's better than you are just doing all the work and holding your job I got ya okay\nRight very gray so now I'm going to ... now I Hope\nTo work on your business you're not just in it okay good\nRight and so when it comes to compensation for the employees is it better to give them more money or or benefits or how do you balance that\n[noise] well when your brand new one small you don't have a lot of choices the benefits of are ridiculously expensive and so um you know like for instance health insurance when when you have less than ten people you can buy health insurance cheaper than you can\nFor them okay and so I'd rather just get more money and let them do what they want to with it or they buy health insurance through their spouses work\nRight attached to that for all that kind of like ... different benefits are very difficult for the business without that are twenty people are less but you can give them other benefits that are not corporate tied benefits like treating them good a tree in my family being there when the baby is\nGoing to the ... or send them flowers for the grandmas funeral and you can treat 'em like human beings [laughter] you don't get treated that way\nAmerica [noise] this is the Ramsey show [noise]\nLet me tell you a story about two families that are

Fifteen or twenty thousand dollars in it I Would self insured through that\nChildren we love them they're precious they're everything they do not create financial benefit\nWhile most often\nI had a friend who had a kid a diaper commercial he created financial benefit but most of the time kids costs money they don't make money and so our goal is to take care of them not for their passing to take care of us\nAnd so the only cost you would want to cover it would be God Forbid and the event you lost a child would be a final expenses cost\nAnd you usually have an emergency fund if you're following our steps in Europe the baby step three to do that and you won't need to do that when you're switching your show I'm cancel the whole life policies on the kids they're sold to you as a

stable job [laughter] you're not going to like I mean you could lose that job it's possible but you'd have to really work at it\nAnd I'm just not like they're not going to make payroll right so um that part's okay but I mean other types of emergencies or the job loss can occur so yeah you need some money set aside as an emergency fund and then yeah you'd be a baby step forward and you start putting Fifteen Percent of your income away and um that would be baby step for\nAnd I do that first in a rough IRA and then I Do it in a ...

I'm and wake up America the FBI Director warns of an attack never seen before here in America will happen we can afford to risk American lives with Hillary Clinton [noise]\nUm and she was one of the people that was targeted by by all of this but other postings you know um if you look at\nA that they don't seem to express admiration for Trump's politics so you got the other side of this you know crediting Trump on the one hand would strategies with helping him open up a sports bar you know why he would put that up there in any way that seems a little odd and weird and\nUh but I think what we're dealing with somebody with the greatest ability\nIs one is from MSNBC is Andrea Mitchell a promise to repay your door apply to your threats\nYou know we will answering coming to see you soon and uh with his arrest by the way it means one lunatic one maniac is off the streets thank God [noise] and um we uh we have to just credit law enforcement for the good work that they do and it's amazing the DNA trail led to this Florida Man\nAt his fingerprints on some of these bombs that basically they were small PVC bombs and from what we can determine they all had powder in them some type of electric\nSome type of electrical connection device director re described it here's a little bit of what he had to say [noise]\n\nEffort and getting those devices to our lab from around the country [noise] we can confirm\nThat Thirteen IUD for sent to marry as individuals across the country each device consisted of roughly six inches of PVC pipe [noise] a small clock a battery\nWiring and what is known as energetic material which is essentially potential explosives in material they give off sheet and energy through a reaction to heat shock or friction\nSo we're still analyzing the devices in our laboratory these are not hoax devices\nI Want to focus for a moment on the amazing work of our folks at the guy left based on their initial analysis they uncovered relating fingerprint from one of the envelope containing an ID that had been sent to congresswoman Maxine Waters\nWe have confirmed this fingerprint is that ... or say\nThere is also a possible DNA connection between samples collected from pieces of two different high eighties mailed in separate envelopes and a sample previously collected from say Iraq in connection with an earlier rushed down in Florida\nThis is phenomenal work with the greatest pressure\nUnder an incredibly tight timeframe\nWe see unbelievable work like this on TV and an Hollywood but to see it up close in reality is something to behold and we are so proud of our team at the lab for their work and keeping people safe and helping us to find the individual responsible\nLate last night we also turns to our partners in the Florida department of law enforcement for confirmation of this DNA connection and we want to thank them in particular for they're very quick work\nAlso want to thank the men and women of the FBI's counterterrorism division who remain on high alert\nEvery to try to keep the American people safe from harm and who move quickly and efficiently into action every single time\nToday's arrest doesn't mean we're all out of the woods there may be other packages in transit now and other packages on [noise] so we need the help\nOf everyone out there every citizen everyone in law enforcement everyone we've got\nTo help with this investigation in the days to come if you got any information please call us our tip line at one eight hundred call FBI or our email line tips the FBI dot Gov\nNo piece of information is too small every ship could be the one that leads to something very important and of course if you see something suspicious suspicious activity please call your local authorities we need all hands on deck we need to stay vigilant\nFinally I Want to thank our partners too many to name from across the country because we cannot do this work alone everyone up here today understands that and we take that to heart every single day as we do the hard work together\nAbout protecting three hundred and twenty five million Americans like to turn the podium over the commissioner O'Neill from\nIraq to re are confirming that they believe they have the main suspect they're worried that there might still be some that have been recently mailed there on the lookout for that but it looks like they have DNA evidence now that ties to this one guy\nAnd uh they have analyzed it confirmed it and you know these guys are amazing what they do every day\nYou know the sad thing about all of this you know I Want to remind you\nBecause you know I've lived through some of this myself at all explain that in a minute but you don't remember when Bernie Sanders ... one of his supporters shot Steve ... shut up all these Republicans at a ball field a nearly killed Steve ... says the fact that he's a walking miracle\nAnd I know because I knew what was what he was really going through at the time was far worse than was reported\nAnd uh people wanted to blame Bernie Sanders if you can't blame Bernie Sanders for what one does listen\nNow I Am I'm not going to do what the left does here\nBernie Sanders is not responsible for what one of his stupid supporters have to say but this most Bernie Sanders supporters are not violent and not out there trying to kill Republicans and Bernie said he was sick and by the entire\nYou know anti GOP massacre here I and I believe him\nAnd I said that\nAnd just like I said in the years gone by remember when the one guy broke into the White House\nWhen Obama was president and they said they came up a number of times I have a number of tape saying that we've got to protect our politicians I'm no fan of Obama's policies but\nProtecting our elected president is is job one for all of us as Americans ... is our elected leader whether you like it or not and here's what I said Mr Speaker you're gonna have strong feelings about this we've now learned that this guy that broke into the White House\nNot only did he get in the door\nBut he knocked down a secret service agent went into the three different rooms of the White House and pass the stairs that would have gone right up to the the residents of of the Obamas that is extraordinarily chilling to me huh yeah I mean what ... ... you're talking about protecting the president of the United states of America and it's just there's no room for error\nYou've got to protect our president that that represents the free world\nSo they've got a very difficult job they've got to almost be perfect and any time any incident happens ah lately is becoming pretty high profile and if we're not protecting our president we're not protecting our leaders we've got a big problem the rest of the world is watching us\n[noise] [noise] so I said that many many times you know and I say this only because um\nThere's this idiot on fake news CNN [noise] his name I but what's his name John Avalon somebody who's taking cheap\nShots of me a number of times over the years\nAnd I want to play for you what he said because he basically links the bombs sent to De Niro to me let's just played that part ... ... ... ... basically blaming me listen to the\nElectron had and he said had a direct language ... may have we don't we don't know who is we don't know the motive but what was fascinating is you see a direct patterns between the president's attacks on Twitter and and the stage and being echoed an amplified by Fox News and other folks in the control projects you can you know it's not like the others right why Robert De Niro\nWell one of things I found was that October Fifteen Sean Hannity was doing a whole segment blessings in Europe for things he said on the Alec Baldwin show of all things which you said that Trump allies will regret it because they made a deal with the devil so that all of a sudden it becomes ... Robert De Niro is calling the president devil and us devil worshippers effect you know\nI'm used to play the victim card but at the top of mind ten days ago and it says she's going to see what is that when we find out who this is um because some of these figures are are more prominent on the on the campaign has been ...\nMe because the narrow got one of these packages well let's listen to De Niro and the things that I've been critical of De Niro about let's listen to what maybe I was talking about\nI mean he's so blatantly stupid he's ... he's a dog he's a pig he's a con\nArtist a mutt who doesn't know what he's talking about doesn't do his homework doesn't care thinks he's gaming society doesn't pay his taxes he's an idiot Colin Powell said it best he's a national disaster he said the virus meant to this country\nIt makes me so angry that this country has gotten to this point that this fool disposal has wound up where he has talked how he wants to punch people in the face well\nI'd like to punch him in the face today the world is suffering from the real Donald\nTrump [noise]\nI'm On what are we talking about [noise] idiot as the president [noise]\nWhat about business owners or managers can you share examples of some of these initiatives\nBusinesses or expanding leave and benefit policies to include elder care and offering flexibility to address things such as child care and transportation also wages are increasing as well including raises in sign on bonuses\nSo it really sounds like a job seekers market right now what else can you share\nCompanies are looking for ways to offer growth and development within the business versus having employees seek advancement opportunities elsewhere and this could mean offering training and educational system it's not just for the job there isn't but for a future career auction\nMakes sense invest in your workforce and they'll invest in your business\nThat's right Sean and an investment isn't always financial\nFrom a simple

the media you get conservatives who say you can't hold\nBernie Sanders responsible because one of his ... supporters went out there and shot somebody\nBut it's there there is an obsession to always blamed conservatives for the actions of some of these ... cases in that appears to be the media talking point for the hour for the day here\nUm you know if you expose somebody is being absolutely insane you you know it doesn't matter what their politics are managed that we keep America safe\nYou know when I when I go out there and say I'm not going to go ... into the silly ridiculous road of saying well because that guy like Bernie Sanders any shot up Republicans on the ball field the Bernie must support that I said just the opposite is true\nYou know it is beyond reckless and irresponsible for CNN and all of them to ignore the rhetoric of De Niro and Madonna I think an awful lot about blowing up the White House\nThey called the president twenty four seven on that network a liar they've gone deep into the conspiracy theory of\nTrump Russia collusion with no evidence but ignore such collusion when we do have evidence as it relates to Hillary\nThey fall into the all the Kavanaugh standard but only because he's a Republican or appointed by Republican but they're in love with the Clintons there nobody vets Keith Ellison or Cory Booker it's always hypocrisy [noise]\nYou know you look at the hearing ... who's been warning that horrible things are going to happen if the rhetoric doesn't come down as the me the most part CNN and these other networks have been silent when Republicans are confronted everywhere [noise]\nPiracy will you we are\nNews I enjoy the odds a supporter of President Trump is arrested after authorities say he targeted prominent Democrats and critics of the president by male authority states either say accent more than a dozen explosives they\nDid contain energetic material or which if subjected to the right combination of heat or shot and friction or could be dangerous to the\nPublic FBI Director Christopher Wray more troops and reinforcements will head to the U.S Mexico border as the caravan from Central America makes its way north
