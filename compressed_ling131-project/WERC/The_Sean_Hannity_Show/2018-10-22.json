dominate the Sunni Muslim world\nThat's the new often I'm an avid won regime of turkey and the birth place of Islam Saudi Arabia and this man was caught in the middle\nHowever however this isn't the fake news we've got to be accurate this man was a journalist wasn't an American so well that trying to spin it was a foreign national read them and it was a common types that you wrote commentary\nAnd he has a long decades long history of ... the Muslim Brotherhood and there's also related to the figures Arab um the ... of the twentieth century ... so all of these things off total statements of factual\nWhat do you think a missed the hop and it's been a while my uh my friend Dan is good to have you back I Know this has been your life and your business for so many years\nUm my gut is pretty clear on this or I think this man was murdered\nAnd the most evil brutal brutal way possible and I think that the president is wise knowing that we're going to get to the truth now there's no doubt we'll go and we're going to have the truth rushing to that point is not smart in my opinion\nI I agree with you uh look there's a lot of evidence that we have already we nailed it Fifteen

is denying it\nI'm kind of having a hard time buying that myself\nBut knowing that there are very different country but\nNow it gets complicated because fall so the Saudis the Egyptians Jordanians the Israelis the United states the Emirates they're all fighting against the Iranian had you had money in the region and their quest for nuclear weapons and the instability that would cause the entire world\nUm I Know everybody Dr Gorka would like to say that okay we're cutting off all ties with Saudi Arabia where Don where this with that\nUm I think this will be consequences severe consequences the president said\nBut it gets a little rougher what do you do if you're also trying to paddle another enemy I mean the United states did partner with our arch enemy is the former Soviet Union to defeat a Nazi ism in World War two\nYeah absolutely I mean if you don't make the perfect the enemy of the good\nGeopolitics is like politics itself domestically it is the the all over the ... the um over the perfect on on the truth is we have a lot of leverage over Saudi Arabia or at the beginning of the Trump Administration we established very very\nGood times through a and B as strict mom it's been found them in a very those relationships are not going to be tested\nBut this is a nation that revival depends upon our support militarily and I'm ... and training so there's a lot but reachable

continues to double down on that is why is the most disgusting thing to me is the fact that she's in the public eye and she continues to use is and what she was trying to do was put to bed so she could run against President Trump and twenty twenty and it is back burner and I'm Glad to see it because she was she needs to do just come out and apologize to all of us\nI'm not running for president I'm not running for president I'm not running for president I Am not running for president of the United states are you going to run so fast that I Know I'm not running and I'm not going to run\n\nHi I'm Geoff Diehl running to be your fulltime US Senator you don't need a part time author part time senator and part time presidential candidate I'm going to put Massachusetts first\nI'm just deal with a guy who's done automatic gas tax and now I Know to stop partisan gridlock in Washington that's why I'm running for Senate against Elizabeth Warren same Elizabeth Warren they call a lease officers racist\nMe I call them heroes men and women\nMy campaign isn't about party politics about getting the job done [noise] Massachusetts I'm Jay Field I approve this message\nOr that is the ad glad you're with us by the way twenty five now so the top of the hour eight hundred nine four one Sean ... is our number\n... ads by Jeff deal Elizabeth Warren well she does have to get reelected as senator she wants to think about running for president from the great state of Massachusetts in the commonwealth look\nHere's where we are this week Elizabeth Warren has claimed for ever that she is Native American we can go back to Nineteen eighty six to Nineteen Ninety five she listed\nSelf as a Native American and the director of the association of American law schools she identified as a Native American during her tenure when she was a professor at the University of Pennsylvania while teaching at Harvard law school\nShe was described as quote the only tenured minority woman and on multiple occasions Warren stated that her mother and father were forced to a low\nBecause of racism surrounding her mother's Native American lineage he was featured in a Native American cookbook that isn't titled\nHow while chow and it turns out according to the DNA test that she released a justice week well it turns out she is approximately between one sixty one sixty fourth and one one thousand twenty fourth\nNative American let me interpret it another way that is less than zero point one percent Native American Ninety six percent European according to the American Journal of human genetics that's less than the average white person that lives in the United states so you have are claiming to be a Native American and our professional career a political career\nFor personal gain claims of family was discriminated against as a result of all this\nThen tries to prove to her detractors that she's right and releases a DNA test showing less than point one percent of Native American heritage now is this all the Democrats have to offer you know identity politics is the worst than I mean you know it's a national embarrassment what's going on here\nOther question is I I Know that Massachusetts plans solidly left I Know it's a solidly blue state but the really want or let somebody that has lied on such a spectacular level to advance her career all throughout her career as your senator\nWell do you have to deal is the candidate running against Elizabeth Warren I Know it's a long shot but\nYou know Massachusetts also different points elect the guys like Bill weld and Mitt Romney at the time so I guess it is possible Jeff that uh the people of Massachusetts can wake up how are you doing\nShowing great to be with you thank you hey this is the state where I'm you know stop brown one when he ran into a ... state that was the model for the on Affordable Care act so uh if we can definitely when this and I'll tell you something the Boston patrolman association has never endorsed a Republican for the U.S Senate they've done in this race\nThe last Republican was H. George W. Bush\nUm when Elizabeth Warren talked about the criminal justice system being racist front that she got so many people angry there's a lot of families out there that care about community safety in here she is insulting law enforcement so this is a different race and I think most people are expecting and I think now that she's made it very clear that she wants to run for the White House and twenty twenty\nI'm no focus on Massachusetts whatsoever\nOn this is a no brainer for a lot of people out there and and of course the integrity issue I'm not really concerned about her ancestry but the integrity of claiming Native American heritage is what I think people are most concerned about it and she says one thing all the time and does another she wants to raise your taxes Sean\nOkay cool so how much do you have personally\n[noise] um well our\nFinancial together now they're not together you're not married okay check me I have about eleven thousand in credit card debt okay and that's it I Know how I have a five thousand dollar car ... and I have about forty four thousand seven hundred in student loan okay cool and what does he have\nHe has only a car a ... eleven thousand four hundred okay and what is his income his income is about thirty eight that was like what is your income about thirty three thousand or ... when are you wanting to get married when's the wedding in September twenty nine next year okay\nGot twelve much good\nOkay so you're not going to be a hundred percent that free and pay cash for a wedding between the two of you with that income those deaths\nMath but I think he would like to do our best\nExactly oh I didn't want you to do poorly understand you just just observing mathematically we're not going to knock all of that out yet so given that that's the situation we need to have a modest wedding would you agree with that\nYes okay she'll ... we do have help from his parents my parents how good how much are they chipping in a while his\nParents are paying for the catering in their reception many which is a huge chunk\nOf it yeah and then um then us three were getting married at that capital ground so that'll be very good\nAnd then um we my parents pay for that dress and then they are paying off though for um the limited free alcohol that will be there\nAnd okay phenomenal good and so uh what do you guys need to put in to add to this\nI'm I'm hoping to stay around eight thousand for what for decoration I'm renting things like for the went in and stuff like that and flowers you think that's too much\nI've done to really really nice weddings with two daughters are like really nice things and um I mean you've got the big dog in the wedding is the reception usually the typical wedding [laughter]\nIt's at least fifty percent of your budget usually the dress and the you know the the camera and the venue is usually aren't hiring the preachers not usually that much\nShell our friend is actually doing it right so so we've got you know we generally speaking really you've got the big things covered here [noise] um yeah you're probably a little rich just for ... linens a lot of people have really nice wedding the whole wedding virgin rent\nOkay and the national average is less than thirty\nOkay for and that includes letting go talk Princess Diana type weddings okay I mean you know yeah [laughter] right so um\nMy mom always says I have a champagne taste with a beer budget\nYeah well I called me to that that's how I Want broke so [laughter] so if I'm you know it's not a big deal but I'm going to back that down in the spirit of\nWe want to get out of that I I'm going to just make up a number of you guys can adjust it your adults you and your ... you and your fiance talk about it okay we're both handy I liked him a good thing so I'm going to say I'm going to say let them cover the stuff they're covering and you put in five K. I. dot camera up OK\nOkay you you could change it you could get for you could make it eight you can change it later OK okay but whatever we do I'm going to put that in the bank first okay before you start your total money might go okay we're going to go ahead and bank five grand between the two of you and I want you to do that and they always\nSay to save up for the wedding and then hey you know and I want you to do that in like too much okay perfect and then two months I Want it passed by Christmas yeah we can do that okay and then we're going to start the debt snowball each individual ally\nDo not run your money together until you're married I Know you said you were a bad idea it's bad for your budding uh engaged relationship it's really bad legally because if something God Forbid happens and I believe me I've been coaching folks for Thirty years and I see things happen that aren't nice okay [laughter] and it's stuff\nLike a car wreck or something weird okay and you just all kinds of stuff happens and if he has paid off a bunch of your debt and you're not married it's it's it's a problem and that's really what setting up here so um\nThe the other way you could do this since you've got a lot more than ... you could just attack your debt snowball and he could build up to five grand\nOkay I just don't want to make him pay for that oh\nWell in a sense he's not because of the day we get married it's all combined mhm and so he's not paying for it we're paying for it okay if as long as it combines on September twenty ninth there's no you paid for it I paid for it okay this is our money at that point right yeah because here's the thing if if he\nUm pays off the eleven thousand dollars he should be debt free\nAnd you guys ought to have the wedding\nAnd then we got you to deal with when you get a call from the honeymoon and okay the actual gonna have Sallie Mae moving in your spare bedroom right well we already do I know but I mean she's still going to be there when you get the honeymoon the gotta get rid of VIX you'll notice over the next year or two but we're hoping yeah the thing is just lay out a plan that both of you agree to\nOkay but please don't I don't want him paying your dad's okay it gets weird okay I I absolutely I didn't see it like that\nYeah it's just possible downside is all there and the upshot is very little if\nYou get to the point that he has extra money the weddings covered and he's debt free and he wants to pay on it it's just ... big pile of cash in on September the thirtieth write checks towards your dad okay but then if something God Forbid happen that everything's still separated between now and then okay and I'm\nSo cool cool congratulations must send you a wedding gift is called the book the total money make over hold on Kelly's going to pick up emotion that out to you very cool stuff [noise]\nOpen phones a triple eight eight to five five two to five or Jill is on Facebook do when you started your company did you borrow money for startup expenses no joy don't borrow money\nTo sound familiar [laughter]\nI don't borrow money [noise]\nUh no I did I start on a card table my living room and I did some counseling sessions and I got paid a little bit for doing some speaking in that paid for the printing and we lost a thing called life after death with an overhead projector in a bad suit and it was a clash that became a\nFinancial peace university and every time a medal of money we bought a little bit more stuff and grew the company a little bit we grew one hundred percent organically which all that means is is the money we made we put back into the company after we ate a little bit of food and pay a little bit of light bills\nAnd I'm just poured back in the company back in the company quarterback and the company um but we never borrow money which means that some things we wanted to do we weren't able to do\nAnd you know what they did protect us from going some stupid stuff cause some stuff we wanted to do that with the money do stupid stuff\nAnd if you do something stupid and you pay cash for it it doesn't hurt near as much as if you do something stupid and get the payments on stupid and in business you're going to do some stupid stuff in business Ninety percent of the other side from you\nSurvive and make all your money on ten percent of your ideas and you don't know which ones they are ... oh\nIt more expensive yeah three four times more\nYou know same thing so can you get a share of early education and be fine out here yeah most of us function on that we didn't go to ... schools that were a hundred grand a year your kids aren't going to either unless you're going to run them deeply in debt which I wouldn't recommend so we show you call you know your local\nIn state tuition schools that you think your kids might go to and you find out how much it is\nAnd we have we've gotten a pretty good start on that we have a a great program here in Iowa that are high school kids are able to take college courses for free and a lot of them are a lot of the kids graduate with not only their high school diploma but also their two year degree at our local community college\nSo we are highly advising older and could do that and out of out of the kids are already doing that and kicking college classes and I'm going to college you said community college is free\nWell if you were taking classes while you're in high school it was okay yeah cool yeah well the other thing you can do is\nIf you don't do that and you graduate from high school you still can go to community college about a third the cost of the typical in state called four year college\nAnd not here for two years if you don't have your first two years of stuff studies out a way because most of the core stuff anyway and you just make sure that that community college will transfer full credit into you know I'm I don't know University of Iowa or wherever it is going to go right\nAnd wrong and our our state or whatever it is you just look at that and you lay it out and you say this is where we are going to go this is what it's going to cost and then you back into your budgets on it and go okay Seventeen year old we're going to be casual so college choice is your biggest\nVariable in a kid going to college debt free variable number two is they make their part time job filling out for scholarships\nYeah jump on learning died\nSuddenly filling out scholarship money and um you know we're we're meeting parents and kids who were\nYou know that they're they're getting two hundred and fifty twelve hundred and fifty twenty two hundred and fifty dollar scholarships and add them all up in a pile and they turned out to be thirty grand and they pay for school not a bad part time job when you're Seventeen\nAnd you work your butt off filling out black above zillion of those things not ten but hundreds of scholarship applications and you try to get the third thing is you take a class on how to take the ACT not just take the ACT or SAT depending on which eh\nApplies to your particular situation and get your scores up because ... that a little bit of tutoring or a class on how to take that test will jump your scores substantially uh with the typical kid and that qualifies you for yet more stuff and then the last one is juniors going to be working\nWhile in school you're going to be working all a view that worked while you're in college raise your hand\nI see hands going up all over America okay all of us work while we were in college why do we think that's child abuse for this generation is not child abuse it builds character I worked forty to sixty hours a week while I was in school and I got through and for years\nAnd my grade students show for it so they suffered it would have been for other reasons like not working hard enough for something like that but I worked my butt off and um you can to and you got to be smart about it you're not going to get through school you know a flop whoppers for minimum wage at Burger King you can't be a whopper flop or you've got to do more than that\nYou get some more you make more money build websites um\nWalk dogs cut grass babysit kids people pay lawyer and plumber rates to babysit kids now it's unbelievable go be a nanny for a rich person I mean seriously and you will get through college right there\nI mean it's amazing what you can get and so a ... some serious box so make some money\nBy the cheapest education in this vital to you in in state tuition community college\nWork work work work work get scholarships work work work work work yet your ACT scores up work work work work work and you will go through debt free and especially when someone's life than he likes you or your your mom

the ... were just kind of figure out we got more nimble infantry is late with us real fast his his wallet was basically his bank account he had no bank account yet\nRight yet or\n... and you can pay off that making a hundred thousand dollars a year and work your way through it and know the twenty nine thousand dollars is not need to go the kids' college fund it needs to go clean up his dad gummed ...\nOkay but it don't it you're the only way that makes sense is if you have a system in a plan where you actually know if the business is making a profit and if it is making a profit what the property is and it's all coming home to pay off these debts\nMhm or if you want to pay off if it's two thousand at the business and call that business death I don't care but we need to be reducing debt right quickly and aggressively and if you're making a hundred thousand dollars a year younger people do that but you guys aren't living on a plan the business is not a plant on your personal out on a plant I can tell by talking to you\nYeah I Know we just got ... in the mail today and we started to do that on average\nThat's a good start ... and I'm going to send you a copy of the book entree leadership on the business side so uh because here's the thing you need to be going no no I'm not going to quit making a hundred thousand dollars a year that's a great business\nYou know I'm not going to quit that but what we are saying then is is that we need to fine tune in give I think you're good at making money I don't think you're as good at managing it\n... to fine tune our systems at the business the profit and loss statements the budget\nShut the business and so we know exactly where every dollar at the businesses going and exactly where it's coming from and then exactly what's coming home and what is taxable income and then lay out a game plan to pay off a hundred and forty two thousand dollars worth of\nBetween these two different sets of death and work your way through it you can do both and use the twenty nine thousand towards that go if you don't do that and you sort of between themselves in that the goal and then you never pay off the debt it was kind of wasted wasn't it so I'm not asking you to blindly throw it at the ... the ... and throwing a system\nAt your business in a system in detail budget at your home and all of that applied directly on this problem she'll the problem goes away and this went on thousands part of the solution to that\nBut the biggest part of the solution is really getting detailed and organized with the money at home and

little too much and uh\nApparently I had a pen decided this and I thought it was more than something different so I thought it was bad food\nAnd ... and I had to get my appendix removed so that put us on a screeching halt yeah wow yeah so that was an emergency surgery that we had to cash flow and we did when everything on pay that off\nStarted up again we're back at it filling out our our thermometer and six months later lucky me I had kidney stones so yeah so I hit the double whammy yeah the only thing that didn't go as the gall bladder I'm\nLindsay this gray to burn than what I Know [laughter]\nI Know that a lot though not urgency appendectomy you almost warrant area oh my goodness\nAnd it happened the kidney stone last two months and the new year so we had to start over that ad hoc sell the but it was because we weren't and stressed out because he knew how much we can pay off you know not so long have you been married\nFive years on the December the first\nSo what happened that put you on this journey Thirteen months ago\nWe had our little guy he's too right now that I had just gone back to work some attorney lease ... and we always plan of big annual trips and you know\nHaving him without oh we'll go do at Disney cruise or something and\nUh we're planning that trip and then I kind of stressed out because we only had maybe three thousand savings and then just didn't sound right\nAnd we knew that you are his parents actually given us I think there's a ... when we got engaged okay Manhattan but it just didn't click back then and then watch them no no well\nThat's that's really what we know we watch them that we stopped at a ... and just didn't stick to it on a cell and I knew that you went on line found that you had an ad and I had about an hour and a half hour commute each way to work\nNow I listen to your podcast and I\nYeah I heard you tell a capital that was on base that too that they're ... they can't go to any vacations and that's when it's ... like we can't do any of that stuff we need to\nReally buckle down half our debt so that's when I came home to him and tell them no vacations we're going to get started\nTo which he was really excited to hear all of\nSudden I was thinking dang\nA payout of pay off dead or go golfing and Florida Keys or something I'm like\nOh our choice I guess is that I I Am but the good news is you're out of debt now and I'm like no one else later you can ... it was like no one there's no what do you sell people the key to getting out of that as you paid off thirty thousand and Thirteen months\nFor me that budget sticking to the ... budget that we never I'm stuck to it through the ... that always change we knew we had extra cash than spontaneous spending\nAs a planning for each month happened and loves the every dollar Applebee's it all the time and cool and so yeah I just sticking to that budget and planning ahead and just delaying send the air and things that you'd wind just waiting on then\nYeah then for for me I Would say it's just you know everybody's different in the way that they approach\nA this debt free journey a Lindsey over here she's an excel guru in geek in loves to see it split out I'm a put a thermometer up there and let me hold her in\nThe whole thing and get me to the top a man to go more goal driven in that way that we build it had it All right but on the refrigerator right when we went on the refrigerator so that everybody can see that we're in debt it's kinda like you know when you're an alcoholic you got it Alcoholics Anonymous now this was it it was like hey we're the ... were in debt\nI Am not I was our way of being honest and I end up front and letting people see kind of be a part of our journey if they enter a home\nSo that people look at you look curiously or like you were crazy or did you get more cheerleaders\nNo it was a little bit of both I mean our family was very supportive but for me the crazy part was that it was weird I I kind of took it took my blinders off and realize that a lot of people are OK with with being in debt and drinking on that and I'm like\nEither way you do have a higher to duck double with an H essay and they lower premium as a result\nBut you'll have to just find out what they're offering do they have a hundred percent pay after the ... um and if they do and you're healthy or you're sick either one it comes out better kind of in the middle it doesn't necessarily come out better\nBut if you're going to most of the ... the doctor will every year and then they pick up a hundred percent that's a great deal if you got like a chronic illness\nAnd or if you're hardly ever sick Ramsey is knock on wood we hardly ever\nEnd up at the dock then in that case\nObviously we save a lot of money because I'm only pay what comes out of our pocket and we never go to the doctor ... so we just end up with a cheaper premium is what ends up with us and the ability to put money into the health savings account which creates a tax deductible account and you can use that money of course to meet your ducked double or\nAny other health issues that you want to cover as you go along so good question good to talk to you Annette thank you for calling in ... in Rochester, Minnesota Hi Dennis how are you\nI'm well under seltzer better than I deserve what's up\n[noise] [noise] well my wife and I started your program back you know and um we've been working our way through where they used to\nUm we have some whole life\nLife insurance policies um each of our parents took all life insurance on us when we were younger we still have those policies Miller we got married we each took out a policy for the whole life um the cash value on\nThe policies as volatile loving housing dollars mhm and we were wondering if we should cash out the policy is after getting her policy\nAnd use that money to put into her snowball\nAbsolutely\nYeah they're horrible product they're just um you know the whole life has to payday lender of the middle class I mean it just as a ... a ridiculously low rate of return on your money and the worst part is when you die they only pay the face value the policy they don't pay the\nThe cash value also which means the extra money you pay to build up savings in their disappears a death\nThey keep your money you know and so it's just a bad\nProduct the math on it is horrendous and you're you're much better off to buy inexpensive term insurance and do your investing anywhere except in a life insurance product and so um that's what I that's what I have done for you know Thirty years\n\nWhere there'd be a tax implications on the money are we pulled out\nVery doubtful and the reason is is that your basis in a cash value policy for tax purposes\nThe the in other words what you paid into it it is everything you paid into it throughout the entire time the policy has been open so if you add up all the premiums that you've ever paid you don't even get that much out and so you really end up with a law she can't ride the law but you end up with having put more into it\nThen you get out so there's no game now\nYou have um and it happens about five percent of the time with an old with a very very old whole life policy\nThere it is possible that the cash value is greater than was paid in which you would only pay taxes on the difference and so you do you use the figure eleven thousand so if you if you found out that the all the premiums added up to only ten thousand than you'd pay taxes on the one thousand dollar difference Whoopi still do it\nRight\nWhen Ninety five percent of the time Ninety eight percent of the time they lose money 'cause they suck\nYou don't make money you know and so you end up losing money on the transaction and of course that's not a taxable event when you lose money no question about that Catherine is with us in Danbury, Connecticut Hi Katherine how are you\nHi Dave I'm doing good how are you\nBetter than I deserve what's up\nUh and and I just got married in August and we're combining our finances and everything else [noise]\nUm and we're working on paying off all I think that we get paid off his car like three days ago Hervey\nYeah mine should be paid off by the end of this year which is great and the next thing we're going to tackle as um I meant for property that eye on 'em and then after that was good until\nMarch that we live and so why are you planning on saving up to three to six months of Americans say fine but we're not sure how much we can save 'em\nWhere two income family obviously we have no kids on but if you thought that my tenants leave and my rental property fat out require like a really different amount that if I have them tell we're trying to figure out how much safer make hats\nWell given that you have two properties that can have stuff break down on them um you could set up in your rental accounts some savings just to cover the rental issues a vacancy or repair I assume you keep a separate account free rentals digging on\nHow much I Wish I Would\nSay I would I Would open up a separate checking account just for the rentals and would pay all the bills associate with rentals out of that account\nOnly and then um and of course by the payments out of there with a ranch in there and then you can tell if you're making money on the rental cars what's left in the account as your profit right\nRight that's a ... a that's a portion is going to be ... here\nBecause everything else was going to be deducted well all the expenses associated with it and you can keep some money in that account to cover vacancies a or to cover repairs and I'm like keep that to do it that way as separate from my emergency fund and then 'cause that's like a business over on the side for the small business right off okay\nAnd then over but then at home I Would have three to six months or expenses there not counting the rentals\nUm because I got the rentals covered in the rental account and you're okay over there um and you know if you've got two incomes and you're pretty stable it sounds like you're doing really well and you're paying attention you might be okay with the three months out of three to six months of household expenses measure\nKnown as your game plan and so forth so a good question thanks for joining Joe's in Austin, Texas Hi Joe I'm short on time go straight to your question\nI um I have a one year old\nAnd I was wanting to get your advice on how to um to hurt each or so we have a clean I'm cleaning it up and getting money I'm from birthdays and um you know they're all day\nAnd I don't even know what we should do with that money and how can we teach them on ants were about the ability to get older\nCool well good for you or a great question yeah you just um I Would have the money inside the five twenty nine invested in good growth stocks mutual funds were course or five twenty managers for college\nAnd so we're going to teach him that his college money is there and was showing that money or as he gets older he didn't need to understand it four years old don't don't worry about them but then there's four things should teach your kids about money for things we only learned about\nMoney number one is work number 'cause that's where money comes from a number two is giving there were three saving in the workforce was spending and you teach them to work age appropriately on this ... okay we're at the gym to work to give ... to ... bin\nSo are you know if it's sharing and doing this we got three kids and a ... in you know they're all grown now thank you Jesus but um but they they uh if it was me in your situation and I've been in your situation or pretty close anyway um I Would write a check today and be debt free\nAnd then I began to build my emergency fund\nAnd when I have my emergency fund a three to six months of expenses than I Will begin to build a down payment if it starts looking like that we need to rent for a year or somewhere to have our sanity and not be living with the in laws forever and ever on men\nUm and take a break from that and get your own place and rent for a year while you save up your down payment there is no Senate and that\nAnd so I honestly we probably would do that\nBut we are people we shot and I figured out were very generous and a lot of ways but we're not generous for people living with us or ... people\nWe just don't do that well we got friends or just moving the missionary with them they just moving so and so one of them and all that we can't do it we just were not work that way\nAnd we're we're generous otherwise but we don't have that ability so honestly when I just just just us I'm not saying you I'm not saying you're bad for doing it I'm just saying we couldn't do what you're doing\nFor very long it'd be for a very short window out of sheer wreaking desperation and then we would go get some kind of little rental and have our own little life until we could save up a down payment but you know maybe you can do that maybe you can hang out there that long but if your debt free today and you land a job tomorrow what do you think you're going to be making [noise]\n[noise] well I'm I'm hoping in somewhere in the fifty to sixty arrange\nOkay so that puts you at a hundred out young household income you don't have any rent\nIf you're living with them and you don't have any debt because I just paid it off and then you need to save up you know Fifteen thousand bucks or so for an emergency fine and start saving for your down payment and then just run that map out how quick can you do that and then ask yourself do we want to rent a year\nAnd slowed down are buying maybe by one year which is not the end of the world it's not you know it's not like we're winning the rest of our life but just in order to have the dignity of having your own space for your kids and and writing the conflict that I mean very few people can live within laws an extended period of time\nAnd it not create in not create relationship string\nAnd it it hasn't been bad living with them and we get along its just after a while you kind of want to sort of be able to be on your own and you know walk around the house and have it be quiet and you know I haven't people given their life's all the\nTime necessarily [laughter]\nA man and I and I would say whoever's parents you're living within ... years or hers it's not it's always harder\nFor the the other the other one show if you're living with her folks it's harder for you\nBecause she's used to hanging out with them and listening to their advice and all that you're like oh I mean we make a hundred thousand dollars a year I think I'll do what I wanted to thank you very much right now and uh yeah but so I'm probably going to land on a rental for a little while and your situation but again I'm not saying you have to do that but if you're asking me what to do with an an chili\nFor sure I'm writing a check today and I'm debt free for sure I'm starting to build an emergency fund and quickly as I Do that I'm for sure going to start saving a down payment\nAnd um and even if you bought and didn't save the ... because you didn't have a full twenty percent that's okay with me to as long as you're on a Fifteen year fixed and the payment is no more than a fourth of your take home pay and your debt free with your emergency fun when you move in after you make your down payment\nAnd you're going to the house will be a blessing that but if you do it the other way because you get all twisted up in a hurry\nYou're going to regret it\nSharon is with us in Florida Hi Sharon how are you\nI'm going good how are you better than I deserve what's up\nOh well I have a question about my husband I carry [laughter]\nUm he's gonna be the next ... and ... than than we've been paying the universal like I said we got married that Twenty years ago and the lord and hey yeah [laughter] um I always have the terrible thing that we found out that I care about a couple of years ago they came to lead to what we pay every month\nWas old enough to keep it at All right so now you have to even pay more

University of tender it's about seven years or else gets paid for and everything else too in the process so very very well done so what put you on this on a journey tell me what happened how did you get started\nProbably that wrapped we bought the house and I had heard of your stuff in church one time and uh I got her name but it really did anything and then I don't know as we move in your show you that five and I happen to see it and then really kind of I Know all your stuff at all though\nRight around that had to do that and we got to do this kind of that's how it all began\n[laughter] whatever of the class\nOr anything like that but we did actually teach one class but we never take the class but it's mostly in your pocket every day and that's kind of began\nGood deal so hours when he comes in cities worst listen to this weird gum and radio he wants to pay off everything what'd you say\nI was actually really on board with that I never had a problem with like over spending that was probably more Bobby I Know I was all for it and let me try to in the house I got rough but now we're on the other side so it's not worth it\nYeah you got no payments at all now you know parents you're thirty two years old you might get two hundred I mean you guys are you are going to be so wildly this was awesome\nAnd it was really cool we paid off the house is on his birthday so when we had it in there and I said well let's just wait until you actual birthday so we we always remember that day I'm so awesome all four of its ... and the kids were all jammed up for it so it's got\nA match on very well done how many kids do is have you got two boys what ages\nSix and Benjamin just turning three\nSo you've changed your family tree happened ...\nOh yeah they don't know anything other than they've been warning to I've never having a credit card which is pretty awesome\nIt was very awesome so proud of you guys did you have more cheerleaders or more detractors as you went along\n[laughter] actually talking about that a little bit earlier ending up with my parents are very proud and you know to turn it on you know some other people oh we got to poke fun a little ... and actually now my friends or anything like that if they don't they don't say anything now\nI guess not yeah you're sitting there with a paid for house or shut up yeah that's what a great interesting very neat\nWell Well Don guys very well done what do you think will be the key to getting out of that is\n[noise] he went there and hang on track\nYeah even when you see when you grow up I mean I don't want to be the most uh as all my idea of what I Want something or\nI like stuff so [laughter] I always like the most expensive thing and I would be the one part of the biggest fuss about waiting or Asian being patient ... artist thing\nOkay good and um okay the uh the thing is is\nYou want to keep an emergency fond of three to six months of expenses are probably keep one of six months worth of expenses\nAnd no one's forcing anybody to invest in anything um the the thing I finally figured out and they took me a long time to get there and it may take you a little while to get there is that buying a mutual fund\nIs not risky and does not keep me up at night if I understand that mutual fund and each track record let me give you an example of how I Know that would be true for you you bought two houses neither time does anyone give you a guarantee\nThat they would not go down in value\nThat day crew and they might have actually gone down in value back in two thousand I\nBut you didn't get scared and sell them as you thought well real estate a workout you know now that's what that means is you're looking at the track record of real estate not the guarantee 'cause there's not one\nI'm looking at the track record and going you know I'm Seventy three I've watched houses go up my whole life sometimes I go down but most of the time they go up and if they go down I'm not going to panic and they'll come back up\nAnd that is looking at the track record you might not have had the actual numbers memorized but good walking around since ... means you observe really goes up in value over time right right\nSo that's what I needed about mutual funds were some good walking around sense so one of the very first ones I ever bought\nWas Seventy five year old mutual fund and um it's got an average annual return over Seventy five years at a little over eleven percent now that's\nFor some years it went down\nSome years it went up but for me that was kind of like buying a house on the street with big trees I felt like I'm a pretty stable neighborhood oh and out of the last ten years it'd only been in when I bought it back then I mean it'd only lost money to two out of ten times\nAll the other years it made money and over the scope of ten years at my money\nSo it was a pretty calm growth in income ... mutual fund and when I was looking at was the track record and going okay\nI Know there's risk in the stock market and I know stupid people lose all their money in the stock market 'cause they buy some little stupid company and the company goes under and they lose all their money because they're just playing with their golfing buddy told him to do\nBut I'm looking at a mutual fund here that's invested in Ninety two hundred different stocks it has a Seventy year track record as a you know tenured drag are you in ... and I can actually look at it and go okay what's your average over the last ten years what's your average over the last Twenty years\nAnd how many times has actually been down\nNow is that a guarantee that it won't go down in the future it's not a guarantee but your house wasn't either and if your house did go down one time out of ten years or one or two or three times out of Twenty years you wouldn't panic you'd all around the house and\nYou know let it come back up and that's how I first got comfortable with mutual funds 'cause you know Rick in my late twenties I went broke and lost everything I don't like losing money on like risk but I also don't like money invested in or sitting in the cow making one percent when it could be making ten or twelve\nAnd ... and so if I got a mutual fund this average eleven percent four Seventy five years\n[noise] and it only does half of what it used to do well that still five and a half percent\nHalf I mean it's got a really shock to go through half of what it's done for Seventy five years that's got to be really bad\nI mean it's like the worst possible ... period of time you know so uh I'm a beat my savings account I'm going to beat your annuity I'm going to beat everything if it\nDoes and that gave me a lot of comfort\nAnd and you know and again on but but the reason you're laying awake at night is you didn't think about it in terms of track record and knowledge\nOf history will give you peace on investments it'll allow you to sleep well in in show just take your time

convince the people of Tennessee that he is something that he's not that he's a moderate liberal and these tapes blew that out of the water as they're calling the people of Tennessee ignorant people in his office and saying that his public position on Brett Kavanaugh is just for show and we saw the same thing in the tape\nIn Missouri with Claire McCaskill you know we've already found out she was a phony but now we really know she's a phony she goes on to an RV tour of Missouri except she's taking private jets looks so Harvey tour\nWith with wings unbelievable but some anecdotal evidence now there I think the Kavanaugh hearings I think this caravan is now becoming a massive campaign issue\nAnd just the fact that there's seven thousand people that are marching towards our southern border to create some type of confrontation oughta tell Americans what the party of sanctuary cities sanctuary states the party that wants to eliminate eyes open borders means\nWhen you look at the amount of money illegal immigration has cost the American taxpayers it isn't in the billions and billions and billions of dollars because if you're in this country illegally and you're arrested for something we paid the criminal justice cause\nIf you go to a hospital hospitals not gonna not take care of you we pay the health care costs\nWe pay the educational costs when your kids are in school nobody's against illegal immigration\n... nobody's against immigration everyone's against illegal immigration we're saying we have a process\nThat we have sovereignty and we have borders and they deserve to be respected\nAnd what does it say about the people that do go through the process legally improperly that's now coming to the forefront at the president's call for a wall is right sanctuary cities and states are wrong there's been so look at the crimes committed in Texas alone when I was down there for that security briefing with Rick Perry\nI mean the six hundred and forty two thousand Texas alone\nVictims of crimes some very serious including murder\nI mean it gets downright scary that we have more instances Mitch McConnell over the weekend confronted some guy banging on his table at a restaurant taking his leftovers and throwing them throwing those out the the door of the restaurant now it's almost happening on a daily weekly basis we got a lot of new tape that we're going to play for you\nBut I think the biggest thing that people need to know is Democrats want to stop all progress what do they want to take us back to\nWhat we know failed after eight years of Obama\nTheir signature legislation Obamacare their fundamental promises which was keep your doctor keep your plan pay less millions of Americans lost their doctors plans and are paying in some cases one hundred two hundred and three hundred percent more than they ever paid before for in theory or coverage\nWe have many states where you only have one option one the health care option that's it\nSo it has not worked out well for the American people it was from the beginning it redistribution scam where you're forcing the young and healthy to buy plans they never want needed or desired\nAnd forcing them by threat of a fine to literally subsidize the sick the elderly and and the disabled\nOr Americans when all they really need is a catastrophic plan and one office visit a year or and they catastrophic plan would be like fifty bucks a month and that's for God Forbid you have a bad accident get cancer and heart attack\nBut the anecdotal hope that I'm Talking about is political even says looks like Chuck Schumer his dreams of becoming the Senate majority leader or evaporating before his eyes\nEven his Democratic colleagues don't think it's going to happen anymore democratic hopes of winning the Senate have faded in the final weeks of the twenty Eighteen electorate with a party now needing to win every one of the more than half a dozen\nCompetitive races to capture control the chamber it's a far cry from pretty much the last year and a half oh we're gonna we're gonna take control of the house in the Senate\nHeidi Heitkamp seat has slipped away looks like it's going to be a Republican pickup Martha mix Sally is going to join us later I mean every day gets worse for Christ in cinema I mean there's just an unmitigated disaster for her I mean you know she thinks it's okay for Americans to join up and support\nIt skipped Mitt treason against their country and support the Taliban we've got that\nWe've got her on tape saying that her state of Arizona the people are crazy and it's the ... lab of democracy and then of course you know attacking border patrol people inviting radicals like the lawyer for the blind shake into town\nAnd meanwhile Martha ... Sally twenty eight years of service serving our country six tours of duty in Iraq and Afghanistan what a comparison\nSo that we have top Democrats are urging caution on the blue wave to temper expectations of new Fox\nA poll has come out top Democrats now they're spending their time managing expectations about quote the blue wave\nAnd sweeping the party into power on Capitol Hill urging caution about those predictions mid fresh signs at the midterms are much closer than anticipated Democratic National committee chair Tom ... has still hasn't condemn Keith Ellison\nSaid today that he doesn't use the term blue wave to talk about a possible victory for the party even though house minority leader Nancy Pelosi who has her eyes on the speaker's gavel said just days earlier that we're looking at a democratic tsunami\nLook I Can't look I don't have a crystal ball I all I Know is winning everything is possible\nI can see a scenario where Rick Scott wins in Florida Ron dissenters becomes the governor Marsha Blackburn wins in Tennessee Martha Black or ... Marshall ... Martha ... Sally wins in Arizona\nWhere we have Dean Heller holds the seat in Nevada which is tough that's a tough state tough race a lot of money being poured against him where I can see Claire McCaskill\nGetting the exit sign Jon Tester getting the exit sign and Heidi Heitkamp saying goodbye and even Joe Donnelly\nThe problem for the Republican Braun in the state of Indiana is well in his particular case he's got a libertarian in the race and that means that the libertarian his siphoning votes away from the Republican broad Mike Braun is now claiming that\nYou know a Brett Kavanaugh surge citing internal polling is now as a leading will see in Fifteen days you know if you look at all of this and add to all of this this is an opportunity one bit of anecdotal evidence\nWe have you know they say voter enthusiasm for the Democrats is that an all time high but you know crazy uncle Joe Biden was at a rally in Vegas on Saturday in an attempt to boost Democratic Senate candidates according to the a P he drew a pathetic five hundred people\nA hundred and thirty thousand people have signed up they want to go see the Trump cruise rally tonight\nI mean amazing I was down in Houston in Beaumont, Texas this weekend and and doing a a town hall with Ted Cruz and then we have four thousand people or around there a moment at a huge crowd and used it as well\nWe're doing better than crazy uncle Joe\nBernie Sanders is warning his party that there is no blue wave coming and he also says that you can't win elections by alienating half the population and I hate to say it but I agree with Bernie you're absolutely right\nAnd you've got to force the hypocrisy so we got\nThe cabin on your shoe you got the caravan coming you've got more mobs over the weekend confronting and and showing nothing but mean spirited hostility to people that are trying to serve their country\nYou've got now two years of magnificent success record breaking jobs and opportunities for Americans it's where you have more safety and security a stronger president versus eight years of failure so we have a choice in this election\nI'm pretty handy around the house but now that I had kids I don't want to spend my Saturday installing a toilet or fixing an air conditioner but thankfully there's ...\nHome advisor helped me find them back home pros in my area to handle any kind of project you can read reviews the check their bail ability even book appointments on line and when my wife love most is that home advisor is completely free to you\nGo to ... dot com or download the ... to get started [noise]\nYour brain is an amazing thing but as you get older it naturally begins to change causing a lack of sharpness or even trouble with recall thankfully\nThe breakthrough in ... helps your brain and actually improve memory the secret is an ingredient originally discovered in jellyfish in clinical trials production has been shown to improve short term memory ...\nHealthier brain better life now available in stores everywhere they must have not been evaluated ... this product is not intended to ... prevent any disease [noise]\nStayed on Birmingham Christmas auction is going on now why go from store to store searching for deal when we have tons of Christmas gets hotline than to sixty percent off [noise] go to bed on Birmingham dot com Howard's I Am attracted credit union\n\n\n\nWe ever afford out that the caravan has now grown according to the Washington Times fourteen thousand illegal immigrants marching towards our southern border the president just spoke\nOut about it with a play some of what he said at the bottom of this half hour out if those reports are all accurate it's a whole lot bigger than previously reported and growing and what you have is members of the caravan chanting guess we could\nAs they're making their way through Mexico all day to day I've been defied the will of one country vowing to test the spine of another ...
