and control your time or book the times that you're willing to do those things around your classroom time doing that so do away with a time oysters intentionally budget your time and look for self employed and or straight commission ideas where\nWhen you work you get paid very well and you control when you work and work a lot I was selling real estate in college now that's a very unusual

drop by Jeff how are you\nI'm doing great Dave how are you better than I deserve book how can I help you to ensure\nSet in the past few weeks or I've been thinking about my personal lives my personal professional wise and I'm I'm also in the process of building a defense contractor and building up a business you know within that\nMy question is are those same personal professor professional wise I'm able to be forklift it over to business wise is that it is that a good way to make a foundation for business um mission statement\nYes um it directly or indirectly your your business your career mission statement as a subset of you\nRight guy and so you've got a personal reason for a living or why what is it um what's my no but what caused me to nobility right what\nWhat am I doing this for one of ultimately and we know as much power money okay the reason we're piling up money is what you know and what are we going to do with it what is it we're trying to accomplish that's your personal thing and then a subset of that is your\nYour why in the different areas of your life the reason for your your mission statement so yeah you'd have a a personal mission statement so to speak um that that attaches to who you are ... and then your career your marriage your parenting your\nPhysical activity uh your intellectual grow to your spiritual growth are all subsets of that then\nUh and so you create a holistic look at things but no they're not compartmentalize our department allies like you don't count at work saying you know no it definitely forklift a\nOver a ... in other words my personal drive is underneath of this one this organization's mission statement and wise and reasons for doing things you know um and so\nYeah it's a neat question I don't ... Noreen by asked that but that's that's my view on it um and of course my opinions always worth what you pay for it but uh it just seems to me if you had a\nBusiness reason for being that was different than your personal reason for being\nOr was not somehow connected it would be income grew it really does that make sense absolutely I mean it would be at cross purposes with each other if they weren't somehow running ... grew in our parallel or subset or something but ... the way I visualize what the easiest for me is subset\nThat makes sense it does thank you very much thanks for stopping by rather good to meet you open it sounds a AAA eight to five five two to five if you want to talk about career stuff\nAnd setting your passion and setting your why and that kind of like the best guy on the planet doing that right now is a guy named Ken Coleman he's one of our Ramsey personalities\nAs his own show and on serious ex um every day you could call that show talked to him tune in\nUm ending up with a you know six thousand square foot home I'm going to only four twenty at the end and also the value of the home at that time what would be somewhere in the upper nine hundred to a million dollars\nOr what is the ah typical home so for ... and within two or three block area of your house\nAbout\nThe typical homes and there's not really a typical home in our area it's\nAll over the place because the tourist property there's you know Fifteen hundred square foot home and then there's also a three million dollar homes across the street so I'll come from my home is about four four ten for twenty\nYeah that one when I was asking I was trying to determine if you turned over to build the neighborhoods doesn't sound like a no causes scenario not an area that's got this wide diverse a price range and that doesn't mean cause I don't want you build a nine hundred thousand dollar home on a six hundred thousand dollar street\nRight yeah and I couldn't get out and we do have a to point three million dollar home just right around the corner and then there's an eight hundred and Seventy catty corner to where I Am at you know when does the baby ... baby it'll do in the end of January\nOkay well sure when it started before then\n[laughter] no no we're or um have you go I'm playing\nHave you got some plans for our own yet\nYeah I've I've been working on that with an architect um were were you know running around or or we want to do but or just um you know I've never spoken with any expert about this and I'm not sure if this\nWas a building you know there's two or three factors one is um you don't want to rebuild the neighborhood we address that too is you want to seek in your family handle you know construction noise\nFor a whatever time it takes you to put this thing up shouldn't be a nine day project may be so two or three months can they put up with that well they ought to be able to ... that's what we're going to do 'cause moving is more disruptive than that\nBy and this project that we are considering doing just because of the the industry that I man we're thinking of going it's more like a fix one project so I mean we're we're considering adding almost four thousand square feet to the home\nOh wow you're just almost rebuilding another home\nWe had to basically tripling the size of the home now you know\nUh so you're going to end up mortgage when you're done then\nWhy a bigger mortgage or maybe I think we're gonna end up somewhere and the four twenty four thirty\nAnd what's your house I am\nHousehold income my my wife makes about ... about fifty five to six grand a month and I'm self employed so very that can go from\nOne of my ... last year\nLast year we were I was somewhere in the two twenty area\nOkay what are you going to worry about her income and you can afford a mortgage on a Fifteen year fixed when you're done but basically what you're going to be doing here is getting a construction\nLoan and then you're going to um reset the construction alone in a permanent mortgage it's almost like a bill miles correct\nAnd you can email you when you're done you need a fully you need a regular Fifteen year fixed rate mortgage\nPayment is no more than a force of your take home pay and if that's where you're going to end up and you've got a process to get there than yes I Would do that um I don't see any problem with it it's just a massive project in your living next door to it um yeah that probably is going to take six months um\nMost of the time when I think of an addition I don't think about four thousand ... four thousand square foot addition to a Nineteen hundred square foot house to\nGender is one of those in Texarkana Hi ginger how are you\nI'm doing All right good how can I\nI don't want it now is my husband and I we have work constantly for quite awhile ... and we have finally paid off our market here on our cars everything everything we own it pay our great we have so much\nUm we're still marking that we are we have been trying our thoughts on security ... are a ... year in me\nAlmost all year how ... ... ... and I think helped me out we had that well now last night we had been going on that end up saving the last minute\nTo minute I get hit by we had been putting our income that we weren't at inciting living off of the security okay my question to you and when our retirement or when they're fighting\nA town mhm and what I think it would be fine how are you here with our income on us carry\nWhy when he got much retiring at the end of next year\nYou know how old are you how old are you I'm sixty thanks and he is okay and how much do you have in your ...\nOkay and the one we don't have a hundred and twenty thousand and our next and we have a lot at another hundred thousand\nMhm okay that's two hundred and twenty thousand and uh just round numbers I mean if you made 'em ten percent or there'll be twenty two thousand dollars a year okay okay I had never figured you know\nSo if you invest and we did that if you invested in it did that and then you add your Social Security too that um I mean you're not going to be living lavishly uh I mean you you have a few thousand dollars a month to liberal but I mean you got Fifteen hundred Eighteen hundred bucks a month coming up this money\nIs we're talking about here and um and plus your Social Security and if you can live on those numbers then you can retire if you want to\nBut a ... that's not going to be an easy I mean it's not going to be retiring and luxury uh but you shouldn't have fairly low expenses because everything's paid off and that's good\nUm I'd love for you to have another hundred in there anyway but if you work a little bit more to knock it out that might be up not be a bad thing but if you guys are just you know you're done and you want to you want to live on that that's fine but I Would not set up a thing where I'm draining down that two hundred and twenty\nSystematically just to retire\nNow because that's there's an end to that game called hunger\nAnd I don't want to get there you don't want to destroy this do so you just live off the gold and eggs only so whatever you know you sit down with your\nInvestment professionals you don't have one sit down with one of our smart Mr pros and talk about investing there's two hundred and twenty thousand in a way that you did it creates an income that you can live off of that plus your Social Security\nAnd if you could do that then you're in a position to do it and um but\nNow that crap what they think about money you're going to take that advice from broke people [laughter] ... yeah and dumb\nI Know I Know it I crave either candidate and like maybe not a country ...\nThey're broke yeah and I'm Wondering\nLike saying that's like saying I'm overweight and I'm going to lose weight and I'm actually doing it and all my overweight friends or making fun of my plan that's kinda dumb yeah\nYeah\nYeah I mean who cares what they think are even I wouldn't even discuss it with them like somebody's been married sixteen times and they're going to help you with your marriage problem\nMan they got the honeymoon down they ain't got the marriage thing down\nYou know what I'm saying right so you've got to Ghana in business I don't go to someone who was bailed at the last three marketing plans and asked them how to do marketing plan I Try to find people who are successful at marketing and emulate those things that's called best practices in business it's the same thing here\nSo I mean I don't really care what you broke friends think about money\nOr stupid [laughter] that's all I mean really I don't yeah\nSo what you've got to decide is do you have sufficient evidence that in your spirit in your mind and ... and and that that the system that were laying out makes sense and you're really going to go do it and if you\nIf you don't have sufficient evidence then don't do it\nBut but you know you shouldn't that would be unwise on your part I don't want you to blindly follow some voice on the radio that would be weird to you know\nBut but you know read through the total money make over go to the financial ... class or something like that and then sit there and use your own critical thinking skills but don't let peer pressure from broke people tell you how to handle money\nOkay\nThat's not logical at all I mean they mean well but they're stupid\n[laughter]\nIt's not that they're you know they don't ... their life doesn't have any fruit in it you know I mean do you have a friend that's really really bad at selecting the men that she dates\nAdvocate laugh I mean you would take the what'd you take their advice on whether or not you're dating a good guy\nNow and I know all around there man meters broken right in the same\nThing here it's just it's just not logical so I I think you're asking the wrong questions of the wrong people or the right questions of the wrong people you're trying to get affirmation\nFrom a group of people that are not going to give you information because they don't have the the uh the capacity to they don't have the knowledge to do it and their their life proves that so far I'm not it's not say they couldn't turn it around after you do\nBut um don't take financial advisor broke people it's a bad plan so hold on I'm going to send you a copy of the book financial our total money make over and read through that and then you decide\nI mean we've helped millions of people get out of that\nAnd and to my knowledge we've never caused a bankruptcy never cause somebody to be home\nSo you know it's it's so it's not crazy\nYou know I'm not telling you catch after four one K. I'm telling you stop including including the six percent German stopped you\nStop putting any money in savings of any kind and let's clear this dad gummed data you bought into it a little ways but you didn't buy into it all the way and then let's go ahead and get it finished and get on a really tight budget beans and rice rice and beans\nAnd if you're broke friends don't understand just smile and not\nJust smile and not but they're not going to understand\nBut don't look for affirmation in the wrong places that'll get you in trouble in any area in your life [noise] open phones a triple eight eight to five five two to five generations in New York Hi Jason how are you\nI'm good what about yourself better than I deserve what's up in your world\nI'm just trying to I'm just trying to get an idea what it's been watching your show for quite a while now listening to you on you too and I'm I'm not a bad either but I still I mean I mean quite what [noise]\nYou know these kind of need some guidance to get out of the what what is the ... are the what is um maybe what everybody calls you for car debt okay lots lots and lots of ...

merely try to influence them but the other the other thing that's a pool is is what I Do something\nTo what I participate in an activity was one of my children that I thought was bringing them harm even if they're grown and the answer to that will be no and you are working to get on a day your son is working to get out of that\nYou guys are made the decision that being in debt on cars and these other things is a bad idea it's not good for your finances and to turn around put her in dead or participate in an activity\nIt's not an act of love and so um I appreciate her sentiment that she's standing on her own and she can do whatever she wants she's right but as your mom if I'm Ninety\nAnd you're eighty\nFive an hour and you're and you're Seventy or whatever I I'm Still going to love you and I'm Still not going to participate in an activity that's bringing you harm\nMhm I Love you too much to do that and ah and if you don't understand that I you know you have the right to be mad or you have the right to think that I'm outlined but I'm just kidding\nNot in good conscience participate in an activity that's not good for you I Love you\nKnow I wouldn't sell it to her okay\nIf I were in power in your shoes I'm just thinking through how I Would I've got grown kids and one of them came to me and said you know I Want to do this thing and you're going to participate in this thing this that that that I don't agree with and that I don't think is good without good for them that I'm not going to do it they should buy five thousand dollar car and pay cash for it\nMhm\nNow how much debt do you have not counting your home\nI mean we have a hundred dollars a day and what is your house while and I I went ...\nOkay so how quickly are you going to have a hundred thousand paid do you think\nWe're looking at two years that's\nAbout as long as there should take max the fifty a year making one eighties not exactly so deeply deeply sacrificing\nI'm now given all of those numbers four thousand dollars doesn't matter much you could just show or the car for four or five thousand okay and not you know but no I won't sell it to you where you go into debt I'm not going to participate in that activity okay but if you want to sell it to our sheep\nAnd just help her um because of four thousand dollars doesn't move the needle much and out of a hundred you follow me what moves the naval out of a hundred is you're getting really emotional about deeply sacrificing and using the huge income you have declared this debt really really fast\nSo given those numbers I might\nGive up you know some of my value in the car or you gotta scrape together five hundred and you pay me cash five thousand you can have a car I might\nDo that but hunting I Am not going to participate you going into bad you're going to have if you're gonna do that you're going to do it somewhere else 'cause I Love you too much to participate in something that brings harm to you and that's even if my kids are grown and\nThat's not me interfering in their life and that's not me being a control freak it's I'm not going to participate in anything\nThat I don't think is good for you that brings you harm because I care about you and if they can't get that statement than they are obstinate little rebellious ... seriously I mean that's just I mean if they can't hear love coming from you that way then there's something\nWrong but in your case with the numbers I might if you're on your show to him cheap that's okay too but he didn't want is fine with me but no going into debt is not an option Amy is with us in Spokane, Washington Hi Amy how are you\nGo to Dave how are you better than I deserve what's up\nWell I've been listening to you for a couple of weeks and I'll bet that night that at filling out college applications that my daughter my son's already in college and\nRight now I'm just like how did we get him into much debt already he's in two years\nA hit that he started at second air on school and my daughter was like I said in the fall but he already has um like ten thousand dollars and a\nAnd school grounds and then we have fourteen thousand an apparent python [noise] mhm\nAnd it so I'm just struggling and know how do I get through this thing and how do I get them through college\nWhere is he in school\nAh Washington state university\nOkay here's what is the tuition\nAbout well the first year it twenty seven tuition it is um around [noise] I Can't even wealth eight and ...\nTwelve thousand okay top that probably pretty close down a little off but there should be about\nThere in state tuition and yet at school or something like that the national averages about ten but I think Washington's a little bit higher okay and so um that's the tuition only and he's living away from home on campus\nNo he's not living on campus you know I think in our trade paying very minimal for rent\nOkay that's good news okay working\nYeah he works about twenty five hours per week right now but he does make about fourteen dollars an hour\nThat's decent okay good good [noise] okay\nAnd we got to get him on a really really tight budget immunity to be applying for scholarships left and right and yeah you guys helped him shut down and figure out what you can contribute to the equation so between his hard work between the scholarships and you can your contribution and the fact that he's in a reasonably inexpensive school\nUm we just sit down and really iron the wrinkles out of this and figure out how we can pull it all together and make it happen with no more debt and don't add any more debt\n[noise] okay so then my question is we had that they're we have a car loan where\nWe have a car loan for Thirteen thousand five hundred dollars and then I've got he's got that ... PLUS Loan now do I start hammering on the parent PLUS Loan or do a camera in the car loan Carla\nA car loan and then the parent plus non yes\nOkay because I didn't know if that 'cause you know when you go down in Europe um that I didn't know investor kids with\nThis number five but we're not investing for kids now trying to cash flow with them yeah help him get through with no more new debt you're you're not you're past the point of saving for college or trying to get through college now\nYes and then my daughter has starting in the fall she is selling out scholarship she does have we do have some money you know not much but a little bit of money saved shirt\nOn good she has worked like an animal and she has only out like ten scholarship application is a day\nAnd again she chooses an inexpensive school the least expensive option possible because you guys were broke and you're trying to foolish together as a family and get these two kids through school it can be done but it's going to require a lot of work a lot of scholarships and choosing the inexpensive school out here and there was no shame\nIn that game some people do it every day and other people go a hundred\nPuts this hour that Iran be showing the bugs and we got to know what it means um remember there's ultimately only one way to be and that's the one day with the prince of the same price and you know\nThat's the producer in the center for the Dave Ramsey pay this hour the show is over but you can find our podcast on ideas are good will play where everywhere every year to surf yeah\n\n\n\nHe was radio nine sixty WBRC Birmingham and on line nine sixty W we are C. dot com\nOn car radios seats four o'clock [noise]\nThe comforter in chief I mean the ... the president and several members of the first family visiting the Pittsburgh synagogue were eleven people were killed over the weekend Fox has gone on Scott has more lively\nA congressional candidates and very important districts it's interesting all up there were four hundred and thirty five so they're all important every ... every one of you listening to my vote I don't care if you think your congressmen as safe or not you better get out and vote\nBecause otherwise if you don't vote that's pretty much a vote for Nancy Pelosi and if you have a Senate race going on in your state that's vote for Chuck Schumer\nThe second potential outcome is a split decision\nSplit decision would be Republicans hang on to the Senate gain a couple seats and Nancy Pelosi them become speaker and Maxine Waters is a chairwoman Adam shift as a chairwoman and let's say Gerald ... is a chairman\nAnd allies are coming the chairman and it's endless investigations into one of the most unbelievable things that we're watching unfold here\nIs what we got this desperation factor of the Democrats I mean even when I think even want to warn you of what they do every two and four years racist or sexist besides you know just seeing a phobic Islamic phobic homophobic\nYou know dirty air dirty water kill children pro granny over the cliff just one you think it can't get worse it gets worse\nAnd the echo chamber if you've ever doubted ever doubted who's the media in this country is pulling for just just watch any so called cable news channel besides Fox\nFor thirty seconds because it's every second every minute of every day hate Trump destroy Trump help the Democrats\nAnd if it means falsely accusing the president of being responsible for the synagogue shooting over the weekend\nAnd not even tell the people there viewers that well the shooter this mad man power hated Trump because of Trump being so allied and good partners with our closest ally Israel\nAnd the same people you know St Trump cause this Trump's responsible for this\nYou know it's a it's it's a sense of madness but it also does show a desperation that is now kicked in for the Democratic party they are desperate\nYou know one thing I think I'm going to talk about pose a little bit in the course of the program today but I'm also on the other hand\nSeems like I'm Talking to both sides of my face I'm really not I'm I'm gonna tell you to just ignore the polls at this point does it matter you still have a job to do and if you want to to keep the progress that we've had\nYou want to prevent hearing the night of one week from tonight\nAnd one day after one week from tomorrow when we talk about the results if you don't want to hear the words speaker elect Pelosi\nSenate majority elects sure then you're going to have to do something about it\nThe worst case scenario is they can win at all\nAnd the only way that's going to happen is if you stay home that the reason I'll tell you not to pay attention to the polls is because they get it wrong so often just two years ago the exit poll showed that Trump lost Florida he won it last North Carolina he wanted\nThat he had lost Ohio he won Ohio that he lost Pennsylvania He won Pennsylvania that he lost Michigan in Wisconsin and he won both of them\nAnd the media nobody there were candy because they read these results as I was on the air at five Fifteen I had it before everybody else\nI remember my first break it at the about twenty after the hour I called then candidate Donald Trump and I said somebody's going to come in in about a minute with bad news and tell you that you lost everything don't believe it\nI said I don't believe these polls I said there's no way these polls are accurate and he goes why do you believe that and I told them the story about two thousand and four where the median again the polls came back\nAnd George Bush and Dick Cheney and lost Florida Ohio\nPennsylvania and it was over and Dick Cheney called the radio program this radio program at you know on election day two thousand and four or five thirty five and reminded people they still have time to vote because he read the same information that I just read\nA John Kerry was going to be the next president you know you go back in you know other polls would they'd been wrong twenty four team\nYou know let's go back with the election one week away it's coming down to the wire conventional wisdom is Republicans will pick up a few seats in the house or in the Senate but lose the house\nBy a painfully slim margin one of the reasons is look if you look real clear politics that's based on polling polling is not totally inaccurate information there's some things you can glean from polling that are\nAnecdotal maybe the way to put it helpful in other ways right now real clear politics has the Democrats are two hundred and five seats locked solid\nOr leaning Democrat it has leaning Republican rock solid Republican two hundred that's a five seats difference but because Republicans have\nThe majority of ah right now that means that they have more seats they have to defend is like thirty seats that they call toss ups that could swing one way or the other we've identified these we put them up on Hannity dot com you could check it out for yourself\nAnd the only thing that can make a difference is if you want the progress of the last two years to continue you\nGet to decide how you're gonna feel a week from tonight I mean when the if you watch go back the media in twenty sixteen this five Fifteen they were getting\nWell it's pretty clear Hillary I think it's going to the next president Frank Luntz who's reporting from Times Square at six Fifteen and I'm watching him it's over Trump lost it ain't happening turned out not to be true turned out the polls were wrong and I'm not criticizing Frank he was reading the polling data\nI had read the same data\nSo if you don't have the sense of urgency I don't know what I can say or do to give it to you but the media is all in on helping the Democrats get back the house and the Senate and they're doing everything within their power to make that happen\nBecause they hated Trump since the day walk down the escalator with millennia I think it's worth noting now that conventional wisdom does not exactly have a stellar track record this is where I urge you to be cautious about the polls and don't let the polls influence your motivation here\nBut it's not only were they wrong and twenty six team they also wrong in two thousand and four they were way off in the last midterm election member Republicans were even saying oh because Ted Cruz's fellow buster oh we're going to get cleaned out in the Senate that didn't happen\nOne year before the twenty fourteen midterms of media insisted the GOP hopes to recapture the Senate were dead on arrival because in October Ted Cruz had filibustered Obamacare and shut the government down for sixteen days good for him makes me like Ted Cruz more\nThe expert such a short us a hundred percent certainty in twenty four two Republicans are going to pay huge price when the twenty four team midterms rolled around Thirteen months later the GOP not only won back the Senate they did it with a nine the Senate landslide\nHow remembers the night went on in twenty sixteen media was kinda Getty\nBut then that getting this began to give away to a little bit of a little bit of nervousness I think we got it still but uh yeah to get a little tighter than we thought isn't it\nAnd then I turned to do it all out melt down depression collectively by the media and they couldn't believe it because you we the people shocked the world\nAll that but an old for it's happened and fourteen and it happened in sixteen no reason it can happen in a tea\nYou should do it for no other reason because you want to keep America on the great growth growth trajectory we're on and maybe for another reason to watch these idiots in the mainstream media these sanctimonious\nA self righteous they're not news people advocates that they are the extension of the Democratic party they're going to lose it if the house remains in Republican hands and Republicans pick up a number of Senate seats they will lose it\nJust like they did in twenty six he this is a this is all white latch CNN was reporting that night anyway the so called experts saw the Republican landslide coming that none of them saw it in twenty fourteen no very few of us saw that we could wait\nI'll give you the let's go to twenty fourteen final Wall Street journal\n\n[noise]\n...

eighty eight percent of Bloomberg that was a pretty quick thing I'm\nHere's an interesting article so the president and millennia go to Pittsburgh today after the terrible shooting in the synagogue in Pittsburgh on Saturday and no one in the media and all the people in the media there actually blaming Donald Trump for this it's outrageous\nIt is ugly is twisted it is sick it is the family tore\nAnd frankly the there's there's gotta be some legal standard at some point that you ought to be able to sue for such slander and libel those comments like this\nAnyway Jeffrey Myers the pits Pittsburgh rabbi who watched eleven of his congregants gun down during their Saturday services saying he's now become the political target and then\nHe's receiving hate mail for saying he would welcome the president to his place of prayer it's unbelievable anyway you had all these wonderful people they're going to praise God in a temple and their gun now\nAnyway the organization told reporters they now have received three phone calls today a loan from a non identified man swearing and angry at them they wouldn't elaborate exactly what the caller said they did tell reporters that it was anti Semitic and\nPro Trump while the guy powers that was responsible for this murder and terror in the synagogue was anti Trump and his Ron ... said the ambassador to Israel as a Bebe Netanyahu has said\nYou know they've never heard any one president ever say stand up that if you destroy our friends our allies in Israel we will destroy you which by the way is the way it should be\nYou don't get to kill innocent men women and children in a synagogue\nIt's unbelievable the ... the race the rushed to politicize pretty much anything and everything that is Donald Trump [noise]\nYou know the rabbi said on CNN Trump is my president he's always welcome to visit\nYou know ever since yesterday morning of the fake news fraud media's been circulating what is just the nation is why that somehow Pittsburgh's rabbis didn't want the president to visit and pay his respects after the massacre\nRose tenant friend of this program she was home with those yesterday you know she exposed\nThis is their hateful garbage in broad that it is and say in those comments come from you know some fringe group but not from that not\nRepresentative of anybody the mainstream of the Pittsburgh Jewish community\nThe Jerusalem Post today points out you know that this radical group out there or whatever they're not it's not mainstream it's a political group and they want to give them any attention\nAnd then anyway and it was so they invited a I guess an interview rabbi Jeffrey Myers he gave a prayer yesterday that was beyond beautiful\nI mean how pastors and priests and you know people the cloth are able to lift people up when I'm sure they themselves are just dying inside I don't know it takes a very special anointed person to be that kind of person Donald Trump's my president", "year": "2018",
