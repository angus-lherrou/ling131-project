your own and so um you know you just call it out and you just have some fun with it laugh about it to be sarcastic about whatever your family gift is right\nAnd I'm In some of them are going to be upset but there'll be upset 'cause you don't buy their food then well oh well you know and as far as friends go do the same thing but if this is a continual thing then we just\nAren't you know it's not a real friend because a friend that you have to bother relationship that's called prostitution and that's not friend okay and so um you know I don't have to buy my friendships\nMy my friends I've got friends that are wealthier than me and friends that are nowhere near as wealthy as me I'm doesn't matter I might buy dinner but that's my choice not on their expectation I'm\nI'm pretty generous um I've done a lot but I don't I don't think about it but the point my wife is like you really don't need to pay every time but I don't I'm not worried about it is but if I ever sent somebody being title I'd get all hillbilly and a second you know I'll be like no you're not entitled\nUm and my wife has a little bit more uh she has this thing about fairness and so she wants everything to be fair and I'm just here trying to explain to her bears what happens at the county fair is not going to happen but\nBut you know you just ... that's okay I mean you talk it through is what I'm saying and you're going to find occasionally somebody that you're not going to be able to continue in relationship with\nAnd um that could even be family if it's extreme but hopefully it's not something like that that's very hurtful for you\nBut um most of the time it's just like no you know we're paying our share you pay your shirt split it up or this time we're going to give you a gift and we're going to pay for everything but that's on your option is not a gift if it's entitlements such a good question though um and that happens more\nIt probably happens more to people with family than it does

I can\nI T yeah she said okay so you like technology yeah All right\nWell um I I think the first go before you go start your education process is you need to have an idea of what you're going to study because that will change the answer to your question that you asked okay so let's say for instance that you wanted to be a Web programmer\nAnd um I've got folk guys on my team that make 'em in excess of a hundred thousand dollars well in excess of that that that are right ruby on rails code okay\nNot I'm not a bad career and uh that's an example of an ... type of thing okay and Web programmer writing code\nNow if you're going to do that you would not need and it would not be preferable for you to get a four year degree in information technology that's not necessary to do that\nYou would need to take some classes on how to code and you'd want to learn you know some of the basic IT things and so I Would probably direct you towards a vote tech type school or which is probably a two year degree\nWhile you're studying doing that and I would tell you to work your tail off in the technology field uh and if you can\nUh you know bring coffee for people who are doing code and just watch over their shoulder and learn from them and hang out from them and you're a new hobby is hanging out with people who are world class code riders voters then uh you know and you're taking some classes that'll get you and they're more than a four year degree will get you and then it's a lot cheaper\nBut it depends on what I mean when you say a tea but you could change your mind about I'm ... I'm not going to do a T I\nWant to go into business well then you might want to do a four year degree with a degree you know the specialization in marketing or finance or something like that and in that case the answer would be different on how to pay for it here's the thing you want to number one carefully select what it is you want to study\nAnd that it makes your eyes light up when you talk about it you kind of smile down inside when you talk about doing this\nThing whatever the thing is okay you know once you've selected that then you decide how to study it if it's a four year degree if it's a two year vote tech degree or am I going to go to a community college for two years and then go and those credits all transfer and then go to a\nRegular school I mean for your school for two years to finish up or that kind of a thing\nCommunity college is a lot less expensive and you can get your basics out of the way for the first two years for a four year degree if you want to show the second thing once you've determined what you want to do and how you're going to do it then the second thing you do is\nCollege cost is the number one cause of student loan debt and mayor and what I mean is that you can buy a Bentley\nOr you can buy a use to pick up truck both our transportation but one is several hundred thousand dollars and one is just a few hundred dollars\nBut both of you know the mall\nInsurance world is full of gimmicks particularly the life insurance world and anytime you hear a gimmick it's almost always a good idea to run\nYou know here's another one you should have long term disability insurance everyone should have long\nTerm disability insurance if unless you are in in in an industry where each such high risk and you just it's nutty it cost you ten thousand dollars a month to have it you can't 'cause you you know you're\nA high rise window washer or something like that right you can't get long term disability insurance but other than that everybody ought to have long term disability insurance for most of the time you can get it through your work and it's not that expensive if you have long term disability insurance don't buy wave your premium\nOn your life insurance\nAll that does pay your life insurance premium for you if you become disabled so what is that it's a little tiny baby miniature\nLong term disability insurance policy salt is and it's a very expensive one very expensive\nIt'd be better off to use that same amount of money to increase the coverage of your existing long term disability or help you buy it if you haven't bought it yet and you heard me today and you need to get long term disability\nOr you go just like that again gimmicks they're everywhere particularly around the life insurance world and just buy insurance oh you know I don't want friends with that no one will fries with that I just wanted a hamburger no I don't want for us with\nYour friends with that there's always an upgrade there's always an up say stay away from it Benjamin is with us in Wichita, Kansas Hi Benjamin how're you\nDoing great how are you today better than I deserve what's up [noise]\nHave a question for you my wife and I are currently working on baby step to uh we have one more quote unquote non mortgage debt to pay off what should we paid off by the end of the ear and we'll have um [noise]\nThat is technically it's technically a mortgage because we bought a house to use the rental so that would be true right so I didn't know of that for rental um at that\nStill considered a debt and should be paid off as part of baby step to six or we should move that now it's six she with mortgages are insects okay even if it's not my home even if you're or the rental even your home\nBecause it's usually it's typically you know and most people listening if they have a rental property it's a large debt\nAnd we're we're done with the baby step too as we are getting rid of all the ... and or consumer debt sometimes are large but we're trying to get rid of all of that and that really gives you a huge amount of cash flow to do baby step three finish your emergency fund for Fifteen Percent of your income going into retirement and five kids college in six\nOh we'll go ahead and pay the mortgage off or out on the rentals and our personal residents Emily is with us from Cincinnati Hi Emily how are you\nHow about yourself better than I deserve what's up\n[noise] um my I mean I we sold our house and purchased a um flash rental flash home we buy horse farm and so we are renting out the horse farm facility but living in the house\nAnd what we're renting out paying our mortgage mortgage is very large now\nAnd I'm kind of panicking about that 'cause I don't like that at all [laughter] my husband is looking at it as a business and investment um and I want to pay it off really act that we've heard that we don't want to pay that off very it got the tape that that\n... I don't know I Wish I did my husband's income payroll got going down down it was\nSo businesses should be in that\nUm that people have told me that night I don't like that idea you know\nPeople are stupid [laughter] people ... don't listen to ... stupid broke right now the best businesses in the world or the free ones\nRight now and so one of his whole thing was paid off you know how much should be making oh my goodness gracious [laughter] so much on the ... on this horse farm we oh four hundred and thirty eight out in the news gracious\nAnd right it's worth over seven hundred and Ninety seven fifty\nAnd what's your household income\nI'm a hundred and nine and then we get five thousand dollars a month rent the horse farm\nAnd what if they don't pay the rent\nUm they have to eat and how come\nYou know you're screwed\nYou're in a ... yeah they don't pay the rent is what happens you have all year round to be scared you have a lot of risk here yet or risk one tenant and if that one tenet doesn't pay it messes up your whole world\nThat's right that's called ultra high risk should you pay this off yes as soon as possible ladder salad one of the two this is an accident looking for a place to happen I Hope you get out of this and tacked\nBut I Would I Would do everything I can to reduce the debt as fast as I possibly could as quickly as you can get it paid off and then it's not a big deal if they don't pay the rent because you don't you know you don't fall over dead\nBut financially she I mean you take five thousand bucks a month out of your life you got nothing left some bad bad situation so yeah you need to be scared you're smart to be scared and all these people will say you ought to keep that in the situation there what's known as stupid people\nA man James is with us in New York Hi James how are you\nDoing well how are you better\nThan I deserve what's up\nI have a quick question I'm I'm ... I'm I make about a hundred thirty thousand dollars before taxes I'm Sorry\nI'm my question is is I live in an apartment and I woke up in an apartment and eventually they are at home\nBut everyone at telling me that I'm hoping park open up an apartment I should just stay where I'm at and saying our home but I like uh gone through a lot and I want a nicer apartment what would you recommend\nI've gone through a lot so I Want to waste my money\nUh how's that a reward\nSee here's a guy or whatever you spend on rent is lost right\nYeah the\nRent is rent is patients while you get the money together to buy something and so I Want to pay a little patience for money is I have to pay so that I can buy something as soon as I can buy\nI mean you could go rent something really super nice in super expensive but it would mean you never buy some of your mom and super nice thing right there just spend all your money on rent\nAnd you know that's a dumb idea obviously so um I I Will be with whoever told you that you stay where you are and a pay as little as possible because it's patience and it's gone down I was down the toilet whatever you're spending ... gone\nSo I Want I Want to minimize what I spend on that so that I can get into a homeless quickly as possible it's living like no one else so that later I can live\nAnd give like no one else and and you know that's the best

but not necessarily complimentary I guess\nWell but there is a strength was math so what about math what were you good at with ... it's the solving problems it came this idea of how you solve a math problem very difficult for me Christie I mean I'm not kidding I'm terrible at math my brain's not wired in a way to be able to break in algebra problem down but Katie you are good at solving problems correct\nCorrect All right so that is a starting point now what work have you ever dreamed about doing or you just wonder if this would be amazing if I could do this at some point in your life you wondered about something what'd you wonder about\nWhen I was a kid I wondered about no rocket ship and you know getting into space and you know what would it take to get them up and you know the whole NAFTA mhm idea when I when I was a kid was really fascinating\nOkay so here's what we've got we're not going to solve it on this call but Katie here's a guy you've got a starting point to go take those homework questions I gave you the people that know you and get the answers and here's what you're going to find\nYou're going to find that there are some patterns and there are some themes that continued to develop so there's already Christie a tie between being good in math and being fascinated by rockets\nBecause every NASA person I've met a lot of men about four or five every one of them very good in math and science\nSo you're beginning to develop some themes here\nAnd you're beginning to see some pattern now for you you have a very specific challenge you need to work ideally from home so this is on line work this maybe are not available to you and an online forum but the reality is\nIs that you begin to discover different jobs that you would enjoy because it allows you to do things that you're good at like ...\nLike the science like the problem solving and then you begin to see things waste I go I enjoy that because I'm good at it but I Know you run into this a lot\nYou

you're things that make you come alive does things that you weren't good at are still good at maybe have just\nLost touch with are still in there and so it's going to take a little bit of suffer flexing and discovery just like Ken said oh I heard you that I I wrote in my book Business Week five e questions that help you know your strengths them in a given to you really quickly what do you enjoy\nWhere do you excel what do others encourage any what gives you energy and what types of things come effort less to you\nAnd your answers to some of those questions will start to lead you in the direction of your strengths exactly like can talk about and you can ask other people or what do you know what what are the patterns of what people say hey you're so good at that are man you oughta you got to do that for a living you know what are the things where you excel in relation to other people just like ... what are you good at I Know you're good at things and so\nSometimes we get really overwhelmed with identifying are trying to get all squirming like oh I just wanna be humble and not good at anything but you know if God made you good at something Katie own it and lean into that and

building wealth should go get it today Dave Ramsey dot com or Chris Hogan three sixty dot com and of course they were excited about this the research was eye opening\nFor just a book trailer gave everybody else and I said in fact many that's amazing\nAll right we're going to get to your business questions your career questions you stuck or you're confused scare you got an idea you're ready to launch but needs some advice from Christie we're here for you triple eight eight to five five two to five let's go to Katie who's on the line and St Paul Minnesota Katie how can we all\nHigh hiking right here I'm On a secret huh hair like me I forgot I married a man you got three kids I work about four to five job I marry in architecture he'll get\nOn the climate right now and excited about what I Do my passion architecture and they have ... my\nYeah that and however I have no idea how long I can barely keep up with this ... about a year and a half ... type of working at about sixty hours a week on which is\nA lot for me to sing having you know a husband and family life and you know but you'd recommend I can do don't burn out but I you know we're going to ... the aircraft and played architect yeah hopefully in the near future\nLet me ask you a couple of quick questions here I'm ... years ease our league contract jobs four to five of them understood you quickly you got four to five that you're spending like plates all in architecture is that right\n[laughter] so whatever van on is a forty hour salary job or the other three are yeah contract project by project hourly found here some you know long distance\nOkay so the reason I'm asking this is it it'll it'll color our advice a little bit uh what happens if you back off do you have to work sixty hours to make a certain number for you all to be comfortable with that what your reality is [noise]\nSo right now he asked my husband will be returning to work and that beginning of next year we had to pay that they only had a baby about a year and a half ago and so our financial situation will change at and kind of January but right now yeah kind of went around with the baby steps that does that work I have to\nAnd then just to clarify for Christian I the ideal dream is for you have your own architecture firms that right\nCorrect the only factor in play here okay you want to know best path to get their correct okay\nI'm going to say one quick thing and let you go here's the deal hang on until the hubby gets back to you know what I mean you got to hang on and you can do it here we are in October first years coming right now you have to do it so I think that motivation just hang in there and then 'cause he's going to were well known about the plan to get their\nQuick quick question Katie that contract jobs you're doing in addition to the fulltime salary job or those something you're running independently already or do they go through the main company that's paying your salary\nSo they're different companies okay I'm not clear yet two of them are kind of actually my own projects I work on out here in Minnesota the other one is there a company I used to work four years ago that you contract court for\nPerfect okay they don't pay that sorry yeah the\nThe reason I'm asking is because when you go out on your own even if it's just getting that first client or two that can be the scariest part\nTo validate can I Do it on my own and can I make the sale and can run this whole thing without having a boss that kind of back me and you're already doing it and that's why I'm so excited to Haiti because you're just going to do more of what you're already doing a little bit and just like Ken that\nYou've got this light at the end of the tunnel when you're going to start increase your family household income in other ways to your husband\nBut in the meantime if you want to spend the next two to three months building up the demand to clients the relationship even just taking people to coffee starting to gather interest\nWell uh I'm going to start with the good old fashioned grandma sitting at the dining room table and you've got a piece of paper you draw a line right down the middle of the left side you write prose and I saw you wrote your right cons because here's the deal you are experiencing gross what are you seeing just a moderate projection over the next two years that growth could be\n\nModerately I think you know we could probably be competent almost saying we could double our uh our sales\nI just okay so here again of course the alternative ... but I'm just saying\nI Would I Would not do anything until I had a list that said there were double the amount of prose with crazy upside than there are ... and right now on the surface Christie I don't see what the pros would be unless I'm missing something she's going bananas\nHigh arms flailing ... time to the lady raven\nHere here's a jumped out to me and I hear that's in your voice because I have got entrepreneur in my DNA we get so excited about shiny and new and someone has an opportunity here's my question for you or even\nIf they had never approached you would you want to sell the business\nWere you thinking about selling business is selling the business something you want to do if the opportunity had not presented itself because that's your motivation is in line with your goals your game plan is that something you're excited if that person never came to you\n[noise] well that's a difficult question we can all the time I Love what I Do and a half the time I Want to know for my hair\nEntrepreneurial journey that's just a real live [laughter]\nYou know um so I I I think if the if the situation we're right that then we're absolutely interested um you know I I understand what you're saying it's typical for someone like me to think about working for somebody else\nUm but that these people you know that that are interested um uh we believe our values the line um you know they talked about keeping us on and the staff on and continuing to grow and operate more or less how we are now\nAll right so let me put you to the test Ruben let's say you say yes to this they've made you a financial offer you don't have to say it but you know what the number is correct\nOr we're not quite there yet okay\nWell we'll get even more so let's say that it's a very attractive number\nAnd I want you to say okay they give us a really attractive number that raises my eyebrows and then I Want you to think or if they do what they say they're going to do and you stay around for a little bit but then eventually you're out\nIf you get the number that makes you really excited but you know that it's possible that they push you out at some point in the near future and you are just left with the number and memories are you going to be okay\nWith that I think that's what Chris you said it's really shiny and it should be shiny I think there's a lot of shy but let me ask you what you want is that where you cool with that\n... years from now you would be cool with that [noise] [noise] yes I think I Would be okay when you know hey you got to go with your gut on that one that's the thing is like in business we would lie for there to be an absolute formula that said this is always right\nThis is always wrong there's black and white and are certainly some of that\nBut a lot of times it's business owners were making a value call there's going to be rescued away\nEither way you're going to take on risk of okay I'm going to sell it and then I'm Out like I'm Out forever I'm giving up this baby I I'm getting up ownership to what to cross could be in the next three to five Fifteen Years or you could say with it and you're like man there was a risk where I gave up that awesome offer the shiny thing so\nThat's the thing in business you're you're really asking Reuben I think of value decision of what do you want what's in line with your goals where you want to be in three years you want to be sitting\nDreaming about something new with that off and I'm Out in your bank account or do you want to be in the business and you actually taking credit for all that growth both both could be great it's really up to ...\nGo with your heart run the scenarios use commonsense go with your heart let's go to Adam is on the line in New York New York Adam how can we help\nHey guys thanks for taking my call so uh I'm In a career very started career decent income wife and I paid off pretty much all of our debt except the house and it's coming to the point right now where you know our idea for Fifteen Years and I don't know\nThey're starting to kind of watch the business ideas so what it is is I'm looking for a pet friendly public workers food and beverage to you know bringing the community together\nUm found upon location um landowner one two hundred thousand a year for a week and basically it's just kind of I Know there's a demand out there for it I reached search but from there don't even know where to start\nHow would you monetize this is the sale of the food and beverage is\nYeah so it would be felt food and beverage or along with kind of like a membership fee to get in a department\nJust so you can drink we are like\nA mix between it's a mix between like like a gym membership and public dog park that offers just you know unlimited access to the facility but then also food and beverage is republic\nOkay I've got a question for you for this market 'cause you said you've done research you said there's demand for it for this particular particular market that you're going to serve that's going to pay this membership fee and so on what\nProblem or you solving for them through the business\nSo in the area that I mean right now they don't have any type of public access dog park for at least twenty five mile it's all private offered down and wrote the story\nSo this is a dog park meets food and beverage meets\nTech yeah So Adam she's asking the core thing there is no place to take your dog isn't that the big one you there's no place to take your dog to run around there's no public dog park\nThat though there are but what the town does is they're constantly limiting the hours that I have access or anything like that so this is kind of just a blend between\nAll three I'm primarily yes dog park um but then also it kind of like a gentrified type of situation where you know if I Want to go there and have some type of craft beer or food truck style food um you know all that is on premise\nAre so here's what am I challenged with Adam 'cause I Know we're running short on time\nI I don't think your idea is bad and you seem like you've done your research and I totally get it so I can totally see hipsters with their dogs and their laptops eat and drink and expensive ... like I can totally see what I Want to challenge you to do is\nThink of a one point of arson that the ten point oh version I Want you to think of what is the lowest lowest hanging fruit what is a way to baby step your way into this business without the risk and the commitment of two hundred grand that you may or may not have when the demand may not be there yet\nHow can you start this up on the ground floor organically in a local park in your backyard on a really unimpressive version to justify it gets some revenue coming in before you take the next step I just want you to prove the idea\nBefore you take out some raskin cost and that type of thing I just want to challenge you what that's the big dream what the baby version of that dream that you could test first\nThat's really good advice this is an idea I don't know if it's a good idea but I got to give it to this might be a thing where you start to sit down with local town leaders and go hey we need a full public\nParks just for like ... no limits none of this stuff just anytime you want to show up your show that's meaning the first need then do have one of the changes that I could get a license to sell so that you got to buy stuff that was at one point or you got to start getting mines in the root cause the two hundred thousand dollars and it's hard\nTo get people to pay for something they expect for free I don't know what it's like a New York but in Tennessee dog parks are free so I think he's going to sell the food and the drawl of it though all yeah but people have a free place to hang out to get food they don't have a membership I don't know I just got to understand what problem yourself informed go hey\nChris you write thinks that the one I Want to thank our producer James child's their system associate producer Zach Bennett and of course you America thank you so much during\nThe day rancid show\nAnd\nAnd so we have\nThis Thursday night and you're grabbing drinks with some friends started off with a pitcher for the tape\nWhich quickly becomes too there's\nPrior to squeeze in say jeeze [noise]\nFollowed naturally by an order\nAnd another we get some extra wears off then there's the ceremony ... so what are we doing this weekend\nAnd Leslie back to the car which is your book [noise]\n\nCould be the most expensive not

dot com\nBy harsh radio sci fi it's\nFour o'clock [noise]\nRunning out in the U.S sent me to ... to Senate leader wants to keep his pledge to hold a confirmation vote this week on the Supreme Court nominee an FBI report on sexual assault allegations against Brett Kavanaugh could be finished as soon as today Fox's Geron help hard line on Capitol Hill\nI'm Joe Donnelly already said no who knows if he changes his mind but he's on record saying he's not going to do it [noise] um so we'll see and you know everyone's trying to make a big deal the president was laying out the case\nAbout what is you know what we now know fact should matter in this particular case and in the case of any allegations ... I Want to get into what this whole means I'll get into that at the bottom of the hour a little bit but what we do know now is\nObviously all the people that said we believe her long before we knew really anything about it those that rush to judgment eliminated all due process all presumption of innocence\nThat is the Democratic party today forgetting that of course they were against judge Kavanaugh before he ever got an ounce anyway and it didn't matter who Donald Trump\nNominated to the U.S Supreme Court they were going to be against but Democrats not caring about\nYour rights fundamental rights that have made this a stronger country and I actually think the New York times by moving on to a Fifteen page\nA tax expos day on Donald Trump's father and well he might have gifted his son money years ago when he was eight and therefore he got as well as from his father\nSo there I mean it's it's totally seems to me that they moved on from any chance that have covering the Kavanaugh case 'cause it's probably already done with the FBI investigation wrapped up wrapping up and\nNow handing hand he goes over to the Senate I Want the American people to have a right to see this I think the American people now invested in this\nAnd I think the American people will have a right to know for sure what the FBI came up with\nRemember they're not gonna make conclusions they're not going to make recommendations\nThey're just gonna say probably what the Senate investigative committee and found out already that they in the case of professor Ford for example she didn't remember date\nA day of the week a location how she got to or from the location where the alleged crime took place she mentioned four witnesses for people that were at the event no corroborating evidence of any kind and no one backing up her story including the one person that she placed in the room during the alleged attack\nAnd Democrats you know they they thought this was enough to initiate yet another FBI background check and\nYou know so now it's wrapping up in the mainstream media they've already made up their minds in fact in\nYou know that we learned about mystery mirrors and the New York times couldn't even print that story because when they called dozens of people they found out this Ramirez was actually no she didn't know herself if it was professor I'm Sorry if it was judge Kavanaugh because she was asking former yell classmates\nI don't fully where do you remember I'm not sure it was him well that kind of puts that case to rest\nAnd on top of the other things that she admitted that she had gaps in her memory and that she had been in ... braided rather quickly that that particular event\nAnd the third claim the most outrageous claim from this woman named Julie sweat Nick represented by the anti Trump to sell it Mike eleven Ninety alleging that Kavanaugh was involved in\nThe cereal drug ... almost on a weekly basis all she says she went to ten of these parties but as he said almost on a weekend basis what happened where young boys in these prep schools would be drug in young girls teenage girls and lining up in the halls and\nRaping them and then of course she gave for names to NBC News and well NBC News didn't find one person a backup or story one of the names was dead and another name was somebody who said I have no idea who this person is\nAnd they still ran the story and then of course backtracking on a on a variety of issues significant issues of the story that she just released a week a week prior\nHow does that become news\nAnd yet that is what the media now does they were perfectly happy airing that interview and and now she's saying well\nWell they weren't exactly wind up in the hall um well he was in ... I saw him near the punch bowl and he was given out red solo cups too people that's not drug in girls on a nearly weekend basis and lining up in the halls to gang raped women\nYoung girls and you'd have to believe that if that happens that regularly and was that well known there would be some cooperation\nThat somebody would have told at the time or a law enforcement official a teacher a parent that this was happening or this happened or their drug young kids and and then lining up\nTo rape young girls and it's gotten so absurd now that you have the senator from Hawaii wanting to investigate the ice throwing incident Brett Kavanaugh apparently through ice in a bar when he was in college\nPolice documents that show that Brett Kavanaugh through ice in someone's face during a bar fight when he was in college do you feel that that is in any way disqualifying for someone within a Supreme Court [noise]\nJuly we need and has the identification because there\nA lot of allegations and find really are about how he behaves bringing in drug\n[noise] All right so we're at the end of this process now it's interesting that the Senator Grassley in a written declaration release late last night that we got a hold of at the Fox news channel an ex boyfriend of\nProfessor Ford's ah who's the California professor accusing Brett cabin on that particular case anyway directly contradicting her testimony under oath last week that she had never help anyone prepare for a polygraph examination\nFormer boyfriend whose name was redacted in the declaration also said the poured\nNeither mentioned ... mentioned that she was a victim of sexual misconduct during the time that they were dating from around Ninety two to Ninety eight and he said that he saw for going to great lengths to help a woman that he believed was a lifelong best friend prepare for a potential polygraph test\nAnd he added that the woman I had been interviewing for jobs with the FBI and the U.S attorney's office in further claimed afford never voice any fear of flying even all aboard a propeller plane that they were on\nSeemingly having no problem living in a very small five hundred square foot apartment ... look\nThese
