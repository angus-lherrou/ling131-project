I don't know if we should go and no no it wasn't your career plan or replace our yard and\nPretend like saw young man who's a sharp young guy who's working in the warehouse is Twenty one just walked into your house and wanted to marry your daughter\nWhat would you tell him I don't want to know what his dad gummed plan is right Yes sir how are you going to take care of this girl\nI Would love to take care of it like\nHannah I'm giving you a hard time brother okay if you're if you think about it that way it forces you to think about your long term prospects which is as her dad that's what he'd be looking at right they'd be saying OK skies a sharp young to\nBe not making anything right now he's working in a warehouse but everybody's got really really good career path he's got a plan and it's going to work out I mean by the time he's thirty one what are you going to be doing you know so I'm more concerned about that I think you can make it on thirty five does she have a job\nUh she's in school and doing a part time job at a restaurant when does she graduated from school she has about another year and a half to two years okay and what were her degree being she's teacher okay and who's paying for her school right now her and her parents okay\nAlright would they continue that and she could complete and be a teacher while you are married\nTo ask but I think it would go down critical then\nOkay that's good so you could go ahead and get married and you'd have her part time income and you're thirty five thousand dollar income knowing that and a year Eighteen months she's going to be a teacher and your household incomes going to more than double it'd be making over Seventy up close to eighty thousand depending on what she's teaching where she's teaching and all that kinda stuff right\nBut with a teaching certificate in Florida she'll she'll make good money and then you've got better prospects 'cause you're going to start thinking about what you want to be when you're thirty one is from taking the steps to be that so that when you're forty one year also a better one\nAnd fifty one year rich one that makes sense okay there\nSo I think you've got the stuff to get married uh but I I'm more concerned about where you're going and where you are today\nTo answer the question of are you ready for marriage and I think you are you're sharp young guy and I'm obviously she's doing she's got a great career track there so you know what I Would want you to answer for your own satisfaction I was poking at you and saying let's pretend it's her dad right but for your own satisfaction\nWhat do you want to do where you go because let me tell you if you ain't nothing you hit it every time you'll be a thirty one year old warehouse worker\nAnd you don't want her that there's nothing wrong with no shame in being a warehouse worker but you want to be growing and evolving right\nYeah you want to be something better you I Want you to own the freaking where\nOkay okay

I started listening to it and I think that turning point for me was when I got to the point about the debt snowball and lifting your debt\nBecause up until that point I had been just doing everything they tried to avoid thinking about it it was stressful I just I didn't even want to it you know deal with it and I logged on and I saw that in the past three years I had been pain about Thirteen thousand dollars a year\nAnd about Fifteen thousand dollars a year it was occurring in interest every year so I really wasn't even making a dent in the student loans and so I knew something needed to change I Need to get serious especially being\nIn my late twenties at the time and single I didn't want to have this burden looming over my head for the next decade or two and certainly if I got married and had a family in the future I didn't want to bring that burden into that\nWilliam paid off a ridiculous amount of that with a ridiculously wonderful income show you hum wow okay so you you finished residency\nAnd really about a year went by before you started this right yeah roughly year okay did you come straight out and go into ER yeah yeah Microsoft is emergency medicine so you were making bucks already ... but then you just when you shut down to the math on this you went oh I can do this\nYeah I just realized that something absolutely needed to change because I just I couldn't live like that anymore\nWow look at you and just don't mean you just do them now do you take a lot of extra time at a yard to in order to get the income and this was I wanted to but we are position makes\nSo I actually went to my boss and asked if I could work all night shift and the ER and I did that for the entire twenties too much pointing months because it paid significantly more to work nights\nYou know is it it's just the mere double in it uh it's about twenty percent more in our twenty percent more okay All right but wow so you really sacrifice to get this done new people think you were losing your mind I mean your family your doctor your really enjoy your life I mean\nYeah the one thing I heard a lot of was in regards to buying a new car because I was still driving a used car for medical school at that point like being out\nYou did it right\nAnd so my friends and family would tell me you know you're crazy you can afford a new car you can afford a car payment and I would tell them no I really just want to save and I'll buy my ex corporate cash and I'll probably be a used car and they thought I was not\nYeah well you you wonder I Know I mean you might foreign fishing don't pay much\nLuck in the ... story very well done thank you very well done\nWell you did exactly what I tried to get doctors to do most dogs come out and go finally worked all this time I've gone to school my whole break in life mhm\nI deserve a new house in a new car I deserve a trip and they spend money like water you've seen them do it oh yeah definitely and I it's craziness did all you do would you use kept living like a broke college student\nYeah and I think that was really the key to getting out of that was just to keep living like a resident while I was in his first few years out because that was really the easiest time to do it and so I think that was probably the most important stuff that I thought\nYeah 'cause now I ... I mean you make three hundred four hundred five hundred worm you make it ... you're going to be unbelievably will the hit show you said your how thirty thirty one thirty one\nWas this fabulous income congratulations I guess I'm so proud of you who was your biggest cheerleader I Know you had to have good tractors that was easy yeah but who is the biggest cheerleader uh I Would\nSay my parents or my mom had followed you for years and also people in my church family as well because they are I talked a lot about you and we're encouraging me not to look into because they knew I had a lot of student loans\nUh it'd be OK coming out of an electric bill\nOkay All right and how does your wife work outside the home yes\nYou go okay she'll between her income and your military retirement the households not going to fold up\nNo not at all about it to the ... year\nYeah and that's if you don't work so why do you need to save money\nAll ... a ... ... and living a little a little more money now we're trying to get our budget and everything under control and I just want to make sure that\nWhat I Do I understand it as I get my budget under Seventy five thousand between now and then and I would get my career lined up between now and then you got plenty of time here that yeah I just I don't I don't want I mean you can't save up enough to not deal with those two issues agreed\nUh yes 'cause you'll burn through whatever it is if you never go back to work and you always spend more than the Seventy five\nNo matter how much you're safe if you saved a hundred grand you burn through it eventually you know I'm Sorry we ... we have to we have to go ahead and address those issues so let's just address from now\nBut again thank you for your service we appreciate it and so yeah I get my career lined up and get my budget lined up under Seventy five thousand and that takes the pressure off of getting the career\nWound up exactly but a ... year even your your okay it's not your good long term plan but no I I think I'd go ahead and work on getting my debts paid off now and build your emergency fund whatever you do let's keep working your debt snowball keep working your baby steps get their career lined up that's what I Would do\nRyan is in Atlanta Hi Ryan how're you\nDoing good how are you doing better than I deserve what's up\nTrying to question [noise]\nInvesting so I guess a short overview um I'm thirty my wife's thirty three\nA combined income right now about one Seventy five ... I'm only is mortgage I'm a car payment and then I'm a little bit of student loan that we've got the cash to pay it off\nA which was about to go at the end it all the U.S pay\n'em even after that we can get at least six months of\nUm you know emergency expenses that back emergency fund um I've got a four one K. and a pension she has four one K. and profit sharing in our main question is what a extra income every month\nAnd if we should be voted at something that's strictly tied retirement which it seemed like we have a lot of origin it'd be better to put that into something more accessible like a like a managed a like a some type of managed fund it can be accessed prior to retirement if need be\nYou know we call those bridge funds um\nYeah at some point I Would go there but I think you've got some cleaning up to do y'all been pretty sloppy you make a lot of money to be as broke as you are um how long have you been making that kinda money\nOn the last couple of years okay\nIt's it's it's time to clean up the rest of this mess thin yeah let's Raj them checks today and pay off student loan the car you got to pay off both of them\nDo yeah\nGood let's do that today and then you need to have your emergency fond of three to six months of expenses not income three to six months of expenses\nAnd uh that's what we call taken you through baby step three which lays the foundation for a solid financial planning your debt free and you have your rainy day fund except your home okay then we move on to what we call baby steps for five and six do you have children\nNo not right now okay\nThen ah we would baby steps for is Fifteen Percent of your income going into retirement that's not much with what you guys make\nWhat it is a good start and it's not going to keep you from retiring and doing the British stuff later which I'm going to come back to and actually do what you want to do but I'm going to do it in the right order um [noise] once you're\nDoing that then maybe step father's kids' college that does not apply here baby steps six pay off your house or lamb or reach over knock the house out beyond that which is has the same effect to your net worth that the bridge loan does because I have in your home paid off frees you up and and ... to need a lot less income\nTo retire before you can access the retirement funds okay now then once the house is paid off which really do how much do you own your home\nAll the ... to eighty\nOkay if you do what I'm Talking about here probably in about five years maybe seven before you're forty or house is going to be paid off\nAnd by then you're probably making two two and a quarter if you're on a normal career track maybe even more okay so your income is increasing your debt one hundred percent debt free before you're forty now we can do a lot of stuff\nAnd I have a single parent in the world mathematically with one Seventy five two and a quarter or whatever it is coming in\nNow you max out retirement and you build other wealth which will have this effect you're looking for of what we call the ... bridge financing his or bridge savings or bridge investing bridge between age fifty two and\nYou know if you wanted to have enough to to do some stuff with before that but the whole idea of being that we're going to build wealth as a result\nOf having no pay much\nTo go with your fabulous income or your most powerful will building tool is your income we've just finished a study here the crush Hogan is doing a book on a ... of the largest study of millionaires over done and what we find is as they pay off their home in an average of pinpoint two years\nMost of them do not make as much as you make\nThe vast majority of millionaires don't make as much as you make\n'em and then they steadily invested in there for one k.'s and once they maxed out they do other investing in just good mutual funds were Bosh I'm real estate that you pay cash for the income producing or something like that where you've got some other money that you got access to\nThat is not return not all caught up in retirement\nAnd so you're thinking right I just put it to the back of a line as to the front of the line on when you're going to get to it\nUm and you'll get there faster if you'll do it the way I'm Talking about in the way you're talking about it clean up this might actually make too much money we shouldn't

have no margin yo no wiggle room and a show you guys have got to sit down and analyzes or something we can do to get our incomes up substantially or we've got to look at living further out\nIn in a different setting where it's not as expensive I Know California real estate expensive I understand I'm In ... in and out of California in and out of Manhattan all the time I understand these markets I Know the markets but I mean it's almost impossible to live on the island of Manhattan unless you make a hundred dollars a year\nUm you just cannot afford the rent even on a studio apartment and so that's what you're facing in your market there are and then the you know we're talking about this in San Fran and the other day when I was over there you you cannot afford to live in Silicon valley unless you make substantial money\nAnd so I mean so there's and Silicon Valley as a result is having a real problem staffing service type jobs\nBecause nobody that does service type jobs for typical service type income can afford to live there and so you run into all kinds of people are being busted him to do\nLabor type jobs and uh it you know because we can't afford to live in Silicon valley and that's that's just a mathematical facts of the situation so that applies to you and you've got to make some decisions are is are we going to do something with our careers that allow us to live in this house or\nAre we going to do in order to stay in that job and in that general area we're probably looking at a more substantial commute Amy is with us in Detroit Michigan Hi Amy how are you\nCan

phone numbers triple eight eight to five\nFive two to five welcome back Ken thanks for having always fun to be with you the smart conference in\nKansas City last weekend phenomenal you did a great job presenting that really connected didn't it\nThank you yes it uh it was exciting to see people jot down some of the things we were talking about that practically allow them to get where they want to be you know that I mean we can all envision a mountain top but then it gets real scary when we started thinking about how do I scale that mountain top and as we talked a lot about the proximity principal and\nGave people some ideas on the right people to be around and and the right places they need to be in\nBecause if you want to do something to be in the proximity of that same as it is here to the proximity principle simply says in order to do what I Want to do you fill in the ...\nThat I've got to be around people who are doing that and in places where that is happening so think about that when I'm Around the right people they all point to the right places and then when I go in those places and were specifically looking for three things in the right places where I can learn where I can do and where I can connect\nAnd date when I'm In the right places I inevitably going to be more of the right people and so it becomes this cyclical process that is so profoundly simple\nIt should demystify the path to getting where I Want to go you're an example here's what's good about that no matter how successful you get your always practicing the proximity principle you're continuously looking to get around the right people whether it be for personal reasons are professional reasons you like to sit down billionaires you want to learn things about these men and women\nYou know and you're constantly thinking about what are the places I Need to be an where's Ramsey solutions need to be\nThis is a very simple principle that no matter where you're at life if you want to get somewhere\nYou have to practice proximity you know I've noticed that happening here in our\nLittle a burger outside of Nashville Franklin, Tennessee has has ended up becoming a melting pot for people who write ... in the self improvement space centers hand who uh who speak and the self improvement space\nI mean I've been here all along or Mike Hi it a ... has been in the ... a friend of mine down the road Donald Miller moved here in the last couple of years in from Oregon ... from the ... moved here about the town that book took off there's probably a handful of others that I'm not even thinking you're mentioning right now\nUm but a lot of movement and it just seems to be this thing happening and it's like an almost like an artist community like Asheville North Carolina very much an art community now and you get around things and the people\nAnd the places that something's happening and then you have a better chance of pulling it off and it's not that\nThe Donald Miller or diagrams your Mike Hi it interact a reunion every day we certainly don't but we all know each other and we all interacting and we've all helped each other that's one way or another ah sometimes it's just a drop by nothing real fancy but it is a very much all within about five miles of each other you know as an example\nYeah it it it here's what happens when you get around like minded people then there is a natural\nA force if you will it's almost magnetic that they are going to pull you into their or of a little bit just by their example and you you know there there is a guy that you and I both admire I never had the chance to meet him Charles tremendous Jones you know there's a famous saying that said you know who you are five years from now is largely\nDependent on the books you read and the people you meet and we've also heard the age old colloquial isn't that nobody can attribute it to anybody but it's not\nWhat you know it's who you know who you know so again what we've done here on the show with was helping people try to demystify or take away the fear of getting where they want to go is by showing them this is a process is not going to happen overnight\nIt might take you four years of putting yourself in proximity to the right person\nFor me to have you know my story you watched it from afar eight years\nEight years of small itty bitty baby steps\nOf putting myself around the right people in in the right places doing the hard work learning being humble hustling staying hungry and then you get an opportunity at some point everybody's story is different but as I said Saturday Kansas City in the crowd kind of laughed at this\nBroke up an interest in what\nAviation pilot okay I Gotcha okay\nSo um I might add guy and I I'm saved up my marking the find I have children three and five and I'm just wondering if I Would have to go through all the training and to becoming a pilot\nBecause I feel like it's a calling for me but I'm not positive and I'm just wondering if I can\nTap into that world or if I can do and what I'm doing in saving and\nThen retire I mean that's pretty much where I'm at right now and I don't know I don't know what to do I get kind of thought well what\nWould be wrong becoming a pilot\nUm well I think it is\nAnd what do you mean what are you now I make fifty five\nPounds more like a lot more than that show you got your show if you spent eighty and you made twice as much as you make now there'll be a good return on investment so that's not um ... what's the rest of the problem\nUm I get away from the family oh\nNow that's real ... real but let's look at that do you have you done the research what is that going to based on the cost and you're going to do with cash so that's another issue you're going to do this cash so it's going to take a little bit in a while I understand but are you willing to do what it takes to be in the air and fly\nI think I have to put my foot forward and at least attempt to try and see where it goes up get your pilot light armored tank grant that's right if I felt like it when I thought I Would probably say yeah\nI think the answer is unequivocally yes I don't think it's probably yes I think your heart is so clear everybody on the air can here here's what I'm telling you you don't need to feel any guilt here's why\nYou've done the Dave Ramsey plan you're doing the play and you're going to continue to work in that job it's making you fifty five thousand you're going to castle as you go\nAnd because this is going to take maybe five seven years of making that up whatever it is you're going to do and as you go and that means you're not going to sacrifice that much time away from the kids number one number two you're not going to starve because you're going to stay in that day job while you're pursuing the dream job\nAnd by the time you get ready to be gone from being a pilot the kids are going to be a lot older\nAnd the kids are going to see the mom says\nMind to something and pursued it the right way and is happy and fulfilled what a tremendous life lesson in example you're going to be I don't see why you should have any guilt at all in fact I think you should be fired up about it and take one small step today\nWe might even guilt you if you didn't [laughter]\nExactly [laughter] I really appreciate it\nThanks for the call now reality is worse you're going to be a corporate pilot today she might be gone a lot that's that's where I'm a little kids of course and that might not be our lifestyle the fish but this is a process for it's not it's not a snapshot these are not instantaneous that's where I can just push a button and decide your pilot no this is going to take some kind of doing that\nBut let's let's let's play this out real quick folks you heard this if it takes her day five to seven years to ... between the eighty thousand cash flow plus the the classes and all the training that requires to become a pilot\nShe could still stay in that day job begin to do things on the side maybe she fly some tours on the weekends again the kids are still maybe early teens but just five years removed from that they're out of the house and then she can go full time but she can actually fly part time\nI mean we have to look at the big picture and this lady wants to be in the skies and she can do it\nNow I got to tell you the problem with that thing is it's addicting from what I hear oh you know stark will have I mean I'll give you a like a vast car so I Know you can't imagine how bad our gifts you know that that would be a bad idea ... I don't yeah I can tell some things I don't need to start because I don't have to finish them\nLook it's a bird no it's they ran a barrel level it's a pretty scary out there in so many ways barbers on Instagram can she says I have over Twenty years of experience or should I have a two page resume with all my jobs listed instead of the suggested one page\nNo which is why suggested one page but let me explain why [laughter]\nI Love those costs you know we fought this thing through here's why\nThe average hiring manager David spinning somewhere between six and sixty seconds skinny interests me\nSo they all see all two pages anyway so if you look at the Ken Coleman show resume temple of how to fix your resume to chemical and show dot com it's absolutely free\nGive it to read because we actually show you what to do but we explain why you're doing it that way and it's based on research so for hiring managers looking at that for less than sixty seconds\nThey want to see what's most relevant to them to see if you can help them win that's all they care about they don't want to be impressed with you they wanna know\nCan this guy or gal helped me when and so\nI managers not your mother but I don't care they don't ... it all started all the honey Sony hillside ... do you do oh God just shoes ...\nWell you've heard the phrase what have you done for me lately yeah I think you ought to apply that to your resume we don't care about what you did Twenty years ago unless Dave it's relevant to the current roll your ... [laughter] I think that's safe to say almost never so no I think you should do one page we've designed this resume tell that to be a brochure because folks that's what it is\nI graduated with a degree in computers in Nineteen Seventy four that is of no help today exactly you can't even spell computer now it's completely different it's a completely different world show what it would have you done lately that involved a computer starting all relevant it's everything about the Ken Coleman show dot com\nYou can download the resume template but resumes by themselves are worthless they're completely worthless\nAnd I love that because it shocks people that they've you know this is true Ramsey solution it if you can give the data are the reality is folks that if someone's out walking your resume in to the person who's hiring for the job and said hey I Know this person through a friend of a friend or I Know them personally\nAnd I think they're solid individual to give them a look you're buried inside of a pile and it's like playing the lottery to get your resume noticed so that's what we mean when we say you've got to do the work\nTo get a connection so the relationship is attached to your resume\nFifteen thousand applications here last year we are two hundred people case in point and there is no issue is logistically impossible for us to look at every one of them ...\nAnd not to mention you motivated is each one of us to go find eagles to bring into this organization you want to keep crazy out so we're incentivized arranges let's just to bring in somebody that we know\nCan fit the culture and can obviously fit the role that means confidence character those types of things culture fit so that's why it's so important that you have a relationship\nYou can download the resume template but don't use it by itself that's what we're saying it's completely free at Ken Coleman show dot com if you have questions and you want to talk to count on a ... show or on his podcast which are the same thing they put out there on the phone number is eight to four four\nSeven four seven\nTwenty five Seventy seven you're going to follow him on Facebook or Instagram\nPet Ken Coleman show or at can Coleman on Twitter as well he's got a book out called one question life changing answers from today's leading voices\nAnd against serious one Twenty one and one eleven is where you'll pick up the show and I'm sure you're sick Sam ... stopping by always fun to say always good to have some help for folks out there trying to get there\nA career aligned with her\nPassion she opposes our living rooms are showing the bucks we'll be back with you before you know in the meantime remember there's only one way to financial fees and that's directly with the prince of Christ Jesus [noise]\nBlake the production officer for the show and here's a little tip for two thousand and\nRevamp Dave Ramsey show out in the store\nOr race\nHe was radio Ninety sixty tell you we are seeing farming has had on line nine sixty got what you we are C. dot com\nI harsh radio sci fi it's four o'clock [noise]\nAnd frankly Republicans this was their moment and look we got rid of the individual mandate\nIn Nineteen days we can create a system of health care second to nobody in the world that's why first seven years I have harassed and bother poor Josh ...\nAtlas MD Wichita, Kansas not only do I put them on radio and TV oh no that's not enough I set up meetings with hand me fly to Washington on his own that we should pay him\nYou know for that I'll probably get accused of something if I offer to pay for something\nUm you know we should form the effort fifty dollars a month on limited concierge chair he negotiates directly with pharmaceuticals Ninety five percent reduction\nYou you need team of therapy got breast cancer or for a lot of those drugs it's six dollars a treatment\nGood luck getting those prices anywhere we couldn't institutionalized this\nAnyway so there's ... there's not running on what they believe\nWe've learned that with Brett us in in Tennessee thanks to project beret toss we've learned with Claire McCaskill caught on undercover videos you can weigh outrageous we needed investigation\nInvestigation into what the fact that you and your own words are saying to the people in Missouri I'm a lawyer I'm a fake phony fraud I Am a I'm just a phony [noise]\nI'm a liar I'm saying whatever I Need to say they get elected I don't mean any of my job is to bamboozled the people of Missouri lie to them then go to Washington and I'm going to govern just like Iraq Obama\nThey can't win if they define who they really are they can't win if they give us their true agenda\nThey can't win if they say yeah we really want to impeach Trump impeach forty five and Pete forty five impeach forty five are claiming my timer claiming my time they tell Maxine Waters don't say it when I ... I don't want to talk about it\nJust don't say if they tell her and she says they told me not to\nBut I'm going to keep saying in any way\nSo their gender is impeachment and lists never ending investigations\nOpen borders eliminate ice sanctuary cities now we have a sanctuary state California\nThey want ... why do they want to open borders they calculated that's gonna benefit them\nAt the ballot box helping them retain power notice every decision and every agenda item is about them wanting to hold on to power period it doesn't matter the output or the the what the end result is\nDoesn't matter Obama wrecked the economy I won't give you the statistics again if you listen to this program regularly I Know you could recite them by rote as well the only reason I say it so often is that so everybody nobody can't say they didn't know\nBut that's what they want to take us back to that's what they want their crumbs back they want they want to destroy Trump they're driven\nBy a borderline psychotic hatred of this president\nThey want to go back to what back to Obamacare they want open borders so that they think that their their party will remain in power forever if they get enough people crossing the border caravans\nOf people are going to talk about what the president's planning and it's like that's what they stand for\nThis is what the Democratic Party take back the crumbs heat both by my care open borders impeach Trump endless investigation what name one thing they're that they're doing to make your life better because after losing\nThirteen million Americans and and having them have to go through food stamps to survive and sustain themselves in eight years of failed to count on me of Obama the only president never to reach three percent GDP Growth in American history\nYou know they want to go what we're gonna want to add more people why 'cause they're dependent on them the crumbs they're handing out the irony of that they're ... what what did the leftovers they have\nYou know when they're done building their gyms their Senate gyms their house Kim's there you know house barbershops their Senate barber shops the Senate dining rooms their house tiny rooms or they treat themselves while they're not they're not on Obamacare they got to separate house system just for them\nVery different [noise] so that's what's at stake you know I'm going to tell you something about this border as I watch this care of it\nYou got to understand this is a about national security this is personal security\nI think I'm the only person in the media that actually took the time over the years and I've been down reporting from the border Thirteen times science Hannity you've told us that before\nYeah I bet on horseback yeah Ben and helicopters yeah been out on boats yeah I've been on foot yeah I've been all terrain vehicles I've been on the border all the way from the Rio Grande straight on through San Diego in many stops in between\nI've seen gang members arrested drug warehouse the biggest warehouse I've ever seen in my life floor to ceiling\nDrugs confiscated guess what they were headed to Yorktown your city to your kids that they ingest them and now it's worse than ever\nBut there's now a lot of the heroin that we have we have an opioid crisis in this country\nIs is one that you know one issue is oh kids go into grandma grandpa was medicine cabinet\nThey try a bike and then a Percocet anoxic on and then they go back there got another one next thing you know they're addicted next thing you know they're buying them on the streets God Knows what those pills really are the drug dealers don't give a rip that these kids die\nThen when they find out that can't afford eighty bucks a pill well then some genius idiot friend or deal or friend quote of theirs says why don't you try heroin does much better high and the only ten dollars a bag\nAnd they'll start snorting heroin or chasing the dragon is they call it and they light up in smoke it and then eventually they're going to be main lining it and then guess what they're on a trajectory straight into the grave\nAnd a life of a living hell\nAnd that's the opioid crisis and wears a lot of those drugs coming from right over the border where it's human trafficking happening right over the border\nWhat's happening all across the border there's a new thing it's called ... and all you know talk to my buddy Eric bowling his Nineteen year old son bought an than that which is you know to relieve anxiety\nAnd and and it was laced if you have three grains of fat and all the size of three grain of salt\nIt will kill you\nAnd we have nearly a hundred thousand kids dying every single day one death every seven point five minutes you know almost a hundred thousand deaths a year and we keep talking about opioid crisis left and right opioid we can stop it if we secure the border\nCaravans now so I think it's right I think Kavanaugh what do we see with terminal\nThe total total elimination of anything that we recognize as the U.S constitution the rule of law equal justice under the law equal application of our laws or the presumption of innocence what presumption of innocence I Believe her never heard from a bribe believer\nThat no corroborating evidence I still believe her\nYou know but then ... no no no but but they were lined up almost on a weekend basis they wind up in the whole first they spike the punch bowl and after they spike the punch bowl the boys would line up in the hall every weekend and then they rape the girls in the room they take turns and it happened almost every weekend\nAnd then the story evolved into well I didn't see him spike the punch bowl but I saw a mirror punch bowl\nAnd I see I saw him give out a red solo cup\nThat's what that became\nSo and then Dianne Feinstein wants to bring that up again after eight FBI investigations water\nThey offering for you because since Trump spent president you got for a million new jobs since Trump's been president four hundred thousand manufacturing jobs jobs that Obama said would never coming back\nSince he's been president we've gotten rid of more regulations than the last five presidents a combined uh he's opened up the entire energy industry of which we have a flawed\nLiterally of natural resources those are going to be career paying jobs high paying jobs for so many millions of Americans\nAre then we've got oh the president the grading ISIS nobody thought little rocket man would stop shooting his rockets nobody thought that you know being tough on the
