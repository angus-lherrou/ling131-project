into Mexico on a treacherous journey to reach the usa walk\nAt talking about fusion GPS founder Glenn Simpson well he's now saying indicated he's going to plead the fifth he's not saying a word anymore\nAh he was on Fox News Sunday telling Maria ... that Glenn Simpson is in real legal jeopardy in all of this you also confirmed that the FBI has evidence that directly refused the premise of a ... a Trump Russia probe in other words that there's been and remains exculpatory evidence\nIt was a great piece by Jonathan Turley ... three reasons mother may not charge Trump with obstruction apparently not asking any questions about it but sticking exclusively to whether or not there was any type of collusion which we all know the answer to a you have one top Republican lawmaker no saying the FBI failed to provide a\nFederal surveillance court with important evidence well we do that now for a long time and we know that for Pfizer court judges\nOr handed information that was supposed to be verified and corroborated ended up being Hillary Clinton's bought and paid for Russian lives that was put together by fusion GPS interestingly funneled money through ... from the hiring of Christ is Christopher Steele a foreign national he doesn't even stand by the information and the ...\nAnd it was the bulk of information to get for Pfizer warrants against the Trump campaign associate the lead up to the twenty sixteen race\nAll this comes down to some simple basic fundamental things and they never told the Pfizer judges that it was Hillary Clinton that paid for it\nThis information and it's unbelievable that this could be happening in this country but it looks like we're finally begin to get to get to the bottom of it at least I Hope so Jason shape it's is with us\nFormer congressman now on Fox News contributor author of the New York times best seller of the deep state we have Victoria Toensing and Joe diGenova of of the gentleman ... with us ah thank you both for being here let's start with Jason shape it's because this is your will house\nAnd it seems to me that it doesn't matter what Congress request as they seek to do their job of oversight they're never going to get the information from the department of justice and they're not going to get the people they need to talk in front of them under oath\nWell the hard part about when you issue a subpoena when I was the chairman of the oversight commission or committee I can issue a subpoena but the only way to unfortunate it's through the department of justice and so the weight of the paper really isn't worth much because the OJ won't enforce its own subpoena the subpoena issued by Congress\n... the name that people need to also familiar ... themselves with is marked Elias market why it was ... he was ... for the DNC he was counsel for Hillary Clinton he was counsel for a ... group he was involved there\nThis this guy sits in the middle of a lot of these transactions in the movement of money and I think more and more you'll start to see his name along with you know or and Simpson and all these others\nWell I think the fact that ... Simpson is now saying Victoria that was going to plead the fifth and it can get away with that and make them come in and plead the fifth you know the idea that they can just threatened to plead the fifth and not have to actually go through with it I think it's important\nThey should make him show up and in front of the TV cameras plead the fifth it's ridiculous to accept a letter from the lawyers and I hope Jason you're talking to your former friends and telling them to get them a get hit in to the Congress to take\nThis it and I don't care if they're not going to um enforced to subpoena because I think there are other ways to to figure out how to do it you've got a subpoena you subpoenaed first and then you negotiate later\nYou don't say oh mine he didn't show up talking trying to work it out now you have to think of that scene and he said Pina and then you say you can't make it Wednesday then you make it there is that I Can't believe there's no ... well\nI mean I'm trying to understand I mean the president said that there would be de classification and all the materials the Jim Jordan was just talking about would be an redacted and we'd have a chance to see the ... the gang of eight information the three oh two between\nAh Bruce or and Christopher Steele and how they wanted a funnel that information straight into Robert Mueller's office uh Joe diGenova but\nYou know the idea of why do I think even with you and Victoria's my attorneys that I wouldn't get away with just saying oh I'm going to plead the fifth leave me alone now or or not handing over subpoenaed materials to Congress\nWell I don't think there's any question that Congress has dropped the ball on course to get some subpoenas but let me just say this because this is really important all the names that you heard Michael fuss than Mr liar Simpson\nOr all those people they are key to everything that was done in the United states what's fascinating is what happened in the United kingdom between the Congress has an important issue any subpoenas for we now know that the FBI or am I fix\nAnd that you see a cue to conduct electronic surveillance of American city citizens on foreign soil without legal authority to do so and that information was in fact the conversations George ...\nWere intercepted and in the course of intercepting those compensation they found out that off the top of it was not interested in Hillary's emails or anything else and they never ... information to the by the court\nYou know it seems congressman shape it's that every piece of the puzzle now is falling in place I think we now understand what the insurance policy was Lisa Page testify that in the the nine months of the investigation\nLeading up to the appointment of special counsel Robert Mueller that they had no evidence of Trump Russia collusion at all\nUm and by the way even her lover Peter Struck said the same thing he said well I'd be all end if there was something there there's no there are there\nAnd then all of a sudden we find the media elite strategy that they discussed this with Andrew McCabe comes in James Baker comes in and other people come in and what we see is again it goes back to the Clinton bought and paid ... that dossier information has leaked out to the media creating the impression that in fact there was Russia Trump collusion\nBut they did it themselves they took the again it's it's all they were doing the leaking so that they can appoint the special counsel so that in the which one could be good begin I is there any part of the puzzle that isn't clear to you because it's getting very clear to me\nDo it is becoming a crystal clear\nAnd that's why Jim Jordan is exactly right the people that were in that meeting and reverse the timing of this evening this meeting happens directly after a district Colombia's relieved of his duties but just before\nA Mr Mueller is put into place and you have to understand who's in that meeting what was discussed it sounds like bakers being the most candid about what was going on there\nBut each of the people in that meeting should be brought in for its own their own deposition uh transcribed under oath\nOr before Congress you don't have these five minute little ... you know after you have questions when you do this and I've been in these things go for an hour for the Republican than the Democrats get time than another hour for Republicans and you can really get in depth information if they would do it that way\nWell Victoria I think that's true and that's right and that's just an that's fair but\nThe obstruction continually I Will take a break we'll come back more with Jason Chaffetz and Joe diGenova also but Dorian ... with us\nI Want to remind you our friends at my pillow
