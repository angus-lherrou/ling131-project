bankruptcy or not\nMuch that I Am and I'm the one now and what kind of did as a loan\nAnd credit cards I had um a major medical that will make a medical issue happened mhm and I had ...\nPlace and the company is fighting they and they spend a year and a half and he still had to give me my money and I wouldn't be in that situation and um and then giving me my money\nMhm um so I just got a lawyer and um it is right in the latter basically right now 'cause I Can't afford a kid I really wanted to like train the legal\nMhm\nAnd do that ... them and it really hard because of all we have had things in place now\nAre you currently disabled and I am\nWhat's the nature of the network which the nature of your disability\nIs a federal thing going on right now Cheryl medical issues so fiber around they found out I just had a test on August twenty twenty and and I found out of hand another condition [noise] ...\n... what kind of it is the fifty one doesn't use a credit card so I'm not sure which credit cards\n[noise] um [noise] and um\nThe way\nOf it as a credit card and a half percent alone so for one credit card come a Thirteen Down the ladder and if I paid on a path out they and they would you know I did one on calling them all and the town I'm I'm having a hardship to have a lower\nOh mhm\nVote on doing good for them lower you don't have the money\nWell my husband is an income I was thinking but it's still not enough [noise]\nOh well that's part of the picture when what does he make\n[noise] about twenty eight thousand in that much because he lost his job when I first got her mhm um when I first got her are you not Andrew Young lung receiving disability\nNo I'm a clown um [noise] the short time we had an economy dropped off for a permanent disability to state but I've been out of work so much that now it's going to be really really low and not even want to be when I cook it because you know go about our credit than in and out in and out of where\nI'm at this point I went to a disability lawyer so I'm trying to find out he said he can't really tell me much until they going to see if I should do with that one on it I could do with that and\nWhatever team and then if I did at Thirteen he didn't know how much they were going to pay that they want to get it out figure that out\nAnd then I might have to wind up paying I mean you know they'll only and that money I don't understand\nYou gave him Eighteen hundred dollars to file bankruptcy and give them anything oh I don't get anything so you're not paying on these credit cards or these loans to the ...\nNo not right now on on that and when the\nShow and they were or are you going to be look let's pretend you're just didn't pay those loans for a year\nAnd they just sit there the worst cases in which you're right yeah and what are they going to get you don't have anything you don't have an income and you don't have the assets they can do your own something as valuable\nWhile I have all the homes I live in I have a home and I looked at the equity and other home um I have about fifty thousand and now I Can't sell out though because if I tried to tell ... what does that algae either go\nMarket yourself and then it because they found out in an area like sixty Seventy thousand dollars you know I'm an area that how are you all for like one of a like a hundred and fifty thousand\nMhm but why can't you sell your home\nA lot of them and there are better at it again\nWalk into your house\nAnd one of the other house that I don't live in a while I'm speaking out and about fifty thousand and why\nWhy can't you sell it\nBecause then you have a lot of foreclosures and people are telling them for sixty\nAnd you are what um own Ninety eight\nOkay so Charlotte and get out what you can out of it and pay somebody will\nSay oh my dad with that\nYeah definitely before you go bankrupt\nYou when you file bankruptcy they don't let you keep investment property with equity and then not pay your bills how bankruptcy law works so the Trump bankruptcy trustee will force the sale of that property and it'll be forced to be paid against your bills\nAnd I think you can get enough out of that to go to each one of these and you can probably shuttle fifty thousand in your situation for around thirty five if you negotiate with them but you need the money in your hand to do that and you know what I mean money\nSo this is a way to get those all cleared up and then in the process of course we've got to figure out how to get your income back up and get your household income working again 'cause that's the root cause of all of this ...\nBeen so long term where are you going to be in two years where are you going to be in a year where are you going to be in three years which are long term game plan and what are you doing about getting there that's got to be your next step because you got to get either disability income coming in um you know if you're the workers' comp if it if you were hurt you said on the job or you or I can tell from what you're saying that which way it was but\nYou know any money that is do you or any money you can create you used to create your future kiddo\nAnd that's what we want you to do we want you to have a future\nAnd and so you start looking out there into the future and saying how am I going to take the next step is to get there but as far as filing bankruptcy I don't think that's going to be advantageous to you when you got this much older when you've got this much equity in a property and I think you can clear up by showing it\nShowing it taking the equity using that money about thirty thirty five thousand dollars it's they're forty thousand whatever you\nGet out of it and subtle at fifty one thousand doubts about negotiate with them get that in writing before you send them any money but I think you can work your way through this to fall by ruptured be one finally goes on what you saw the house or your wife and I\nSuppose this

our household so\n... her husband has a job yes my dad has a job when does seem a\nWhile he makes so I think a hundred thousand dollars here\nMaybe so she doesn't know how she didn't have to work to eat yeah okay so I mean what if she just didn't want to work\nWell uh I feel like for her type of bending that's the problem strikes and money mhm\nMhm and how old are you\nI'm Eighteen okay All right\nWell there's a rule that we have discovered in these types of conversations and it's called the powder ... syndrome once someone has powder but they don't really want your opinion about money or sex and so your mother is not going to take an Eighteen year olds input\nOn her spending habits you don't have standing you don't have credibility with her to have that discussion and that's what you're discovering andme our own\nMillion are on you know\nYou know it's just difficult now you know when you're fifty eight and she's Ninety six or something yeah she may take your input those days right that's a different that's a different parent child relationship than an Eighteen to whatever and so\nYou know you have to build some credibility so the only thing I Would tell you that there was a couple things um one is I Would not bring up her spending again unless she brings it up\nOK okay too I Would tell her lots of stories about the times that you used to mess up mom I used to spend and do this and I used to do this and man when I got on this budget I got on this humble up system I got on this plan to get out of debt I'm doing so good and you just tell your story\nIs your story is not condemning her\nIt's just ... just holding up the idea that there's hope right\nYeah so tell your story and talk about how you're winning doing these things and that changes everything for you then the second thing you can do is is is there anyone like maybe your dad who could shut down and talk with her and the two of them actually start getting their act together\nWell I'm actually yes my dad had talked to her he's actually one of the people that we should call and we don't watch his show\nMhm okay well this was his job not yours is what I'm saying and sunny ah this would be like a husband now calling now that's a little different standing and he puts his arm around his wife and says look we got a problem here you're spending like you're in Congress I mean we got to stop this there's a problem here\nAnd we sit down and work through this issue together and we've got to put together some kind of a plan where we have a good life\nAnd we have a good life meaning we spend some money now and we invest and save show that we have to live like no one else so later we can live like no one else but really this is on your dad to do this is not on you you real cause you're he's got standing he's got a position in the household to have a discussion\nWhere as an Eighteen year old you don't and um it's not just you obviously are very sharp and you can do all kinds of things for you I'm not saying you're not good or you're not whole or whatever I'm just saying in your mom's eyes you're still that little baby she used a diaper\nAnd it's just hard for her to take advice from you but now her husband that's a different thing\nAnd um you know he can sit down and if it was at my house on insurance I Would just sit down when I have a discussion going this is this is something we're not doing here and there's a problem and we've got to work through this and so he's put up with is a long time and it's time for him to deal with it now\nThat that's what I'm saying hey thank

proud for y'all world are how much of your mind off we pay off almost a hundred and twenty four hundred and twenty thousand seven hundred and forty ... forty two dollars in one when I got it and how long did this take\nWell it took six years but for three years when we really started\nFollowing your we finally on the same page at that point so we are a little faster then yeah I was dragging my feet got it and you're a range of income during that time well we were broke twenty twenty five twenty five thousand and we just accept a new jobs and right now are making a hundred and twenty five and ... what do you do for a living\nI work for an advertising agency in Oklahoma City and then on the store manager at the coach store at I'm In Oklahoma City very clearly I Know your wife like sandbags booming\nYeah she's got a pretty good collection [laughter] she deserves anything she gets that is right\nUp with me so well done you know guys you're you know how long you been married seven years and All right so a year in a marriage you start but then three years later you kick it into high gear for sure tell me about the journey what happened and and show other people how it's done\nUm right after we graduated we had so much in school that\nAnd we just we need to get rid of this and and\nI grew up in a single family home that my mom worked really really hard you know I wanted to say I want to take advantage every advantage that we had and get our you know get everything in line and be successful or yawn so\nAnd I felt entitled like I deserved a jeep wrangler and I work too hard and so we really were fighting and I just felt in title I was acting like a little boy and I needed to be coming in and I just well I she deserves better and I just I had to you know what my pride down\nSo what happened what what was the breaking point what kicked in in the gear because obviously you flew up to an obvious ... the way she looked at you just then when you said that was admiration and ... and it was it was really the way every man wants his wife to look at them know what you just did was incredible so tell me about that what happened well\nI mean we just argued a lot and he wanted to have a very healthy and happy marriage and I just remember standing in the kitchen three years ago and he held my face and his hands and he was like we are going to get rid of fast and I think um\nWe just finally got on the same page and felt like we were connecting ... um because you mentioned a lot that when your priorities are nine and your budget your parodies aren't aligned in your marriage and so for us that was kind of just something that was really important\nYeah and I just I didn't have any hope I didn't think we can do it what what ... what we got this we're going to do this what happened\nUm I just I\nI think I just didn't want to hurt her anymore Mm hurting I Love her so much and I just don't want to it just wasn't fair to her and I was the one who's spending money and going out to eat doing whatever I Want to do and so\nAnd I was hearing your not important yeah finally we're like we're the most important\nThing in on us and we need to get our finances in line and be on the same age in our life moving\nForward and so at that point it's game on yeah and what what kind of income where you making at that point three years ago I think between eighty them about eighty okay so you're still come up from ... to one twenty five during that three years yet hurry impressive very cool so then okay you've made the decision were on the same page then what happened to make\nA budget and it kind of\nIt was I felt constricted at first and then I kept listening to your show and it's like almost like give me permission to spend money and I felt safe to spend money it wasn't like oh this is going to cost me a night on the couch and felt like okay we're on the same page and I felt the connecting more when I found is happy and I was like you know what stuff doesn't make me happy anymore and I don't need\nA jeep wrangler I Need new clothes and they don't need to go out to eat like I'm just happy this is more important than anything else\nThere you go you're under funding it automatically then so that's perfect yeah yeah I Would I Would put the whole five thousand through there which is going to save you about Fifteen hundred dollars a year\nThat's a nice benefit that and I thank\nThanks for the call Anders next in Canada hey Andrew how are you\nAll are you\nBetter than I deserve what's up\nSo we have just recently paid off our house and yeah so we are completely debt free and just wanted to ask you a question about next steps okay\n[noise] okay so\nWe live in a two bedroom townhouse pretty tight we have a family of four and go on on the way\n... so we\nAre we're okay here for a little while but in the next few years we want to say about the pay cash for a large a good\n... so\nMy income is roughly a hundred thousand a year my wife know that she is on maternity leave really making anything\nIs she going back to work she won't know okay so you have a hundred thousand dollar household income what your townhouse worth two hundred and forty to fifty and when you move up what what price would you move up to\nRoughly four hundred\nOkay she and a hundred and sixty thousand and it's gone up in value during that time so you need a hundred and something thousand dollars how long has it gone tricky to save a hundred and something thousand dollars\nFor our question is I I Am quoting a wave the Fifteen Percent a month long ...\nOn my employer matches four percent ... so we have the Nineteen percent there that's going Nineteen percent of my income that's going to retirement mhm my question is would it make sense to go back to three baby step three D. no and no you know\nWhat a what is your age\nUh I'm thirty and my wife is going on and okay well you got plenty of time you're going to be OK I'm into here here's what's gonna happen during the next\nThree years five years whatever it is your income going to go up and the value of your town house they're going to go up or slow value of what you're trying to buy is going to go up to right but it's so we're not dealing with a fixed\nTo do forecasting with the fixed item your your income is not fixed it you know you're going to see some increases and the value of the town houses not fixed and of course your target is not fixed\nUm and so we don't know exactly where you're going to end up there but um no I I Would stay at Fifteen Percent if I were in your shoes and then I Would just save aggressively I Would take extra jobs any other money that comes your way inheritance is bonuses anything else\nThrow out in the house fund don't consume it anytime you can get your hands on anything just do it in the house fun though in the house fun though it in the house fun\nAnd um but we know if you save thirty thousand dollars a year that in three years and some change you'd have another hundred thousand but with a stone should almost be there\nSo I think your three I think you go through your plan you might have a four year plan something like that while doing the Fifteen Percent but it's going to be tied or be a tight budget to do that but you got trashed by not going to send your back into that you know that and you didn't have to go back into

VA is right in the hugest state yeah so they gave him a lump sum due to his disability\nNo he was one hundred percent disabled in every month he received money from the Veterans Administration and has been paid all his you know care bills and everything like that mhm\nBut because Mike would give it away on the first day he got at the Veterans Administration every family member to watch over his state and some might have been doing that for Twenty years oh my lousy so the state grew\nRational it's not they're not going to come after that they're not paid paid a disabled veteran for being

altogether\nThey don't know what they can do shows dream Trump hunt consumer federation of American Life insurance action where they pay a premium and they thought they paid for life and now they're facing extremely high premiums to keep them going recent wave of lawsuits which we're getting cropping up around twenty Fifteen of targeted units\nFor life policies sold in the eighties and nineties ensures offered an attractive guaranteed minimum interest rate the policy holders of about four to five percent\nSupported by higher interest rates set by the federal government during this time but a decade of rock bottom\nInterest rates in the wake of their financial crisis hurt insurers profitability reducing the return on the bonds an underpinning their products and so they jak the rates so here's what happens with a universal life policy\nWhy these things are happening why people are pissed off about it so you're told that if you pay a premium you'll have the policy of your whole life a portion of the premium goes to pay for the insurance and a portion goes into your investment called cash value\nThe problem is these things are based on the insurance and some of them is based on A R T which is an annual were noble term\nIf you think about it every year you live you're more likely to dodge statistically a forty six year olds more likely to die statistically than a forty five year old on average Seventy six year old is more likely to die than fifty six year old on average statistically speaking so they charge\nMore it costs more because of the probability of death to ensure someone who's older or by get that and so if the let's say you had a hundred dollar a month or two hundred dollar a month premium okay and if it started out at age\nThirty five and the cost to cover you at age thirty five was fifty dollars a month of the two hundred then you'd have a hundred and fifty going into investment that should be just fine right\nBut then what happens is over time the cost to cover you let's say let's let's get you up to age sixty\nMight be two hundred and fifty dollars you're only paying two hundred fifty dollars coming from eating your savings up that you put in\nAnd so your insurance costs goes up every year to the point that it passes the premium it eats up the savings when the savings is gone the insurance company comes to you knocking on your door and says now it costs three hundred dollars a month for you to just have insurance no savings\nBecause not only have as the increasing premium or eaten up what you were paying or the increasing cost of insurance eaten up your premium but it's also going over that and eaten up your savings now there's nothing left and we're not going to cover you anymore unless you pay this new higher premium for insurance only\nUses got screwed by buying a bad badly designed horrible financial product and so when all these guys are\nDoing if you don't understand the index university yeah flexible premium yes\nI Do understand that and I've seen this happen I've met with these people when they're sixty five years old and their insurance that they paid into for forty years has has completely self destruct did and now they're standing there with nothing\nAnd they paid huge premium is if they paid a one twentieth as much they'd had term insurance over all that same twenty year period of time\nAnd they could have invested and nobody's going to tinker with their investments and steal their investments to buy insurance premiums to some dead gum insurance company if it\nIf your if your insurance product has a if you have a life insurance policy that has a savings component to it\nIt's building up cash value you're getting screwed the worst of the worst for these things actually

five two to five you jump in Dave is in Cleveland, Ohio welcome to Dave Ramsey show Dave\nHey thanks nice to talk to your technical man what's up so I'm Wondering if it would be okay to sell my condo um [laughter] that is completely paid for a huge part of the fun to do a career change and pay for school flash living expenses since I Will be working part time or going back to school\nYou're single or married ... years old married mhm\nOkay and what is a career shift you want to do\nI'm so I'm a registered nurse and right now I'm In management um and I want to go back to school to be a nurse practitioner\nGotcha okay and how long will that take\nA it's going to be about three years in which it cost a forty five thousand\nThen you sell the condo and you rent and you use the money from the condo to live on while you go to school and pay for school\nI was I was actually thinking about saving up um some money in the next year to put down on a house on a Fifteen year loan and um so you know by by the mortgage\nAnd how are you going to pay for a house if you're not working\nOr well that was I was hoping I could have a some saving for say some of the funds from the condo go towards um living expenses for school or cetera\nYeah you're not a qualifier mortgage if you don't have an income\n[noise] I thought I was still working part time out that we make it about forty five thousand a year\nOh okay your wife work outside the home\nYeah she's a cousin told us and she makes what I'm about twenty five\nOkay and she or you are you going to be in the same city doing all of this year\nSo I'm not concerned about homeownership until three years from now if you want to if you want to do this and just keep all the cash available and make sure you hit your goal\nThat's fine let's make the turn with no debt and when we get out of the get out of school and land that you know nurse practitioners job and\nUh your income probably going to go up in that situation [noise] pretty substantially um then and you've done all of this for a hundred percent that free then you think about buying cars whatever you buy in the next two years is not going to be a house you keep two years later\nOkay because you're going to move up an income your income is going to go ... when you come out of school agreed\n[noise] yeah yeah\nAnd so I was a different house world than all of a sudden for you I don't mind if you rent something and just keep all your\nCasual viable to ensure that this dream of curves debt free because when I Dream of cars and its financial debt it often turns into a nightmare and we don't want to go that route but I Love the whole plan the idea and the will you know your willingness to sacrifice to get it done and researcher life in your thirties that's that's pretty cool man\nA pretty gutsy and I like it a lot\nUm and obviously you've investigated ... nurse practitioner and what they do every day and that is what you want to do with your life\nAnd I'm going to be heavily invested after this you're not going to be six months into that and go I don't watch a show I mean you don't want to get to that that's you're paying too big a price to get there but if you're going to play this through for the next couple of decades this could be a very very cool move for your family and for you or satisfying move\nGood question thank you for joining U.S Open phones a AAA eight to five five two to five Brett says on Twitter you can follow me there at Dave Ramsey by the way Facebook dot com slash day rooms is about five million Instagram dot com ... they ... about a million\nAnd Twitter about eight hundred thousand or wherever you guys want to pick up where I'm ... and you can pick it up there a branch as a family member mentioned it might be a good idea\nTo freeze my one year olds credit do you think that's necessary\nI don't know that it's necessary but I probably wouldn't do it\nI'm\nA I froze my kids when they were minors as soon as the law came out allowing you to freeze in law just shifted the other day and in late ... in late September allowing you to freeze a credit bureau without any fees now like you were allowed to charge you a fee to freeze it or an freezing\nUp until a late September twenty first the law shifted so um yeah I Would freeze it and and the only reason is if someone were to steal his identity give his Social Security number or somewhere and try to open an account of his name\nIs ... the company's trying they're trying to open the account with checks his credit they'll find it frozen and they would it would prevent that type of identity theft and fraud\nUm now if they don't check it it will prevent anything and only about three out of ten credit card applications that they actually run the credit on auto issue the other seven so that's how the issue credit cards on the people in dogs because they don't even bother to check and if they\nCheck bill discover you know a three you're a one year old with a frozen credit account all fall while this was fraud and they're not going to issue the car so it'll help you a little thing and I probably would do it\nAnd I'll probably not probably I Would go to Sandra insurance when I get out in the federal protection on your whole family including your children and they have a family plan that does that and that poses our the rams are showing the bugs will you before no one in the meantime remember there's ultimately only one way to financial be\nAnd that's the ... daily with the prince of Persia [noise] Mm\nYeah I just jinx child today with the radio station what Dave Ramsey dot com bust show [noise]\n\nDonald Trump's America\nAs diplomacy take center stage of the United nations the focus Thursday turned to the middle east Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu left out in Iran\nIsrael will never let a regime that calls for destruction to develop nuclear weapons not now not in ten years not ever\nAnd Palestinian president Mahmoud Abbas speaking out against Israel and shutting out and whether the Palestinians would come to the table in a U.S brokered peace process\nSeparated by Jerusalem is not for sale\nThe comments come a day after President Trump publicly expressed his support for a two state solution in the region that's what I think works best and his meeting with Netanyahu the president also said his goal would be to unveil a peace plan in the next two to three months\nThere's nothing I Would rather use and see these ... Israel and Palestinians\nAt the United nations David Lee Miller Fox News\nHe was radio nine sixty tell you we are seeing firming hat hat on line nine sixty got what you we are ... dot com\nI harsh radio sci fi it's four o'clock [noise]\nMuch is enough I mean the Brady socks knee is the Senate leader reaffirming the deadline for the FBI knew review of the Supreme Court nominee anticipating complaints when it's finished this year and help arc light on Capitol Hill the Brett\nAgainst judge Brett Kavanaugh and that would be by the way I read the FBI is already looking into allegations number two which was\nThe New Yorker piece this was by Mr Ramirez and remember even the New York times couldn't go with that story they had reported that\nThey interviewed several dozen people in an attempt to corroborate her story they couldn't find one person with first hand knowledge and then they reported that Mrs Ramirez herself was contacting\nFormer your classmates asking if they recalled the incident and told them hold some of them that she could not be certain Mr cabin all was the one who exposed himself now that's what they're saying\nAnd remember she admitted she quickly became a ... a jihad gaps in her memory foggy slurring of words\nSo that's what the Democrats are said there's a credible allegation well if it was so credible why didn't they ask judge Kavanaugh when he sat in front of the\nLast week 'cause they they all had the opportunity to delve into anything they wanted to delve into and they chose not to then we've got the the third incident which is the ... case where a woman claims that routinely\nAlmost on a weekend basis and she had been the ten of these parties were so personally that there was Brett Kavanaugh and a bunch of ... kids that were drug ...\nGirls and then lining up in the hall waiting their turn to rape innocent girls and a whole series of allegations he looked at as as Byron York said the gold polls\nHave moved very very far away very very quickly and all the people that but that's just going to be a week limited scope no big deal just an FBI invest you want to clear your name right you'd want to clear your name right judge\nIt's not about clearing his name it's about giving them more time so they can come up with more allegations and it doesn't matter at the end of the day Democrats do not even want a vote on judge capital\nAnd they want to continue the smears the slander the lies the mismanagement character assassination frankly the police\nThe gold blood joining of judge Kavanaugh and his family now as evidenced by now remember Dianne Feinstein had this for six long weeks she had this back in July there was a California state or California congressman that had\nIt early July and then they went to Dianne Feinstein Dianne Feinstein and two separate occasions was meeting with judge Kavanaugh and then of course we had the original hearings and not at one point that Dianne Feinstein ever mentioned professor Ford\nBut while she was meeting with him privately she was simultaneously recommending lawyers to professor Ford and one that was eventually chosen was Deborah cats\nAnd she is a lawyer that represents professor poured but which is fine but she has a history of oh challenging Paula Jones and supporting Al Franken so in other words she's\nRadical left political the attorney is\nAnd so anyway they were emails sent out we just found out late last week of a friend of this attorney for professor for this Deborah cats woman and she was in the hearing she was sitting to the right\nA professor forward or to the left on your screen if you were watching the hearings\nAnyway it goes on to say that friends emails were sent by a friend of Deborah cats the lawyer representing professor Ford recommended by Dianne Feinstein\nAnd they were soliciting women to accused judge Brett Kavanaugh of impropriety and this is what they were sending out last week where we just need an FBI Barry expeditious very quick very limited in scope\nThey were they have been and continue to be on a fishing expedition now the emails were obtained by the Washington Free beacon seeking corroboration from classmates of cabin all about your book and trees and gang rape\nAnd won emails sent a late last week delivered to roughly fifty alumni of stone rich school of the Sacred Heart an all girls school near Georgetown Prep\nWith the subject line corroboration needed Deborah cats need to find people who are familiar with what the slang terms were used by Brecht cabin on his year book page meant\nAnd the devil's triangle and the F F F F F a wording is in there if you can speak to any of these are willing to sign an affidavit please contact us that's a fishing expedition and that is ... this is what the Democrats wanted the delay for\nNow if it was truly limited in scope and we know that in the case of professor poured that they were four people she mentioned we're at this party some don't remember ever being even her best friend don't remember ever being at a party where Brett Kavanaugh was at\nThe end of the you know that when the perjury I mean ... under the penalty of a felony here\nSo they all signed these affidavits they're all agreed that the that they didn't have any recollection and the the most difficult part of it is is professor Ford identified an eye witness to the event that I witnessed his said under penalty of a felony\nThat it never happened what professor Ford is claiming and this is professor Ford who put\nMark judge in the room at the time of the alleged incident so I'm not sure what the FBI really can do in this case beyond\nSee whether any of these people are going to admit that they committed perjury and gave false statements ... there's nothing else really left for them to do please use your voice you will not get a second chance this letter goes on to say I mean well this point you're you're pretty much just soliciting\nYou know randomly anybody took ... please please come forward\nAnd then the hope is that it'll be delayed again and again and again and you know on top of that then we've got you know what was supposed to be limited in scope what was supposed to be done expeditiously in a week\nNow is turning into because they can't get anything else at least not that we know of yeah who knows what Dianne Feinstein knows then the only thing they've got is well did he committed perjury about the amount of alcohol that he drank you know could did he really black how would anybody know if he blacked out\nThat's the only he would be able to tell you if he blacked out\nNow he admitted to drinking to liking beer liking beer a lot still liking beer drinking too much beer you know being intoxicated he admitted to all of that when he was in high school and college which not all that uncommon let's be honest about it\nAnd so they're trying to say well he didn't he we know we had two of blacked out it was an I worked as a bartender\nFor a number of years I Know a lot about alcohol\nI watched it up close and personal\nYou know everybody's got a number for some people the numbers to and after two they lose\nFor some people I there were people that every single night I work could sit there from six PM till four thirty when I close the doors and other throw him out and they'd be walking straight having been drinking all night I mean the tolerance level from individual individual is just it's an enormous\nYou know you see some people that go beyond their numbers they become aggressive or flirtation I saw it all\nI learned a life lesson and it wasn't good if you go beyond what ever your individual number is it's never going to be good for you or or anybody else\nFor that matter um anyway so we got that and so it's not about limited in scope there's a lot of news or no time any uh was I don't know where the clock is I'm Mark Penn and wrote an interesting piece which I I found today\nAnd he said that
