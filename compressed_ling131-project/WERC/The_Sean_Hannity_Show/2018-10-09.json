{"month": "10", "state": "AL", "station": "WERC", "content": "Because the property is actually owned by the trust you\nThe items are owned by the trust if you don't do that then the trust has no benefit that's called funding the trust re titled ... everything you own end of the name of the trust\nWhich is a bit expensive two and a lot cumbersome\nUm consequently I was reading in financial planning magazine the other day article that said Seventy eight percent of the trust that are formed a number of fun to meeting people pay their stupid lawyer their financial advisor thirty five hundred bucks to build the trust and then they never retired all the stuff in the name of trust which means the trust of absolutely nothing it's got nothing in it\nAnd so it's a ... there's no value so I don't use living crush a I don't personally use living trust and I have a substantial network with a lot of detailed estate planning\nNow I Do have some trust I have a couple of trust here or there but the they have different functions then what this guy is describing and she'll know I Would not build trust now you can set up and you have your attorney or a state planning attorney do this not your financial advisor I trust to a family trust to be formed upon your death\nAnd upon your desk the money if both of you die and you're minor children the money goes into addressed and then it's management to go to the children was talking about that in the first segment of the shower and um or a second second one of the shower I guess but\nYou can do that that's that's not that hard to do and it doesn't really cost anything because there's no trust being formed a no trust happening unless both of you died I had that in my will when my children were minors\nAnd then of course my will has changed since the children are of age\nThere are no longer legally children emotionally either for that matter with her we go\nSo I mean some of your children that are emotionally still minors but of chronologically moved on like the guy [laughter]\nThirty years old ... ... and I'm a stay at home son [laughter] I'm a stay at our own sun [laughter] what your butt in the street [laughter] my sweaters Mike's in Chicago [laughter] my ...\nI'm good how are you doing better than I deserve what's up\nSo I uh have a baby step too I have a a kind of medical bills um and recently I was originally paying ten bucks a month for a medical bills that I had a they stopped it was an automatic withdraw and they stopped taking out and they've since my\nAccount to collections and then to a lawyer and refinance filming to court mhm I'm I'm just trying to figure out what my\nOptions are all if I Need to hire a lawyer or what I Need to do how much is on that bill a Fifteen sixty one thousand five hundred and sixty\nOkay and what's your household income or about Seventy five thousand dollars for them and what ten dollars a month because of all the other bills\nYeah I got all campaign hundred dollars in medical bills and a lot of credit card as well student loan\nSo what's what's the total medical bill balance\nOf all the medical bills and I have are probably Fifteen thousand dollars mhm [noise] and my daughter just diagnosed with a few other medical issues that more bills will be coming show\nHow to get a dollar and a three okay and what were the medical issues\nOr she has what's called ... syndrome a a carry mail formation and then she was diagnosed with epilepsy ...\nOkay you gotta do you guys are at a hard time with this little baby girl honey\nYeah yeah she's good if you ever since she was ... actually have a lot of things going on\nAnd how much credit card that do you have\nA lawyer probably at twenty five thousand dollars\nMhm and how much student loan to do\nThat one up there that's about a hundred and twenty thousand dollars ... who's the doctor [laughter] I'm just a teacher my wife has stayed on my\nCar [noise] All right [noise] um well what normally happens if you have a heart\nAnd you're a good person and you have a baby that is sick you pay all of your attention to the baby and it drains every drop of emotion and love and concentration and focus out of your family your body and your life and it's all directed at this baby\nAnd that's just that's what's happened to you which just means you're a good dad and the good husband\nYou guys are not paid attention to the money at all and all that means is your human but his screwing up your life now and you're going to have to deal with it right\n[noise] yeah so as tough as it is I'm your daughter is not going to get one hundred percent of your attention anymore I'm your money's going to have to get some percentage until you get this thing back under control so let's put the student loans if they're not already on hardship referral\nUm if you scrape together five to seven hundred dollars on offer it to the attorney on this Fifteen hundred dollars is a lump sum settlement they'll take it\nOkay because we called today a ... fairly call Kaylee said you know we ... what can we do and they just said\nUm you either pay the full amount plugged in court fees and attorney feed them or hire a lawyer will feel in court\nI'm with her because you've proven you're worth that over more than a fluke\nOr you did it over a long period of time so we know that you have to\nUm\nUnbelievable world class skills one is you have an in depth knowledge of luxury motor homes and uh how they work and what makes them tick and how you can help somebody in a situation and so on there okay that is a very narrow set of a skills\nIt really has only one application in your city and you lost that job okay the second thing we know is is that you know how to sell large ticket items to wealthy people\nAnd you're very good at it\nAnd so were you for instance to sell\n'em Ashton Martin ... or ...\nYou would be in a similar market\nAnd ... the downside is you don't know much about how they work you've never worked on them\nOr so the curve would be but you know how to communicate serve closed the sale handle the service after the sale how a high end luxury buyer wants to be treated and needs to be treated in order to create repeat business\nYou are an expert in that\nAnd I think that's set of skills can be applied in other places would you agree\nOr I don't care if you're selling a hundred thousand dollar watches if you want to do that that's fine I put ... I just came I went to something what wheels on it because you had some wheels or the motor before snow you're mechanically inclined as well so maybe that's it but you know I talked to a guy the other day is selling the crowd\nOf high and cars and he used to be in the um recruiting business she used to sell a you know recruit people for jobs\nAnd it's a similar skill set because we were dealing with high on the executive placement and then he's dealing with a executive placement into cars and it it's the same set of people you're dealing with this thing they think the same way you know how to keep that kind of person moving unhappy\n[noise] and I think if you think if you broaden that out that why do you have you back off your pan out with your camera angle you'll see that and I think you're going to be fine so I wouldn't panic I'm\nThe only thing I could think of is if you can kind of some kind of brokerage situation where you're brokering high end luxury RVs um for two hundred and fifty grand you can fly in and out of a city every so often and make a deal happen\nAnd so I mean you could go straight to manufacture or to a dealer of the same brand fired you but it's been a much larger metropolitan area and sell to people\nAll over the nation and hand hold their hands in the process with a broker process I'm done I'm not sure where the leads come from not sure how that deal happens but um when you're dealing with sometimes two or three hundred thousand dollars airplane tickets are cheap\nAnd that makes that deal happened you can't do that when you're making\nThirty five thousand but in your situation you there's a lot of stuff you can do um I mean you could be going one night a week and jump around and really close some big deals you could sell a jets private jets\nThat's another thing that would fit perfectly in your scenario um and the job market's pretty hot right now because the economy's booming\nCouldn't give a jet away two years ago and now you can't find one so I'm ... you know that's another place you that you think of a luxury mechanical element that's all I'm doing I'm just brainstorming out loud here but I think you've gotta lotta upside potential it may take you six months to land in the right seat\nBut you got plenty of money you're alright get on a budget watch what you're doing I don't know if you're spending come up um but don't don't do something dumb and it was a pimp what you use to make you call that okay don't say that was your passion either 'cause I'll smack you\nThis is the day room to show [noise]\nI Know it's

had a great idea what they're really saying is hey I can make some money off of you\nI mean really like playing with a skunk and wondering why you got sprayed seriously it's not it's not a pet it's a

should I go ahead and do that if I have a chance of coming back and working for the same company in the future\nYeah so I don't know what do we think gold is going to do in the future well we don't know what are we there house prices are going to do in the future where we don't know what do we think mutual funds are going to do in the future while we don't know the only reasonable way to forecast\nInvestment returns um is to say what they have done in the past\nOver a long period of time is likely to be what they will do in the future over a long period of time plus or minus\nWonderful and tragic events\nOkay guy which we can't predict those so the economy booms in other words you can't predict that exactly\nIf the economy tanks you can't predict that exactly if somebody fires missiles ... changes the economy you can't predict somebody's last couple of airplanes into a couple of towers you can't predict that but it will affect the economy so\nWhat we have to just give our best shot on that but the whole thing you've hurt you know a past our results are not indicative of future returns horseshoe crab which they are\nOtherwise you would buy and they buy a

matter of fact it's\nSucks as an investment over a long period of time and so what's this gold and silver worth today if you catch it all in around a hundred thousand so we call a hundred thousand dollars in the military but would you buy gold and silver coins with it no no [laughter] okay for the same reason that you wouldn't buy them again you would sell them today\nNo let's decide what we're going to be a hundred thousand oh you'd like to pay down the mortgage sure I'll go with that but they're ... they're separate decisions do you see what I'm saying\n[noise] kind of and to me that confusion as Matt I don't need the gold and silver like we can just plod along paying our mortgage and they'd gotten three and a half years no no no no no it's not about the more\nIt's not about to ask one more time hundred thousand dollars cash hundred dollar bills laying in the middle of your kitchen table uh-huh are you going to buy gold with it I don't need that money but are we going to buy gold with it\nYou know\nIf you keep this by tomorrow it's like you bought it again do you understand that mathematically\nYeah\nMaking the decision to keep it as the same as making the decision to buy it\nI could tell other people that when it comes to things like I'm OK borrowing from that far away on the path of markets have no other implication like sitting there okay\nYou know it doesn't have an implication forget the mortgage mortgage tent pretend like we were going to go to Disneyland but the money All right I don't care what we're doing the money the point is the way you properly analyze whether to keep the goal is to say I have a hundred thousand dollar sitting in the\nMiddle of the table would I buy gold with it\n[noise] ... [noise]\nAnd if you keep it tomorrow you bought it again and if you keep it the next day you bought it again\nEvery game keep something it's as if you made the decision to purchase it again for its current market value\nThere's nothing wrong with that as long as you don't mind buying it so let me give you an example if you if you and I both thought or if you thought gold was going to double in the next year and you had evidence to make you actually believe that\nWe're going to turn a hundred thousand and the two hundred thousand and one year and you all and you and I both believe that are just you believe that and we had a hundred thousand dollars cash sitting in the middle of the table and I said would you buy gold you're going crappy ass cause I can turn a hundred in the two hundred\nRight yeah but we're making the decision then not based on what we paid for it we're making the decision based on what we think it's going to do in the future\nOkay the decision to buy or sell or hold theirs is based on the future not the past other than we use the past to project our future but even when we do that with gold it tells us to sell\nSell sell it take your last take your lumps you made a dumb investment you lost a bunch of money that stupid tax now you've got a pile of money in the military well what do you wanna do with that money well modeled pals Morgan what the heck\nOkay therefore decisions are two different decisions are into different buckets to do ... proper critical thinking on this Jonah is in Dallas texas Hi Jonah how are you\nHey there how are you better than I deserve what's up\nI'm I'm a college student uh I have about ... between eight and ten thousand dollars a year is coming in that I don't have anything to pay for with parliament making for everyone um if a merit scholarship so that if I get a bunch of extra money\nOkay good for you very cool man for a merit based based on what your your grades or your citizenship or what\nUm my national merit have I have a national merit scholar\nOK and can you do anything to mess that up\n[noise] um I can but it's pretty it'd be a very high\nWhat's the or could you do that would mess it up if my GPA drops oh well that that's not that hard that's fairly easy okay yeah you can drop a GPA pretty easy okay so what what I Do if I were in your shoes I Would call up\nThat money in a savings account as an insurance policy to ensure that I finished school with no debt you are your best investment no I Would not invest this money\nOkay\nAnd um because you're you're the best investment mathematically what are you studying wrecked economic oh yeah you're a great investment you're going to do really well and and you're right you got all these great bass scholarship so you're you're a smart guy\nSo yeah I I don't need what the ...

Would say that my husband if I have we have the extra money went toward a car and get back down\nAnd kind of how much money's involved at ... right\nUm\nWell I analyze these things through the sentimental limbs as well and uh the way I Would ask myself this is okay grandma was obviously good with their money\n... she left her grandkid and kids nine thousand bucks okay mhm um show grandma sitting in heaven looking at a grandbaby what makes her smile because her granddaughter did this with the money you know I'm not thinking a dishwasher does that\n[laughter] now\nI get the tie into she taught you to cook mhm I might take a thousand dollars and buy some cooking utensils so that every time I use that set of\nPots and pans or knives or whatever that I thought a grandma otherwise but the rest of it on my car but I think grandma probably with somebody that hated debt and she might be smiling if you pay it off the debt I gotta agree with your husband\nOkay um but it's not that I'm not doing that through the lens or I'm calling your sentiments silly\nI'm just laying so I'm I'm just saying you're sentiment you can actually use that to try to say okay this you know the ... the

double dip huge ah actually another small Carlin besides by my retirement but that come full Medicare I mean Social Security ... next February\nAnd was thinking at sixty six I Would take that and try to reinvest it uh any gross more\nA cushion for my wife who's younger than me I think I've got enough money to live on but I Want to help her out a little bit cause she got a\nKind of a bad early retirement contributions to marry a ...\nA car early vote for the end the maximum a law that we can into our retirement through our employment mhm so am I actually had a twenty four or five apiece starting this year mhm so I'm Wondering what you thought about taking Social Security is sixty six like that\nNo problem at all especially will turn around and reinvest it\nWell we'll we'll have to pay some taxes on it you know we don't qualify for oil but oh well I think we still put me on a regular All right but you know\nWhat you would qualify for a Roth if you continue to earn at least five thousand dollars a year\nA well I Am a misunderstanding of their upper income limit on the\nOther is yeah yeah you can do not make over two hundred thousand dollar household income do you do\nOkay All right then you can do what's called a back door Ross I'd do that every year I might considerably more than two hundred thousand\nAnd the back door Roth is a at over fifty I'm over fifty euro fifty we can put in sixty five hundred each six thousand five hundred each if we want to\nI'm into I put it into good growth stock mutual funds for me and for my wife saw Thirteen thousand dollars each January I Move into a what's your news you move it into a ...\nAnd after about four Tom sorry before tax IRA traditional i._r._a. because that way you haven't had taxes taken out on it\nYou didn't take a tax deduction and then you roll it to a Ross instantaneously in on the same transaction it's called a back door Roth IRA I talk to your broker about it if you don't have one ... one of our smart best her prose they can show you how to do that but that that's the raw for the IRA issue but you can invest your Social Security money\nWhether you do a Roth or not you just put it in a mutual fund but if you're going to just take and spend it I mean you can do that too but you don't need the money you got plenty of money so I mean yeah I Would go ahead and begin to draw it\nBecause I'm you know the the faster you take it out when you turn around and reinvest it the more you're going to end up with a more than you would have in the difference in what it pays you by waiting\nUm so the only difference is if somebody's just consuming it and you're nowhere near that uh then you might run the calculation differently but if you're a poet and invest it answers always pull that as soon as possible and start investing it as you're going to end up with more alive and more dead by doing that\nI'm Marlene ... is with us in Austin, Texas how can we help today\nHey hey what's up for taking

opportunity that will make us more secure\nEverything you get is predictable Democratic Party one oh one mere slander ... merge meant blood joining whoever they don't like and don't agree with it's nothing new it is there one and only play book\nAnd we have chronicled this now for years on this program but the stakes couldn't be higher for weeks from tonight I'm you might hear the words Nancy Pelosi will be the next speaker of the house and committee chairman Maxine Waters and committee chairman\nJerrold Nadler of New York I born Jew over and over again they don't have any vision to make your life better\nOr they do want to destroy Trump they want impeachment open borders ice eliminated keep their crumbs and Obamacare short of that what else did they stay on for so if you got to start it's important to remember that you know it's an uphill battle in midterm elections\nThe party that controls the presidency has only gain seats in the house of representatives three times in the last one hundred years\nYou have also on top of that you've got about forty retirements to deal with which means that the names on the ballot or new and different hopefully better in some cases\nBut are you better off today than you or two years ago as a matter of America better off today than it was two years ago\nIs America stronger than it was two years ago is the economy better off than it was two years ago is the president keeping his word is promises to you the American people\nWe know that on the issue of the tax cuts well at least kept his promise on the issue of ending burdensome regulation he's kept his promise on building the wall he hasn't fully been able to do it because that hasn't been fully funded Kevin McCarthy introduced a bolt bill today to fully fund the wall\nBut he has spent three point three and a half trillion dollars to\nFund the wall in our record unemployment and fourteen states we now have the lowest unemployment rate in over fifty years the last time it was this low was Nineteen sixty nine when the New York Mets shocked the world and won the world series\nThat's how far back that goes Hispanic American unemployment record lows African American unemployment record low women in the work force record low record low for Asian Americans also record low for\nA veterans who have come back from war they're getting employed as well to\nPresidents kept his promises on feely dealing with rogue regimes like Iran and North Korea sanctions in Iran are now\nPaying off we see the Iranian economy about tank every day we see the whole issue with little rocket man we don't have a rocket being fired almost every other day that seems to be remaining on track the president hasn't given up anything in regards to that\nPresident has opened up an war we now have one of the largest oil reserves that was on available because of environmental extremism it's a vast wilderness and we just let it sit there\nAnd we haven't been able to tap into those resources or building the Dakota pipelines or the Keystone Pipeline that's all in the works now too\nIt's not a small deal is it that the president kept his promise and put to original is on the U.S Supreme Court they've now been confirmed he gave us the names of people that he would select from many selected from that list\nPromises made promises kept too short years and we see the benefits of the country\nAnd in twenty eight days or weeks from tomorrow from tonight you're going to tune in and we're going to find out what the results are the good news is is that you have the power here a lot more power than you even think\nNancy Pelosi's pick it up the drapes Maxine Waters is thinking impeachment Gerald ... endless investigation nobody's thinking about what they're going to do for you we the people\nWhat are they going to do they're going to now finally come out against Obamacare no they love Obamacare they're going to now say you know what these tax cuts are working and it's creating jobs they're not going to do that either\nYou know we've learned a lot in the last couple of days and we're really going to dig down deep do a Hannity investigation and the next hour in a while we've been so busy in the last three weeks covering the the blood thinning of judge Kavanaugh leading up to his confirmation\nThere's been a lot of news that we have not been covering one of them is John Solomon Sarah quarter you know Byron York everybody Catherine heritage of all been breaking stories but\nKnow we have all the evidence now that things were far worse regarding the effort to literally on do an election of the president first we know just to remind you can bring you back words a little bit remember Hillary Clinton\nSingle greatest obstruction of justice case slam dunk case in our history\nWe know that Hillary Clinton obstructed justice when she deleted subpoenaed emails\nAnd then use bleach pit and then busted up devices with cameras were had her age do it\nThat's obstruction but of course she had friends in the deep state they took the case away from the field agents and brought it in a house with the upper echelon of the FBI and that would be called me and struck in company and told me and struck in particular they wrote the exoneration Hillary in May of twenty sixteen\nLong before they ever interviewed Hillary or the main people involved in the whole thing\nAnd then all of a sudden they interview her Peter Struck one of the interviewers\nMan that thinks that Hillary should win a hundred million to zero and they exonerate Hillary three days later and then they launched the Russia investigation\nAn exoneration before an investigation that means the fix was it if the field agents if they were allowed to do their job it never would have ended up that way because they would have followed the rule of law they would have they would have kept their pledge of equal application of our laws\nWell now the new evidence and remembered than all everything goes back to the dossier that Hillary\nAnd paid for but we now know that last week while we were covering the cabinet issue that the FBI general counsel James Baker remember he reported directly to James Cole me well he told congressional investigators last week that an attorney remember the company ...\nThat's the company that Hillary's campaign and she was controlling the DNC money according to Don and Brazil or they will funneling money into Perkins Kuwait\nThe chronicle by both the deputy FBI Director Andrew McCabe in and his lawyer Lisa Page That's Peter strokes boyfriend they went into the office of a third FBI official\nA girlfriend rather sorry\nLisa Page was it was she was his boyfriend he was her she was his girlfriend\nAlright enough you're interrupting me anyway went to the office of a third FBI official general counsel Baker they told Baker what Rod Rosenstein said so now we've got three witnesses that say that Rod Rosenstein talked about surreptitiously taping Donald Trump\nAfter Rosenstein comments were reported in the New York times about what three and a half weeks ago he sent out word through intermediaries that he didn't really mean it that he was speaking sarcastically oh you you want me to put on a wire and tape Trump\nAnyway but it appears that you know that's not how top FBI officials took it the thing that struck\nMe the most was the serious look on Baker's face when he was describing it according to a source close to the investigation of of bakers house interview he was saying that may have been page took it seriously because they took it seriously but as he took it seriously other words they all thought he meant it\nWhich now I Know the president met yesterday with Rod Rosenstein apparently that's a meeting on air force one\nStatement says they got along you know fine but\nYou know Rod Rosenstein is up to his eyeballs and everything involving this thing [noise]\n\nThere might be a million enrolling in health care for

at a time this is Sean Hannity show\nI twenty five until the top of the hour scary hurricane season continues and hurricane Michael now is headed straight for the Florida Panhandle looks like it could hit land at a category three\nA and there's a massive storm surge risk for the panhandle and and the entire area that would be destined Fort Walton Beach uh and surrounding communities and uh is hurricane warning storm surge warnings have all been issued along the Gulf Coast\nAs I understand that we have some evacuations now taking place and it looks like it's a really big threat to the panhandle thoughts and prayers go to our friends down in\nThe panhandle area we check in with both job of started the official weatherman other Sean Hannity show and of course he's with weather bell dot com and spin I'm being told that the worst storm to hit the Florida Panhandle and like decades how bad is\nWhy I say I think it's going to be the or maybe the worst on record in Panama City or that area particularly last major hurricane to hit coming in at this angle was a hurricane ... back in Nineteen Ninety five hurricane cage\nIt there in November believe it or not um Nineteen eighty five that was a major hurricane in the Gulf\nBut a week into a category too when it went through there so this is probably going to be the benchmark storm for that Panama City area now the fortunate thing is if we want to cover the a sort of the silver lining here Pensacola and mobile are going to get north wins\nAnd mobile I don't think this is a big deal and mobile Pensacola go forty ... sixty maybe three four inches of rain\nBut once you start moving east southeast went down the coast and especially at that Panama City area\nThis is going to be as bad as you see in that particular area\nThe weather pattern you remember Florence was\nOff its peak when it hit the north Carolina coast this one because of the weather pattern is intensifying as it comes to the coast\nAnd I don't expect anything to stop it from being a place that strong category three perhaps even a a borderline category for upon landfall very well telegraph in this pattern you remember Shawn last time I was wrong with you I said I'll probably see for a week in October\nWhy why why is this now getting stronger the way you're describing and ... what does it mean to look for the average person including me has no idea\nWhy the actual angle of the ... when it\nReaches land matters so much what is the angle of the storm matter\nIt's also the overall pattern one Florence was coming into powder in the western Atlantic was a weakening as far as tropical site clones September twentieth believe it or not Japanese ... see it's maps came out and said look out October of ...\nThrough about the nineteenth and the Atlantic basic you notice all the tycoons have shut down in the western Pacific completely and say well what does that have to deal with that as well when the action stops there like a good last year it shifted into the Atlantic basin and that's what you see going on folks as you can watch this stuff\nComing to three weeks away now I Can't tell you well is it going to New Orleans or is it going to Tampa oh or whatever I could say this general area has got to look out during this time that's what we saw it once we got so last Thursday and friday you know then showing knows I emailed him down all this stuff to get him ready about this\nYou could see this coming right up into the Gulf of Mexico so that area has not been touched remember we hit Louisiana and Mississippi with Gordon Alberto\nWe hit it off to the east over there with or it's this is going right in between and instead of coming western North West setting it's heading into classical faction from the southwest and it's going to race through the Carolinas so you folks in the Carolinas you're going to happen\nFast moving tropical storm go through there and unfortunately a lot of these areas that were hit by Florence is going to be another three to six locally ten inches of rain\nComing Thursday night into friday morning friday the storm will be between Cape Hatteras in Norfolk go right after the to the south of New England no problem in the north east from it but it is going to be a big problem even in the Carolinas or because of the fact that there's more rain coming\nSo you're going to you're basically saying this is going to come up through the Florida Panhandle it's going to sort of veer right hit the Carolinas hard and then go out to sea\nYeah won't hit the ... you'll see forty to sixty mile an hour winds maybe guts to hurricane force\nThe outer banks and forty or sixty mile an hour winds Charleston Columbia uh Augusta places like that as it moved up it's going to accelerate through there where we are looking at the devastating wind power with this hurricane is Panama City that is ground zero for the worst part of this storm", "show_name": "The Sean Hannity Show", "year": "2018",
