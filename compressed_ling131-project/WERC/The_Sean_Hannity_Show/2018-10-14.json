[noise] hey my point is a today a\nWith Hillary's comments it a ... liberals don't need to be civil to conservatives anymore it reminded me\nOf a profound quote came across ... years ago and maybe even you set it ah but here's the quote a society is either moving toward civility for barbarism and I see Trump trying to apply civil law and order to our society\nAnd it's apparent that the liberal left his embrace the farmers just wanted to get your thoughts\nAre ... the but the question is do I do I agree that uh our society has always trending toward a\nBarber is what what barbarism in a society barbarism or civilly were trending one way or not in the middle exhort eater trending towards the middle of the barbarism off the clocks and the oh it's a constant influx and so what what what what is your question more Trump isn't it\nWell it seems as if a Republican conservatives are taking the side of civility and working\nUh you know towards the law and order or restoring it and it seems like the Democrats have just outright embraced barbarism right ah with all of their character assassination attempts on Trump Kavanaugh the ante a violent shooting\nYeah there's no there's no question about that it's an active choice I mean\nHillary Clinton's endorsing it\nAbsolutely and uh it's it's sad to see because this is not the [noise]\nDemocrat Party of my uh mother and father and

party over your dad or your grandpa what what they want but they're doing\nWell um the Democrats at at that time they see a issue was a labor laws and a win\nFor what purpose\nMy part of the Democratic party hasn't changed that much is my point of the Democratic party has always been rooted\nIn the modern era in our lifetimes of this century and the previous at the Democratic party has

affidavit signed by a career federal law enforcement officer who swears\nThat the information the affidavit is true and correct to the best of his knowledge and beliefs\nAnd that's the way we operate and if that's wrong sometimes it is if you find out this enemy incorrect in there that person is going to face consequences\nMr Rosenstein decided we couldn't get it until your report came out he sat on it for a month the time I I Can't speak to how they were not the first time Mr Rosenstein is kept\nUs from getting information needed information from the project and all kinds of important conversation between ... redacted that promise we had to go over to farm and find it wouldn't be the first time he hasn't given us information frankly I think we're in time do I want a real well\nWe've got thirty seconds and all the time to get it\nThe subject here Mr I'm miserable with time I appreciate that but I Do think it's interesting that you had it you discovered it and we couldn't get it right away might call the other ... we had to wait until the final report\nRight our to Sean Hannity show toll free number is eight hundred nine four one Sean if you want to be a part of the program what we played their Rod Rosenstein you know for people that did wrong in the deal Jay face consequences\nRegarding fights that well he signed the final buys a warrant himself and then when he's talking about the rule of law and speaking up for truth and Jim Jordan blasting Rod Rosenstein uh conduct now the president met yesterday on air force one apparently had a meeting not a lot of details about what went on in the meeting\nWith Rod Rosenstein there was talk about well he might be fired after it had been discovered that he was talking about well you want me to wear a wire\nAround the president and his answer was you know at least has the spin was well I was just saying that you wouldn't want me to wear a wire around the president and it was all in the tone and the cadence of what he said we have three articles in front of me right now one by Katherine heritage at Fox one by Sarah Carter won by John Solomon\nA Solomon's article goes on former FBI lawyer plot to record removed Trump was not a joke and John Solomon let me read from the article don't tell for FBI general council member James Baker\nHe was one of those that resigned that those infamous discussions\nAbout secretly recording president Donald Trump and using the tapes to remove him for office where a joke he apparently doesn't believe it and he yelled quite the vantage point as he was on the inside of the FBI bureaus leadership and may have twenty Seventeen when the discussions occurred and Baker told Congress last week\nThat his boss than acting FBI Director Andrew McCabe remember ...\nAnd Lisa Page both took notes of the meeting and McCabe was saying yeah Rod Rosenstein had in fact said this\nAnyway now James Baker is saying and Andrew McCabe is saying that in fact they were dead serious about about the idea of Sarah surreptitiously recording the forty fifth president\nUsing the evidence to make the case\nThat Trump should be removed from office according to every source now in all three articles and Baker told lawmakers that he wasn't in the meeting that McCain had with the deputy attorney general Rod Rosenstein in which the subject came up but he had first hand conversations with Medicaid and the FBI lawyer that\nWas assigned to a cave and that leads to page about the issue so Baker talk to both of the un quote as far as Baker was concerned this was the real plan being discussed that a source directly familiar with the congressional investigation it was no laughing matter to the FBI or member then you can go back to what was the insurance policy to remove Trump\nIs five months now into his presidency isn't just before the appointment of the special counsel\nAs soon as Justin ... at that time frame around the media elite strategy that was occurring anyway so it goes on word of bakers testimony now is surface just days before Rosenstein said to be interviewed him private by the\nHouse Judiciary committee lawmakers that's supposed to happen Thursday of this week and the New York times first reported allegations that Rosenstein the number two at the department of justice has tried to downplay his role in all of this in his office suggested that\nHe thought the discussion was a joke that Rosenstein never gave in order to carry out any such plot and he doesn't believe the Trump should be removed from office\nOf making those statements throw spokes person is a bit different than having Rosenstein himself face Congress answer the questions under the penalty of a felony if lawmakers think he's lying and bakers account lawmakers this month clearly complicates that already complicated picture\nAs it relates to Rod Rosenstein before Congress assuming he shows up for Thursday's interview but even more so Baker story lays ... extraordinary conversation and we go on from there and now we've got to really take our time with this issue today and\nWe're going to now begin to put the pieces of the puzzle together because what this is we're laying out here are the top people at the upper echelon remember twenty five people have either been demoted fired or have left the FBI the OJ and their\nUpper ranks here and James Baker is one of them and Andrew McCabe at least a page of both corroborating what apparently now James Baker is set about Rod Rosenstein anyway John Solomon ease but investigative reporter is what the hell\nRag Jarrett Fox News legal analyst and of course the seller of the number one book the Russia hoax\nThank you all for being with us I'm John let's just I Want to also put this in context where people because it gets complicated\nWe got a first start with the fine line the timeline is may have twenty Seventeen or that's when Robert Mueller is getting appointed by Rod Rosenstein\nJust before that we had people like let Lisa Page in and Peter Struck talking about uh media leaks strategy\nThat had to do with the dusty a while it now appears that that was all being league for the purposes\nAnd again ... all it was was the ... a recycled and different news outlets for the purpose of initiating the special counsel so would get appointed that we're discovering that they're even talking about Sarah ... taping the president of the United states so that they can remove him from office this sounds like a cool to me\nOr if there's one other event that occurs and that may timeframe that really I think it's the shock wave for this conversation and that was the termination of James\nComey's the FBI directors that allowed all this Russia investigation to go on and we know now from just after market in may and they still have that where you're from a proving any form of collusion with Russia so they've been nine months out of James Kobe's let this go on for nine months\nHe's let two agents who have an anti Trump fires read that investigation he get fired and what's the natural reaction of all those who've been supporting James Comey roses is a a Medicaid\nAnd a stroke page it's hey maybe we can remove this guy rather can't prove that he did something wrong with Russia maybe we can prove easier to complement and will will record him\nAnd uh and maybe try to take 'em out through the recording and the twenty Fifth Amendment this is not what the FBI was brought into the wrong track record talk about history his book lays out a real possibility that this was a soft grew right look at this we have the FBI had access to eating a crime here that in fact they can't find a crime by a page\nAs well at least the pages testimony just to be clear she said they um they had found nothing and nine months leading up to the point\nThat's right so they switch gears right maybe we can remove them through other means and and this conversation is so extraordinary ...\nThat says that job for the FBI or twenty Fifth Amendment never envision the FBI being involved in it she got the FBI and the deputy attorney general\nOr allegedly our conversation he says it's a joke they say they're dead serious about it and they believe he was dead serious about it and no matter which way you're coming down it's just another example of how far down the road with the FBI was beyond its core mission which is to investigate crimes stop counterintelligence\nAnd again this has nothing to do with rank and file agents that all this this is just a group of rogue\nPower hungry upper echelon management types and if anything they took the the cases away from the field officers purposely so that they can involved themselves in these nefarious activities that's why\nIt really does explain a Greg Jarrett why every FBI guy I Know is so angry about this because they know was ripped out of their hands\nAnd this and all of them say that if this was them they know they get fired\nThat's right and in fact I interviewed former top officials or the FBI who are angry at people like James Comey Andrew McCabe James Baker Lisa Page\nPeters struck for ruining the reputation the good name of the FBI I wrote a column recently that said Rosenstein actions\nIn an attempt to deposed the sitting president United States\nIs the equivalent of an attempted coup not a bloody violent coups what's known and John refer to it a moment ago as a soft coup ah using in misusing their power in the law to remove a sitting president and so here we now have not just James Baker\nWho was told this was serious but the people in the conversation with Rosenstein\nWho are Andrew McCabe and Lisa Page you said he was dead serious\nRecruit people to invoke the twenty Fifth Amendment and secretly record the president to gather evidence in support of it uh Rosenstein\nWhenever he gets caught engaging in wrongdoing claims oh I was misunderstood he threatened the intelligence committee staff members in January first denied it\nThen it mitigated but said oh\nI was misunderstood he threatened Devon newness\nAnd said oh I was misunderstood and now in his attempted coup of the president of the evidence indicates he is saying oh I was misunderstood it was my words were misinterpreted it was just sarcasm\nThis audience is going to be the solution but a new pressure can once you understand

uh they're saying the Baker said it Baker and heard about it and the other two actually took notes about it at the time the other story that we're following is\nWhen he was pretty stunning revelation and since it directly contradicts what the Justice Department and the FBI officials have set in sworn testimony but\nJames Baker also telling Congress last week member of the law firm Perkins Kuwait\nThat's where Hillary's campaign that's where the DNC funneled money so it would look like a legal expense when in fact there was anything but and then they hired fusion GPS and research firm that went out and got hired by the name of Christopher Steele and he used as Russian sources to put together\nA series of papers they become known as the ... same dusty a that was never corroborated uh verify but used as a buys a warrant application the bulk of information to get a ... a warrant to spy on a Trump campaign associates\nAnd it gets worse than that it was used even though this information was not corroborated it was disseminated on all levels of government to propagandize on line to the American people in the lead up to a campaign and then it was used when our understanding to bludgeon\nThen president Donald Trump and to try and get him removed from office and creating a phony Russia Trump narrative that never ever had any evidence whatsoever anyway we found out that you
