I'm from Taiwan\nUh-huh\nHow am I have I'm twenty five thousand previous player in a retirement plan and I know you talk about pulling it out and praying that are not pulling it out but ... ... fine good guy went corrupt guy in our church who worked for a drive in finance telling hip our favorite holiday sales\nAnd and I and I I mean every I Need that ... and we talk about you but I felt that we put money other variable annuity mutual mhm and I wasn't sure why or if that was okay our topic you're following\nYou and I did not following you know what is not following what I teach um I think how to answer that\nPart of the question variable Newt mutual fund or variable annuities are mutual funds inside of\nAn annuity if you pretend like the mutual fund as an investment in the annuity is a coat that goes around the investment to keep it warm from taxes\nOkay okay and you pay extra for the annuity portion of this discussion now what you could buy those exact same mutual funds with less fees without the new coke wrapping around them okay\nSo what is the ... do for you the coat wrapping around it to keep it warm it does the same thing the fact that it's in an IRA already ... so you're buying to coach for the same kid\nOkay okay you see what I'm saying you got it's already going to be kept out of the cold of taxes by the fact that you're rolling it into an IRA okay and then you move it into it and knew the inside of an IRA it's redundant\nYou've already got the protection now the only thing the annuity we'll give you is they'll give you some guarantees a along the lines of you know if it goes down in value you know they protect you on principle and it will give you at least a four percent or five percent of income but if you're invested in good mutual funds when you're young you don't need those guarantees\nSo I'm okay and truthfully not not trashing driving I mean driving her friends of ours are good people um but I Would not use that product there and the thing you need to remember about variable annuities versus a direct mutual funds sale is there's two things going on usual\nUsually if someone's trying to show you that because they don't have a securities license they only have a life insurance license\nOh okay and that which way they can make such a way in insurance person can get you into mutual funds is through the variable annuity they cannot sell mutual funds directly unless they have a securities large\nThe second thing that you run into that region you run into this and it's less often for this and I don't think that would be the case with thriving is that they're actually doing this because the commissions on a verbal new to you about four times what they are are on a regular mutual fund\nOkay so some people ... just because they make\nMore on them\nAnd I would not accuse the secular guy of that and the situation I mean knowing his from knowing the setting that you did this my guess is he's probably not security watch that's my guess okay and and you can't use still giving you a bad recommendation\nBut a hundred twenty five thousand about you're pretty good rental house in the St Louis market\nAnd if you don't mind the idea of that and working with a renter and making sure that you know they don't tear up stuff and\nUh that you're you know you do a good job of a screening them vetting them before you come in and you you know you're kind to them but you're from with them they're going to pay your you have to move 'em out and you do all that kinda stuff\nReal estate and making good money uh especially paid for real estate it's very very nice I got a bunch of it [laughter] but if you don't want to do with all that and I just get I Would pick some good mutual funds and go that way\nBut at the point is there's no shame and your game by keeping it simple\nSomehow people have the idea that primitive or simple is bad\nAnd the contrary to the contrary it it the truth is the contrary to that the truth is is that the typical person who builds a network of up to about ten million dollars a does keep it very very clean and very very simple\nSarah is with us in ... uh Seattle, Washington Hi Sarah how are you\n[noise] I'm doing well thank you Kelly taking my call\nWe'll we'll let Kelly answer your question if you want [laughter] what something Sarah [laughter]\nUm I'm trying to get a little bit of advice and how to advise my parents to get long term care insurance\nMy daddy is sixty seven and doesn't qualify them health issues for my mom just turned sixty a couple of months ago a couple of months ago and we're talking and my dad says well\nNow for the insurance doesn't fit in our budget and my mom says that short term thinking ... and I think they need at the budget\nWhich there how income\n[noise] um [noise] well that's a good question they are retired missionary power they have made a town and my dad and now a kayak and my mom worked at the reception is I don't know exactly what he\nMight not fit in their budget okay\nI mean there may have to buy very very limited policy if they don't have hardly any income why what's wrong with your dad that he doesn't qualify\n[noise] um he has made us have had a kidney transplant\nAnd so he's attempted to get it in the past and hasn't been able to\nDo some I tried to do what you said the Potter back or whatever you know say you know what works for me to fathom mhm really hear how they get\nTo get in front I get too much into that gave out but I mean I'm like last year I encourage them to look into that and who they talked about al ... I think today off at that point out\nSo if you if you can't talk about this what are they gonna do it or not I mean how can I help\nOut my mom called me and told me all that so I think she's on board of trying I guess my question is um [noise] how can I have had to convince them that they poured into your\nMom already knows it's important not only question is I don't know if they've got the money to buy much of a policy sounds like they're pretty broke too many\nUm with what you're describing I don't know I mean some people come off of mission field not broke but but sometimes I don't and so you just got to you know um it it sounds like you're trying to fix something a lot harder and they're trying to fix it you can't make them do this\nAnd so I think your ... your mom's question and the yeah I mean if there's any way I could get it into my budget I Would get it into my budget\nUm but it sounds like his health is he's an older than her about Fifteen Years and he's are no I'm Sorry

attending and she was telling us about budgeting and paying our credit card and I kinda just pass\nIt off at the time because we already followed a budget\nAnd then I catch it on the radio show a few weeks after that and um I really liked her no excuse attitude for paying off debt\nSo I came home and suggested they told me that we should go to a total money make over one day event and so we did that and we decided to give it a try and so we were where was that have been held Kansas City okay very cool\nVery cool and I got you guys going you know we started to do that and we finished baby steps two and three ... and we had just finished baby steps three in October two thousand and twelve and then just a few short weeks after that our entire world kind of fell apart\nAnd when he was diagnosed with for brain tumors whoa\nSo at that time we went into survival mode for a year or so while he was in and out of the hospital having surgeries um during that time we also cash load about Fifteen to twenty thousand dollars mhm and medical debt\nAnd medical bills mhm and we also made the difficult decision to sell the family business are closed at the time and so we liquidated that and we've got about fifty thousand dollars and that sale\nAfter he was back in good health and working full time we sat down with that our budget and how much we had to pay off on the house and we just knew we had to finish it with his health history so we just made the commitment and kept moving forward\nWhile she'll go ahead and just be brain tumors in the process yeah\nGood for you think you will on man that is awesome ... gonna do it without these yes I'll bet I bet you guys are fall through some real stuff and paid off ... Italy but we're\nVery very cool well life does happen while we're more we're making other plans doesn't it and uh you you just push pause for a little while and took care of business and then push play again right\nRight so good for you what do you tell people the key to getting out of debt is\nHard work and perseverance there's discipline mhm\nAre disappointed he's pointing at her for that I Can't see through your radio yeah very cool great ... and so you've got a the line up with your the kid knows whether you give me their names and I just\nWe have tally sixteen ... they Megan will be Fifteen next week mhm Carmen is ten and Taylor seven\nHour right very cool so ah the ghettos and and they've struggled through this whole thing too with you obviously they asked they learn anything in the process\nI think so I Hope so [laughter] good okay well congratulations you guys were very proud of in June graduations on beating the brain tumor man that's an incredible story thank you very cool and now I hear your set with a paid for a house\nRight okay and so your questions what uh\nWhat can I Do they tried to help him uh you know get on the right track as well as making sure I'm preparing myself for my financial future so I don't end up in a month yeah he's in a\nThey're already preparing yourself for your financial future you're Seventeen years old you actually know the day Ramsey show exist go figure so I mean that that alone is is um put your way ahead of the game and most people so you know what to do and and and you're obviously observed\nFor some things you don't want to replicate from your dad even though there's probably some things that he does that are good things not necessarily win money but but and he's probably got some good traits that you do when Kate and carry forward [noise]\nUm so uh um well the first thing is is that you learn to stay on a budget you learn to stay out of debt you learn to save money for emergencies and invest for the long term\nYou don't spend more than you make 'em you don't get the credit cards and carry them around so that's how you prepare for your future and obviously you're gonna have to handle your own a school\nAh and you know on your show you have a lot of work ahead of you but that's okay you'll be fine\nAs far as you go now as far as him on there's not many men on the planet\nThat will take financial advice from their Seventeen year old middle son\n[laughter] absolutely\nYou have the powder bud syndrome once someone has powdered your but they really don't want your opinion about money or sex [laughter] and so he's not looking for your advice even though he knows he's probably wrong uh so you're probably not the man to speak up and caused this to happen that's my guess\nNo show what are we going to do well there's a couple of things you could do um one is is there a person in his life uh particularly another man that he respects is their\nBusiness ability their money ability or even they're just they're spiritual walk\n[noise] ah well definitely our pastor in the past there have tried helping them in the past but it seems like no matter who's talking to 'em or what or how they're trying to help and he just doesn't seem to either comprehend any of it or want to replicate any of that and he's very stubborn and being his own man\nMhm okay well I think if I were you ever talk to your pastor again you know I I find people every day I've been doing this for a lot of years and I found people every day who\nTwo years ago ... wouldn't listen but now they list a five years ago they wouldn't listen but now they listen so all of us you know the stubbornness comes and goes with all of us and be in our own man comes and goes but if the past or you know just a leans in and and I think\nI'm most pastors if they're going to make an error it would be on the side of being too soft not too hard\nAnd so I might if I were you ask her past her to turn up the heat is just a little bit more\nAnd just spending time with your dad and push on your dad on this subject\nAnd not mentioned that you are involved because you're not involved\nYeah you can't fix it and you keep your mouth shut down you're not gonna do anything but make things worse\nVery true yeah because he's going to go he's going to do whatever he wants to do and then uh you know at the end of having done everything you can do I mean you know if you wanted to give him a total money make over ... book or something you could do that but you have to be\n... I was thinking about doing that for like Christmas or something I Would just say now this is something I read\nThat I liked I thought you might enjoy it because you like business\nOr something like that not like a hey you're really fat here's a book on how to not be fat\n[laughter] that doesn't work right that's insulting yeah fall on me and so you know instead you would just say are just kind of blow it off and make it not might not make it a big deal that it would change my life I Would feel so good if you would read there's no don't do any of that crap\nJust kind of keep it nonchalant and just go hey I read this I thought you might like it because you like business stuff or something like ...\nAnd and just see if he picks it up he may throw it away he may put it on the coffee table as a coaster for the next two years and then open it we don't know how this was going to work but at least on a minute outside expert your pastor is an outside influence\nThat does have or could potentially have the credibility for him to listen to\nSome people aren't listening anybody and so you have to be willing to go I Love my dad in spite of his um incompetence and this one area of his life and I'm just gonna love him where he is it's all I can do\nAnd a writer and you may you may do that your whole life ... you know he may go to his grave doing this and\nAnd show your love is not conditional upon you know whether you handle money well or not your respect for him it's not even conditional on that\nBut you're not gonna take financial advice from somebody that's misbehaving with money so he's not going to speak into your life on money issues but that's all that's all you know I don't speak into people's life on growing hair because I Can't seem to do it on top of my head so I don't tell people how to grow here so if you can't do something you shouldn't tell other people how to do it right\nYou shouldn't have any even have an opinion this loud about it but people try all the time so just kind of keep that in the back of your mind their joy hey thanks for calling in Mount open phones a triple eight eight to five five two to five Jay is in Jackson, Tennessee Hi Jay how

pay\nCut 'em so even if he were to round them a check they will not Andrew in agreement\nOr he said if I come in to their office I Will get a receipt but they will not give me a payment agreement beforehand\nAnd that's fun that's fun but it I get a receipt I get a a a statement that says this judgment ... dad is one hundred percent clear it upon this payment not ever seen that as you pay the money a receipt to says you paid money doesn't mean that you paid Seventy five percent you're still owe twenty five percent\nOr what he said it is it would be a he called and they were the but also saying that that what would be sent to the county clerk or to mark that it is I ate all and\nAs long as you have something in your hand that says the debt is settled in full and it's in writing you

I'm calling for career advice I'm twenty eight years old I've been working in bank to them which are uh several years and I've been able to narrow down my passion which is a financial coach helping people go blow\nBut in my current roll my own aligned with a longer work um banks are the bankers very heavy on lending and sometimes I don't think that the right thing for\nFor everybody so I find myself talking to people how to read another teacher ... and my question is how can I pursue my passion of the financial coach without ... pretty good\nWell what do you make right now\nOkay so first of all I think you need to to a deal with the guilt I absolutely love where you're coming from and your values and I understand you're having to sell something that you don't believe in but in in the temporary\nA you know don't take on this massive guilt what you want to put your interview on right now is how quickly can replace that eighty thousand dollars so that I can step over into the uh financial coaching space or or like one of our smart vest or prose\nYour Dave Ramsey fan you're part of the tribe you know about are smart best prose and I think one of the first piece of advice I Would give\nIs to go sit down with one of those folks locally in uh Miami area of all those folks are listed on the website I'd find two or three of them tell them you're Dave Ramsey fan tell them your situation just the way you laid it out to us\nAnd and say can I take you to lunch or take it a coffee and learn the best path\nTo get where you're at to do something similar they are going to give you some very very practical or knowledge and some next steps then you do your own homework\nHow much training how much qualification certification or whatever that is that you need to be able to do that that's something you can do and then once you know that you say OK how much is that going to cost me from a financial standpoint and then from a time standpoint these are basic\nResearch questions\nAnd so once you get the answer to that you've got the formulation of a plant and so you take that wisdom and knowledge from somebody who's actually doing what you want to do\nAnd then go do your own homework on what is going to take and you've got yourself a timeline an action plan and and then to to the extent that you can go work for one of those people\nAre and go work in space like that and get in proximity and learned the process and get good at it uh and when maybe you're doing your own thing one day is that something you'd ultimately like to do is have your own business\nThen I think twenty eight I Would do it for somebody else for a while and work your way up and are you wanting to be a financial planner or a financial coach a financial coach\nCoach okay cause a financial planner you'll have to go get your the F P and like there's a lot of that stuff\nDown the ... that started doing it I totally agree but the financial coach it's more almost like a counseling you know the type of situation\nBecause you'll have to get referrals and all of that so I Would definitely say we have a lot of those that have gone through our financial training or financial um master coach training here ... I Would say that's a great first step to uh to come here go through that training Chris Hogan teachers a lot on that and it's phenomenal\nAnd they'll go through that and and try to figure out people in your area that are doing that and then even get connected like even some churches some places that will have\nPeople and families that need this specific health that that they can give you the referral a cause that would be huge as well so that that takes a little bit of time and build up your book of business you had that financial coach but it's totally do well and to make that money for sure and salad I definitely would go through our training on that\nRoute and I think you bring up a good point racial Chris at twenty eight I think you do need to look at the differences even if they're somewhat nuanced somewhat specific between the coach\nAnd the plan or because I think you can be a financial planner and make that money a lot faster and it's still a coach mean Dave says all the time\nWe go sit down with Jeff do bonds and his team that's that's one of our local guys if I sit down with Jeff and I we want to know that he's got the heart of a teacher well that's a ... well I Do think you've got to do some specific research there Chris to be able to determine what does it look like day to day what do I want to be doing day to day that fulfills me\nAnd at twenty eight you have plenty of time to get there but in the meantime while you're pursuing the plan I Can't say this enough\nAnd Hogan crafts we call him he'll get run here is just phenomenal at what he does so\nWe spent the entire episode talking about everyday millionaires so what does it look like to build wealth millionaires look like the mists around that the truth around that and it's so great like we even sit and George Campbell our very own one here at the Daily Show out in the streets national asked people I hate to like for instance your job\nWhat do you think a millionaire when jobs are and it was like doctors lawyers movie stars right like all the answers but the truth\nIs so different it's all in the book every day a millionaire so I was just really encouraging like you said everything from their jobs their salaries these people they are not what you would think are the millionaires but the average Joe millionaire out there in America looks a lot different than what you probably have in your mind and so it's really close to the whole episode yeah we have fun talking about\nDid you how to be a millionaire cake because when I was on your show it was used to I used to hang up for it they didn't bring a shake\nNow I see about any sure about me money what if the millionaire show me a million dollars you know crowd in this look for cash ... Rachel cruise show if you pay I'll I'll get you get ... eight to five five two to five but you ...\nCheck it out sorry and even but of course yes then you have a ... and your shows going well too\nSerious sex him one Twenty one two hundred and thank you very much Ira struggling at Torrey show plugs are sent back to your calls Tripoli eight to five five two to five triple eight to five five two to five is the number Lauren is up in Atlanta Lauren how can we help\nI think when I call Cher and well my husband and I learn where ya ... and ... and really last financially by some of the family and we don't have any that our houses paid off all that that we don't know what to do next [laughter]\nAren't you are and I am a spot where do you mean by that what do you mean I don't know what to do to I understand you are saying well what does that mean specifically what your next goals are the what you're asking\nYeah I mean we don't make a ton of money on a teacher and he's a ... or so yeah\nOur but our family his grandmother really lost the financial aid\nThat very cool so is this a financial cushion career course\nNo financial everything in our careers [laughter]\nOchre gray hair you go there you go right to cook I well I Would say are baby steps learn if you know is passed every step three which is to say three to six months of expensive than the bank do you guys have that cash available\nYeah okay so you have thirty six months of expenses so that's done so then I Move on the baby steps four or five insects for a start funding retirements whatever you guys make than than you know start going into funding retirement Roth IRA I'm\nA four oh three bees is that whatever if there were ... if your husband's church as a pastor has a retirement plan plug into that but the Fifteen Percent into retirement and then what do you guys have kids\n[laughter] you do yes they asked no no no that's all right no cats so then you get baby step five which has kept college you get maybe ... because it done which means are near um baby step seven right now so that is just building wealth and giving which is a pretty awesome spot to be the what I Would say for you guys is funding that retirement\nBut then also have similar goals that you guys want to me because I'm you know there's there can be monotonous state that you get in\nWhen you don't have any debt or a house payment none of that and you're just putting money away\nIn savings and it's just kind of like okay it's just there so you need something exciting that you guys want to do whether that's a vacation you want to take maybe attach to upgrade our home in five years and can we cash flow that can we the car next go to our upgrade of our house we're going to complete we're never going to go into debt like bless your grandmother's like us and say\nWe're going to know that if we sell our house put money towards that so still have some things are working towards\nBecause that makes the saving money fund versus that going to the black hole account and so for you guys to your lifestyle keeping in check like you don't need to go strap against\nMaybe you know you could up at a few a few percentage points each year as your income grows that's totally fine enjoy that because you guys are at that spot I'm but had that savings Goldwyn says and I'm\nYou know we we definitely have a couple now we're like okay what do we want to save toward because again like I said it can kind of be monotonous up just putting money in savings so having those goals for you guys as a couple and as a family it's huge and\nLaughing at least learn it's the first thing we always talk about but it's true I guess you're at a position that you have to just a really cool giving because you guys have no payments and not even help paying that much of an thing goes out in a while do really the big things you can do now and vast safe for something in the short term that you guys are looking forward to and ...\nWe know Chris organ talks a lot about this on do you do as well I think the thing they need to do next to go to a very nice dinner\nCandlelight dinner and take a pad of paper and dream all but that remains because essentially what you just laid out was dreaming yet and I think they're in the position to actually really dream\nAnd even about giving and and maybe a homestead was that's your deal you want to buy land in what happens is now that you're in such a great position you're going to get their way faster than you fought but this was a season to dream\nAnd it and for anyone out there like this is something that couples especially if you're married ... if you're\nIf you're like us which I think your your three kids one\nBut it's like every day it feels like\nYour alarm goes off you wake up you drink your coffee\nYou get ready for work and get the kids up to get them out the door and how low toward my roof you come back I mean there are things like I thought you know you get home you get kids going to throw in the bath tub ones running out make it you're trying to get him back in the ... mine are like you have to say it is and you finally get 'em in bed and you're like oh\nWhat has happened like and you could live in that state for you and you never look at a couple of like what we want to look like in five years and that's the fun part Chris says it and it's true it is fun marriage you guys like you get to build your future together so\nLauren her husband need to do that debt free but also if you're in that still have those dream meetings and dream 'cause that's fun to be able to like what are we going to even if it's our dreams to be out of debt and Eighteen months dream go for it\nYeah and she can make a very key key point I don't want to drive is home to folks some of you out there don't have a lot of hope and it's because you're not focused on a vision\nSo there's a psychology study up there it's a very well known and uh it's it it shows that the brain what it focuses on we tend to see you notice when we didn't see before and here's an example of study that most people get when you go buy a car\nYou buy that car lot and you drive it out how many times have you done this and you see it everywhere for the next game have you noticed totally so that's real that it's a real effect in what's happening is is the brain has been so focused on this new car purchase you wanted to look forward to it so much then you go buy it and you're so excited about it\nAnd then all of a sudden you never saw before\nBut it's materialize and in front of you it's always been there but you are focused on ... so to your point that applies to this idea of even if you're just just completely covered up and debt right now maybe your baby step one you just got to know Dave and you're you're doing this stuff\nIf you can have the meaning that you talked about Rachel what it does is it allows you to see the end of the baby steps and when you can see it and focus on this desire future phrase we use around here all the time yeah\nThen your brain will begin to see the baby steps and the sacrifices many opportunities to do the long haul stuff to get you there that's the key club just as fun romantic dream section it's practical it's what keeps you in the game\nOh absolutely and I said earlier mum said again some ... around here it is literally like okay well we're the seat you're you guys were you know wherever she said twenty twenty three [noise] you\nKnow thinking about Thirty years when you're fifty three like what do you want to do great\nAwesome awesome awesome awesome big things rituals were hanging out with me on to think of what is your dreams child our associate producer ... Manuel and most of all\nOf them are facing show my show\n[noise]\n\nYard during\nI'm excited when we're now hearing on the on the radio stations\nDebuted on a show [noise]\nThe nation's\nNews radio nice sixty is that what you we are the Birmingham that on line nine sixty W we are ... dot com\nCar you'll see four o'clock\n[noise] this is a Fox News alerts a string of suspicious devices stocks\nHumbling sobriety recap on Wall street in a moment first the latest on the packages sent a multiple locations including a CNN office in Manhattan but mainly appearing to target top Democrats boxes girl Scott was more lives\nI'm On almost\nEvery broadcast especially we have been covering it heavily I have been warning almost daily repeatedly someone is gonna get hurt or worse\nIf these mobs don't stop what they're doing now and the mobs in the case as I was talking about you know let's through the prism of what we know today suspicious packages pipe bombs that had been sent\nTo Obama and the Clintons apparently and and CNN and others\nUm how many times yesterday on this program it was a story about George Soros apparently some device about putting his mailbox and I listen what am I say about George Soros yesterday\nLike they have it on tape let me see what I said yesterday when it broke when the storm story broke apparently an explosive device was found near at George Soros is home and his mailbox the New York times reported\nIn a billionaire left this global list George Soros doesn't like Sean Hannity any funds a lot of groups that will love this show to go away I Want to be clear with everybody this crap has got to stop [noise]\nThis crap has got to stop this is you know we we have an election and Thirteen Days and on\nAlmost ... you could see this building and building and building and building Rand Paul was very outspoken somebody is going to get killed\nI was the person saying during the Kavanaugh hearings hey we we got to clear the halls this so one of the senators is going to end up getting assaulted or worse\nYou got to clear the holes you can't let these activists you know getting in the faces bidding it Lindsey Graham holding up elevators screaming at Sanders\n... when you can't let this continue but there's it's obvious but what's gonna happen to somebody and and I haven't heard any of my colleagues on the left warning\nThat this was a bad thing I didn't hear a lot of people on the left all that upset that Sarah Sanders\nChildren were run out of a restaurant and then they go to another restaurant and they were followed over there for crying out loud\nOr the video of secretary Nielsen ... sitting and eating a meal\nAnd these left wing lunatics screaming at secretary Nielsen till she asked to get up and walk out of the restaurant we have the video of Pam Bondi who's going to a movie for crying out loud and what she had to go through with a left wing mob\nAnd then of course Senator Ted Cruz and his his wife\nHeidi they go to sit down at a restaurant there run out right and they get right in your grill right in your face\nYou know it's an amazing thing that they keep doing this to women or guys that are with their wives it culminated this weekend is now the fourth time that Senator McConnell has now had to deal with this he's just sitting in a restaurant with his wife Elaine Chao there just eating that's all they're doing\nHe's not working is on his off time some guy comes literally right up to the table to banks on the table\nAnd then ... rips off some of the food from the table opens the restaurant door which is adjacent to the scene where Mitch McConnell is and throws the guy's food out in the street\nAnd then start screaming at the top of his lungs and then of course Kevin McCarthy's office gets it with a Boulder busting his office window and I didn't hear anybody condemning\nAny of this certainly during the Kavanaugh hearings nobody on the left said a word about their leftist activists they love the pressure that they were putting on Jeff Flake and and other people there they didn't say paying Feinstein wasn't speaking out Lindsey Graham getting spit on nobody speaking out\nThese incidents that have happened to these conservative women's I don't see the coverage hour by hour second by second you know but if Donald Trump calls the news media fake news\nAnd they do give you fake news\nThere is some truth to fake news and they just hate Trump twenty\nFour seven you should have seen the yesterday the graphics because he said I'm not a global list I'm I'm an American first nationalist well does that mean that is or racist ... you know is he a white nationalist no he said he's a nationalist\nAnd his policies of the irony is all of the failure and the disproportionate failure under Obama's policies towards African Americans Hispanic Americans Asian Americans and women in the workplace they went to this proportionally impacted\nBy the horrific policies are bronco bombing sat there for eight years did nothing to curb the violence even at his own home city where people are dying now you have a few famous people that have had these suspicious packages that had been sent it let me be very clear\nYou know leading up to this I had been saying this is not going to end well\nSomebody's gonna get hurt I don't want anybody hurt I don't want any Democrat hurt I don't want any Republican hurt I don't want any American her I don't want anyone in the caravan hurt\nIt ought not be prices precipitated at the border because Mexico allows people to march you know three thousand miles up to the United states you want to avoid confrontations like this if you can so we had a pipe\nBomb suspicious packages sent to the Clintons home and chapel claw similar package to Obama's home one to CNN New York headquarters\nAnd ... and apparently the one yesterday George Soros is home in Westchester New York suspicious package center Debbie Wasserman Schultz his office they're investigating one that might have gone to Maxine Waters office\nYou know with all the rhetoric from Spartacus get in their face\nHolder kick them they go low we pick up Hillary Clinton we can't be civil with them unless of course we win\nYou know Maxine what did she say get a crowd if you see them you get a crowd you follow them in a restaurant in department stores in gas stations and you tell them they're not wanted anywhere anymore\nAnd watching it happened to all these Republicans does any of this you know we don't know what the intentions are a lot of people are speculating what the intentions are\nUm you know let me be very clear I Know I Know firsthand what all of this is like\nMy thoughts and prayers go out to anybody that has to deal with this today I've had similar incidences of security in my life you know\nLinda ... you know somebody that we both care for very very dearly a girl that worked for us for years she's been on the radio occasionally you know remember when we had the white powder scent the Fox news\nAnd she\nLiterally had to spend an entire eight nine hours in\nIsolation because we thought at the time it was anthrax\nThat was sent I don't get packages anymore my life uh and and far worse in terms of threats it's sad but if you're in the public eye this happens more than I Will disclose here it's not about me today but I Know many other conservatives that have had the same thing happen if you go back just three weeks ago\nMaybe people born is alarms that\nWas it was from the minute the news broke this morning the media's on Wall to wall with reports suspicious packages and you know that were sent to the Clintons Obama Eric Holder is another one and\nYou know I think it's a huge story I Do it's a scary story but if you go back just three weeks ago how many ... do you even know that race in\nLetters deadly rice and letters were actually sent to President Trump\nDefense secretary James Mattis or FBI Director Christopher Wray our CIA director Gina Haspel and other top officials in fact that story got so little coverage\nThat I barely remembered it until I saw a report on one of the Web sites earlier today that it was only three weeks ago that that it happened here and then of course we can take it back to the ... the shooting\nWhen Steve skull east nearly lost his life and to this day he struggles and has had so many operations that barely were able to save this guy's life that day but\nFor the heroin hurt the heroism of to brave Capitol police officers that took on a guy with a rifle that well had cover and walked in the middle of a baseball field it's almost a suicide mission to defend\nPeople I I never saw such her was it was amazing but you think of the rhetoric that we've been hearing and the build up to all of this and everyone else has been silent\nThis isn't about left or right when when we found out that the that skill leases shooter happened to be a Bernie Sanders supporter Sean Hannity didn't go on the air and say see I blame Bernie\nI just I did the opposite I don't know I eat can't hold Bernie Sanders responsible\nFor the actions of of one of his ... supporters he's not responsible for that\nBut the media today and their their reaction to this\nOver the top so outrageous so\nDisgusting leap partisan\nIt just it they're so quick to blame President Trump Fox News talk
