I talked to him and he's like oh I don't really know I Dream that would be nice to have more money [laughter]\nKind of acted\nHe is I'm always worked really hard we got married when he was Eighteen and he worked about sixty hours a week then on the corner and how he he is a hard worker and he'd do anything for me\nMhm okay um\nI wasn't questioning out hearty works I was questioning and make your money\nYou see the difference yes I work real hard to ... yeah a lot\nLike this week already sixty hours and It's Wednesday so I'm a Thursday or whatever it is only got one day it is or we go so anyway but I'm\nA I don't always do that every week but you know you've got to look at things and say for the labor and putting out on the time I have away from my family and the stress and the strain on my body and my my\nAnd did my emotions what am I getting paid in Europe the answer is not much in this part of what you are facing is your income challenge\nIs that right okay\nAnd I'm so why why does that bring two years\n[laughter] I feel like we've just been we've had to go on\nAnd you know like I Try to be we try to be financially responsible you know like we we've never will crawl extenders\nYeah I don't think ... I don't think you're irresponsible thinking man I really I think you're doing really good because you don't have any money\nI feel like at this point I had hoped to be a little bit more ahead they'll paycheck to paycheck you\nKnow but it there's two parts of the equation right the income side and they almost side and you know have you noticed I didn't even ask you about the ... yeah and that's because I think you're probably doing pretty good there\nReally aren't we should have babies that number two down in about six months\nAnd I think you're right I think you're stretching the few dollars that you have really well so I think you're I think you're very responsible people I don't think you're overspending I don't think you're crazy I don't think are spoiled brats um and I think he's a hard worker\nMuch yeah\nWell I think you've got all that stuff going for you and that's why I Want you to win better than your winning and so I really think you guys put the kids to bed and I turn off TV light a candle or two and just sit on my porch and talk and say\nWell we got to make some more money um and it's not 'cause money's everything is because when you are or you know doing the best you can do with the dollars you have and they're not stretch and then we've got to look at something well what are we going to do to create some additional income short term short term and long term\nWell actually we did last night and I actually got a job at a local library but after I pay for childcare only bring home about thirty to forty dollars a day\nOr so that's that's not that's not the answer then right [noise] and we've got a better a better income coming in to afford childcare if you're going to be working [noise] am and he's got to have a game plan\nAnd I don't know whether he opens his own butcher shop or whether he becomes the most famous butchering the world doing it on TV I don't care what he does [laughter] I'm not saying you cannot be butchers but uh you can't be a butcher their ten years from now and be anywhere but where you are right now\nThe accents yeah\nAnd so I I you know what are we going to do with the skill or this thing or did he just fall into this 'cause your parents were doing it or\nYou know that's kind of exactly what happened\nYou know and so but I mean what if let's just kind of take the white board out and start over eraser life on the white borders second and say gosh if we can do anything we wanted to do what would we do\nYeah and then let's go about doing that and you went to ... today\nAnd walk in and throw you know throw your knife down and walk out that's not what I'm saying but I Am saying we need a plan that takes us somewhere where we say okay this month I got a hundred bucks left over but it's not always going to be this way but it is always going to be that way if you don't change something agreed\nAgreed [noise] okay I think you ask them do it you're good people this is not a it's not a character issues and it's not a a lack of a effort issue and it's not an immaturity thing you guys just simply mathematically it's income minus outgoing there's not much income\nYeah so and he told us\nWhat how do we go about playing with my parents that if you know like it would really be when he's gone to drill here they always talk about how inconvenient for them and it's so hard on my dad because he's got heart problem and he has to take over all of the work that the very very small operation\nOkay so let's kind of think about this for this is not working for your dad 'cause it's not working for has not working for you yeah so this whole thing and it working\nBut I don't know I mean the way I bring it up is we love your own we'd love to help you but we are starving to death over here and we're not going to continue to do this anymore\nAnd you don't have to do it today but you you know you can say you know my husband is going to we're taking classes and he's going to be a an X or y or Z two years from now and that's what he's going to start doing 'cause that's really his dream\nBecause here's the thing\nWas somebody is going to make some decisions to shut some stuff down or you're going to be sitting exactly where you see it\nOkay and I you know\nBut ... you know you cannot be in this thing of oh we have to starve to death because that's the only way my parents have a good life\nLeft out that's not that's not logical\nThat doesn't make sense right yeah you're right and the truth is your dad if he's got a heart problem and your husband is not there he probably needs to sell this or close\nRight yeah\nAnd and so when you start thinking about that or does it make enough to support you guys if your dad was out of the picture\nDoes he need to go home [noise] [noise]\nWell ...\nThey're linked though it's not like we did buy good money because we're not like we're not at all part of the owners of it I Know\nBut the owner cannot operate it without this particular employees what you said\n\nOh well I guess I Need a new employee or then you talk about selling it to you or giving it to you or something I don't know y'all can talk about there's a lot of different ways out of this mess but continue to do the same thing is not a way out of the ...\nAnd I'm so change what we've got changed their lives have changed today and it does change turkey turkey and nobody's be mad and throw weight around or say anything unkind\nBut we just have to lay say you know five years from now are we doing some different ten years from now it'll be something doing something different and we're going to make more money there's almost all of them get a world is ears are coming from scratch and ... and I think your dad's good people too and I think your life when understand\nThis is the day Ramsey show [noise]\n\n[noise]\nHey guys just constant cheap production officer for the ... show this ours um you'll find more on our YouTube channel where we have over six

Brady right now the Dow is down four hundred eighty nine\nPoints a short time ago dropping nearly seven hundred points until now a volatile day but not quite this bad blamed in part again on interest rate concerns Fox Business network Christina ... is that the New York stock exchange starting at\nYou're talking about the building\nYou know the practice it so I don't want to say do I have a I have a hundred thousand feet and and the practice it'd be five hundred so it'd be really tough to scrape together and other four hundred thousand dollars\nIn a year I mean if you could ever get tied up for a year and close that that's\nYou know uh and then by the real estate at the second year more than ... ... ... for the first year in ... so here's the problem I I heard one I'm struggling with you you haven't obviously ever on the belief ... I mean crazy wonderful income but I Do not tell people to borrow money to buy\nAnd the ... and I'm not going to tell you to borrow money to buy this I think you can save up the money in a year and I think it'd be just didn't you know negotiate with this guy put together a deal and\nEven if you um took it over ran it for a year and at an option to buy it put a hundred thousand dollars that down as your option to buy the practice and then clothes on the practice in one year in cash for it and close on them real estate the next year and pay cash for it and that's how I Would do it if I were in your shoes um I Do not borrow money\nMark and I do not tell people on the show to borrow money for business purchases\nUm I don't believe in it I think it gets you into problems and I'm a you know if this guy wants to sell this ... this practice to you that show and they'll have to sell it if I were negotiating the deal\nBut I mean certainly you can do what you want to do I think that practice um you know I suspect it's going to even add more to your income and then in the third year of this discussion you can probably pay off your house I didn't ask what your mortgage balance was but um\nI don't go into debt to buy to do business with this business has too much risk with it and even dental practice is too much risk with them especially when you're completely changing the format of what you're doing in that you're picking up a whole second location and practice management comes into play then\nAnd so there's risk here there's real risk here I'm so I'm paying cash for it or I'm not buying it and that's how I Would go about it a good question I don't know what you'll do a you certainly got a lot of income and that that covers a lot multitude of sins but that's how I Would do it thanks for the call\nOpen phones a AAA eight to five by two to five uh Melissa is on Facebook and Dave Ramsey a bicycle dot com slash they ... what exactly does it mean if the\nTerm insurance is Twenty years I'm forty three should I go for a longer or shorter term well that means that policy will not change for Twenty years\nIt's called twenty year level term and you'll have the same premium and the same amount of coverage for Twenty years after Twenty years\nThe premium will go up dramatically um or you can go have another medical examined by a new policy that will not be go up nearly as much as that one would go up\nNow the question is how long do you need life insurance\nIf you've got a six year old and a twelve year old and Twenty years you'll have a twenty six year old and a thirty two year old hopefully they're\nGone\nThat's the idea we train them to leave\nAnd come back with grandbabies that's their job okay that's the process here this is how life works so kids are grown and gone Twenty years from now you would be a hundred percent that free because we never tell you to take out more than a Fifteen year fixed rate mortgage\nAnd Twenty years from now if you were doing the baby steps that we teach you'd be putting have been putting Fifteen Percent of your household income away for Twenty years which would probably make you well in excess of a millionaire [noise]\nDepending on what your household income is so let's just say you have seven hundred thousand dollars on them paid for house and no kids at home\nAnd uh you die I think your husband good struggled through\nReverse it he dies you could probably struggle through so hundreds of hours no kids I don't want to pay for our point is being out of debt and building well does away with the need for life insurance you don't need a journal life the only home life life insurance as needed because your age and nice commission his own life and this is the day Ramsey show oh\nAsked all the time when in the baby steps is the right time to buy life insurance my answer is typically now\nLife insurance is not part of the baby steps because it's needed when your family has debt and not enough savings to provide for their financial needs that's when they're at the highest risk and no matter where you are and your baby steps it's a necessity\nNot a choice this includes working husbands and wives as well as stay at home parents it's pretty expensive to replace a stay at home parent responsibilities I only recommend term life insurance sense is the most affordable way to get the right

than it feels really good cool what do you teach a law\nOh good okay so a law professor and empty ... not bad tip\nA long way to go it was a lot of work to get to where we are a bit and uh I think you know coming out of medical school it's um\n[noise] you you have this big lump of money that you know and I remember getting statements in the mail from the loan company and I would just kind of open them and put them and put him to the side because it's so overwhelming you know and um I I was nervous about having\nTo make an Eighteen hundred to two thousand dollar payment every month for ten years and then end up paying almost double what I'd have borrowed ...\nAnd it's basically like paying off a mortgage so um we were\nWe actually had a great I'm attending physician that during my fourth year med school actually sat us down and said\nYou know we're we're going to talk about money and we were thinking oh you see any teachers out billing or had her in her practice and he's like no someday you're going to make a lot of money\nAnd you need to know what to do with it so you don't end up like me and my sixties and I can't retire because I because I have that still wow and so he's he's the one that I heard your name from and got the total money make or a book and read that and\nI'm probably it was another year or two before I really started the program 'cause\nBeing in med school and not having any income living off loans it's kinda hard to figure at herring to pay out that while you're taking out ... um and then Alan and I met and we were engaged and\nWe want it to start our marriage off rights or we want to just sort of getting the same page or our priorities or what to do with a sort of what our future was ...\nSo how Allen actually had a when we met he had already paid off all his school loans and had a lot of the evenings and I'm like hey you want to get married I've got a hundred and fifty five\nThousand and that I I I I think I really don't see doing that\nGirl a minute ago yeah yeah\nAnd our church I'm at the time was offering it for you and so I'd like to go to this class because I'm terrified and I don't know what to do and\nI'm Still we did that in that was in two thousand twelve where she did that while we were engaged and so we got married August twenty twelve and so to this day you know before we got married we had our budget ready to go on the spreadsheet ... from the nerd an end\nTo this day we could tell you every penny we've spent since the day we got married and so that's been that's been an interesting journey but definitely a blessing\nAnd so if I'm going to travel um or for instance people who travel for a living people road warriors I call them you know there there have to travel for work all the time I'm In that case you want to drive in that case you want to drive the least expensive vehicles will get the job done because you're destroying whatever you drive\nI mean you might want to grab a hundred thousand dollar car you it's going to be worth nothing by the time you've finished traveling\nAnd show 'em unless you've just got millions of dollars you can afford to lose a hundred grand but but you know most people don't have that so basically what we're saying is you're going to take the Seventeen thousand our vehicle and you're going to cause it to drop in value faster\nThan anything else what's your household income\nUm I make about eighty thousand okay you're single photo basketball right to renting a small little okay All right I'm always hanging out you have any debt or just the car that ... ... um eleven thousand okay\nAll right well there's nothing you know I'm hearing here this crazy as long as you realize that you know the Seventeen thousand dollar car might be worth um you're going to lose a few thousand dollars extra on it just because you're gonna travel at okay\nAnd as long as you're willing to do that ... it with the kind of money you make you should be okay\nLet's get the car paid off as soon as possible so your preferences keep it and drive it is that right\nOh my privilege to keep it for five or six years now but my friends in an ... or whatever the fate betray they betrayed or you're crazy to keep it to trade it in for what um last night on I I was sitting around the brand new BMW for forty uh-huh exiled falling in love with\nRon well that'd be easy to fall in love with that but the but that's even more expensive so we're going to destroy even more expensive car if you want to travel and that right\nYeah and to upgrade to a brand new one you know that would be twenty percent less\nWell number one they're in day out and you don't have the money to do that so that's ludicrous we wouldn't do it on that basis alone but on the idea that you're going to travel in it no you don't want to you know you don't want to upgrade and destroying more expensive cars about how you\nShow if you if you're gonna travel you need to run the wheels off of something that's not going to cost you as much\nSo we don't upgrade in order to lose more money when we don't have any money that that doesn't make sense at all so whoever your friends are I mean they're they're encouraging you to do stupidity but I've had friends that have encouraged me to do stupid or even I didn't have to do it though uh Brian's with us in Bakersfield, California hey Brian how are you\nBetter than than there Dave how are you better than I deserve how can I help\nOkay Dave so before I found you at the beginning of this year I impulse to and purchased they ridiculous\nCar [laughter] and and as soon as I found you I was like crap [laughter] oh well did you buy um we bought a ... month the fix with all the bells and whistles so we eat yeah well not fulfilling because my pocket hurts\nYeah well I guess but I mean the cars great\nNow okay oh yeah so what what do you owe on this ... thing we'll thirty five thousand mhm okay and what's your how phantom\nHere will be making sixty sixty five maybe touching Seventy depending on my over time oh yeah there's just you know\nSo that and I'm next year I'll be getting a Fifteen Percent raise plus another five percent right down the road yeah I'm so here's my ... I'm calling to see if you what if you're OK with is a memo I finally agreed to let it go\nGood and sell it good it's worth Twenty one thousand oh God yeah so you're you're all ... down into it or die that bad yeah and I thought that it only took like three months good lord so Twenty one guy on trade in\nYes well I mean you know twenty three on private sale\nSomething that that's not enough of a spread on ... so you're saying this car went from thirty five thousand uh twenty three thousand and one year\nActually technically a will forty thousand two thirty five thousand I I also canceled the warranty on it\n'cause we had any extending warranty yeah and and we found out that it's funny how when you pay off the vehicle or he reached ... miles all of a sudden a it starts to fail on you and the ... ... ... you or did it\nThe cars one on our old\n... and I almost a year old yeah\nAll right so yeah when you get rid of this thing for so many reasons so so what's your plan\nFinance or me and my wife is looking around and we saw some four thousand five thousand dollar cars I'm I could say about that money and I already have it by next income refund\nBut what I was thinking is because our monthly payment for the throughout the whole month and it's like eight hundred dollars so because I also have stood among and assume famous I won't succeed but almost done with that and we have like six thousand dollars left over\nSo what what it might just go ahead and sell this car mhm bottled up their friends and then go to the guy who are on the car that showing for like four or five thousand dollars and just make payments off for like a hundred bucks and the monthly payment will go down to four hundred dollars to making a mess\nMhm yeah I mean we okay with them yeah sure but I I I'm not sure I understood how your financing ... is your second car the ... by the uh the five thousand dollar car that you're buying how are you financing it\nThey'll just go ahead just like you know just like you're going to go buy a car for a little down payment on it oh okay I Know where the you know what I mean\nYou know that's fine if you can just get a regular car loan on it that's fine\nLet's do that because we're still reducing your debt by half your right\nAnd um by doing this and then you can concentrate on getting the carpet off and then getting the whole that you've dug with this other car which is absolutely horrendous it's a great car I'm surprised that thing has dropped that foreign value I'm sure you got your numbers right on that\n'cause I I mean I [noise] the\nCars are horrible as far as going down in value I get it I I'm I'm a card guy but they and they go down in value rapidly but that one is like a black hole for money on or something like that that's an incredible\nWhat a horrible horrible\nCar on holding his values so check out and make sure your number your numbers are a little high\nOn terms of lost money I think you maybe you haven't lost as much I'm hoping you have a lot of so much you think you've lost so let's dig into that a little bit further and you do not want to sell it to a dealer at wholesale you want to sell it private sales it should be in this situation about five thousand dollar difference\nIn other words you should be able to get five or more out of it shown it private show than you would from a dealer on something that expensive um so I really check those numbers I'm not sure you've got correct stuff there but\nWow what a dad gummed kicking the teeth man you got hammered amazing\nAnd good luck with it but yes I Would get out of it for sure it's too much car it's a mess it's going down in value it's breaking I mean there's nothing good in the story thanks for the call [noise]\nLevel is this hour of the day

taking my call because you speak with you you too sir how can I help [noise]\nWell I have well about a foil on a show about a nine thousand two hundred and thirty six ... two hundred thirty dollars from school debt\nI'm from an advanced degree and just kind of really looking at the best advice on how to pay that off I Know that you're not a fan of the public service loan forgiveness program and I'm\nWondering maybe about income driven plan where the government might pay it free fan of unpaid interest monthly Oregon ... go ahead and getting down to it not as quick as you can\nNow the third one is the best one you'll be out of debt faster that way what your income dropped\nA after taxes that bring home about fifty four thousand change what do you do for a living\nI'm a nurse practitioner at a nonprofit hospitals you\nKnow kind of like um saint Jude said OK cool All right actually wonderful wonderful place\nUm the um\nWell I don't know whether you can pick up extra time there or not but with a ... nurse practitioner you're very marketable and you can pick up other time you can work as much as you want to work as much as you're able to work logistically\nUm and I would get out and and I would just try to pay this off in about two years and be done with it is that a monkey and around with some kind of a government plan here's the problem with the public service loan forgiveness program it isn't happening\nLast year thirty thirty thousand people put in an application for their loans to be forgiven Ninety ...\nNinety six people were approved so I mean that's that's those are the odds you want you know I Want to I don't want to wait ten years only to find out that the government's scam me basically\nSo I'm not I think you just work like a crazy man pick up as many hours as you can pick up the great news is you're nursing I mean it's just a wonderful career paths\nBecause you can add ours are ads you know pick up some he our time or whatever you need to do I don't know on the short term when you make sixty thousand dollars extra money so fast it's on blue like in two years you can just make sixty thousand extra\nYou know I'm again you'll be working a lot but it does just be done with this and just you know I'm\nA I'm I'm a band aid off fast guy I mean just get it done take take the pain and get it done and then you can get on with the rest of your life and you've got you've got a good again a great career track so you're going to be in really good shape\nThank you Josh for what you're doing saint Jude good stuff All right Tim is uh weather's in Binghamton New York Hi Jim how are you\nEh Dave how're you doing\nBetter than I deserve how can I help\nOh well I have a quick question I'm about three hundred dollars in debt among or twenty five and my car is about to go but I'm trying to office faith and pay off the debt as quick as possible joined question is is right now I'm putting seven percent of my paycheck\nInto my four one K. shed doing all that down to about one to two percent start throwing money at this loan right now and go about a hundred dollars a week at it mhm just to get it knocked out as fast as possible but I Want to hear opinion should also thank you for so much\nI you know you've got to videos and lifting you show you've helped me avoid a lot of bad decisions like buying\nA crappy house and going into like a twenty thousand dollar Carlo shower I really appreciate that\nCool good so well thank you um what do you make what your income\n[noise] I Do about twenty three thousand dollars after taxes but that's not including the overtime I guess you\nKnow what do you do I'm a welder okay so you get a lotta overtime or for the most part can you get more Oh absolutely no\nIt's Only Temporary basis you could really load up your overtime and clean up the ... very very quickly and save up and get you know get your current job your emergency funding and save up and move up in car and cash\nThat would be my learning to do now that would be my first three goals with what are her didn't then and only then what are restart\nMy four oh one K. so what I'm saying is temporarily not forever but maybe for a year or maybe even to completely stop your four O. one K. to become completely debt free builds your emergency fund us three to six months of expenses\nAnd then once you've done that and save up and pay cash for a car and that's maybe step three and rebate and then you move to babysit for and restart your four O. one K. and then you start putting Fifteen Percent of your income into retirement but at that point you don't have any payments and you're driving a paid for decent car\nAnd these are all a really good place for you to be and that that's the direction I Would tell you to move towards show yeah while we have people working these baby steps Jim unless your own baby step forward telling you to temporarily\nTemporarily temporarily stop your four O. one K. investing Andrew is with us in Dallas texas I Andrew how are you\nI'm doing well how you doing better than I deserve what's up\nOh not a whole lot I recently took a new job we're making a good amount of money and I'm very curious about ... stadium more wanted us to get more\nMhm okay um what are you out of debt\nI'm going to get us or current paid off the whole nine yards should\nDo you have an emergency fund of three to six months of expenses\nAre about twenty grand theater currently\nOkay so what would you be saving for them\nAnd that's the whole thing I knew John ... wrote about five days a week so buying a house kind of out of the question right now mhm so I get the explosion and what should be said enforce it couldn't be more in the Roth IRA right by our age or something I mean he looks more towards the future would you recommend\nWell you're at what we call baby step for she'd be starting to put Fifteen Percent of your income away for retirement or beyond that if you wanted to start piling some money into an investment to buy a home later that wouldn't be a bad thing but today it doesn't sound like you're on the market for home yeah\nYeah so it sounds like him to get your retirement savings started and a Fifteen Percent of your income going into that take your gross income before taxes point one five as Fifteen Percent\nAnd then get that started in your four one K. do it in a Roth if you can match you if you can if you can't uh than let's do we'll go to Ross on your own to a Roth IRA on your own and let's make sure you're getting that money set aside if you'll say Fifteen Percent of your income throughout your whole life into good mutual funds in a retirement plan you'll be a millionaire usually a multi millionaire actually\nAnd um so we we can just at least get that started and then beyond that if you want to save towards the house or\nEven invest some money and aside mutual fund that's not a retirement account to use for the house later you could do that well let's get Fifteen Percent of started and I don't think it should go and get you had it in the right direction so it's\nA good question man thank you for joining us we appreciate your hanging out that puts this hour that I've Ramsey show in the books we will be back with you before you know what in the meantime remember there is ultimately only one way to financial peace and that's the ... daily with the friends of\nPrice Jesus [noise]\n\nOn the eastern time and again randomness have ... million dollars in\nPretty in front of these things are more in the rain [noise]\nMilitary matters air force veteran\nThere is just one safe\nService men and women lost to suicide drew took his own life on Memorial Day twenty sixteen\nUh we have a tough race by the way it's going to be a tough race\nFor Scott Walker in Wisconsin who I think he's done a phenomenal job a as it relates to you know the state\nOf Wisconsin and I hope the people who was ... and finally I remember that but we now have Walker one poll finally up by one but it's very very close a we have a Georgia governor race that's also closer than I Would like for comfort\nOr with the Republican Kemp up by two and so we're following that race pretty closely um in some of the other races that were watching the president's approval rating now is doing very very well what fifty one percent and rest musician\nAnd so we'll watch that but I think if you look at Heidi Heitkamp I think she's going to be and should be defeated in North Dakota\nI Hope the people of Montana will pay attention and understand that you basically have Chuck Schumer junior because John tester always goes with Chuck Schumer and the people in Montana I can take back that state which is a red state\nThen you've got other states like Indiana I think Joe Donnelly can be defeated in Indiana I think definitely Claire McCaskill she ought to be sent packing and I think Marsha Blackburn is going to be a phenomenal senator from the great state of Tennessee she'd been a longtime friend of this program in recent polls now have her up as well\nAnd then we get to the all important house races I'm not going to spend the time here it's more of a visual thing that we're doing on television\nAnd we're picking ten important house races at night and we're identifying those specific districts that are going to make\nA difference on election night and twenty six days and that will literally they these these districts were putting up hold the balance of power in the house of representatives\nI mean because of gerrymandering above big portion and percentage of seats\nI ended up being safe for both Republicans and Democrats\nSo we'll find out for voters by the way Trump more help now to these candidates and the president's got what he's out for days this week and he's going to be campaigning for everybody in these tight races in an attempt to help them all out now am\nI honestly think that the Republicans would adapt just a little bit they don't have to take the style of Donald Trump\nBut if they go out and and passionately support making the tax cuts permanent if they passionately talk about ending the bureaucracy the way the president has been doing it if they will sign on to building and fully funding the border wall\nIf they will do the alternative healthcare solutions that we talk about all the time on this program like health savings accounts and health care cooperatives et cetera were just going to have a better country\nAnd and the more prosperous country you you cannot deny the success of this president and the fuel the pure force of personality I mean Donald Trump is a force of nature and I know that he breaks dishes I Know he's an icon of class I Know he's a disruptor\nBut if he's not fighting then we're not winning and when he goes up even against their own allies and says you're not paying their fair share in NATO and we're paying the bulk of money for NATO and then you're stupid enough Chancellor Merkel to go make deals to help make Russia and Vladimir ... rich again while you're basically\nIt's your counteracting everything that made I was trying to do which is prevent a hostile regime from ever having the power to turn off the ticket and turn off the light blood of western Europe's economy\nIt's just simple basic things\nNobody ever thought that the president would get along with little rocket man fire and fury\nApparently Mike Pompeo the secretary of state at a phenomenal meeting I talked to two sources a phenomenal meeting with little rocket man and now a little rocket man is dead he's serious about getting rid of any nuclear ambitions\nDenuclearization of the Korean Peninsula the guy that everybody in the media is that there's going to start World War three that guy is bringing peace to the Korean Peninsula you look at Seoul South Korea\nYou know you look over the DMZ and what do you see thirty million people live there a nuclear armed North Korea is not\nSomething that the world needs if you care about human life and as a result I Would assume that you know markets would open up to North Korea the people of North Korea been suffering you might even see a reunification one day of north and South Korea Korea how great would that be for the world\nAnd he got a president that's not dropping cargo planes full of cash and other currencies\nAnd on the on the tarmac for mullahs around that hate us in chant death to America death to Israel that's not happening either\nYou know I Want to get in Michelle Obama was on the today show earlier today in an interview with savannah Guthrie asking about
