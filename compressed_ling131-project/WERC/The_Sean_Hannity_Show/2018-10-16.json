{"month": "10", "state": "AL", "station": "WERC", "content": "He is or not that's so that's something else we we we have a car at all I Know I'm going out for a place and so the the car I'm thinking about sounds kind of a toy car that's what few years under the as much as I like it I'm thinking oh\nWhat's the what's the what's the car that you need to replace [noise]\nSo the the car need that I Will need to replace the combat troops on if it's a good reliable but I Know that you know actually the miles of getting up there and\nOne of the normal normal but why can't you just save up between now and the time you replace the car and much longer you gonna grab the Hyundai for you replace it\nAll depends on how long it lasted about a hundred and Eighteen thousand miles\nBattle how long were you drive the Hyundai before you replace it\nProbably three to five years\nCan't you save up a car price between now and then\nI think I could yes\nOkay then you don't have to sell the toy car for that the only question is do you want to keep the toy car or do you want to keep the brokerage account because one of them needs to go so you can have an emergency fund\nYeah yeah which one do you want to um [noise] so now I guess the the second\nClip on a brokerage account most with long term so I think if I sell it it's just a matter of you know it'd be additional income to my salary of the year that\n\nYou've been in that we don't have any basis in that stock\nAgain no I don't know why\nYou didn't pay anything going on\nNo I'm Sorry yes I have a basis in their shoulders there's that ... as far as taxes go it only be the capital gains\nTerm exactly which one would you rather have a car with a brokerage account because one of them needs to sell when you decide that you'll know which one to sell and you'll know how to send your emergency fund and keep the other one but now says with us in San Diego Hi Vanessa how are you\n... how are you know better than I deserve what's up\nI'm I just wanted to do that a bit of help I'm ready to start um I'm looking to START I did and it's like a full time business I down the line ... to um I had been mean and it takes you right at\nThe cheat around here and I'm already I'm already down to copy the book yeah I had that I held back\nIt works wonder in the car yeah and I and I'm looking to move forward on my idea I have a business plan that had a few years back\nNow I'm trying to look forward to it on my plan and a sports camp um my question is how do I start where do I do my problem they need permit or local park\nUm I have ideas of ACT Alliance theatre ... it's basically a practice and a baseball or Pakistan batch about for like need locations it's not just a plain park out Neal\nMhm mhm well I guess you could talk to the Y. and asked them if you could split revenues with them or something like that in order to use their stuff\nUm a lot of was do that with personal trainers and in a sense this is a type of personal training I mean I guess if you're holding up I Would suspect some of the yoga teachers or the aerobics teachers or whatever at the Y. probably just do a split revenue deal don't but\nI I Would I don't I just want to be contract or I didn't want to be owned by the Y. and now I\nWas out there that you're just you're just a teacher right now and what you get in there and you you work out all the kinks out of your system and you learn how to do it any developer reputation with people\nI but I and I may not let you necessarily have a business name on this they may just pay you as a teacher there to watch for right now but that will get some income coming in and get you in the field actually doing this and then the next step would be that you could actually rent\nPart time someone else's gym to do this with or part time someone else's ball fields to do this and you know you could you could start there if you want if you got the money if you got on but a cash\nNow I Know I'm starting from scratch and basically a plan that I had in that dreamers stage for the longest time and now that I've had a book and I can hear podcasts empowered I'm Josh Rogers said you know where to go how to start\nI think I might make some money kind of almost as a side job doing this exact thing at the Y. or at some place like a why first and as I said then you get the kinks out of your teaching methods and all that kind of stepped in the next step is you take that cash\nAnd that gives you the ability to rent the gym or rent the ball field on a per day basis\nBut we just got into that no we don't do that see that's that's what I'm trying to avoid so let's create a little bit of money while learning a few things about how to talk to people how to teach people how to coach people\nAnd prove out some of your ah dreams and your theories that you've got here by just poking around on under somebody else a roof a little bit and then\nThen when we get a little bit of cash we can go rent the ball field or rent the gym by the day for a little while and then um you know that way will break you if you don't get clients right off the bat\nAh when I started financial piece University Our a office building allowed us the people that were tenants in the office building we had a common conference room that you could book doesn't\nCost anything but you had the book and you couldn't just keep it both good and just look at you know for a meeting you can you know other people go in there you should've meetings and until like a hundred and thirty people is a nice size little conference room and all of meeting room kind of thing tables moved round and all of that that's where a financial peace university started\nIs in that little conference room and I'm pretty cool if you think about it and so but I had to just look at as a part of renting the little office that I was in and so but it wasn't really my meeting room it was the office buildings meeting room\nAnd you could just use it and so I booked it in the evening and then I booked it in another evening that I've looked at another evening and then I was looking at so much they asked me to start paying a little bit and then I start paying a little bit but I had a lot of classes going by them but I just the first night I did that for people came\nThank goodness I didn't rent but think about a month and therefore people come goes we would have probably gone out of business that month [laughter] so that's what I'm saying it's OK to start it on a very piecemeal basis and started on the cheap\nThere's nothing wrong with that at all I'm really proud of you can do this when I said go do it go do it it's time to do it it's time to get off the dream and move into the actual action go do it you can do this promise you you can do this\nVery well done good good good Laura follows me on Facebook dot Tom ... is it worth it to refinance a student loan to save on interest if you're saving on interest you can get a better interest rate it's okay to do that make\nSure that the loan is a fixed rate and make sure that it is a lower fixed rate\nSometimes people refinance student loans and just throw 'em all in one pile and end up paying a net rate that is higher because they'll mix of four or five or six and seven in there and get it all at six but the foreign the father wouldn't cheaper and they don't end up chief ... net net net right\nThe aggregate in other words so make sure that you are getting a better rate or don't refinance and make sure it is a fixed rate but then you got to do a lot of work to get out of the interest rates are never going to get you out of it you got to get really mad that's how you get out of that\nAnd then you got to work your tail end of it is how you get out of that [noise] that I ran

thousand dollar car has a seven thousand dollar maintenance bill\nIt's a two thousand and five BMW six forty five\nAnd what's wrong with it for God's sakes\nIt's got an engine he'll problem that cost about seven or advocate fix\nOkay what if it's worth seven thousand dollars and it takes seven thousand dollars to fix it that means it's not worth anything that's why there's got to be an alternative way to get this thing fixed are you dealing with the dealer\nOr know dealing with a mechanic to specialize\nAnd that's a that's a ridiculous you can't spend seven thousand I mean you're better off to

thousand pounds whoa yeah and uh at the time I saw the odd one the last ... because I didn't have an emergency fund\nAnd I had a lot of 'em get the news to note St critic count and not you say I felt like I'd done something that I hadn't actually done anything I just moved my debt from one place to another\nAnd now they're starting to struggle and um I was at the bank\nIs challenging may interest

they save up money and pay cash to build a house on that land\nPeople do stuff like that that's fine but there is out there you go about Seventy five eighty a hundred thousand dollar fifty thousand dollar mobile home and call that a good long term bland\nNo it's not a good long term plan it goes down in value that simple I had a buddy of mine owns a huge mobile home operation and he's always give me a hard time would you could say in the day when I said well they won't make which being true of which we've got some that go up in value and I want it when when when I see that as an across the board thing yeah\nNo I Will tell you this manufacturing housing is what they always call it one way or the other there's all kinds of manufactured housing sometimes that means mobile home sometimes that means the wall system for building a factory there stood 'em up and it basically looks like a stick built a house\nAnd so it's treated by the purchasing public\nLike a traditional home\nWhatever you're buying why don't care what words you use to describe but the question you ask yourself is when I woke up in front of it do I say a ball or do I say house if you walk up in front of it and you say\nHow ugly house pretty house but it's a house right\nThen then that's going to go up in value in a mobile home with the wheels off sitting on a concrete foundation that looks all permanent still looks and feels like a mobile home when you walk into it\nAnd as long as people think it was that it's not a house it's not going to go up in value because that's how the market perceives it and that's what you got to look at\nSo whatever you're putting into that you're throwing that money away ... ... what do you think about living in a mobile home for a year to say for a down payment if you're doing that five thousand are mobile home down pike export\nAnd lived there for a year while I save up some money that's fine because you're just given up you know some of the five thousand dollars not turning not allowing fifty thousand on something that's now worth thirty\nWhere you get upside down and the thing um\nOr if you're talking about renting something that's what you want to do sure whatever wherever you want to rent okay rich cheap rent is cheap as you can rent does that mean you can say more for your down payment James's in Lexington Hi James how are

money make over ... Ryan read it and two days and I said yeah let's go ahead and I'm not a reader [laughter]\nAnd we just got after it and it took us thirty month to pay off that initial fifty five thousand dollars a net ... and then we've built our emergency fund and started getting after our house you know and not really believing we were going to pay off the house\nAs quickly as we did but uh even when life got in the way we just kept sticking to the plan and here we are\nAnd we're just incredibly proud of where we're at\nYou ought to be well I mean if you have a guard rails you know if you're bumping up against them yeah and on and so I got I got a game plan here where the houses the house and you get knocked out a little bit then you get back up at four houses the houses the house and enter your ten years later you started when you're twenty eight and every thing is paid for you don't have a single\nPayment now how's that for you\nIt well I was just thinking this morning as um I don't when when bill day comes around it so fast because there's nothing to pay for it yeah yeah it's awesome build day\nAnd we were able to ah you know start putting that money towards the future and agreements rather than a choice we made fourteen years ago and that it's just a huge blessing\nIf you've got your future standing around your kids your retirement and uh your your wealth building your generosity

you like [noise]\nWow yeah my hero yeah how do you do that\nWhat do you tell them what's the key to getting out of debt\nI think it's the budget you gotta start there um and I think now on this side of it you just have to believe that it's going to work and just keep plugging away at it um and small steps add up to a giant stuff at the end you know\nAnd I I Would add to that ah the giving them the ... um what's really court I mean where when we started I\nUsed to routinely saying click while we're driving a church like boys what we're given what we are tied into the church today you know we could do this or do that I'm just slowly over time that's changed and I don't have this um you know deficit mentality any more aware and taking away it's we've learned how to Liz\nHave joy within our means and once you hit that point it's um\nThat makes sense yeah\nSo I mean first thing we got to do is make sure you have enough to pay cash is that what you're talking about that you're going to have enough an pay some down their student loans or what\nOr that's what I was trying to figure out like you have a foul something between Fifteen and twenty grand between now and then the next fall when I go back to school and I've got knocked on the loan so I didn't know stating well\nFirst thing is the first thing the first goal is complete school be a hundred percent sure have way more than enough to complete school with no new debt now when do you finish school at the end of next year\nYou know it'll take about a year and a half\nAnd your degree will be and what\nAre your business management is\nOkay and I'm\nWill that move you up in income immediately are you working now what's your story\nYeah I've been I've been in and out of school I've got a management job now but I don't really see it being able to advance means like higher leadership all all that kind of my reasoning for one could go back to school to finish\nOkay well it's it's not a bad thing to finish up what you're doing and I think that's a good plan but yeah the the first goal is to finish with no new debt and make plenty sure you got plenty more than enough to do that but let's say that you add it up and you say I Need twenty thousand dollars to finish all of my school\nAnd then you save up thirty thousand\nAnd then you save up another ten thousand I wouldn't know what I mean Thirty's more if twenties all you need thirties plenty that gives you a pad then everything above that you start paying off the debt if you got really really into the money you see what I'm saying but I mean I wouldn't be I wouldn't have two dollars extra I'd want to live a lecture to make sure you get through school with no new debt\nThat's your first big goal now when you get out of school then we're going to attack\nThis debt with a vengeance and that's going to be the process but um\nThat's just what we tell people don't don't go further in is your first call Jeffrey is in Atlanta Georgia Hi Jeffrey how are you\nHow you doing better than I deserve what's up uh I work for a company that had the leaf it for a while and\nI Will be paying if I give to the program I Will be paying one twenty I pay period could be going to lead a program but\nThey weren't in my car manufacturer maybe your work or what do you work for a BMW okay that is not a normal leasing program this was an Employee Benefit order and it is excellent\nBecause they furnish the car at a cost that there's there's no way you could have hardly any car for no more than you're paying I mean ... ... you said two hundred and forty dollars right as three thousand dollars a year okay if you bought that car will go down three thousand dollars and twenty minutes in value\nEither you see what I'm saying so that is a bargain and do they not they furnish liked a Tarzan oil and stuff to ... ...\nIs the gas even furnished and that they can't remember no no no there's one on one of the car manufacturers even version but it's it's ... it's called it's all the maintenance and the tires though\nRight everything is the insurance and that to ya author so that's a deal of deal I mean you can't buy the tires and the insurance for three thousand dollars a year\nBut that's not a lease that's not like a standard okay they call it a lease but it's more of an Employee Benefit in other words BMW is losing money\nOn this transaction with you to your benefit because you're an employee it's an employee benefits either\nAnd they want their employees drive in one of their fine automobiles and you guys do make a fine automobile so yeah and I if I remember ... you have what a selection that for that is that the price of a certain car or is that the price of a car up to a certain amount\nAnd oh by the car no car the one that you liked or whatever okay All right\nWe'll do it's a deal I mean seriously you know ... you can't hardly buy insurance for that got much less the tires and maintenance\nMuch less all about the loss in value but that's different than Joe walking off the street and leasing that car which he did it probably seven hundred dollars a month okay\nYou know and that would not be a good deal he should maybe by a BMW if he's got a lot of money and pay cash for it 'cause it's a good car but you're you're getting an Employee Benefit and it's a sweet deal for you I Would definitely do that if I worked for beamer\nIt's a bargain it's a great deal and there are several of the car manufacturers that have really good deals for their employees but you just kind of have to think about it of if I was driving you know if you're driving ten thousand dollar car man\nYou can't do that for three thousand dollars a year\nWas what we're talking about here and you're certainly not driving up ten thousand dollar car what we're describing your probably driving forty thousand dollar car\nSo a good question my thank you for calling in and um again there's a great deal appreciate your joining us Amy is on Twitter at Dave Ramsey is there an item or items that you refuse to pay for or by\nEven though you could afford it now\nYeah sure I can\nAfford most anything I Want to do nowadays I mean not anything but most anything and some things just feel weird to me I feel I just don't want to have that invested in that\nUm I've got a friend that's worth um\nTens of millions of dollars and he's a watch guy and he bought a um a hundred and fifty thousand dollar watch which sounds just nuts but I mean he's got like ... million dollars it's a it's like most people ... okay I can afford to do that it just I just\nI don't know it's not me number one and and I I'm\nA much been on a boat [laughter]\nBut not on a watch so I mean you know it is just being authentic with you you know but uh\nUh so\nThe boats bigger than watch does that count [laughter] so yeah it just it's something that hits me funny but it's not really a value Judgement to say that\nMy point is is that I'm not mad at him for spending ... she's got two hundred million dollars\nAnd if you spend a hundred and fifty grand I Will watch it's nothing okay that guy's got plenty of money it's like most people bought a biscuit he gives away his is a general ... huge he helps lots and lots of hurting people and that's a very very small percentage of his world but emotionally I have trouble\nEven though intellectually I can get there and I'm not judging him emotionally ... I ... I Would struggle doing that um but that doesn't mean it's wrong to do it just 'cause I Can't crash but\nAh emotionally it it would be wrong to do it if it's a high percentage of his world and that's why we tell people like on your cars and stuff don't get into a high percentage of your\nYou know your your financial world where you've got you know you make Seventy five thousand dollars a year and you've got eighty thousand or for the cars well that's just stupid\nThat they can make a value Judgement on that does not emotions just mathematically dumb but when something is a small percentage of your world there are still some things that emotionally you just don't\nFeel right about but it doesn't mean that it's a more immoral for someone else to do it is my point and so\nAnd really a lot of you could learn that lesson 'cause some people judge other people because they can't emotionally grasped that and just because you can't emotionally grasped something doesn't mean it's morally wrong there's a difference here and so anyway that's a good question I talk about a lot of that kind of stuff and the legacy journey book and only ... written about welfare in\nThe books I've written about money and so that puts this hour that Iran's you show in the books\nWe will be fine with me I'm a member there is ultimately only one way to financial\nDaily with the prince of peace and\nPaying\nShe was radio Ninety sixty tell you we are ... and on line nine sixty W we are C. dot com\nI harsh radio sci fi it's four o'clock [noise]\nMore bodies found in Florida or Mr Brady Fox News hurricane Michael now blamed for at least twenty six task force states as a grim search continue in the devastated Florida Panhandle\nShowing you know when they go low we go [noise] go low we go [laughter] we'll just different radical ideas about how I\nThat's what this new Democratic Party is about\nIf that's the part give me an example everybody here's a quick Hannity quiz what one positive thing is any Democrat either running for the Senate or the house where you live\nWhat are they running on that they want to do to make this world this country a better more secure more prosperous home for us our kids our grandkids to create more jobs more opportunities what are they offer it\nWhat are they offering to secure the borders if anything what we're watching now is one of the biggest lie just information propaganda campaigns this is now the the Democratic Party\nHillary Clinton camp be Bernie Sanders fair and square she's got a sheet they got a stack the deck and Bernie the it just being a dummy just took it and when the whole the whole thing was rigged against him from the get go\nDown you know [laughter] I don't know\nOkay suddenly ... soon as possible ... Democrats this is what we're now witnessing and this is not unprecedented I've been in this business radio Thirty years I've been in t._v. I just started my twenty third year\nThey'll play book is the exact same every two four years\nRepublicans were racist sexist massaging as leader phobic Islamic phobic homophobic they weren't dirty air water they want to kill your children and some look alike of your Congress man or woman is going to throw your grandmother over the cliff\nNow they've even taking it a step further than that you\nThe center for American Progress which is John Podesta is old group he created this thing and another think tank I've never heard\nOf the third way their advice and Democrats what they should do and not do and the lead up to the election what they should say what they should not say spend as little time as possible talking about immigration\nDon't tell the people the truth about immigration sanctuary attacks a pack a punch it says that a memorandum\nOh okay New York times got a copy of this thing Democrats the strategy is preparing the memo board by using all Democrats that they could neutralize the attacks if they responded but they should spend as little time as possible talking about immigration itself instead\nPivot to more fruitful issues like by the way health care and taxation\nFor healthcare means people bombing care I don't know how that's fruitful for them you know keep your doctor keep your plan and pay less that hasn't worked out very well people millions lost their doctors their plans and they're paying two three four times what they were ones paying and the only thing they want on taxation is oh they they they want\nYou know they use the rhetoric\nYou know redistribution tax cuts for the rich the reality is ah that's never been true in half the country only pays three percent of the tax bill the latest numbers came I was in Bloomberg yesterday\nTop three percent of Americans pay the majority of taxes in this country the top three percent\nTop one percent pay forty percent\nThe top fifty percent of all taxpayers pay Ninety seven percent of the total individual income taxes let me say it another way the bottom fifty percent of taxpayers only pay three percent of the tax bill that's it\nYou know which small percentile of taxpayers you know also paid three percent or more well you know if you look at the top fourteen hundred taxpayers one thousand four hundred people\nIn a country of three hundred plus million people that group alone pays a massive share of fourteen hundred people pay nearly ... percent of the taxes\nJust just fourteen hundred people\nTwo thousand one bottom fifty percent paid nearly five percent now it's down to three percent that's it you have this progressive tax system that they want but it's still not enough they want their crumbs back\nThey're not going to tell you Maxine Waters see Jason if you can find the cut Maxine Waters said they don't they keep telling me not to say it they don't\nWant me to try to have when you're dealing with what we have in Washington DC in the highest causes says Iran I wake up in the middle of the night and all I can think about a\n[laughter]\nWe should not think about how somebody else has done to deal with versus all of our fight\nI say I'm On the side and on the side of I'm not going to move her house you know there's a difference how some of our leadership talk about how we handle all of this not saying please don't say impeachment anymore when\nI was saying the chicken [laughter]\nAnd they didn't they say Maxine don't say it in other words we we we agree but we're not telling people what we want to do when I'm going to we're not going to ... we just want to keep it quiet well we're going to do well that's what the center for American\nProgress is recommending they doing immigration\nIt's very difficult to it on immigration with vulnerable vulnerable votes in states that Trump carried in twenty sixteen the strategy memo goes on arguing even the most draconian of Republican policies like family separation threats to deport dreamers undocumented immigrants cetera et cetera\nFailed to sway most voters emphasis added let me interpret this for you Maxine being quiet don't tell the people the truth of what we're really going to do\nDon't talk about immigration don't tell them we want to eliminate I stop saying it don't tell them you won't open borders keep lying to them\nYou know we've got Claire McCaskill we got an unbelievable tape that we're going to play at the top of the next hour would project ...\nRemember last week we had you know former governor of Tennessee reticent and the people in his office basically saying we're only
