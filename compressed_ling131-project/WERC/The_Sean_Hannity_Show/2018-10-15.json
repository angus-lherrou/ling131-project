accident right\nRight um you you don't have a car insurance for gasoline you don't have home owners insurance for long term care insurance just for the big thing and we've tried to ensure everything top down and that's led to the west you know really it's ten years of\nInsurance premiums that have doubled or tripled when we need to do it\nThis ensures less which is how every other insurance product works they keep it that is means doctors have to make more of the services they provide affordable and they can if they cut out the middleman and streamline than a simple\nMath and how big is your practice how many patients do you have in your facility in atlas MD and Wichita\nIn Wichita we have five doctors and over thirty two hundred patients\nUnbelievable and your aid you give concierge care at all I could pick up a phone and I'm getting a doctor at three in the morning that it's going to answer my call\nYou do you have and I could go down and see somebody at three AM in the morning\nIf you need stitches ... it's an emergency you know a lot of the three am phone calls or chest pain which we might send the ER but a lot of times the kid who's sick and a mom who's worried and\nUm you of if you can avoid the ER you can avoid a thousand or two thousand dollar bill that's how you get health care health insurance is a card in your wallet health care is access to your doctor yeah\nAll right and then how many other practices around the country have you been able to to provide your model that they have duplicated how you you've been out and about and a champion of this for a long time\nYet we've helped over five hundred and fifty doctors convert to this model in the last few years but there's about a thousand total there in forty eight states every state except north and South Dakota right now but we have one about to launch in North Dakota [noise]\nUm and then it's even gotten a little bit international so um this is a a sound tried and true model\nNow and what do you do Dr growth in terms of your president of duck a doctor patient care foundation you know now that we have alternatives that are working real life experiences seems to me that we ought to be able to duplicate it a lot more than we are\nAbsolutely a so doctor patient care foundation has a physician or on health policy think tank because doctors never seemed to be at the table whenever we're having these important conversations about health care\nSo we put traditions about getting back to the table to help his conversations\nPersonally I I also have a primary care practice much like that lets them here in southwest Florida ... ... any health are plus when he was you know why are we using insurance to pay for health are for basic primary care services\nAll it does is create obstacles ... tour and we're ... the phone ... points as Dr Josh and we're seeing patients come to us from\nAll over the state of ... and even from outside of the country\nWe're seeing some inbound medical tourism are and what we're finding is that you know not not the same thing got about health insurance we're just using it wrong and you know when somebody is you know pay twice the amount of money for a service because you're helping shots\nWater we ensuring is using insurance drives up the cost of the other products so an MRI cash price Ross is two hundred and twenty dollars while using her your commercial insurance we go through all the the hoops to get it authorized\nYour co pay five hundred dollars or so we we see this time and again on the more people are are coming out of pocket to pay for health health or I'll let you signed up to ... more insurance seems to be becoming an optical\n... solution so I'm pleased to see that you know we're shifting the conversation from a coverage for everyone on ... talking about reducing the cost of health care\nI think the real close enough I was about to testify on us some help committee on this topic\nWould it be a better idea I mean I'm watching for example they have this race out in California everybody's shock\nGavin Newsom ... who is now offering free health care for everybody he whether your pay a tax payer whether you're in the ... the state legally or illegally everybody's got to get free health care well I basically put a sign that says come to California but you get sick\nUm because people are going to go there now what's interesting to me is that a Republican is within striking distance and that gubernatorial race out in California because instinctively people no we can't afford to pay\nFor every illegal immigrant in the country but the reality is is that if I Lived in Wichita, Kansas I Would be a part of atlas empty and I would be your patient\nDr ... because I I think it's the best deal I liked the idea of being able to call my doctor whenever I'm sick or if I have a kid that sick every parent wants the ability to do that and your preserved for service provides a fifty bucks a month now how much is the average in Wichita, Kansas catastrophic plan of it but the big things heart attack\nOr accident or cancer how much would one of those plans cost\nAbout five hundred dollars a family member dollars per year or a month\nA month so and the current rates closer to you know a thousand twelve hundred a across the nation people are paying more for health insurance each month and they are paying for their mortgage if the Trump tax cuts only put a hundred dollars\nPer household per month in and they're being credited with the economic boom of your four point two percent GDP\nIf we fix health insurance we could put five hundred dollars back in the pocket of every household or that the real ... and the the politician there has in California is to send them on a ridge analogy\nJust throwing more money at the problem has never fixed it the what we're doing is Dr Lee and ourselves and and a thousand other physicians is is innovating and saying how do we get ... cheaper how do we make it so patients don't have co pays how do we provide stitches for no cost because they're so affordable\nI'm actually looking at ways it's fundamentally fixing the system that's what we need not just promises of more spending way and if I could\nAdd add to that just a a ... you know as far as the cost of care is you know the biggest thing that people ask us as well how can I just get major medical you know we we can afford what what services the direct primary care practice is providing but we just need something catastrophic well Obama Care made that illegal\nOr so from the middle ... just brought by ... that access to these major medical plans called ... short term medical plans and you know some would argue that these are actually true insurance they don't cover anything except the major medical expenses Seventy five dollars a month a\nAnd I mean but what it is this can be implemented easily city by city town by town we can duplicate the model it already does take care of individuals with preexisting conditions if somebody wants to sign up for outlets empty and they have a preexisting condition or Dr ... denied them service\nNow everybody's welcome and everybody is priced the same just based on age um we know we're going to work harder for some patients ... Wilson over then to not have to work as hard for other patients and we don't want to be judged by their illness\nHow did you get to who directly negotiate these prices with these pharmaceutical companies\nBoy I I Wish I could say was because we're so darn good at it um the the truth is it's so much more simple than that\nAt a doctor's in forty four states are allowed to work directly with pharmaceutical wholesalers so just like you can go to Costco and get something for much cheaper because you pay a membership\nWe do the same thing and we're able to\nGet the you know the actual cost of medicine might be a ten dollars for a thousand pills and because we don't have a staff of seven people per physician fighting insurance\nWe can lower the cost and and pass the savings on directly to the patient that this is a win for everybody we we don't take care of of Republicans or Democrats we take care of people\nSo how does somebody had to a group of doctors in New York say implement those cars are going to look at this and say fifty bucks a month I Can't make ten cents off of that\nBut they're going to have to move to New York because they don't make it easy but um they could work with a pharmacist in New York state's one of the a few states that make it very difficult but then a pharmacist could say um if you do a five dollar a month membership with them then you get the medicine that costs that would be an amazing model it it would cut down\nThere right let's take the New York out of the equation for California out of the ... let's say any other state Louisiana Florida um I don't know Missouri yeah how do they do it\nIt's as simple as signing up effect shopping on Amazon there's there's almost nothing to it um you know we have one supplier that makes it very easy overnight shipping and that's just it if I Want to buy a bottle of a hundred pills of blood pressure medicine I can if I Want to buy a thousand pills I can and it's about the same price\nIn

no reasoning with on reasonable people so we'll just have to wait and see it's up to the Republican Party I think and and the candidates and indeed President Trump to maintain the momentum going forward over the next twenty seven days\nLook the hell out of great article today about what their agenda is then they the Democrats have big plans\nNone of which will help the country or they want to shore up Obamacare which has been nothing short of a disaster for the American people\nThey want more Dodd Frank financial rules to protect quote dreamers and the integrity of elections in other words they want massive amnesty they want to aggressively probe any single thing they can they want this country locked down into endless investigation and likely the impeachment of Donald Trump\nThey you know Republicans celebrate the passage of the biggest tax cutting history they refer to as crumbs\nAnd they're saying it's time to take the crumbs back I guess the crumbs or the most delicious part of the meal um so all of this isn't the jeopardy damned bonds you know I don't see a waning in people's enthusiasm now I think they have\nThey went so far in the case I'm frankly in the last two years what we have witnessed with the end you chronicled lives in your new book\nYou know the they attempted sabotage of the president I think they see the fundamental unfairness and nothing they stand for is going to help the average American to have a better life\nRight and so on the media and Greg just nailed it by the way [laughter] you know the media and the Democrats ... ... it's it's it's symbiotic I mean it's a host at a at a parasite at this point they're the same thing they have ... end up this rage not\nAll of them but many of them against Donald Trump to such an intense for me think about the things showing that have come out I mean new lows in politics\nDonald Trump Supreme Court nominee called the rapist Donald Trump called the treat treat guilty of treason a crime literally punishable by death that's not hyperbolic he thinks he's been called trees as they ginned up the base so much on that here's the problem the Democrats have created for themselves and the election\nThat in order to seem like the more anti Trump candidate to get that money in those volunteers for your twenty twenty presidential campaign or to get that money in the midterms what do you have to do you have to oppose the trader you have to oppose the train rapists or whatever it's sick name they call the capital\nSo that that's what's leading to this a psycho pathology on the left\nAnd I agree I I don't see this waning and I do see Republican voters saying listen when is enough enough you attack this this this American patriot and cabinet or you try to take down the Trump Administration weaponize and the government when is enough enough and I think they're going to show up I Hope I pray they do\nWell what do you think about Hillary's endorsement of ah the incitement of getting in people's faith and you can't be civil suit basically calling for instability you you can't really civil with the political party\nThat wants to destroy what you stand for what you care about and then the other comments made by people like Maxine Waters and others getting their Hayes\nFollow him into a grocery store is following the gas stations confront them chase them out of restaurants which we have seen going on and on a on a regular basis\nFor Republicans it is absolutely wonderful you know they ought to send an early Christmas gift to Hillary Clinton Michael ... Maxine Waters Jerry Adler Nancy Pelosi many of those individuals are calling for\nThe investigation and teach men to Brett Kavanaugh which Americans realize you is wrong and preposterous I could have certainly explain how on a legal basis\nImpeachment is not possible uh for Brett Kavanaugh but the more that these toxic individuals' and all of the ones I mentioned\nEspecially Hillary Clinton are toxic uh the more that only drives Republican voters to the polls to make sure that these people are not ah in positions of power and will not be able to ruin the accomplishments\nOf Donald Trump which have been incredible you know in the course of two years he's accomplished more than Brock Obama did in eight years the greatest level of American economic growth and prosperity in modern American history and that is not\nJust made up I mean the statistics demonstrate that and so if Americans want to maintain that prosperity 'em and add you know money to their wallets into private\nAh from government officials who loved just squander hard earned money from American taxpayers are their choices easy while\nI did like Kevin McCarthy introduced which was a bill to fully fund the Trump border wall\nOr the president has already spent about what three three and a half billion dollars you needs about twenty three billion dollars more to get the job done and I think that is certainly one of the big issues that Americans would be motivated to go out and vote for and the other I think\nYou know the president rightly said he could make as many as four and more Supreme Court appointments that is a massive issue at this point it is it's a tipping point for the courts you know if you think of the age and the help of some of the justices um ... there's no doubt there will be vacancies in the in years to come in the near\nFuture ... and don't forget shown that the circuits and the district court the Supreme Court gets all of the attention you know it's the sexy story the highest court in the land quite obviously\nBut his Greg can tell you most of these cases that are ... reports to American businesses American individuals moms and dads out there are settled that the circuit court level they don't even make it to the Supreme Court and Trump already has\nWas uh twenty six appointees to the circuit courts and there's a couple of more are getting ready to have to be confirmed as well so this is a really big deal now um we have of course the Ginsburg seat a you know they could come open if Trump wins reelection bid may come open I ... and I say that Sean I'm\nWorried I mean I mean it I'm actually worried what will happen to the country if that seat if it gets Berg decides to step down I mean look what we just witnessed would cabinet can you imagine what's gonna happen if that seat comes open has the potential six three conservative majority and the courts\nI mean it is genuinely frightens me at a at a again that's not melodramatic I worry for my kids what will happen\nAnd also a chance to win tickets for a\nBig event spirits cars in cigar want to know what's going on\nFox News on that he had like President Trump dealing with pressure over the suspected murder of Washington Post columnist Jamal could show gate by Saudi Arabia Larry Kudlow at the White House economic council was asked about sanctions\nLook I'm not an expert on these things I don't know if anybody knows at this point the president's call for a swift and transparent investigation I think he's talking about this week in particular so we will see what that brings\nKudlow was on ABC's This week search crews are still out in Mexico Beach Florida after hurricane Michael\nThe eye of Michael's slammed into here on Wednesday a hundred and fifty five mile an hour winds nine foot storm surge and everything that was it that way level and apply to spread across the neighborhood is still standing but ripped open in ... bill ruling\nFox's silky eating this is Fox News [noise]\n\nThis report is brought to you by mothers against drunk driving good evening Birmingham we're talking about temperatures tonight and dropping down into the low to mid sixties you'll also noticed an increase in humidity is you wake up tomorrow morning Monday about a twenty\nPercent chance for some spotty showers will see a partly to mostly ... going to remain very warm temperatures above average ties in the mid eighties or advertising for this time of year in the mid to upper seventies on WBRC funk six meteorologist Matt Daniel on your side all news radio what five by W.

people that I I see talking about it seem not to recognize a what a five ... five application is actually a warrant just like a search warrant\nIn order to get five or a search warrant you need an affidavit signed by a career federal law enforcement officer who swears that the information the affidavit is true and correct to the best of his knowledge and beliefs\nAnd that's the way we operate and if that's wrong sometimes it is if you find out that in any incorrect in there that person is going to face consequences\nAnd if you find that anything's wrong in the air that person is going to face consequences you got to fix your signature to this you know it was signed up for David together Pfizer warrant signed by a career law enforcement person\nSwearing that what you are presenting to the court is true and that you know it to be true and affirmed it to be true well that didn't work out with the third renewal by the application in the case of Carter Page\nA which is the fourth buys a warrant issued but the fourth one that was signed was signed by Rod Rosenstein and we all know that the bulk of information that was put in the ... and ...\nWell that was based on the bone eight Clinton bought and paid for dot CA that not even Christopher Steele stands by to this day\nAnd that was never verified never corroborated and has turned out to be mostly debunked which is among the many other conflicts that Rod Rosenstein has of course he's the one that recommended firing Jim call me\nHe's the one that signed the visor warrants he's the one that appointed Mueller and now he was scheduled to appear tomorrow under old and a two sources now telling Fox News at this hour\nThat Rod Rosenstein scheduled the parents before the house Judiciary Committee is at an impasse\nOver the terms of the testimony\nAnd he doesn't want to have a transcribed interview under oath which is the standard for congressional task force interviews\nAnd those closed the Rosenstein say well he prefers a meeting or briefing with the house Judiciary Committee chairman and other lawmakers where there's no paper trail where there's no under oath part well the question is why would he be afraid to go under oath\nWell here to weigh in on this and much more\nUh as as impasse continues Mark Meadows he is the Freedom Caucus chairman and congressman Jim Jordan of Ohio also a Freedom Caucus member a and by the way would be in the house Judiciary Committee\nInterview of Rod Rosenstein um we also have learned in the last three days Mark Meadows I'll start with you that we now know that Lisa Page\nAndrew McCabe the deputy FBI directors under criminal investigation Lisa Page who is out at the FBI James Baker the top attorney at the FBI they all are telling the same story that Rod Rosenstein said that he wanted to surreptitiously record the president of the United states\nIn the hopes of being able to get him to say something that would allow them to invoke the twenty Fifth Amendment so we there's a lot of questions were Rod Rosenstein at this moment\nWell there are a lot of questions I think probably the bigger question is why would Rod Rosenstein\nOr not be prepared to come to Congress tomorrow to clear his name and I think the reason for that is there there are credible witness is you know your lead in had Rod Rosenstein voice saying well you know the needs to be facts and we have the rule of law well we're willing to to consider him innocent until proven guilty\nHim not coming tomorrow indicates a that there is real credibility with these witnesses that suggested that he not only wanted to take the president but he wanted to use those tapes a to effectively have a deal Jake who on the president of the United states\nWell he met with the president apparently earlier this week and blue on air force one does anyone know what the result of that meeting was\nWell I think the biggest thing is uh Shaun is is a let's don't read too much into a flight on air force one\nI think it's the president trying to be reasonable and hear rod side of the story I think the president has been extremely measured I tell you who's not measured at this particular point\nYou give your work and that's the first thing that comes up [noise] hey thanks for the call literally is with us in Knoxville highly how are you\nHeard of that how are you better than I deserve what's up [noise]\nYou know my I call fair to me like I mean he made me happy ... well I'm I'm not well an interesting or by the fact that I may try fully understand Hitler said after he had a question it is it appropriate I can see that well and you have any suggestions on how the fact that conversation\nOr it's more than appropriate as a matter of fact it's just flat out strange he made you the executor without first talking to you\nThat's like weird [laughter] yeah that's a very presumptive\nTo say the least so ah let's re start the conversation ... ... ah I didn't sign up for this and I am willing to consider helping you in this way\nAnd I think you thought you were honoring me with this and I appreciate the honor I think uh but there's a couple of things that are going to go along with me agreeing to be your executor\nUm otherwise I Can't be your executor number one is I have to know what every detail of your situation is\nAnd that includes reading the will and understanding the wheel and going over it with your lawyer number two is all of those affected by the will have to be informed both for your death what the world says\n'cause I'm not going to implement stuff that I get blamed for and everybody's pissed at me and it was you that\nDid it you follow me ... ...\nYeah 'cause you're going to have like your cousins or whoever it is that he's asking you to not give money to that thinks they're getting money they're not going to be mad at him he's dead they're going to be mad at you and all you are allowed to do by the law\nIs exactly what the wheel says\nAnd yet you're going to get all the relational blame\nAnd all the emotional blame and I'm not set myself up until that no way we're going to have a lot of reading of the wheel with the parties that are involved they're all going to know what it says ... junior boys getting cut out because he's doing heroin we need to go and tell him while he's alive he gets no money\nWhile I'm Still alive if he won't do that and he won't let you see everything in advance just say honey I understand\nYou don't have to do that at your stuff but you need to take me off of the executor ship because those are my terms for serving as executive does that sound unreasonable you\nNot at all I I appreciate that's how I was feeling as well ... ...\nYeah that's exactly what I Would do and by the way if he won't take you off as soon as he dies you step before the judge and say I refuse it I'm not going to take it I told him while he's alive I'm not going to do it and I'm not going to do it every day I don't get built into it\nOkay thanks for the call open phones a triple eight eight to five five to to fly by white folks that little exercise right there was a really good for all of you go ahead and tell everybody\nThis is what you're going to get this is what you're not going to get little Suzie gets the\nChina cabinet little George gets the gun collection I don't care what it is going ahead and tell everybody in that way they got when they tell me one time on the back porch I don't want your all that crap it needs to be in oil and everybody needs to know what's going on daddy told me on the back porch does not stand up in court\nAnd so you're going to help people angry and you might as well go ahead and just go with this is what we're doing no need to be angry it's my stuff\nI get to do with what I Want to do with it I'm managing for God I'm going to give it to you to manage for God and this is how this works and be real clear everyone should do that you should always have to see this idea of we have a reading of the will\nAnd it's almost like a movie scene the third wife the trophy wife is in the study the dysfunctional son is in the study\nThe um the responsible daughter is in the study you ... you know these movie scenes you've seen on their own set up for several bad movies that are out there and then the the ... you know the walnut lined the office of the attorney and the attorney begins to read the will and it always has strange and eccentric stipulations in it in every movie right but this is the first time anyone knew what the old\nMan had to do with Israel or the old woman had to do with their will know as dysfunctional crap go ahead and tell everybody in the will what the deal is um we do it around here we have a meeting every year to cover what happens

I was really happy with how it\nTurned out it was really really strong running awful stuff and so much of it I mean I I've been uh I just was editing a blog it's commercial break a couple of commercials where I'd go back to content people on a blog article I'd written them a few weeks ago before I even heard her talk and they had you know that element of overcoming fear because I think there's so much\nWe talk about transforming around here a lot right transformation transfer forming and\nGetting yourself out of debt transforming your marriage outlets parrot talks about that rage on less with marriage and money a van or a you know Anthony with transforming with your teenagers you ladies in business and every time there's transformation as a possibility failure as a possibility and fear kicked kicks in\nAnd doesn't that voice in your head gets really loud\nAnd it starts to even sound rational and you start to make make excuses that really make you make a lot of sense and you stay stopped but if you had someone that can speak into your life whether it's a mentor a friend a spouse that says you can do this and here's how and you lay out the path which we've been talking about that even just today that but\nUh you know ran the solution is so great at getting people to plan whether it's with their money or their business and telling 'em that I loved\nThat quote from the tri athletes said don't listen to your self talk to your so yeah it's kind of listening to yourself to start telling yourself the way it's going to be but I didn't even know how he described and he's just so funny what you're talking to him\nWhen I left some odd years beyond doubt and worried but when I talked to myself I can tell myself anything I Want to and it that simple and you can tell myself into something so today\nHere at your new project is here I was little the book is cool this way on an even given anybody I don't know I mean no one knows so this is like big time announcement right now I hold my hand the business boutique\nTwenty Nineteen gold plan or your personal guide to getting results\nAnd this thing is chock full\nWith a step by step process to change your life talk about putting this together and what's in the scope\nPlanner well when I introduced it to our team a few weeks ago really the best way that I could explain it at there are different things that I use my own personal life to grow and to improve and reach my goals I read books to grow I Will use work books if I'm doing a devotion or Bible study I have to do list and I use a journal to write down Gulf and the calendar and a calendar\nHow can we pull all of these pieces together into a planner that connect those dots so for example in January we set goals and then we talk about what then we actually uh put those on the counter than we put them on the task lesson you begin to see\nHow those goals you set in January really can carry through the entire year and and the way that bill today it was like I Would of coaching session so I have questions in there for reflection and activities to work through so if I was sitting down with you over coffee these the questions I Would ask you to help you get to where you want to be so it's really fun and then every single month\nHas a different topic in teaching\nTo help you grow and this is kind of like a complement to the business boutique book it's almost like a work but\nThat helps you put pressure on the month of August is taking care of you know and then you've got questions in there when do you feel your best what activates what activities give you energy and bringing joy and what things make you like yourself the ...\nI mean that's awesome first of all I Love how you introduce yourself you said I'm a young entrepreneur in right there that mindset\nIs already going to set you up for success you already see yourself in the space that just screams confidence and I love that\nI Will tell you one of the great things a million I see a lot is you don't have to wait until you graduate from college to start working on this this is something that you could have a side business\nAnd start while you're in college to help you not only pay your bills but then you're building up demand building up your brand by the time you graduate this could be\nYour full time job in fact um I worked with a guy that did that he started a little T shirt business Dave in college little T shirt business that was a multimillion dollar business before he ever graduated and that was his full time thing so I mean you can do this I just want to encourage him\nThe idea that it's difficult to get into space because you're a girl I think\nIs more in your head in reality if you build great pieces people want to buy them if you solve problems for people if you had a great product and you take care of the market place they don't really care if it was you or do someone old someone young they just love the furniture I Am\nI'm an older doesn't buy furniture but my wife would do a decorator and I can just tell you either my wife or I were we buy a piece of custom made furniture made by a lady that would actually be a brand advantage 'cause we would think that was pretty cool\nYeah that you had that you have a good eye for it that there's yeah I think a million that you this does it have to be a barrier for you if I didn't want to get so I think it's an advantage just you just get started because you're going to get the most confidence when you sell that first piece even if it's small piece even if you sell it to your aunt I don't care\nJust get started dip you're telling the water and million will make sure that Kelly since my book and you can follow that plan it's a step by step plan to grow this business\nAnd start small start in the ... side and you'll see your confidence growing up promised you a ... that will be a non issue it won't even be a fear in your head anymore because like Dave said you'll start to see it as an advantage that you offer the marketplace through your business and excited for you the fact that you're even asking this question and making that phone call girl you got big things ahead for you I'm so excited for you\nSo let me tell you what happened to me a million when I went broke and I wrote a book about how to handle money I'm a broke a shown a book about money\nThat's kind of a disadvantage and all of us who\nWould want to read them money book from a guy that went broke that's what I used to think and after seven Fifteen million bucks a kind of figured out everybody wants to buy among the book from a guy who went broke and learned his lesson\nIn show is actually turned into my what I thought was my disadvantage what my my insecurity that felt like a disadvantage\nEnded up actually being my brand differentiate her\nBecause I Know how people feel I've been there done that I got the T shirts you've got a brand advantages you've got the female touch\nOn the furniture um and you're going to put a different kind of look a different kind of feel to it\nAnd uh and it makes you different you're not just another group making furniture it's really cool you know it makes you stand out I just love it I think you need to get some really cool pictures\nWith you with your power tools and yet somehow you know get in there with the big ... or whatever and safety glasses on and that's your business card\nI I think it's an advantage I think it's a ... the opposite of a disadvantage but when I started\nMy insecurity I thought was a brand disadvantage has turned into one of my biggest brand advantages because it might be different and you need to identify that when you're doing a business right\nIt's interesting to we just had on her leadership master series last week and I was on a panel with Suzanne Suzanne ... and ... and a very common theme we heard a in the audience asking questions is how ... women leaders women leader on how you know how do I succeed as a woman in a man's industry\nAnd there are certainly some industries where you need to be aware of what you're going into but the reality is so often\nIs bigger in our head than it is in reality it's to your point if the thing we think is holding us back when that's the thing that's going to set us apart and make people want to buy from us and so I I Love that whole perspective Amelia uh that that you already see yourself as an entrepreneur now you just need to see yourself as a successful business owner and start to take the steps\nWell I mean I think about somebody like um you know we had Condi Rice speaking on ... and I got to spend time with her obviously female obviously African American\nObviously Hooper brilliant oh you get smarter to ... oh yeah with a woman so unbelievably smart [noise]\nBut um I mean ... successful I mean ... ... the United states of America I mean you know this is no small job here yes ... and\nBut what ended up happening with her what what we we were asking her about the same thing the barriers you know the racial barrier the sexism racism all this kind of stuff and she used the line from her neighborhood\nShe should growing up in a segregated neighborhood in Birmingham, Alabama that her mom I told her it doesn't matter where you're coming from it matters where you're going Mm that's good ... and she said I won't let other people with their prejudice beside\nMy fate yep I decide my foot ... and ... it was like coming out it was just very calm but yeah I heard it loud and clear cut off it ends in there but again it comes back to that that um you know you're going to I'm going on the space and I'm going to turn what you think is a\nDisadvantage that race sex whatever it is up into an advantage because it's a brand differentiate or\nWhat have you been talked about you and share and buying furniture if you look at most American household the women make the purchasing designing decorating decisions\nA ... I think of a a woman that makes plans she's known in the spaces at creating furniture and plans and a white and I buy her plant like bunk bed plans or a fork in the backyard plant\nAnd I love hers more because she has that female touch the male designed so far at least you think should only in my mind I got you got you connected we're best friends you know to me so I really will will draw those people based on that she didn't even realize it\nYeah that's that's very very important I think this is good information the book is business boutique it has a number one buzz shower and you can see why\nChristie ride is with us the founder of that you hear her speak all over America and teach and you'll see her own media you'll see her at ... dot com and those of you that are members of the uh business boutique academy regularly get coaching from her uh and of course now the crusty right business podcast\nYes very well right it is it is taking off and it's amazing\nNow when you can encourage people and inspire them and teach them while they're living their lives so like lift there's right now on the radio show they may be driving in the car on a commute they may be going for a run or they may be cooking or cleaning or something around the house\nBut you're able to encourage them and give them up the steps and plans and tools that they need to win so it's been really fun to to see the stories coming out of someone that their life has changed from the podcast\nWill the information is important because of her marshals what changes your life um you don't do you know you can listen to music and or if it's for those will be in the car all day I mean if ... if you ... you get the same song\nAbout over what the hour and a half or so now ... and I like music I enjoy that I

after that there was the last five years you just whatever's left on the mortgage we reach over and start beating on it\nYes sir and of course during that time typically your income is going to go up that's what we worked for every day right there\nWhen we typically incomes over time go up unless you know plus or minus situations you know but but typically that's what you're faced with so you're you're heading in the right way you're doing stuff right I'm just gonna move that college thing up because you got teenagers and I'm just not move it up I'm On a loaded up before I Move on past

a theory I Can't right now here where we were very\n... and I'm sure that you could be living off of investment income if you've got to two million dollar networks don't you have some income\nWell\nIt's a growing there we go we go to how can we come back in ... when we set aside for ... years okay I can kind of hard to argue with you but\nI Would hope if you have a two million dollar network that if you were making ten percent on that you'd be making two hundred thousand dollars a year on your on your investments\nUm or at least a hundred thousand dollars a year I mean surely your investments are making you or something anyway my take on franchises doesn't really matter much because you've already done one but here's what I Would tell you you're going to find it to be a love hate relationship most franchisees do and most French ...\nLove is they teach you how to do something they give you some marketing and some brand awareness that you might not have had\nIn the marketplace processes to show\nThat the business is all very valuable homeless but most of the times I Would\nTo say it is\n\nUsually on the website and a while you start losing users just by

in a non destructive inspection\nGotcha okay and so what kind of ... was the ...\nUm most of my credit card and then we had a car I'm a tractor and then he vacation time share oh\nGoody and you guys are a little bit of everything and how long have you been married\nI'm Twenty one years now\nWhat happened to Eighteen months ago\n[noise] um well\nI had a because my work is kind of cyclical I work about sixty days on sixty days off\nOverseas I\nFor a long time had or for the first couple of years of my employment I had the opportunity to do extensions ...\nAnd we use those extensions which kind of worked out like all the time and kind of cover expenses and make things and all that and then about a few months ago I was told that we wouldn't be getting any more extensions\nSo I Will I Will do overseas with time and Mary where I couldn't really call stuff I had to do everything by text to my texted her and said here's what it's looking like which are understandably we we were doing things are upset her\nQuite a bit yeah your income really dropped off\nA yeah yeah just took a big hit to beat her income there and she was pretty upset about that so we were considering cashing out my four one K. to pay things off and to kind of make her so cold again\nAnd then what happened at that point as when we got gotten texting that night I'm like you've got very upset I started looking into the four one K. option I didn't like that option because we've already in our past Twenty years cashed in a couple of my small retirements when I quit a job\nAnd so I called my brother at like eleven o'clock at night he works nights so I can talk to him and I called my brother Charlie and he kinda ripped me what he\nRan to the navy\nI\nSaid that you know we make too much money can be that's broke and he told me that we you know if I can tell this or that and you start talking about how in the car and selling the tractor and selling the trap getting\nThe van and I kind of came up with excuses for every one and it wasn't really listening very well and hung up liking cheers just crying and\nTried to go to sleep at Clinton and ended up getting up out of bed\nA went into my office got on the computer and started making a spreadsheet and I sat down in the first thing I looked at with the car um it was the only vehicle in the tractor that we owe money on a scale mhm I'm at my mini van was paid off um had in my power over two hundred thousand miles\nUm but wasn't worth a lot so I didn't see that being helpful when we had a unique opportunity with the car because we I think one of the votes can be false\nWas a scandal yeah you know and\nYeah and they were offering us you know we could do that by Dr ... and we were paying the pet but I looked at the options and started looking at if we get the back and got the cash federal married and got rid of the payment\nAnd the position that would put a than I did actually had it at that point to where we would pay off in thirty six months\nAnd about two or three o'clock in the morning I called\nMy brother back what I've been doing and he said he would buy us F pay\n'em for Christmas and allow us to the program at home we kind of within the middle of nowhere and then I told him that I Would text pet but not today to talk to him and I was a little nervous because the car with kind of cats and I didn't think he\nAnd don't forget

scotch in San Francisco Hi Scott welcome to the day Ramsey show\nThat comes with a chemical sure what's up\nHey so I've got a question for you so my dad has a small\n\nGroup working with him for about seven years and I just started a family from time to take over the business you're kind of make it better on every now and this year this time of the either he wants to buy tractors because he started going because it's going to quote ... man and he\nSeems to think that's the best way that the amount you've you know for taxes rather than\nSaving money or there's never been able to hold over twenty five years and you've never been able to say really\nWell that's why you know is because we keep spending money on that to buy stuff that he doesn't even need to say on taxes or the the math that he's doing is unbelievably faulty okay let me give an example what what would be a typical purchase it will be the size of the equipment I'm fifty\nThat was in dollar item a hundred thousand rode out while yeah fifty thousand\nDollars he buys a fifty thousand dollar item um in years past she had to he could not write that all off in one year yet a runoff over five years or ten thousand dollar a year right off and if he has a ten thousand dollar you write off you don't get to say it doesn't say ten thousand dollars on your tax bill\nOkay mhm instead what it does is it would save you about two thousand dollars on your tax bill\nNow what we're saying is that he borrowed fifty thousand dollars to save two thousand dollars a year on this tax bill for five years\nYeah the the math is really really faulty there\nAnd so what happens is entrepreneur is either don't think this through an or use this as a rationalization to buy toys inside their business that they really can't afford to you guys have to quit buying equipment or you can pay cash for it and then and then you're going to buy older used equipment only equipment you need to do the job\nWe don't buy anything here in our office if we don't have to have it to get the job done when anything is a tax write off\nThe way he explained it to me if he has because it has to be you know because they want to break down but the one that won't be down and look out for ten days you just walk that's the way he explains to me and I\nTell them you're telling me all two year old and three year old tractors aren't safe and break down all the time again you know asinine ... that's just ridiculous\nOK here's the other thing is kind of a doctor Phil moment he's worked has bought off all these years and he has no money mhm and Dr phil would say how's that working for you\nYeah it's not you know childhood theory of years working out here it's not working out and so I don't know how to tell you to tell your dad what to do he's probably not listening to you and he's probably look Lena may see the\nPoint now finally I take it you know actually\nIf you're running you know if you're running than if you're running it then you get to make the decision\nAnd you and I just decided you can ... I don't want anybody to be unsafe and I don't want to have equipment but I've got probably a million and a half dollars and equipment sitting here within a Fifteen feet of me right now while we're doing the show\nI Can't have that equipment going down the show would go down that would cost me a lot of money just like that but but we also don't buy equipment we don't need\nAnd then we make a decision whether we're going to buy new and we certainly pay cash for it\nOr whether it's cameras were computer systems in your case it's actually heavy equipment we don't own any heavy equipment\nUm couple pickup trucks to do delivery and stuff around here and one bus that keeps running us between buildings but other than that we don't have any big stuff like that but still I Can't have that bus breaking down all the time but on the bus used\nDonald Harris drives our bus everyday runs us back and forth between our little shuttled between our things and it's it was a huge shuttle and I paid attempt for what I knew what it costs\nAnd its run I mean it's broken down a couple of times when we rented a shuttle for that day when it broke down kept kept moving we'll put it in the shop and fixed it but I mean for that little bit of inconvenience it's safe\nAnd it's been reliable enough to get the job done and not shut us down\nAnd so that's a minor example but it's filling in the same metaphor and so yeah you can you can make this work by use to pay cash for your quip months otherwise all you do is work for nothing all you do is end up with no money for all your work because and and the you know the\nHeavy equipment dealer gets all your money and it just doesn't work for me I don't want to live that way Josh is in Savannah hey Josh welcome to Dave Ramsey show\nHow you doing better than I deserve how can I help\nMy wife and I just moved from Alabama or Georgia almost a year ago and we have our tags for our cars are are coming up to be viewed in Alabama you pay for your

there\nBut we have um another car that we are about eleven thousand on that we've been comic letting sailing anyway um we we recently started ...\nAnd um we'd been caught up on any way and we were a art eggs we have to bring your attack at the end of October which would be a lot more money than it would have been that way than an Alabama how\nHow much how much it costs to run a ...\nUh about four hundred\nFor it and what what's your household income just under a thousand and one of the debt she'll be got not counting your house\nWe're alone or me and my why I'm One for twenty nine thousand and one or twenty\nOkay and that's it they're okay you like this car\n[noise] uh it's on it's not what we um we got the family car we we recently had a baby and it it it's not as much rain whenever we drove it it's not as much room as we thought it would be once we got strollers you\nKnow if you want to move to a different car that's fine I don't think you have to do this financially and you're certainly not to do it over four hundred dollars worth of tax um that's not the way you make the decision here but I'm basically you got a pile of debt you're trying to get through can you get through that in two years and keep\nThe scars yes I'm In his car the total of cars less than half your on your own income yes and those are the guidelines we use on whether to keep a car so this car is very
