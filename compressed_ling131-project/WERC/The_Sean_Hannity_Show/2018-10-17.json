{"month": "10", "state": "AL", "station": "WERC", "content": "Smart vest her approach that are called you can click smart restaurant Dave Ramsey dot com Don's with us in Longview, Texas Hi Don welcome to the Dave Ramsey show\nOh thanks for taking my call sure what's up\nWell first of all I didn't know anything about you know three weeks ago when I was driving in her view on the radio but not like the ... with my mother putting her foot we're safe I Need money to go to work [laughter]\n\nBut I have five between me and my wife we have five four one K. is our age\nAnd I was wondering you know you might consider consolidating those ... former employees employers actually she and we were all their stuff over the guy I so I was just wondering what your thoughts were on\nEvery different four O. one K. will be a different IRA when you roll it\nBut you could have five I our age that we're all rollovers from previous\nFor a one case or previous IRAs and they could all be at one investment broker and one person won't watching over it with you\nUm and that's a viable uh so uh yeah I I Would get was one of those smart Mr burrows I was just talking about right before I picked up a call ... ... dot com and they can show you how to do those rollovers or shouldn't be any taxes involved if he'd roll over a traditional I write to a tradition or traditional four O. one K. to a traditional i._r._a.\nThere's no taxes on that if you do a direct transfer a roll over\nAnd I'm Don we're always recommend and I personally invest with recommendations that I use oddly enough\nA too that we put your in retirement and my retirement in four types of growth stocks mutual funds\nGross growth in income aggressive growth and international and spread the total of the nest egg across those four and a evenly twenty five percent H Kathy is with us in Wisconsin Hi Kathy how are you\nI'm good how are you there aren't any better than I deserve what's up [noise]\nUm my husband and I are looking for it\nHire within the next two to three beers um has been for sure now we have a third of our income author of our retirement savings where a financial advisor to current my and I'm Wondering what your opinion is and having more than my financial advisor\nWhy would you need more than ...\n[noise] I'm the only reason that I'm I I worry a little bit is that you'd have all of your your retirement savings whiny and\nIt's not with them they're just advising you know you are and where to put it mhm you're\nNot with them on their their the I mean it's like saying I'm you know I've\nGot four different cars and so I'm worried about the mechanic already own cars and the mechanic is just helping me manage all before cars\nIt doesn't change the mix the two of the cars one mechanic and do the guards were the other McKenna you've still got the same for cars and you're still have to manage all four of them so it makes sense\nYeah I Do I don't I don't know that now like the college\nGuy well it's not connecting them because it's perfect but uh it added up the ... the idea is this the investments that you have are not owned and operated by your financial advisor\nYou owned them your advisor is just telling you what to do with what things you own\nAnd so you could own mutual funds in three different mutual for different mutual funds\nAnd a half two of them was one advisor and two of them more than other advisor or you could have all four of them was one advisor in either case you're still own for mutual funds the exact same for by the way\nBecause you're you should be making the decision about where your money goes\nThe advisor teaches you and advisors you but you should be making the money the decision about where you're going to go you're not blindly turning over a block of money and go just doing whatever you want you know no that's just dangerous as crooked you need to know everything about where the money's going and understand everything about it\nAnd so if that's the case then the financial advisors simply the conduit\nAnd an information source and if you don't trust the information to shore so they shouldn't be your advisor\nThat's why you don't need to any one that their information aligns with your value system and what you are planning to do with your investments and then they walk you through that\nI have one and there's twenty five accounts with this one guy in my case and and so but the twenty five accounts or mine or not his and he just advisors me on\nWhether I Want but more and more I'm more than one open another one whether I Want\nTo um together we just talk through what these funds are doing with these investments are doing I understand what they're doing based on his advice and based on that then I make the decision of what's going to happen with my money and that's what I Want you doing and if you do it that way then there's no benefit whatsoever to having to financial advisors\nAnd the only reason you would do that is if you didn't trust one of them which means you shouldn't even have them\nAnd so that that's the idea that's what the analogy was trying to get to where I guess I missed it sorry about that Sean is with us in Tucson, Arizona Hi Shaun how are you\nThere God how can I oh ... oh I'm open to give you some numbers here real quick I'm fifty five thousand dollars in liquid cache of about forty monitor raw or\nAnd I make Seventy two down here I'm I'm traveling nurse\nAnd I sold it all everything except for my truck and my trailer and I'm traveling with my dog when we got cheap one two fifty a month so I'm going to post up in Tucson Waller search for land um\nWorm don't worry about our house I Would say I'm the baby step for\nAnd I'm not contribute to the raw or any kind of\nYou know you've got some money sitting there to buy a house in a above and beyond your emergency fund some of that family thousand casually wouldn't label and emergency bone and some of it we would label EMI okay than thirty of it we would label for your down payment right\nNow I'm paying cash\nOkay sorry of it we would like you've got that much money saved up you're going to buy a piece of land because you're going to stay there okay gosh I got the cash bark and a ... you're going to move the trailer onto it\nUsually yeah and then I'll build build the go home with or\nWithout actually you're you're traveling nurse days are over\n[laughter] yeah but the kicker is as I can land has so far out I could do this contract work um you know and definitely so that's good that's a good there's plenty of work here and just work more\nStrictly about the wind is you're you're not going to be you're not gonna be hooking up with this ... going off to a lot to do to New York today travelling nurse stuff while you get a piece of land over in Tucson\nNo no I'm not\nSo you are you are on were settling down you're settling down then I got the weather yeah you're right on track I think you're doing the right thing we shut the emergency phone aside we bought the land and um then it sounds like you're going to power money\nInto building for a while once you get the house bill for cash then we would start retirement investing very aggressively 'cause you'll probably be a little bit behind at that point and I would go from there so I'm a good question and interesting should Jewish and you put yourself in their\nHouse ... good ... and stuff which is our ... our thanks to change the\nChild doesn't want to associate producer Dave Ramsey roads [noise] [noise] Mm\nHi this is James child now we're down your radio station here you have questions [noise]\n\nStayed on Birmingham Christmas action is going on now why go from store to store searching for deal when we have tons of Christmas gas lines down to sixty percent off go to bed on Birmingham dot com Howard ... credit union\nNews radio nice sixty WBRC Birmingham at on line nine sixty got what you we are C. dot com\nI harsh radio see these two o'clock\n... says he's not trying to provide cover let me see Brady talked me but he does suggest the Saudi it should not be guilty until proven innocent and the case of a journalist suspected of being murdered after visiting the Saudi constantly in Turkey\nDid it on and when credit it as a student loan and we were under the impression through our attorney that it you know wouldn't matter whether we put it down or not I mean we still get include everything that I'm\nGetting a dollar matter if you're attorney thought it was a Sallie Mae your attorney was telling you that Sallie Mae's or not bankrupt ... that survives the bankruptcy if it's a private loan it's just like a personal line of credit is what it is and it completely was bankrupted\nOkay so do you put down chase student loan some amount on your matrix yeah I'm not worried about it it was a banker right it was my corrupted if you're bankrupt she was discharged yeah OK\nThan if someone comes up you go and says we yours the student loan you say no that was bankrupted a study originally chase and that was what was on the bankruptcy matrix and nobody can find you people but you know it's clear it should be clear it I don't know why your attorney would think that's not bankrupted I think they must have thought it was a Sallie Mae loan\nPossibly and like I said my husband's not very organized but um I mean we did say it was a private loan I Know that\nI don't know a ... a a private student loan is basically an secured long it's just the one that was used for college okay you just use like a personal I'm ready for college is the same thing a government insured Sallie Mae alone is not bankrupt ... a lot of credit is bankrupt but we usually the difference\nYeah I mean we have plenty of that we have plenty of Sally chair to pass\nSally Sally survive ... she's a resume how broad\nAnd so as you just can't get rid of our until you pay are often Victor\nBut the other stuff that's what you're saying I wouldn't worry about that right now I don't think it's going to come up if it does come up you don't have to go back and um this later I filed bankruptcy Thirty years ago and there are two years later American Express came at me again\nOn a similar situation that was listed on the thing but it wasn't they didn't get notified because of the way it was listed they don't have to be notified\nA federal law and for a court in bankruptcy court federal bankruptcy court and so I sent them bankruptcy papers and told them you know just remove the account don't report on the account anymore you're not allowed to report on it because they count on longer does this mean they can't keep reporting it as bad dead after a bankruptcy on your credit bureau report\nBankruptcy is the line in the sand is drawn the chapter seven clears it now the chapter seven will stay on their credit report for ten years\nBut the everything that caused it stops on that date and that's the way you look at it so good question thank you for calling in I'm Sorry you guys are facing that but it sounds like you're coming out the other side open phones a AAA eight to five five two to five you're jumping

move\nRight I don't care I mean the actual threat of blood statistically with what you've given me I wouldn't be that concerned about but if they're absolutely panicking every time the weather person

ravens a\n... Yes sir you also before they beat the put a beat down on the titans so yeah we have now are limited in during any more revenue ... prior to our titans [laughter]\nUnbelievable unbelievable really motivated him ... we had a good time Dave and uh I didn't pray for them to beat us but uh hey it was an amazing game is [laughter] I I Love the diet and but I Love the ravens too so hey the best one way or the flu\nWell that day the best football team play on that but yeah I don't think that our our guys would agree with that there was a bad day it was\nBut ah so you you've done that travels several times you've done some other NFL work as well so some of the other teams of cold and you and Chris all going to both been available to them and and helping them when you're meeting with those guys I'm ... and they're asking you money questions what's coming up\nYou know day this is the main thing that's coming up hey I'm young I'm twenty two years old I was only making maybe five thousand dollars a year my first check was Fifteen thousand and I'm gonna get another one next week it what do I do ... how ...\nHow do you keep from being overwhelmed\nOverwhelmed money with the pressure with family how do I tell my mom no should I tell my parents you know how do I tell my friends know um should I go by this car\nAlmost any names but there are some um rookies out there that I've had the opportunity to to mentor\nAnd they're you know they they they are going out there and buy some big things and other rookies are seeing that are saying well wait should I Do that and I'm like no no no do not do that and save your money live on a plan live on a budget\nAnd with the coolest thing was with the ravens I can say this was all of them sign up for every dollar ... a couple of weeks ago um and all of them get every dollar plus and so there was like ... how do we do this and it was surprising to see\nThat a lot of kids did not know how to budget\nEither twenty two year old Twenty one euros making nearly um on average sucking the low end is about Fifteen thousand dollars a game so it's about sixty thousand dollars a month to about two hundred thousand dollars a month and they didn't know how to budget that so I'm just excited because I'm seeing them saying hey I Want to help\nYou know these guys are Texan me they're they're calling me Kate how do I do this how do I invest what is Dave say about this you know it's just real cool to see these young players want to be good on the field but it also want to make the right decision it's off the field as well\n[noise] I was telling a leadership team this week that I was talking to the river passers we're with yesterday that you can't attribute\nA life skills book to someone just because we're successful in one area\nAnd so if you get a twenty six year old music star yeah um well they're good at music but what happens is we see them being very successful there even me I'm fifty eight I Know better I've worked for the NFL players for Twenty years off and on\nAnd um I Know this was a a a world class one half of one percent athlete\nUm but they are twenty two guests there and the rest of their life skills are not developed at the level that they're football skills are developed they are the size of a key uh yeah but that doesn't mean that their life skills have developed at the same level and you know so\nIt it's it's kind of weird I told somebody during one of these rookie camps as like you're looking at this guy the size of a key but when you look in his eyes you see a Thirteen year old yes um because he still is football skills are are the best on the planet\nI'm and his physical acumen his physical uh IQ the things you can do this body in mid error or it's just circus like it's amazing what those guys can do it but what happens is when you watch that skill level especially if you're just watching on TV\nWell I have that I I I Would think an unusual question but maybe not I have a twenty year old granddaughter she is living on her own now um she was working ... full time she had two jobs when she lived in the war\nBut uh [noise] had to move and so she's renting a room for hours away from the Denver area\nAnd she was only able to get part time she is still making her bell she die if she doesn't know about a random the I I've been trying to get her into a class they will at some point um and she does have a car payment cheese making that she's you know has room rental room she's making that\nUm but just barely yes you can imagine I'm working at a rally it's part time [laughter] so uh the problem is that she is making it but now she just found out she\nHas five not for it but I went to the teeth in her mouth all the cat to come out and we'll be Wellington that's out there why our\n... why did she move away from her income\nBecause um it was a dangerous area her house with being shot up her father's truck with blown up at ... at the house I'm it with a life threatening situation um she walked into the house twice that we've sat being and people were in there and I got\nThat burger I had jobs right\nShe had a job\nAnd she ... she moved so far away that she couldn't do that job when you can move out of the hood and move into a decent area and keep\nThe job\nWell she couldn't find a rental in the Denver area that which within her range\nShe felt yeah I Know yeah I mean do do do that in\nDenver at the very very expensive rental area and show she moved somebody offered her room over in a\nLot of faith ... additional shows so she got\nEnrolled into a mess because she overreacted and I'm jumped away from her income without an income set up on the other end and now she's dolled up well\nSee I have to tell you that the company she was working for a promise cherry they transfer to fulltime even there oh so when she when they had told her yeah we'll we'll give you a full time day or two we understand\nAnd so she got there and all of a sudden it with them right now it's part time it will working fulltime but\nNow it's like I got ya so she didn't she didn't move thinking she was having all that got you okay fulltime\nSo Bob are you asking should you help her with her with a with some situation\nOh I Would\nYeah I I Will help her as much as I can with her weight and keep the tuition um is there any other ideas I mean what this money if he ...\nYeah yeah yes jobs ...\n... you have to let her\nShe made the decision says he has to live with the consequences of that decision understand you want to help her as a granddaughter but at the same time as young millennials they need to start feeling the weight of their decisions if they make a bad decision\nMom and ground pirate grandparents should not come to help them out all the time I made one bad decision day my dad kicked me out the house\nAnd he said hey you're going to learn from that consequences because he knew that's the only way that I could really become the young man that I was going to become so\nWe brought a ... I wouldn't help or as much I agree with ... she needs to get multiple jobs she left a good job I have friends in Denver I understand you're saying is expensive but it's not that expensive to where she had to move that far away or for a good solid career path that she had going on\nYou know so until these people come in with a fulltime you work through those things you ... do you live or features you babysit your dog walk you do other stuff to backfill and and that'll get her where she can eat yeah and if you want to help her out with the wisdom teeth expense there's nothing wrong with that\nUm but I'm not going to go along with the idea that somewhere in this process she was forced to write\nAnd she's a victim of or circumstance or she overreacted or circumstance gay and uh when you tell me that that people cannot live in Denver because rent a shot or there's a whole lot of people living in Denver proving you wrong proving yeah and I'm a show you know you've got that ... you know\nShe just use that as an excuse and said I'm outta here I'm going to another city\nAnd did not however feet solid under but worked three four jobs and then the other thing comes in its full time job and you can drop a couple of those and maybe you can help her with wisdom to help her make to\nMake the ... the governor financially Ted is with us in Kansas City Hi Ted you're question for Anthony\nAnthony I'm [laughter] I have two daughters they're both doing very well Eighteen and night game for four one K. question either one want anything to do it\nYet they're most favors and givers um an spenders I'm the one is making a ton of money she's a welder she's on the road she saves money great and she's starting to do the four oh one K. is my question is should I advise her\nTo just go to a Edward Jones or someone or a or one of your piece or do her work ones and keep transferring them\nOr do you know for work was are matching matching her as well\nAnd and I that's the question is is you get the packets she'll she her to the well there is just she'll run she could be there for three months you could be there for six months so but they do all we send to the retirement pay for country may lead to get into that so I guess that would be the question if they are matching it would be worth the\nRolling it over every time he changes jobs\n... yeah that's that's exactly right up so and then in addition to that on the side that the two have stability peace in their lives are just a Roth IRA ratio with is more of us are pro and each time but you're saying she's working short statements and so she's going to end up with ten or Fifteen of these little for one by before one case someday\nShe could rights or should she each time she leaves it into their stable one she has\nYes yep yes always take your four one K. with you and do direct transfer roll over when you leave always do that but that they technically or won't each one will technically be a separate account number but you can still look at the whole\nYou know your whole portfolio in one place than from all the different rollovers stuff as you go alone so good question I Would question\nEighteen years old that's amazing that is amazing that debt free welder she's making anywhere between eighty two hundred thousand dollars a year and already starting to invest in two or four one K. they that sounds like an everyday millionaire to me I\nThink it is like this is talk of the dad every day and he is a very good well he's taught um well I mean they don't have debt and um and they're not afraid to go to you know do a trade or a man trades are paying a ... a day they're out there is a technical stuff and\nStuff like welding and in in the construction world and I kind of stuff the trades are paying big\nYou know you know Dave I just had the opportunity to go to the White House a couple of months ago and that's one thing that President Trump and his daughter talked about was we went to see that trade sealed active there so many jobs out there that are hiring and um I agree with Dave this this trait to go right now\nAnd will mean if if you don't do college and you can do that and if you do that you might not want it to college I mean it's it's you can go any direction you want to go these days there's a lot of opportunity out there and the job market is definitely a on your side if

know not hearing from your shows and\nThe and you don't need doing but they didn't actually need to finish one of these degrees and get your income\nOr you live in are you working fulltime\nArt crime okay why\nBecause you can hide behind your caring for your mother yeah\nWell we don't like it it kind of like they don't jak all night my son in law makes it tough\nYeah I can imagine but yeah I

what do you make a year\nOr about sixty right now good for you and how much debt do you have I have not look at you know your great grandfather's kid that's excellent [laughter] he's proud of that I'm sure I'm All right um how old are you I'm twenty three okay\nGood good okay typically what will occur in the next five years statistically speaking it's not a requirement is certainly not a law it's just an observation of the way life unfolds or you'll get married and buy a house typically okay you might not you don't have to like I said it's not required\nI'm not saying that but the point of that being those are two major events and uh both of them will require money\nAnd so we need to keep that in mind what we're doing this we would always tell you to have an emergency fund of three to six months of expenses so I Want you to have brown Fifteen thousand bucks or so set aside for that um\nIf you want to buy a home and pay cash for it at this stage an inexpensive home a that's not a bad thing uh I I I Would expect that when you get married you probably wouldn't move again\nAnd that's not unusual it's not bad it's just you kind of expect that\nSo I'm just generally after you get married you find out you bought their own home [laughter]\nYeah I I'm anxious to buy a home my older brother is buying a home at this point but I just don't think it's right for me with you know with how accessible moving as for me and my field I Am a nurse I'm you know critical of moving anywhere\nAnd you don't you don't have to then that's cool yeah there is not my point is there's no rush in\nI'm personally with you I think it'd be cool if you wait three years to buy your place in kind of quote settling on or whatever number of years and so once you've got your emergency phone in place and you're dead free then there's really nothing left to do with this money except three things which is what you should always do with money\nOr you should enjoy some of it I'm a small portion of it not much you make enough with no debt to enjoy your salary\nOr you should give some of any money that you have and you should um invest some of it and so the majority of this money and if I'm In your shoes is going to be invested and uh the ... the portion that you know you're going to leave alone you're pretty comfortable that you're going to leave alone at least five years\nI'm just going to buy some good mutual funds with it I invest in four types of mutual funds in my retirement and in my long term investing which is five years or longer and growth growth in income aggressive growth and international\nI probably would set\nA hundred ... a hundred and fifty of this in something or a little more conservative than that that is growing some but I'm probably going to pull that money out in the next five years and buy a house with it\nAnd um you know something along those lines again it's not a requirement and I would make sure I was settled in you liked the um\nThe flexibility that you've got now and I think that's a bad I mean I think that's a good thing uh I think you're on hold on to that flexibility for a while I don't want to look up and find your thirty five years old and still having not bought a home\nOr in especially in your situation 'cause you're in such a great situation so I Would give some I Would enjoy swimming I Would invest the majority of it\nAh some of it towards a home in the future maybe just a simple on index fund and asking the five hundred no load and there's no commission just let it grow um it is going to go it's going to follow the market whatever the market does and then the rest of it I Would invest longer term than that just to build wealth with\nIf you start at your age say with 'em\nAround two hundred thousand of this and you invest it you know and it sits there for forty years in grows a stock market rates of return which has been eleven point eight percent since it started ... you're going to be so wealthy is going to be unbelievable and it's it's a wonderful way to\nUm honor your great grandfather's legacy ... sit down with a smart rushed her pro is what I Would tell you to do ... dot com it'll drop down a list of the smart Mr pros in your area when you fill in your stuff you pick out one you like or two or three and interview them I don't care\nAnd go from there and sit down with someone and start to learn about mutual funds how they work what they are how to invest\nAnd uh I think it's good to have two buckets of investing here one with a five year mindset for buying a home and one where the forty or mindset for just becoming on believe a blue wonderfully wealthy\nA art Ashton is with us from Charlotte North Carolina Hi Ashton how are you\nI'm doing great how are you\nBetter than I deserve how can I help\nWell I'm I just recently about three months ago started to every dollar at love it I mean with a smart pro investor this week good a from a personal finances are all great but my question isn't on the individual ... thing\nIt is on the church or a non profit out of things I was curious if and your opinion or prospective ... are there a way for churches and nonprofits to and for them financially\nWell some people call that being in doubt ah we're a university is typically a situation where you would see that happen um and that's where there's a large enough sum of money that the investment return off of that account\nSo you out of ten million dollar endowment that had built up and that money is invested in the ... the returns off at ten million dollars will operate the thing in perpetuation\nAnd so they limit the nest egg causes of the nonprofit to live in perpetuation off of that are you most often see that in a um\nA formal large a\nNonprofit or in where you really see a lot is in a university\nOr were there in ... or even a professorship there's enough money in this one account that the income is providing is paying the salary of a professor in whatever field okay and someone just about like they wanted to make sure that university was able to\nUh pay that professor in perpetuation and going forward and that kind of a thing in the local church I almost never see that\nI'm a ... where the evangelical world okay the magical church now ... says ... has a lot of assets\nAre the Vatican is very wealthy and show that's a different a different mindset on it but in evangelicalism the vast majority of the time those of us sitting on that church border that elder board which I've done many times would say the investment is not\nTo be made in um\nIn earthly investments but instead and\nEnd up people and causing people to make Christ and grow and crushed and that that that's the investments that we want to make and so the only actual wealth is retained as the paid for properties that the thing operates fan or the awesome retained earnings that are sitting there are some savings just to make sure that there's an operational\nBuffer but um but in terms of building an actual in down in that setting find only hope that helps answering questions that both of\nOf the day Ramsey showing the bugs will be back with you know in the meantime remember there's
