I mean I I ... I don't tell people to buy a home when they're in debt okay so if you call me out of time I was told you ought to buy but this house is not like you know if you call me up you're making thirty eight hundred dollars your house payments Fifteen hundred dollars and now we got a problem\nI'm going to put that house on the market but your house payment is way less than a fourth of your take on pay\nAnd so you're fine I mean it's really not your problem I think you guys are just starting to budget and uh the emotional weight of\nA a of dealing with the medical situation you're facing and when you're with your baby I mean when you're babies' heart and it just that's just it just wears you down you know it just makes you human her makes you a good daddy and a good mommy\nBut according to the truth is it makes it kind of hard to see past ah I'm just looking at the ... numbers right now I don't ... I mean I I feel for you guys are pray for you but I don't have the emotional weight that you guys have got facing the stuff you face every day dealing with this situation you know show\nThat's just very real a ... but but the math actually you know thirty eight hundred bucks minus nine hundred dollars minus a eight hundred dollars for a house payment or you know minus ... minus ... minus water down to leave a lot of ...\nMhm but you could pay your payments on everything doing that and then you could pick up your overtime and start making some headway on some of these deaths and cleaning them often as they these little that's clean all these credit cards outstanding medical bills in student loans clean off\nYou know over the next year and a half two years you're going to start having a little bit of wiggle room and you guys will keep moving forward and head but I I think that you're just\nYou know you're just feeling the weight of all of this and it's kind of cloudy and it's this is doable though where you are is doable I I think you can pull it off no I Would not sell your house or would not about it because I don't ... to buy a house where we got that\nBut it's your house is not like when I hear those numbers on my like what are you crazy none of that so there none of it you're you're it's very very reasonable\nFor your situation now would it help if you earn an extra thousand bucks a month you're dead gum rotted would clean this mess up faster two thousand bucks a month even faster so are you have you got a couple of years are really hard work and lots of overtime inside jobs ahead of you yup you sure do\nAre you guys gonna be taking a bunch of fans who vacations new you've got a bunch of that\nYou're cleaning it up a ... reality but hold on I'll have Kelly pick up we're going to get your copy of the total money make over book and give it to ya and help get you started and if you need some more help you call me I'll help you in any way I can\nI'm Sorry you guys are facing all these challenges but I think you're up for it I think you can do the math makes sense to me that you're giving me unless there's something we left out of this equation so thank you for the call Josh is with us in Los Angeles Hi Josh how are you\nGood how are you doing better than I deserve what's up\n[noise] not too much I've got a question for you on baby steps which it pay off my house early [noise] um [noise] I don't have any other debt inside my house I have a six month emergency fun\nUm but I kinda did all your stuff out of order because I've never really liked that but anyway um [noise] I have a hundred and sixty four thousand dollars less pay off my house\nBut I also have about a hundred thousand dollars invested in mutual funds and stuff like that and I'm curious\nWould it be wiser to um take a hundred thousand dollars out of my personal investment put that all towards the house and then just pay off the remaining sixty four thousand or should I leave that money invested and the money that I have every month just accelerate payment from my house\n... what's your household income\nUh probably about a hundred and fifty thousand\nSo you could be like debt free and when you were if you did the\n\nUh um yeah I'd be done by the end of next year I'm sure if I if I took the hundred thousand for the court house\nIf your house was paid for and you didn't have any money and investments would you borrow a hundred thousand on your home to putting investments\nKnow same thing in\nUm I don't follow okay well\nI mean if you have a hundred thousand dollars in an investment and you take it out of the investment in order to put in and pay off your home\nThat's the same thing in reverse if you didn't do that it's the same thing is if you if you leave it in the investment it's the same thing is borrowing own your home to invest isn't it got it yeah\nOkay so it's a balance sheet equation meaning that balance sheet is where you list your assets on one side of the page or liabilities on the other side of the page\nAnd right and you can switch them back and forth by borrowing money meaning if you were sitting there with no investments paid for house you could you could borrow money and put you know money you drop dead over there on that one side of the page but on the other side of the ... now you'd have an investment right\nAnd all I'm doing is on doing that by asking the question in reverse though it's a bit of a trick I kind of ... ah the trick is that it makes you think not just with your head but also with your heart\nAnd I always like to think of when my my head is where I Do math in my heart for a measure risk\nAnd your real risk averse you hate that like I Do and so the idea of borrowing on a paid for house chagrin investment is absurd and your mind yeah I mean you immediately\nReacted but that's a heart things we that's where that's at risk bart that ... that you're measuring this cause you to do that you didn't stop and do math you went you recoiled and went crazy in\nYour mind right you know and that that but and and start by asking it in reverse so all of that to say yes I built a hundred grand at it in a heartbeat I assume this was not in a retirement account no penalties right\n[noise] [noise] uh no that that hundred thousand is just her slow in bed right yeah and the only thing is I mean you're talking about the head and the heart just with\nThe mathematics of it ... if you leave ... by if you put risk in the mathematics of it and it changes the mathematics and so and\nAnd so your heart is actually correct your heart is helping you do a complete measured amount\nAnd so yes I'd take the money out of their house I'll be done for in a year she's actually what I Do [noise]\nGuy just Blake Johnson

kept it simple um in our marriage with are buying we kept everything kind of minimalist steak mhm um if it broke we fixed it and\nThen it went and bought another one um you know just try not to be McCune materialistic ... we didn't need to buy a lot of clothes or anything like that\nAnd okay so that's a big thing keeping costs down yeah that's what allows you to do this what other points do you have for getting\nOut of that oil a\nDefinitely you know we live in the age of of excuses you know everybody has an excuse for something and I got a lot of\nYeah I'm just a you know don't make any excuses we've heard a million times you know oh well if we major income we could get edited or if we didn't have kids we could get edited the really anybody can do it I\nMean if people do it of all all strike down here you know\nVery cool yeah that's good that's a good point no excuses just get after it you're going to you hey that's your deal so do you deal you know whatever your deal is do

in to his podcast returns burden that'll\nKeep you on the track to now becoming millionaires and outrageously generous along the way okay thank you well done YouTube Randy and Jennifer\nI take home about five hey everything like that take out\nSo sixty thousand is your take home so that means you're probably making Seventy five to eighty give or take okay when you put your twenty five percent tax bracket right\nNow if you were to cash out the Seventeen thousand out of your savings out of your retirement the government is going to charge you a ten percent penalty wash your twenty five percent tax rate\nSo you're going to get kicked in the teeth to the tune of thirty five percent so it's kind of like\nSaying hey Dave I Want to borrow money at thirty five percent interest to pay off my student loan answer would be and I\nKnow you see what I'm saying hey they're laid out\nThe good news is you won the argument the bad news is you both have to read the book again [laughter]\nLA thanks for the call Rick Carruthers ranks in Fort Lauderdale Florida Hi Rick how're you\nGuys are how are you better than others or what's up\nI'm just calling I bought a product I have a I bought a while back all the Wii U L\nA very universal life yes\nYes sir Yes sir I'm and I'm not really sure what to do with it I'm not I know I'm not a fan of it but again even when I talk my eyes on the ins and outs of it I used to walk away confused and not sure what to do with it\nBut that's because that is one of the techniques they used to get people to keep it [laughter] even the dark and feed them little neuro [laughter] oh mushroom process or keep them in the dark for the manure tried to grow mushrooms um [laughter] so\nAh ... the deal is is it's a cash value life insurance policy there are three types her whole life universal variable universal life and just verbal life and a universe alive or variable universal life and the variable universal sometimes has a mutual fund selection the inside of it there's years\nYes or no yeah okay and so what happens is though of course\nThat you you know you're not a fan of it 'cause you're not seeing good returns\n[noise] no it's about eight percent returns but all the fees and built into it I think that it if not more yeah\nYeah well and usually if you're in a good mutual fund that's making ten or twelve you'll net somewhere in the seven range or after fees\nWhich if you're just bought the mutual fund you might have made ten or twelve in your case you're making hay and their fees are getting your down probably in the four range actually will be my guess usually the ... are going to eat four to five roughly in those things\nAnd so instead of buying a mutual fund directly you're buying it through the stupid policy and they're kicking in the tapes to the tune of another four or five percent that's when it comes down to that's problem number one problem number two is the ... the life insurance portion of it is what's called an A R T an annual adjustable term\nAnd uh the cheapest term insurance you can buy is term insurance for one year based on you\nPage that year and then it adjusts up every year as you get older okay that's the cheapest term policy by the year for one year it's not the cheapest way to buy it over ten years or Twenty years okay but you know if you buy just based on your age this year\nSo you're paying in X number of dollars\nSome of it is going to buy the life insurance and some of those going to the investment that we've already ascertain just doing poorly okay less and less every year is going to the investment more and more is going to the insurance because your insurance costs just increasing every year because they are the have you noticed that as well\n[noise] I have not okay\nAnd uh because ... and so what we have always suggested that I don't sell any of this I don't give a crap but here's the math on it I have found that a Fifteen to twenty year level term policy\nIn and gives you less expensive term insurance and when you invest the money directly into the mutual fund you don't have the extra fees and you get a better net of fees return\nThat makes sense and plus when you die with the Wii U L they're going to pay the face and keep your investment that's the worst part of it so it's a horrible plan when you die\nBut uh it's just really bad while you're alive and it gets really worse when you die so what I Would suggest you do is get the proper amount of term insurance in place and then drop this garbage into your investing somewhere else does that make sense\nIt does I think the reason I haven't done that yet because of the surrender charges\nWell you're you've already bought that I mean you're just did that just got ripped and this also means you're probably need a new financial advisor because I think I think you have a life insurance salesman this calling himself a financial advisor it's certainly possible\n[laughter] so it sounds a lot anyway it doesn't sound like most of the people in the mutual fund world don't sell this crap\nI say that they get on the actual funds and some of them sell term insurance too but most of them don't sell this crap because nobody believes in the garbage except the life insurance people nobody anymore nobody there's no one in the financial arena in the financial spaces as by whole live life insurance or by cash value in terms of any kind of their little one out there\nThere are just the cost of math is just so horrible and you figured that\nPart out but this guy's doing smoke and mirrors and hadn't a pea under shell and keeping you confused as to teaching you\n'cause he knows if you've ever understood at that you drop it and him to probably\nSo I'm thinking you need a new advisor and

I'm sure ... team can help you with that and getting rid of those and then the cars how much do you owe on your cars\n[noise] um we have a cat right now that's forty five Taliban and an ... mile and your household income as what I'm way I had to cross a one year you know\nGet rid of both of them and just get you to be years from now while you get this mess cleaned up it's not a forever car\nIt it's just a short period of time but if you can ... the huge amount of money you got going out the door on cars and the huge amount of last year taking every day and appreciation of how fast are going down in value is just destroying you guys so I Would just moved down to like to five\nThousand dollar cars and you\nKnow even if you got a little bit on those and you've got a little bit on where you were upside down finance it over to credit union or something will cover their mouth that you're in the hole is still a lot less debt than you've got now and you stop the bleeding\n[noise] yeah I I guess I'm not exactly sure how to go about doing that you know a little\nWhile here and we walk you through it okay let's take the thirty two thousand dollar car that's the dead on the car correct\nYeah unless pretend that when you look that car up on the Kelley Blue book that you can private cell that car for um like twenty eight thousand which will be like four thousand in the whole\nThing now where do we get to four thousand well you obviously don't have any money you're broke right so you're going to either borrow that from your local credit union or your bank\nAnd you'll be four thousand dollars in debt instead of twenty eight there should have thirty two thousand dollars and that\nSo that's huge progress right there okay and the and then let's say that I come up to buy the car I hand you a check for twenty eight thousand you put the four thousand you borrowed from the credit union with it and pay the car off that get you the title to give to me the buyer\nMy okay and that's how you do it now who are your lungs with on the cars\nWent after the credit union and want to throw out\nOkay the allied deal will will work just like I talked about just now the credit union you may be able to sit down with them\nAnd convince them by sitting in person in the manager's office only so it's not a telephone conversation but you may try to say hey look this is how far we are upside down on this car which means that you have a partially secured loan\nYou have alone is secured by this much the value of the car the rest of this one was an an secured loan right you\nUnderstand what I'm saying yeah OK then the uh\nAnd so Mr manager all we're asking you to do is to admit that it's an secured by giving us an inch beard loan for the amount that you're there were in the whole I Want to sell the car and get out of this debt okay\nAnd then you got a five thousand dollar loan and credit unions whatever the differences are you know at the credit union instead of a forty five thousand dollar whatever the word whatever the numbers work out to be but I Would dump both of these cars get into some very very cheap cars for a period of time while you clean this mess up and it's going to take you a couple of years to clean this mess up\nOh yeah but five years from now you'll be driving anything you want to drive you pay cash for it\nAnd it's not like help and\nIt is not open I mean you you can do it mathematically if you just take the steps and sacrifice to get there but you've got to amputate I you know these cars I mean you've got thousand dollars a month car payments are more probably twelve hundred and um you know it's just it's choking you to death here to feel so much more free when you get rid of those\nStupid vehicles and then later on get you whatever you want your drive like no one else or later you can drive like no one else she live like no one else later you can live and give like no one else ... is with us in San Antonio I'm Betty Lou how are you\nCan you hear me now yes ma'am how can I help okay cool\nI Am I was telling your comrade that I thought like on the poster child that fixing too far away that financial decisions and not by a semi retirement and the reason I'm calling because I I Am working full time on sixty two and I\nWant to find out how to leverage my situation my income by saving cetera and I have found that to ensure at least a reasonably comfortable retire at which I plan on land about eight years\nShould and and what do you like to know how much do you make I may\nSixty six thousand a year good no matter how much that do you have\nI add twenty thousand and stay on the line and I am twenty eight hundred do online vehicle which our pay off by\nMhm okay so twenty two twenty three thousand dollars in debt making sixty six that's good All right and how much money do you have saved not counting retirement\nOkay so I have the government's version of borrowing hey which is called ... and I'm sure you're familiar with it and I have about eleven thousand in it and I was\nYou have any money other than that saved\nI have a thousand dollar fine\nOkay good All right cool while we stop adding to the tea SP temporarily\nYes I I I well I took it down to one percent stop\nTemporarily and could concentrate on the twenty three thousand dollars worth of debt with al right and then you've got squeeze every dollar out because when you don't have any payments then you have control of your most powerful wealth building too\nWhich is your income right now it's all going on student loans car payments so we get rid of the car payment you're registered lump island we build an emergency fund raising the thousand dollar up to a three to six months of expenses emergency fund baby step three and then maybe step for is saving Fifteen Percent of your income into retirement\nAnd um you know where will that leave you is the next question so we'd like sixty six thousand dollars\nLet's just pretend for a second and Fifteen Percent of that is Ninety nine hundred ... says eight hundred bucks a month\nGive or take nine hundred bucks a month something like that going into retirement um and we start with eleven thousand living out in putting this on the calculators one mumbling All right when the calculator and we're going to do this for say\nI'm I'll just put ten years in there for the phone I Would just to see what it does\nShe would kind of money we end up with here [noise] that would be about a quarter million dollars that you would have a retirement and you would be Seventy two\nAt that point um and that's not counting any kind of match from the government a lot of most of the ts but you don't have a match and that's not counting any raises you get during the next ten years while you're working but if your debt free and bother in your house will be paid off too by the way\nUm and so if your debt free one hundred percent and you have two to three hundred thousand dollar sitting there\nYou're going to make it I'd like to have you have a lot more but it's not as a whole lot tougher piece from Social Security is your only way to retire\nUm and you certainly don't have to buy
