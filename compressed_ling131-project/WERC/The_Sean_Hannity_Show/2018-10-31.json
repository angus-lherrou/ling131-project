... or so it looks like you've got about a million and in mutual funds right right okay very cool how old are you\n[noise] sixty three this week\nAnd graduations happy birthday shown how much of this one point for millionaires there because you inherited money\nWell claim forty my mother left me forty thousand\nSo you're not a millionaire because of inherent in ... no no [laughter] I Love it\nAnd Paul do you remember your worst didn't come here and your best income year\nBest income you're all started with the the cars that was the most recent that was the last year before I retired I was at a hundred and Ninety thousand okay I'm In the ... the worst shows come on the other end of the works ...\nI'll say the year before I went in the air force I think I made about a thousand\nOkay and\nAnd looking at that what you what was your career before you retired\n\nI was a a sport specialist for a fortune ... company\nOkay and did you attend college not OK and\nLooking at this did you use any debt outside of a mortgage to help you reach millionaire status\nOkay and as a household do you do any giving of naturally what kind of giving do you do\nSpecifically if it were tied in with a charitable groups and sometimes it's a mixture of cash sometimes ... it's a actual the effort or work where what do\nYou guys are going to write and show 'em\nWhat advice would you give to the twenty five year old version of use is listening right now Ken this still be done and if so what do you do to get there\nI Would definitely can be done I retired I I just for whatever reason I may want to pick up a buck church work to do everywhere\nAnd when I say to anybody today is um our school I'd be afraid to work show up on time but most importantly what worked for me I didn't have the paper is I always called I didn't have the the shoot 'em ups are kind of ... in fear that but what I did instead as I look for opportunities\nSo when the door open not put my foot in 'em and and that's the way I I kind of scratch and called and got my way from two thousand do harm Nineteen uh\nHow old were you when you started investing in mutual funds\nI was a twenty seven years old\nWhat made you do that\n[laughter] [noise] and that was the year I think I heard you mentioned this on the show a ... stocks went on sale\nAnd our company at the time I started doing the matching funds and I just thought it was a no brainer to at least capture the ... percent were not you know home a couple of years later I looked at it I had tens of thousands of dollars all of a sudden we were kind of cool\n[laughter] that's a nice thing to wake up to brother a congratulations very proud of you sir very well done interesting mix to day all day uh only two college graduates out of the whole bunch today that's exactly right most of the millionaires we studied in the millionaire study from your book the everyday millionaires\nDid graduate from college most of them did not graduate from prestige colleges throwing Seventy three percent I Believe it wasn't didn't not graduated from a prestigious college went to a state school but most of them did I have a four year degree today\nOn the today show most of them did not that's right I mean or or a couple of associate's degrees and a couple of a high school graduates one with a GED at age thirty\nYeah it's amazing a day at the age is that we're looking at we got from forty three fifty sixty fifty seven forty to sixty three that\nWas today yeah all today you know\nSo we're average age we found in the study was fifty to two years old you know that the average of all of them that's right of the ten thousand that we talk to\nBut they are amazing thing is is we've got also two to three of them started investing in their twenties so they got that first job got intentional early\nThey recognize the match that's right orange scared of the mutual funds and were scared of the stock market and as a matter of fact Paul was the opposite he jumped in when the market was down that's where I think it out hey it's down this time to get in\nWell because he ... he had listened to you explain it but it's on sale and now he hadn't back then [laughter] he said that's ... that's when ... when I got that right yeah you know the other one we had the one lady bed learn what not to do from watching her parents who ended up having to go down the path to bankruptcy you know\nAnd so this wisdom Dave this awareness this gaining the right kinds of information using the right tools that are out there for one k.'s and for what three bees\nSo that typical millionaires not uh\nNo they're not an athlete but they're not an artist they're not an actor is a ... a ton of money isn't inherit their money and the typical million or does not have a four point oh GPA\nIn other words there every day people people in plain sight that's right and uh\nThey just made the decision that was their actions that created it not some in eight\nLightning strike or a you know lightning in a bottle and all this shit oh you got to be Brad Paisley Peyton Manning to be a millionaire not true matter of fact a famous millionaires are less than one percent of the millionaires are that are out there\nUm and ... you know the words you don't have to be rich and famous so you know when we hear people say the only way out of my neighborhood is\nA a a basketball it that's all true that's right it is a way out right but it's not the only way out as a matter of fact it's not the typical way out if you want to be a typical everyday millionaire\nAnd that kind of comes down to what constellation Russia and a quarter an off color because we both just fell in love with a lady but they're saying doesn't matter where you come from it matters where you're going that's right\nAnd you make the decision to ... you know do they use for one case stay out of debt live on less than you might several of them today talked about work ethic\nYeah I mean I'm sitting here thinking about Carlos who was with KFC for over forty years one drop starting out washing dishes Dave one company no one comedy washing dishes so here he is with us back of this as we've probably in their scrubbing\nHave no idea his work ethic his focus was going to put him on a path three million dollar three million dollars but the the highest network millionaire we talked\nTo today did not get his GED until he was thirty doesn't matter where you're coming from a medical you're going to cut throaty say should study the next job in front of you I like I learned that job\nUm well I mean typically a Christian school is a private school and there's going to be more expensive and then the question you've got to say is if we go that route it pays off our home in\nSeven years if we go the other route it pays off our home in three years is it worth four more years or whatever the number is you just run your numbers out I just made those up okay but in other words this is going to delay the mortgage being paid off if you go the more expensive school route in order to get that world view\nWhich is fine and um now I I Will tell you having educated a paid for the education for three kids that are now adults\nAnd having participated in this discussion a multitude of times with friends that are Christians and and we are obviously to 'em\nThat you need to be very careful if you're going to invest in a a a a private Christian school that they are actually\nImplementing that belief system\nThere are some that have a Christian heritage that are no more matching with my value system that fly to the moon\n[laughter] just ... they once had something that was Christian and on and sometimes they still holding themselves out as Christian schools but the values that they're tenured professors are bringing into the classroom at nothing to do with the values of miles hold\nAnd so if I'm going to do that I might have if I won't be on the enemy territory I might as well know that I'm On the enemy territory\nInstead of a wolf in sheep's clothing kind of thing so if you're going to invest make sure you're getting what you're attempting to get here I'm not saying that can't be done and can be done there are great Christian schools that do a great job of a quality education with\nThe quality value system but you just gotta make sure you can't just assume because such and such was a Baptist school or such and such with Presbyterian but that might have been many years ago and the and you know they've got that in their heritage but there are no more than fly to the moon anymore um\nAnd so you know that then you just pay for an expensive school\nWith a questionable quality you know so they're not the second part of the equation as this and this is not the challenge you it's just a kid help you with your critical thinking and you decide which one you want to do in the process my three kids and sharing and I all went to University of Tennessee\nA public state school\nWhich there is some bizarre stupid but stuff that happens on the campus\n[laughter] okay I mean crazy and some of those professors are proof tenure should not be there you know I mean there is some nut burgers running around over there at my university campus okay and I love University of Tennessee but there's some stuff happening over there that just make your hair colonel you know so my kids went there though\nBut here's the thing we figured out that our kids spiritual walk was not based on what happened at school it was based on what happened at home okay\nAnd so our kids plugged into young life while they were in a public university setting and they already had their values and backbone and apologetic established\nBecause of how they were raised inside the randomly house so they were equipped to go into\nThat environment and not quote unquote lose their salvation in the process now I'm not saying no Ramsey kid ever did anything stupid I can promise you randomly kids Ramsey are pretty much known for having done some stupid at one time [laughter] but but uh but but you know I I you know you can do that in a Christian school too you know that right\nMhm right yeah right off campus was a bar\n[laughter] every one of those and so you can go get do you can go get just as drunk at a Christian schools you can in their state schools all that to say I I don't eat there is no bubble that protects them like your home does\nThe preparation you give them at your kitchen table is their insurance policy it's their fire insurance policy it's not you\nKnow the name of the door of the school but that's not to say you should never do of course go I think it's perfectly fine as long as you pay cash for it\nAnd you're willing to say we're going to be off the mortgage a little slower because of that and how would investigate and make sure that the values are actually taught in the classroom I put my kids in a private Christian school for two years when they were in uh elementary school and I found that some of the teaching they were\nDoing over there and I'm like well this is useless is complete waste of money\nCrazy as as a mainstream I mean you know so I figured out it's going to be made that does this this was the ...\n\nOne question I get asked all the time is do I need life insurance listen the whole point of life insurance is to replace your income for someone who counts on you so if you have a spouse or you have kids yes you need term life insurance is the only way to protect them until you're out of debt and build up your wealth\nOnly

keep paying\nDental insurance is one of the most easy insurance is to figure out that they're charging you more than you are getting\nUm we've had dental insurance proposed to us as a a a employee benefits several times and it's really simple when you add up what you pay for it in a year you would never spend that much on dentistry it just doesn't work out it's one of those things you should self insure through\nTell you that that they can't do that um\nThat they all obviously all believe that they can and then just ask them to show you\nThe question Alex is with us from Charlotte North

piece followers jump in it's called the Ramsey the Ramsey baby steps community the Ramsey baby steps community will let you joined if you want jump over their own Facebook lots of interaction or over a hundred thousand folks in there talking all the time\nOr should we Heather says take out out from that community take out our retirement to pay off our car which still have some left for thirty one years old no\nWe never cash out retirement to pay off a debt unless it's to avoid bankruptcy or a foreclosure you're not facing either one of those where you would have mentioned that\nYou just want your car paid off here's the problem you pull money out of a four one K. they charge you a ten percent penalty plus your tax rate so if you're on the twenty two percent tax bracket as an example in the year twenty Eighteen [noise]\nThat would be a thirty two percent hit on your money so that's the equivalent of saying Dave I Want to borrow money at thirty two percent interest to pay off my car\nAnd the answer would be no that's stupid and so don't cash route retirement no that stupid don't do that unless it's just unless your backs against the wall and you can't breathe which case maybe you need to sell the car actually that were the case not\nStill not cash out the retirement but if you're looking down the lens of some kind of a horrible financial situation that would be the only time I would use some retirement considering how hard the government punches you in the face for doing this Christopher is in Los Angeles high CRISPR welcome to the Dave Ramsey show\nThey have live better than I deserve sir how 'bout you\nGet the same ... thank you well I'm a Twenty one year olds graduating in may with a business degree with no debt of any kind thing for you and this show\nWay

opportunities available\nBut my question to you are what skills should I developed to become an invaluable in the marketplace as possible and then the second question is what resources should I use given that relocating to Colorado and I'm interested in financial advisor\nMm okay um well financial devising my take you a little while coming straight out of school\nUm you know there's not a lot of people don't want to sit at the desk with a Twenty one year old telling them how to put their money aside just to be very blond hair and I mean you could be an actual you could be a bona fide genius and you'd still have that trouble\nBecause people just looking for um a a little different thing but there there's a way that there's a process to work into that and there's a lot of things around that industry\nYou could do as well that would lead you in that my friend Ken Coleman RMC personality that does a show on extreme on career says use the proximity principal he calls its meaning get in the proximity of\nWhat you want to do and it will legions towards doing that so that you know by the time you're twenty five twenty six year in the rocking and rolling and\nYou know really doing that but in in the meantime what you're doing is you just get in the ... in the business around the business and that kind of a thing so the way to do that is just are contacting some of those companies and go hey I Want to come in there and make copies and ah\nHelp you with your database and I want to use you know I I Want to help you with analysis anything I can do uh to get my foot in the door and I'm going to make myself so valuable that you can't afford to think about getting rid of me\nAnd just start getting in and doing that a jump on him tens website he has a great system there\nAre on how to put together a a resume that actually works and it works as you get in contact with people not just\nAnd make it work Joe's with us in Minneapolis just got home from Minneapolis Joe how are ya\nMan are you\nBetter than I deserve we loved our trip up there how can I help today\nAre you guys that's a good whether you're lucky [laughter] we did we did and I remember\nFor one quick question I'm as a kid free and step three as well and um my company Matt you're on a four one K. on an annual basis rather than on a project\nAnd however we're not employed with the company by the time they pay it out on an annual basis we don't match at all in all of my question is am I better off investing in other areas rather than the four oh one K. if if I don't see myself that company ...\nWell I mean if you're going to see there be there for this year\nI Would through the end of the year each year I Would continue to do that you want to get the match matches the best route but I mean you're going to know 'em you're not going to come home one morning and decided not to be there right this was going to be a planned ... correct\nWell this will be very clear and well you know fortunately at times but\nDo you think they might let you off okay ... okay so what ... what what if you said or in the year twenty Nineteen coming up you're getting ready to start your four O. one K. and you know you'll get the match or a you know in December because December she you know make that one but\nBy the next year what would you say the chances are you're they're fifty\nFifty Ninety ten what\nI'd say probably fifty fifty sixty forty okay so I'm not very good\nWhat do you do for a living I'm account manager okay All right um\nI probably would still do it okay because you're not going to that you're not going to lose money you're just not going to get the match do they have a Ross four one K.\nAnd they do then that makes it a no brainer do the raw because of rough four O. one K. we'll give you the exact same thing as a Roth IRA but you might get the match if you're there\nAnd so definitely do their off and do it there and then if you're not there you didn't lose anything as long as you picked good mutual funds in there and you're spread across the four types of mutual funds that we tell you to use which are grows growth in income\nAggressive growth and international and put a force in each of those um pick good mutual funds with long track records and do the raw you should always be rough four one K. any way but in this case it's like double the essential if you let's say you\nDo the rock and ... you get fired November next year and you don't get the match you didn't lose anything you just take that rock and roll it out to a rough IRA and you'll have no taxes and you move on with your next career and everything will be fine John is with us in Chicago Hi John welcome to the Dave Ramsey show\nThank you Dave how're you doing today\nBetter than I deserve what's up in

membership\nMoney and it certainly includes budgeting and includes the every dollar\nThat as much as you get back\nThis was the day Ramsey show [noise]\n\n\nLet me tell you a story about two families

their budgets and smarter decisions with money\nThey have dreams and plans and the only real differences that one family has the right amount of term life insurance and the other doesn't big

I get on the same page and we never enough money ... really cool\nFive or six years mhm um\nIt was probably may this year I bought a two thousand Eighteen foreigner and to upgrade it package so it was like forty one thousand we put eleven thousand down with\nA trade in and everything I'm about thirty five thousand on it together we have about twenty thousand and saving ... uh she\nEssentially what I got from her that she kind of wants to skip the baby step three that she doesn't have any other day that there are only ... the foreigner in the house ... um she got a wife gets the baby step three to\nPrepare to get out and so that would put her paying you know the normal mortgage and he um gets that all my bills that we have and fading everything else until she gets out there she's still she teaches dance on the side as well so she's got additional link or what's your question um\nI wanted to know if we should tackle this foreigner together\nMhm and get this thirty five thousand out of the way or if you think that we just keep going about it the way that we are going to let her continued to save and then we tackled a foreigner and that eventually when she\nThink you're running your natural tension that occurs when you're trying to\nAct like you're married but you're not you're ... you're vacillating back and forth between acting like a married couple are acting like roommates\nAnd and your ... built her bills but we did this and we did that and yeah under in a legal sense from ... from a law perspective there's not a week\nYeah you have a roommate from ... from the perspective of the law you see what I'm saying and so if if she decides to walk out the door whoever's names are on these things or who's going to be holding the bag\nWhoever's you name any savings accounts wants can be there so you're in relation Lee you're struggling back and forth and vacillating so um you guys can do what you want to do obviously you're grown ups and you've done very well you're making\nA hundred and twenty eight year congratulations [noise] um you called and asked me so I Will tell you what I Would do if I woke up in your shoes okay\nYeah I Would get married tomorrow\nAnd then there would be no you're for one runner your savings account you're this it would only be weak and then I Would work the baby steps exactly as prescribed\n\nIt's what I Would do I think you're making really good money I think you pay the stupid for rent or off or get rid of it before she gets out and I want to learn about I Want her to line up her career\nOr for what she's going to do as she comes out of the military\nBut you know the thing is you you just can't vacillate between you know ... looking in the refrigerator and going well that's my mustard I bought that mustard um you know back in ... or no that's our mustard because we're we're doing this together oh why can't decide and there's there's ... it just polls at people part is\nUm there's all kind of\nStatistical research that shows you're going to have the sub standard results in your finances as well as other areas of your life until you but marriage and the equation\nAnd so you do what you want to do I'm I'm just an old guy advising you I've got several reasons for that advice\nBut um that's what I Would tell you to do if you were my little brother that's what I Would tell you to do I'd say get married and stop trying to play both sides of this coin just do it and you know you've been together forever anyway you do in life together\nIt's a technicality really but then you have to say from that point forward we we have a four runner\nWe have a house we have a savings account\nWe have a plan we are going to submit ourselves to the baby steps we are going to stick with this we are going to go that route and and you become friends at that point we week right [laughter] and so that that's what I Would do it cleans up everything\nAnd then walk right down it and if you want to say well you know we're facing an emergency with a loss of her income and so we're not going to work the baby steps right now we're just going to pile of cash and get ready for a baby step\nThat's not really skipping the baby step three that's just saying we're not going to do anything right now in a pile of money if you want to make that decision you can because you're panicked about the loss of her income\nI don't think I'm panicked about the loss of her income though\nI'm putting because a I think she's going to have another income lined up she's got from now the June to figure that out and be I don't know what percentage of your income she of our income once were married that she represents so that that's the other thing you've got to look at the variable\nWill is with us in California Hi Will welcome to the Dave Ramsey show\nA day driving me sure what's up from\nI've got a four home that I own a three hour Rand Paul's at this point uh one of my primary residence two of those trials are paid off and the third I owe about one Seventy on I guess my question is\nI have the cash to pay that a rental property off completely I'm Wondering if I should versus what the ultimate goal is to get more investment properties so I was wondering what your thoughts on that\nIs the ultimate goal to have a bunch of investment properties and a bunch of debt on them are a bunch of investment properties that are paid\nFor a pay for of course okay then let's start with that okay that's what I did\nUm the second time the first time I did my last and everything but the second time I don't borrow money and more and so I I you know I paid off all my properties and I use the increase cash flow that was resulting\nTo buy the next property and by the next one and of course every time you buy another one you got that much more cash flow that's a debt free cash does I mean these things cash for like crazy when you don't have any debt right\n[noise] right the changes are the only thing how much do you do your residence or my primary is about to forty okay the rental the rental is one Seventy and you have how much cash about two twenty okay I won't pay off my primary first\nOff the primary first yep yep\nAnd either way race with that either way you're encouraging ... well the reason is simply this year your heart is part of this equation it's not simply a math equation\nUh and when you're homeless paid off for you think differently you can't keep yourself from doing it you will make different decisions um it ... it calms you down\nYou know you just chill and not in a way where you lose your ambition or something like that but um you relax or because you're walking around the back yard when their shoes on and you're it hit the grass field different under your feet\nThe bar or really is labor the lender of experience that and I've had many many many people experience it over the years that I've thought this to millions of people\nAnd of course that frees up that two thousand or whatever dollars a month what's your household income\nOr about one forty five good you've been doing great man how old are you a forty four\nYou're doing well you're doing very very well so either way without\nWithout these psychological I guess just kind of what your cars that are there that ran on that has money on it oh you should be my primary residence and probably will be a good at some point so if you take the emotional equation out of it doesn't matter which one you pay off versus the other\nThe emotional equations part of the equation\n[noise] so yes it matters is personal finances personal it's not just finance ... when you try to do your wealth building process\nAnd don't involve behavior and don't involve relationships and don't involve emotions and don't involve spirit your spiritual um you're you're you're you've got a substandard plan if you're doing it only on my asking\nAnd you're gonna miss it you do whatever you want to they will die progress but if I were you that's what I Would do this hour that I've Ramsey show in the books will be back with you more you know in the meantime remember there's ultimately only one way to financial ... daily with

... by the president of the United states for the race was the manage them I think that he's perfectly tolerant of racial ...\nIt is oh factually a lie because the guy hates Trump all the evidence is there why he hated Trump\nHated him because of his support for our closest ally Israel how many presidents promise to move to the capital of Israel from Tel Aviv\nTo Jerusalem where it belongs many none had the courage to do it except this president [noise] you know it's amazing when you listen to the prime minister of Israel\nThinking the president no president has gone as far as to say we will destroy the enemies of Israel\nBecause there are closest ally just the opposite of what they are reporting and what they're trying to do look it would've been dishonest and I said at the time when Bernie Sanders supporters went out there and shot Steve skull east on the ball field in\nAnd shot up these other innocent people you know it it would have been it would have been wrong\nTo blame Bernie Sanders Bernie is not responsible\nFor what one of his crazy supporters to he's just not isn't it's intellectually dishonest to suggest such a thing I said it at the time and I even had at the time this is not some accommodation or rational they would ever give it if it's a conservative\nJust the opposite in this case you don't even have a Trump supporter and they're still blaming him [noise] I mean you know it it is it is what it is\nThe biggest donors to the Democratic caused this election season is the media\nIs universal almost at this point they hate Donald Trump every second every minute every hour every day it is hate destroy Trump at all costs you know the whole lie about Russia collusion it's just what I've been saying\nThey don't care about Russia collusion unless the Trump\nHillary bought and paid for ... full of Russian lies\nUsed to disseminate propaganda and influence the American people in the lead up to twenty sixteen it was it was used to get flies warrants unverified uncorroborated Russian lies that even the own even the author\nOf the dusty those in even stand by\nLet me tell you something let's remember when the media bashed Trump a lot of them were moving the embassy to Jerusalem\nAnd the president went against it in many ways what is a new alliance forming that could be maybe at some point God willing a path to peace in the middle east ones overall because of\nThe threat of a rainy in Germany in the region now caused an alliance that was ... maybe just a number of years back with Israel the Jordanians Egyptians\nThe Saudis the Emirates putting aside what Saudi Arabia recently did\nI mean if there was an emerging alliance here because of Donald Trump in large part and what he's done but I Will tell you you know let's play Joe Scarborough Joe Scarborough was lost his mind I honestly I don't I don't even it's inexplicable\nThat this guy has evolved into\nWhat I think is just he's he's lost any sense of reality all of these people in the media\nThey don't even see what blind hypocrites they are how they are guilty of the very thing they accused Trump up their rhetoric that they fame moral outrage about but there are guilty of\nHe's been he's been playing the race card I he said I'm a nationalist saving do comes out the next day say thank you thank you so much for\nFinally admitting that your own life ... list and
