{"month": "10", "state": "AL", "station": "WERC", "content": "And here it is that this is that they didn't even the Connecticut Senator who himself has been the target of attacks from Trump the target of attacks from the guy was flat out why or what do you mean the target\nOf attacks from Trump chimed in attack anybody told everybody who the guy\nAnd here is Sarah Sanders ... from the press briefing just now exactly as I said she got a question from John Roberts and it was all about\nDo you think that maybe the president should have done it marking her like that because you get Collins and Murkowski ended me in the way they bowed means horrible you'd think the president for maybe should have not done it\nThe president was gaining the facts and frankly facts that were included in special prosecutor Rachel Mitchell's report he was fading facts that were given during Dr ... testimony and it's been it has to make a decision based on those facts\nAnd whether or not they see judge Kavanaugh to be qualified to hold a position on the Supreme Court every single word judge Kavanaugh has said has been picked apart every single word second by second of his testimony has been picked apart yet if anybody says anything about\nThe accusations that have been thrown against them that's totally off limits and outrageous\nExactly right ya can't challenge her so Trump did [noise]\nFor everybody else who doesn't have to go ... to do it\n[noise] Trump did it\nIn yeah he's provide no little shade for some of these people hide under [noise] [noise]\n[noise] and I'll guarantee they may be publicly saying I Wish he hadn't done it that's outrageous went from there thinking everybody did it privately [noise]\nSomebody has to say it [noise] [noise] it's the freaking truth [noise] [noise]\nOkay now back to the phones and we go to Tom's river New Jersey ... is next and he is Fifteen Years old ever him I'm Glad you waited you're next on the program thank you for calling\nHey rushed great to speak to you again a great to have your back you\nGreat to be out again anyway so I'm watching this whole thing on me too movement watching the Kavanaugh hearings I'm I'm Fifteen I'm just regular straight guy\nThat's into abnormal but I think that I really cannot believe any of these women that pop up on TV anymore you can't believe any of them who are coming old guy raped me the guy did this to me did that to me you know we had to draw on CNN while the other like couple of months ago saying that a guy he raped her because he asked her for her phone number [noise]\nCan't believe any of them and I think that what this this whole me\nTo get away ... ... ... ... that that is my exact point I Believe that woman I Believe\nShe thinks she was raped when somebody asked her for her number that's how she's been conditioned\nWomen's studies on campus the the outright hatred for men you know I keep talking about it\nBut it's relevant Catherine McKenna and this was back in the nineties she was a professor of women's studies at Michigan She taught women in her class the all sex is rape even the sex of marriage and the women were lapping up and women have been taught for two generations now that men are basically predators and that their own kids are not safe from their fathers\nAnd it's not random it's widespread it is part and parcel of higher education today\nSo you have a woman and she could be acting I mean she could be making this up could be a political activist but it's entirely possible at the same time out from that the cause of what she's been\nTaught and heard on the news and talking to her she made all literally believe that men don't have no right to ask for her phone number is the same thing as bullying her raping her\nThat's my point she may really believe it\nOr else will rush of you know the same woman that are screaming about how they've been raped or off the ones who want to have the right to having abortions it so they could have unlimited sex\nOr have you\nEver um [noise] um you're right sex without consequences but you better not\nBut then they claimed that all men are predators but then they run to run hook up and then they want to have abortions for free\nWhen it's their idea then everything's fine you know look up at a ride by the way here's this you're\nAlso random it's not all women but it's been made to look like\nThat isn't it [noise] the me too movement supposedly include all women [noise]\nOn across America who do not think this way are being lumped into this\nMovement ... against their will [noise] it's just that assumption that the Democrats and the drive by media\nOr making a I think every time you're young you're growing up I think you're going to be OK finding a woman but you got to be real careful about it just get a written permission for every move you might get notarized after the date\n[laughter] and you're listening to Rush Limbaugh ... voice on the right time but by the MIT

Mika to evenings with Chris Chris Rachel Lawrence and Brian makes sense to the midterms all fall on MSNBC\nThese these news radio one oh five five tell you we are seeing Birmingham\nYou we are seeing them over and die hard radio station the six o'clock [noise]\nA deadly limo ride in upstate New York I'm Steve Rapaport Fox News authority saying the limo ran a stop sign before crashing into a car and pedestrians in a crowded parking lot all Eighteen people in the limo and to pedestrians were killed\nThroughout the next few days NTSB investigative work room scene too thoroughly document the scene and together what we call the perishable evidence the information that goes away with the passage of time Robert\nAnyway well Deborah cats as the one that well she didn't really believe Paula Jones and she did take al Franken's side\nAnd you know it is [noise] you know you just give got to watch this\nIt there's no end to this now they are not going to stop until they get a no vote on Brecht capital\nThat's just this this should not surprise anybody and Jeff Flake is now in Massachusetts today trying to run for president thinking he's going to which by the way the way to do it you don't like Trump go beat him\nIn thirty six days Democrats they'll make their case\nAnd they're going to ask you to give the house of representatives to Nancy Pelosi and the Senate Democrats\nTo Chuck Schumer if that's what you want on election night in thirty six days and you want to turn on the TV and find out the results if you stay home well you'll get the government you deserve we always do you want all progress that we have now\nAchieved in two years to stop that will happen too but all the senators saying well no no no we got to limit the scope it it's got to be very quick expeditious and just have the FBI do this that's not what they ever intended they want this to drag on through the mid term elections\nIn the hope that Donald Trump doesn't get to make is Supreme Court nomination anyway joining us now is Carrie Severino she's the chief counsel policy director for the Judicial Crisis network a welcome back to the program well as predicted the bar\nHas shifted and now the Democrats won an extensive FBI investigation but from my standpoint as it relates to professor Ford there's really only for people that need to be interviewed and I would assume by now all four of them probably were\nI'm sure they were it was easy to find people because they already had been interviewed\nBy the Senate Judiciary committee look the the\nThe goalposts are moving faster than the speed of light here it's it's very difficult to that to believe that any of these people\nUm it it can take themselves seriously they said it's going to be four days a week and now they're going to have an artificial that time you know they were saying the FBI the gold standard there impartial there you know she said that every Democrat that that now they're going up\nBut Trump is evil puppet master controlling the FBI they're actually going to be this horrible part is an organization you know it it it\nIt is and it would be laughable if it wasn't a man's lifelong reputation here on the line\nTo hear jokes that are doing two weeks ago\nAs far as everybody else knew Brett Kavanaugh had an impeccable reputation that is now that's gone forever you know re Donovan famously once said after being investigated for a year and a half where do I go to get my good name back mhm well in this case\nI I don't think ... ever gets back in many many ways I mean Clarence Thomas will ever be remembered because of the last minute accusations of Anita Hill\nYeah it it it's very discouraging although I have to say I I Do get some on there is someone who clerk for Justice Thomas and knows the why he he you know there are certain ... ... people who are going to just simply use that as their excuse is counted the name of this couch them because they disagree with in any way\nOn and he is someone who it does ... incredible amount of respect\nOn the bench judge Kavanaugh is a kind of person where even when he was on the DC circuit as the lower court judge the Supreme Court said it saw him as someone to really take seriously you know more than a dozen times they spoke to fourteen different times he found out they vindicated his opinion they had a huge amount of respect for him\nI don't think that's going to change I think um they are not going to be watching this with a sane knee jerk or part is in response as I Hope\nThat that that we're seeing some some of these people are ... but but if\nIf the parents who brought her reputation now\nIf you read James Comey's New York times piece that he came out with the ... it to me it's absolutely stunning and the things that he's saying because\nWhile the FBI's back in the middle of it when we handled the Hillary Clinton email investigation while he was running an exoneration himself prior to the real investigation which didn't happen until three days before he publicly exonerated her um but\nThen he goes on to trash the president at length\nAnd then he talks about FBI agents are experts which they are interviewing people and quickly dispatching leads to their colleagues around the world to follow up with additional interviews\nAnd they will come from people with testimony and other accounts and you know yes the alleged incident occurred thirty six years ago but at the age is no time has little to do with memory um which I found a little strange um and then you know for example everybody remembers if it rained on their wedding day\nUh I don't think that's a political in that particular sense maybe to somebody who is traumatized I could see that but for somebody that's not traumatized maybe not um once they start interviewing every witness knows the consequences he says\nIs one thing to have your lawyer submitted statement on your behalf it's very different thing to sit across from two FBI special agents and answer their relentless questions of course the bureau won't have subpoena power only the ability to knock on doors and ask questions most people will speak to them that there is what he says refusal to do so\nIts own kind of statement now I Want to just address that because\nMy FBI friends my friends in the in the bureau special agents have all said to me never ever\nTalk to the FBI unless you have a lawyer\nEver and I'm like why am\nSomebody who loves the FBI don't love the upper brass on the call me and the cave and struck and page but the FBI is is ... ... people I Know the fault of the earth people and I sort of course I'd want to help him he goes no\nAnd then they say look what happened to General Flynn General Flynn is accused of lying to the FBI and the up here I didn't think he was learning to live in this you just it's dumb to ever talk to any law enforcement\nWithout a lawyer that's what all my law enforcement people friends say because it's a crime if you lie to the FBI let's say you said something in the Senate Judiciary investigation and it doesn't exactly match up you could be charged with a crime of lying to the FBI it's ridiculous\nAnd you know the irony that says hey\nLook hit hit companies coming MO right now is just to try to destroy Trump with everything he can and it's just another another section in that play book but the irony is the exact same federal law provision that says it's a crime to to lie the FBI is the one that says it's a crime to lie to the Senate\nTheir ... with their investigators it's not just you know a similar penalty it's exactly the same statutory violation so that's just not\nThey've been kind of pretending they're ... that I guess playing a little bit on people's images maybe from the movies of what the FBI guys to say that this is somehow it's going to be a separate different thing\nWhat they're really doing here is there going down the same list to people the Senate Judiciary committee has already talks to they're getting the same statement in some cases they might get exactly the same thing 'cause the FBI can't ... can't force them to talk to them especially if all you know as\nI don't remember that I wasn't there they they could be dealing with taking the same exact statement from the same lawyers for the same the same individuals that that's ... that that is all we can no ... just because the nature of this old investigation so the FBI isn't going to find anything new to hear that there there's my prediction\nTurned it around the IRA and that they don't have any other thing\nThey've already moved on I guess the ... and and that's the one that came out in the New Yorker piece and you know ... that's the one we're even the New York times that said they attempted\nTo interview over the course of a week several dozen people they couldn't find a link to one to corroborate her story and then saying the mist Ramirez\nContacted former yo classmates asking them if they were called the incident and told some of them that she could not be certain Mr cab and all was the one who exposed themselves which at that point tells me you know what do they investigating here\nIf she's asking other ... she's telling other people she doesn't know\nWhat are they investigated\nThe more shocking thing is eating right and it's you know right before\nThis whole um ... most recent face exploded I think it was the morning on of the vote she actually her lawyer was telling people she's not even sure it with him she said what puppet he was in the room [laughter]\nI'm positive he adjusted his hands whatever that means that so but I but I Can't say for certain to get hit it and so it's even after talking to her lawyers for six days to kind of work up\nA her memory that she didn't have when she initially talked to the to the New York New Yorker 'cause they also said she couldn't say for sure he was there when they initially talked to her\nI I I I mean ... even counted as a credible allegations of the you know what go for the FBI can talk to her um they'll they'll get their statement and I think this is if you look at the people if they're\nOnly going to include a whole new ones and they don't make any recommendations they're just going to give very handover the information\nThat's it the the three ... and and maybe we'll get those thrilled to we've been waiting for thrilled to forever as it relates to Bruce or and and Christopher Steele and and what was said and those conversations are Carrie Severino is with those cheap council policy
