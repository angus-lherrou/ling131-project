{"month": "10", "state": "AL", "station": "WERC", "content": "They absolutely ended up paying everything whenever the divorce like he was making about a hundred and twenty five thousand dollars a year and\nA wide as you know like that now\nWe went through the flight and truth out and I think for me and we\nHe lost his job I lost my job um and so he's gotten that he'd like now I have gotten back to working at like he got like a different company and they offered him five dollars an hour ...\nOne of the other company never reopened right and what does he do\nHe writes I'm a traitor and could plant here in Louisiana\nOkay ... work in a new\n... the other part of the story I Want to get straight in my head it sounded like you didn't know how much did he had until after you were engaged\nYeah why I I was not aware I was not very smart and I pointed out that that I've never had that Red Cross my mind\nWas should across is\nThat you should have had this information prior to a making a commitment to marriage yeah that's kind of a problem like he was hiding it\nOkay and that\nBothers me more than the debt right this moment um and so what's his attitude about the debt\nUm he really hasn't been paying anything like that I I just don't want to start a marriage now that I Know about the guy I can accept that I guess before we actually had a date to get married I Want you know that we are on a plan to get paid off\nThere you go and that he believes in that plan and is committed fully to that plan if he if he is for whatever reason\nHas has given up hope and it feels like he's stuck you just going to stay there or he just doesn't care or whatever about the debt if for whatever reason he's just going to wallow in this that's a deal breaker okay it's not that\nI wouldn't tell you the not marry him over the debt but I Would tell you to not marry him over lying about it or not marry him over uh the fact that he wants to just stay in it because you're not going to be you know you you you it's a long life will help for you\nOkay if you think about ten years Fifteen Years from now you're still wall and the stuff you're not going to be okay with that\nNo that's what I absolutely don't want to do you know\nAnd so as long you know and if he's not going to be all in like we live on nothing and I'm you know he probably has to go back to court and adjust some stuff\nAnd um\nAnd I don't think he owes forty five thousand dollars on the repo I think that's what he owed on the car at the time they reported Eli\nFalcon he owed when they re paradise Seventy thousand yeah what was he driving than what I think it absolutely outrageous\nA yellow any roads and negative equity into that to get the ... and ... and so the the forty five thousand is the difference okay they'll settle that for pennies on the dollar really probably sell that for ten grand but the rest of the stuff I don't know I mean the ex wife thing I don't know what you're going to do with that how in the world ends up on her and these two attorneys\nUm [laughter] while a\nYou might be able to settle those would lump sum I mean you might walk up to her and say here's a check for thirty if you go away\nUm and uh she might take it you know but you'd have to have the thirty thousand dollars is what I'm doing better not thirty dollars and so you know you're going to put some money together here and that means both of you are going to get your incomes up and you both have to buy I desire to get out of money\nOr to get out of debt and to make more money to do that you have to both have this thing and it's still going to take you a few years I mean if you just go bananas it's going to take you a few years\nSo um\nThat that's what you're facing and um but the the thing is folks I hear those will be dating out there it is not a deal breaker as far as I'm concerned it can be for you you decide what you want to do with your life but I don't tell people to not to get married over that\nI Do tell them to not get married over the decision to stay in debt when you don't want to stay in that because that's going to be when you can't be an agreement on money before you get married when money is the number one cause of divorce we can highly predict that your marriage is not gonna last\nIt's it's ... it's okay if the number one cause a divorce you don't agree on\nGuess what you're going to get divorced I mean that's a fairly simple equation here\nAnd so you have to be in agreement so I don't the two fifty doesn't scare me scares me but it doesn't terrify me to say this guy's not a keeper I don't know if he's a keeper or not I can't tell he sure has a bad taste and lawyers and all that but as he got his way up [noise]\nBut um anyway [laughter] man he ends up paying her lawyer his lawyer owes her Seventy grand and half of his income\n[laughter] off a lot of four that's good gosh so uh wow yeah\nSomebody so anyway yeah ... this was not\nAn equitable

... yes\nMortgages are only okay and what we have about Fifteen thousand extra savings on top of our six month emergency fund for the question is a story about forty on the house is worth about a hundred\nUm and it's an a good rental area so our goal is to move in about two to four years\nAnd with the fourteen Fifteen extra ground we use that to start paying off the mortgage more right now I

having a very hard time trying to get on track with everything including starting our emergency fund\nWhat can we do when we are so behind that we can not even catch up we're about two months behind on all bills is causing a lot of stress on our marriage or kids were tired of living this way but we feel like we're in so much debt in so deep that we can't get out\nYeah just seeing it gets really really scary when you're in a situation like that and I'm part of what's scary is the sense that you're stuck part of what's scary is you're overwhelmed\nAnd um\n[noise] let's stop and pull one segment out of this thing and talk about that for a second or two months behind on our bills and it's causing so much stress on our marriage and kids being behind on your bills should not affect your kids\nThey should know about it you don't need to tell your five year old you are behind on the lights that's not their problem much your problem\nAnd you can tell the kids know but you don't have to give him a big long reason why knows a complete sentence [noise] no but don't pass off the uh\nYou know don't pass off the stress of the kids\nNow let's look at the rest of this what do you do when you're completely overwhelmed and terrified and feel stuck I've been there somebody you don't know what I'm Talking about you been there too and you\nIt is no fun OK here's how you fix it you have to begin to take control of what you can take control of\nYou have an income let's make sure that that first is being controlled and that's called the budget now you do not have to be able to pay everything to do a budget all a budget is as you're telling the money that you do have where it is going to go\nAnd so when you can't pay everything which catching everything up in one month would be paying everything right\nWhen you can't pay everything then you've got to say well the money that we have we're going to do the most we can do with that and for this month that's all we can do\nSo you prioritize you make enough to buy food you do not make enough to eat out so we're not going to restaurants but we are going to the grocery store and we're going to feed our family and we're going to cook from scratch 'cause it's healthier and it costs less\nSo there we go do you make enough to do that check with that one down for the food budget downright that number down and you can do that you make enough to pay your lights and water and if you're behind on them you catch them all up this month before you do anything else after you ate\nGet current on your lights get current on your water now if you have a six hundred dollar a month cable bill because you have NFL super duper pooper scooper or whatever then cancel all that crap but I'm Talking about water and the lights\nAnd gas to eat okay\nNow I don't really give a rip whether you can see Downton Abbey or not but I Am more concerned about you having lights and water on and gas to heat if it's gas heat okay so you pay your basic necessities food and utilities you make enough to do that and get current on them right now\nNumber three is shelter now you pay your rent\nIt doesn't matter if you pay your rent and you can't sleep there because there is no heat so you've got to put heat in the place okay so you pay your rent if you're behind on your rent before you move on to number for you catch up on your rent\nNumber for transportation\nYou colonel in the car and you keep gash in the car now if that takes all your money and you can pay nothing else this month old well\nSo that means you need to write a check today and pay off your car in your credit card and cut up your stupid credit card [laughter] okay okay now your debt free right okay yeah okay and that was formed to\n... so six thousand so I'm Down to twenty four thousand right yeah okay and your land is paid off and it's worth sixty\nUh about Fifteen about fifty and uh we need sixty so you need ten thousand that's where you're getting your twenty percent of the what you're doing okay ah well we're going put fourteen thousand in the emergency fund\n... pay so now you have an emergency phony what ten thousand with the land you get a construction alone with the takeout loan a permanent takeout\nAnd your budget cannot exceed or a three hundred thousand dollar value that does not mean a house that you spend three hundred thousand on the house okay the value of the total package can't be more than three hundred\nAnd that makes sense huh so that means you're building up two hundred and forty thousand dollar house maximum\nOkay\nBecause the packages worth three hundred and that gives you the twenty percent down if you spend three hundred on the house\nNow you're at three sixty and you don't have to ... percent down anymore okay you see how that works so you're getting actor option\nLoan that is tied to your new mortgage that is your final mortgage good called your permanent mortgage that's the mortgage that takes out your construction line and so you're construction lender will require a take out letter where your form where your permanent mortgages already approved sometimes you can just package all that together\nAnd with increasing interest rates are probably would package it altogether checked Churchill mortgage they can probably help you with that and you go in lock in your interest rate on your permanent mortgage\nBecause he's a mortgage entered Roger ticking up and a good idea to lock 'em in when you can by the way if you have a ... and you got a higher interest rate loans folks this would be the time to call Joe Joe mortgage a it is taking up and I would lock in rates if you're in the middle of a deal right now walk your rights in\nAnd I probably would lock 'em in like twenty minutes ago like four days ago I Would love to improve but we are in a rising interest rate environment none to panic about but it is going up\nAnd so you might as well take advantage of the lowest possible right you can get your hands on for refinance were for buying or in her case for building and um\nThat's by locking in current rage because I don't think you're going to see rage come back down dramatically um you know in ... in the foreseeable future in the next say six to twelve much they're probably going to go up\nAnd so given that environment um you don't have to be an economist to figure this out it's fairly easy to look at the trends um then then I'm going to lock everything in as fast as I can get in touch with Churchill mortgage the bank\nYou can get this done Barbara is one of those barbers in Salt Lake City Hi Barbara how are you\nHey babe during gray how you doing better than I deserve what's up\nSo we are a month and a half away from a and gotten a baby step too good and I know you're ... but I don't want to live that momentum that we've had kept\nGoing towards ... and and going into baby steps three there's like a few curve balls I guess on that are happening so we want to August ... babysat three ... my husband is also wanting to go back into school to get a bachelor's they get a better paying job that would be a it'd be step three\nOkay but that's my question would we also want to start a family that we need competitors like baby find because we want to cash flow that\nWhen you have a baby on the way you will build up a baby's lungs no need to do it\nOkay to build up the emergency fund first\nEmergency finished first for you do anything and then you start doing other life goals I wouldn't worry about saving for a baby you don't really need to save a bunch of money for a baby um if you got ... got health insurance you know and you\nShould have health insurance and um you know you've got your emergency fund and blood and you know you'll be able to budget the diapers and believe me your work it out um but yeah you don't really need an extra baby savings account unless you just want to save up enough to cover whatever normal labor and delivery is out of pocket\nYeah that would be it would be around a I think we pay like Fifteen hundred dollars toward that labor and delivery\nThat I'm not sure that's easy enough to do during that's easy enough to do during a much\nOkay\nYeah so you could just do that whenever that happens and whenever babies on the way you decide well run our cyber for that and and and you know anything you want to do that to an upgrade them ... and whatever comes after the emergency fund 'cause it's not an emergency I'm going to ... goes on emergency this Fifteen hundred for the baby's not even an emergency or you can cover it\nIt's a luxury to have that as extra savings or maybe came on the way writes\nIt maybe got here before you had to say you'll be All right\nOkay yeah you know that they don't they're not curve balls

get land to build our own and also we're in an area that we really want to live and there are a lot of family around here great so\nYes sir I quickly you're a how much how can we afford with our income ... the contract that we've been talking the recommended at us alone and you're not a fan of\nAbsolutely not no I Would never do your do you\nKnow it's a it's a subsidized loan and if you ever sold the house or go to refinance the loan at any point you're going to pay back all the subsidy and in some\nYou get really trapped in these things and they're nasty bad no I never would do a USDA long I have had more problems with that loan working with people that are in trouble than any other loan I've dealt with\nWhile while\nNo stay with laugh as far as how much how you can afford we always say I'm you know put your down payment whatever that is the end of the formula rights and\nThen the loan amount on a Fifteen year fixed rate loan which today's about five percent interest loan amount on a Fifteen year fixed rate loan is no more the payment is no more than a force of your take home pay\nAnd and that put you right where you want to be shown like you've done some really good

E. R. C. [noise]\nNashville eyebrows welcome to the Dave Ramsey show [noise] hello thanks for taking my call sure what's up [noise] yeah ... ... mortgage\nPay off question for you [laughter] um I currently have a mortgage thirty year mortgage or many balance of three hundred and fifty thousand [laughter]\nAnd I am wondering if I should use money after ... stock account and savings account I'm Becky ... my emergency account to paid us off or get Chuck Chuck's on either Atacama how have the money that we're having trouble\nOr do you have it up with ... with the whole you know calm value of money just you know put you know what what I can make and what they weren't sure how what's your house actually we're probably about six hundred thousand\nBased on your concern about time value of money why do you not oh six hundred thousand on it\nI'm chunk Dexter on it why yeah\nThat's right I should add some contrary to your ... your money problem\nHere\nShouldn't consistent okay so here's what's going on\nRight you you have um some good information but it's incomplete 'em and show that in that cause you'll be left with a a a primitive analysis and let me walk you through that All right\n'cause I used to think exactly the same way so I don't know where your brain is [laughter] yeah okay so because you obviously have a good intellect on especially on financial thanks so\nYour your concern is if I can borrow money at three four or five percent and I can reinvest it and good mutual fund at ten ten eleven twelve percent and might not making that spread why would I ever\nYou know miss out on that spread and um you know I've got the money invested now it's making me ten twelve whatever it's making me not the day but it's making me that overall and why would I lose that spread and uh I had to really wrestle that down because that's how I was trained in the financial world obviously with a finance degree\nAnd then I had to start looking at didn't want to start looking at stuff through the lens of the borrower is slave to the lender and there is no good mentions of debt and scripture and I'm going okay either God's stupid or and I've got something figured out he doesn't know about or there's something I don't understand\nAnd so um what I figured out was was that that formula that we just used\nTen percent over\nFour percent ... percent spread leaves out risk\nAnd in a sophisticated uh investment analysis you adjust for risk\nMeaning I Would never compare a growth in income mutual fund apples to apples was an aggressive growth stocks mutual fund the rest of gross stock mutual fund might have an average annual return of twenty twenty percent the other one might have an average and overturn of twelve percent\nBut the risk ratio is completely different risk profile and those two ... completely different agreed\nAgree okay so what you would do is you would adjust and in in that world you can actually use a thing called a beta with an inverse formula and we'll get an all that crap but basically you can say because one is more risky than the other way mathematically adjusted for risk to be able to compare them apples to apples\nAnd that's the proper way to do an analysis between those two funds but no one applies that concept that that level of sophistication to this debt analysis that says Tom by your money and I could use this money to make more than I'm making now so ah but what I have found is is when I Do pay off my house\nI I don't know which risk neutralizes a lot of those the difference between the foreign the ten percent\nIt takes away most of that spread when you when you you know when you factor interest 'cause we're there is risk when your mortgage now it's not a lot of risk 'cause you've got the money in the bank today to pay it off but or an investment to pay it off but there is risk\nAnd so uh you have to admit that you know one hundred percent of foreclosures occur on home with a mortgage there is rich and so I'm getting rid of that will have found is it's not completely quantifiable I'm In a simple mathematical formula because when\nYou see poor people being oppressed there with payday lender\nThe pawn shop the title pawn the rent to own the number one ZIP Code that lottery tickets are sold in pour into town\nPeople buy poor people buy lottery tickets such a governmental brushing you they're giving you fall show on somebody's going to win will no you're not going to win stupid you're just going to be poor but you bought the ticket you know it's a tax on poor people and people that can't do math\nThat's what it is stupid on entertainment is never entertaining to lose money unless you're sick I mean you think it's entertaining to lose money how's that entertaining if you do that just throw hundred dollar bills out your car window on the way to work at the big entertaining come on watch the\nOr be mirror and see what happens to be back there I mean you know something the interim people graphic be entertaining right [laughter] so you know seriously\nNow so there are things that happen to people that caused them to be in poverty and we're not mad at anybody in poverty but they only variables you can control out of the three possible reasons someone's in poverty you're born into it\nYou are oh pressed by others\nOr\nYour choices are stupid loser the three things that caused me to be poor cause you to be poor\nAnd the only one of those three variables you can control as you\nYour choices you can't control what other people do you can't control what you were born into kind of literature rush spoke to was a while back and leadership event when around her leadership summit and she was talking about growing up in segregated a working class to poor neighborhood\nAnd she said her parents kept telling her her whole town growing up and she's freaking secretary of state okay\nSo brilliant highly educated woman\nFabulous communicator\nI think we can all say she kind of made it okay\nBut she came out of that neighborhood she wasn't born into and obviously she was a woman obviously she's African American so a couple of strikes right there right now but she said mom and dad told me they didn't tell me about the victim they taught me it doesn't matter where you're from it matters where you're going\nOh\nNo matter where you're from matters where you're going and so I don't know where he started most of us didn't start with a silver spoon\nOr you have privilege okay I'll take your privilege whatever you probably just I don't know what your privileges but you know I've never known anybody that had ... their life perfectly easy and with no obstacles\nThere ain't that much privilege out there yes some people start further ahead than others I get that but I Can't control that I can only control my response you can only control your response and it's your decision it doesn't matter where you are coming from what matters is where you are going love that quote\n\nHard work brings profit talk leads to poverty\nI don't get mad at me God's said that\nHard work brings a profit me or talk leads to poverty\n...\nDoesn't matter where you're coming from what

of those surrounding areas you are right in line of of the path of hurricane Michael\nIt's moving at a pretty rapid pace which means that will be there sometime tomorrow and then make its way up the coast through Columbia South Carolina into North Carolina and then we expect to that point is probably going to go out to see a little bit but the bottom line is a this is a cat for borderline tap five hurricane\nAnd the strongest one ever to reach the Gulf Coast area there in the panhandle area and uh on top of it we got catastrophic storm surge\nThese destructive wind gusts hundred and Seventy five miles per hour and even higher um over a million power outages we expect occurring\nAnd not just near the coast but also inland after now this is hitting as we speak rainfall flooding is going to be a significant threat into the Carolinas so uh everybody if if you're in\nIf you're in Georgia if you're in South Carolina of you're in North Carolina you know you can make their preparations now and I would listen to local authorities if they're telling you to get out get out and uh you can come back take whatever important pictures valuables you need to take with you packed the car move inland and protect your family and\nUh you know our thoughts and prayers are with everybody in in harm's way today this is this is the real deal this is you know Florida governor scared to death for those who said\nThis is why you know at times they make predictions they tell you to leave and it it's not as bad as they say it's gonna be this was one of those times it's as bad or worse than they predict that it's going to be\nThe worst the worst hurricane ever for the panhandle in Florida that's how dangerous this is as it goes inland we're talking about in Augusta, Georgia you're going to be having eighty to a hundred mile an hour winds tomorrow\nSame thing as you head up to Columbia South Carolina into the\nInto North Carolina so a lot of bad stuff happening our thoughts and prayers are with everybody and just no help will be on the way we live in the greatest country on earth with the most generous people on earth and whatever our friends in Florida Georgia the Carolinas\nAre going to need I Know that people will be there to to help in any way imaginable a we have some breaking news on the deep state as it relates to Rod Rosenstein oh this is really outrageous\nRod Rosenstein now think of everything that he's involved to think of how conflicted he has been as it relates to all things deep state that we have been telling you about now for a year and a half he is the person in May of twenty Seventeen recommending the firing\nOf Jim told me he is the guy that appointed special counsel Robert Mueller he\nIs the guy that signed the third ... knew the fourth Pfizer application to spy on the Trump campaign associate Carter Page\nOr the bulk of the information in the ... of warrants as we all know now or the Hillary Clinton bought and paid for\nPhony rushing dusty aid that even its author Christopher Steele doesn't stand by and of course that was funneled money it was made to look like a legal expense when in fact it was anything but a legally Spence\nNow he was now are supposed to testify because three people now Lisa Page Andrew McCabe the former deputy FBI Director and James Baker again we just learned this you know this week James Baker now the third person\nAre all saying that Rod Rosenstein talked at length about surreptitiously going into the oval office\nTaping the president of the United states by the way that would be without a warrant\nAnd then hoping he can get some information something from the president that could then at night or ... or start the process of invoking the twenty Fifth Amendment to remove the president from office\nNow he's denying it said he was being sarcastic said it was he was joking about it\nBut the testimony of Lisa Page Andrew McCabe and James Baker all contradict what Rod Rosenstein is now saying\nWell Rod Rosenstein was scheduled to testify tomorrow to the house Judiciary Committee but unfortunately this hour there at an impasse and the impasse over the terms of the testimony\nBecause lawmakers are calling for what is the standard congressional task force interview and insisting that Rod Rosenstein give a transcribed interview and that the interview be under oath he's refusing to do so\nAnd those close to Rosenstein say they prefer a meeting and I'm sure they do or briefing with the house Judiciary Committee chairman and other lawmakers they don't want any paper trail they don't want to be under oath at all\nNow the house Judiciary Committee aide said on Wednesday they left the door open for a possible resolution there should be no resolution\nThe resolution is to subpoena Rod Rosenstein and have him testify under oath did he or did he not\nAs Lisa Page as McKay Andrew McCabe is James Baker all saying Diddy or did he not talked about wearing a wire against the president and the hope of getting something he says to help invoke the twenty Fifth Amendment\nEither he did it or he didn't do it and then we can also talk about why signs of the fourth and final buys a warrant application as it relates to Carter Page\nWhy why did he sign off on a document himself talked about well with regards to ... warrants you know that it was an affidavit and career law enforcement swears to the validity of truthfulness\nAnd if they're wrong there's consequences well we all know the bulk of the size of applications including the last one and there's one that shouldn't have been signed by that point they knew Hillary paid for it they know the DNC paid for it\nThey knew it was full of uncorroborated on verified information we're now nine months in too\nSurveilling Carter Page by then you think they would have figured out that the dot CA was phony and made up and even its own author\nOr couldn't prove any of its content when questioned in in Iraq a tour in Great Britain and said I don't know if any of this is true of just raw intelligence and people just saying things like to hookers urinating in a bad in front of Donald Trump or in Moscow and the Ritz Carlton\nWell nobody ever verify that or corroborated that and it is if you're going to get an affidavit ... law especially Pfizer application Pfizer warrant\nAnd protocol that you verify the contents and the information you're presenting to a ... court and you don't purposely withhold information\nPertinent information like the fact that Hillary Clinton bought and paid for that pony ... that you didn't take the time to verify or corroborate but there's obviously they all hated Donald Trump because remember struck was the one that said well first they get to smell the Trump voters in a Walmart but also said that Hillary should win them\nA hundred million is zero\nAnd then you're going to add to that the insurance policy comment that he made and what you really have here is I think now the validation or the cooperation of what the insurance policy was\nInsurance policy is that you have people conspiring not only remember Lisa Page testified\nAs we head into may nine months into the investigation into so called Trump Russia collusion by the very same people that gave Hillary Clinton a pass on the biggest obstruction of justice case in history\nThen they go into the Trump Russia so called investigation Lisa Page confirms that they had no information Peter Struck tech confirmed that there is no there there\nBut anyway then they started ... media leaks strategy all coming from the same source which is Hillary's bought and paid for dot CA they get their willing accomplices in the media to spread their lives and propaganda from the CIA\nAnd it creates an atmosphere where an impression is being created that whoa there really is something going on here\nAnd then it's used by the very same people the phony information that they spread to whip up hysteria so that they can go forward after the firing of called me on the ninth of may in twenty Seventeen then they appoint\nRod Rod Rosenstein goes out and appointed buddy Robert Mueller\nBut there was no evidence at all according to lease to pay that there was any reason to open a special counsel investigation the whole house of cards the corruption those failing school is now exposed no wonder Rod Rosenstein doesn't want to speak to the Senate\nJudiciary Committee is outside of the house Judiciary Committee no wonder why ... especially under oath where then he could be charged with lying under oath you know and people worry about that just asked Papadopoulos or General Flynn\nOr we have a lot of information we're going to get to we have a rash musician a poll out today Republicans tied with the Democrats on the generic ballot that is huge we have more information specific information of just how radical\nThe Democratic party's agenda is if they ever get back power in twenty seven days we have in Arizona Mick Sally thankfully has taken the lead in that close Senate race out there she is really an American war hero\nAnd ah anyway I think we're seeing a lot of moving in Missouri in favor of the Republican candidates a lot of movement Heidi Heitkamp is in trouble in North Dakota Joe Donnelly is in trouble in Indiana\nGovernment ... dog go I'm Bob car radio one of five five W E R C ...\nWe were all on Sean Hannity's show eight hundred nine four one Sean good news polling operation\nRats musing a by the way they had the best accuracy record in twenty sixteen and the presidential election when so many others were wrong now saying that Republicans are\nTied with Democrats on the twenty Eighteen generic ballot latest raspy recent survey forty five percent of likely voters would choose a democratic candidate of the elections for Congress were held today another forty five percent off for the Republicans three percent prefer another candidate\nThat's set up by point recent improvement for the G O P\nBut if you go back at this time in twenty fourteen prior to the last non presidential\nA year congressional election Democrats at a forty one thirty nine lead but Republicans went on to win nine Senate seats and increase their majority in the house\nWhat that means if I can interpret for you it means that in twenty seven days\nWe the people have the opportunity to shock the world again and not reward the outrageous behavior of the entire Democratic Party establishment in the last two years and and more recently with judge Kavanaugh\nAnd by the way another sign that Chuck Schumer is antique Kavanaugh strategy was a public relations disaster another poll finds raspy within that Republicans are more angry about the cabinet controversy the Democrats are more determined to vote in the upcoming election because of a\nNew recipe of some poll shows that sixty two percent of Republicans are more likely to vote because of what the Democrats did\nThe judge Kavanaugh compared to fifty four percent of Democrats or that is a good sign for twenty seven days and on top of that Democrats keep Everytime they open their mouth and they expose what they're real agenda is its investigation it's impeachment it's\nTake their crumbs back and eliminate the the tax cuts that have been helping the economy so much and of course they want to keep Obamacare and actually quote strengthen it in other words make it worse and\nOn top of all of that eliminating ice and open borders has a lot at stake\nI when we come back a category ... uh for hurricane landing

Sean Hannity show\nUm everything you said and more um cat for maybe borderline cat five\nYeah landfall now it's it's inland now thirty to forty miles and we want to give you said at the track of this is going to be very a right to middle Georgia or they're very close to making Warner robins about two am this morning near Augusta tomorrow morning and near and south of the track for instance uh looks like wind gusts\nAre going to be a hundred two hundred and twenty miles an hour in southwest Georgia probably uh Seventy five a hundred miles an hour middle Georgia around the Augusta area the strongest winds are probably going to be between a sixty and eighty miles an hour near in southeast of Augusta\nAnd in Columbia say fifty five Seventy five year in southeast of there so the track of this by tomorrow night\nUh will take it or to take it probably a north the Fayetteville North Carolina and then two AM in the morning it reaches the or reaches a lizard at city North Carolina and then it goes out so\nThat's how we're expecting this to move or over the next twenty four thirty six hours and so it's going to be moving pretty quickly or through a lot of these areas\nAnd let me throw this a little bit more first of all I mean the the governor saying I Hope to God that nobody said that ... people evacuated on the coast I'm not so sure that that's the case I mean I'm looking at some of these images and it's it's downright scary flooding has already occurred in in some of these coastal areas\nUm but the the these are the types of wins that could blow down houses correct and and structure\nI suspect you're not seeing any any uh video coming in from where this made landfall ... I mean it's one thing for instance the Pensacola is on the west side of this mobile Pensacola has had a wins out the north forty ... sixty but it's blowing out\nSo it's at Panama City area a port saint Joe that's the area where it's ground zero and ... you know if you told me structures and I'm not just talking about the you know a small structure I'm Talking about a year Camille took apartment buildings out along the beach\nThey're saying this storm Joe is the most powerful on record to\nWe're hit the Florida Panhandle\nRight between mobile and Tampa this is the most powerful and record ... you know a ... that also goes west multiple Camille once you get ...\nYou get Camille in there about us Chris John and those places that are Camille as a benchmark storm there and done and Charlie down south of Tampa or the benchmark storms there of course Andrew in Miami\nOr they're Nineteen twenty six was a bad storm along the coast but it was only a category three up near Pensacola now this is this is the ... the worst storm now when we get a lot of folks to the east of the tracks severe weather tornadoes are going to break out tonight into tomorrow and we're talking on southern and eastern\nWhen you lay on the east of the ... you're talking now about the Georgia but it's going to be a little south of Atlanta a direct kind of hit a day to a hundred miles an hour I'm guessing into Augusta\nOne I think I think oh gosh this is sixty to eighty maybe Ninety miles an hour they'll back off by them making making like I said it may get us as high as that southwest Georgia where it's going to be entering in a couple of hours they're\nGoing to be seen with a hundred hundred and twenty miles an hour and got in there I mean that that's phenomenal because you've got to understand folks as powerful as these things are when they get inland fractional effects\nOr it's almost like if you if you're running a nine one a sprint nine one one hundred yard dash if you tweak your hamstring if you can't run that fast if you really pull it you can't run at all well these things have perfect machines\nBut once they get inland the fractional affects the fact that they're moving away from the source of energy the water they ... they wind down but we're talking about a relative windy got how many times is a ...
