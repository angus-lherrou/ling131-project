{"month": "10", "state": "AL", "station": "WERC", "content": "Right okay so if you came a\nYou know you'd be at about a five year plan if you were a little under two hundred thousand right thirty six thousand divided into two hundred thousand right well it would be um six years roughly if you do the full two hundred a little over two hundred but\nSomewhere between one fifty and two hundred you could do it in about five years not counting getting raises and not counting saving even more that's the most I wouldn't want to go\nOh I don't want to wait much more than five years or to buy and I don't want to wait much more than five years\nOut of your retirement system so I mean whatever you're going to do I would try to do it in under that ah but then so the point is you're sitting with a paid for property no payment in the world at that point right and you're making really good money and you're thirty something thirty one thirty two years old\nRight and so can you can you become a multi millionaire doing that absolutely you can\nOkay is that what you just pay yourself house payment from age thirty to age sixty you'd be a multi millionaire\nRight okay okay great so uh well go ahead and would you recommend it maybe if we did it might be a good idea to do maybe I hesitate retirement and say maybe a little bit less\nIt's up to you if you're gonna go longer than five years I'm starting to get pretty nervous about it\nOkay okay if you're going to be under five years and you want to do zero in your case you're still going to be very young and without a house payment when you pay cash for this house\nRight thirty one years old is very young with zero house payment and you got the income for the rest of your life to build wealth with I mean if you will just keep paying attention again pay yourself a house payment plus or minus a little you can be a multi millionaire\nOkay great thank you sound like they create your life\nVery well done good job you're thinking Deborah's whether it's in Tampa, Florida Hi Deborah how are you\nI'm doing well thank you for taking my call I'm sure what's up\nWell I'm I Am working on that you know a a financial peace university and I have paid out forty thousand dollars in twelve month good for you and yes and I'm Down to just one dead\nWhich is a hospital bill that we've been paying for many years now and I with very small payments uh-huh and uh it's been offended collection and we've been looking at our credit report just making sure that all these deaths have fallen off\nAnd it well it turns out that hospital bill has fallen off of our credit report\nAnd they cover that my husband than a trying with the idea of just not adding that to the debt now and just continuing that men on payments or\nEven not paying it at all and that scares me to death but I wanted to know from you what are the implications of doing something like that\nWhere there's two problems whether one is you actually owed them money so you should pay it yeah\nThat's one problem with the second problem is is that it's going to come back to haunt you just 'cause they're not reporting it today doesn't mean they're not going to take an active outstanding account and reported that anytime\nAnd so right what happened what's happened is is the collection agency that you're dealing with the collections company that you're dealing with is just not downloaded their files to credit bureau but they could do that at any time and then you've got a bad mark not just a mark what a bad mark 'cause this is a defaulted this is a bad bill\nIt's not a current bill 'cause they an offer you payments at the start they only offered to pay much because you couldn't pay them\nRight and you owe them the money and so uh how much is the bill\nI it's less than ten thousand at that point\nOkay what I Would do is continue to pay them I Would continue to pay them the minimum ... and I would build up a you know a lump sum up three or four thousand and offer them that a settlement and let's get it settled in full and get it in writing\nOkay but in writing settled in the fall and I I Would do that because it's already a bad mark on your credit and there's no telling how much they've added to it in collections fees in late fees anyway\nAnd so I you know I I Want to I Want to discount it a little for those reasons in those situations but just to ignore it because it's currently not showing up on your credit bureau is on was because it will end up showing up again\nAnd on top of that you owe the bill so clear the bill move on with your life it's worth it it's worth the trouble to address a good question thanks for calling in Tanya is in Lexington Hi Tania welcome to the Dave Ramsey show\nHello thank you for taking my phone call sure one time I have I have a question I Am Seventy years old and I'm getting ready to think about taking the payment options for tax shelter anybody [noise]\nUh and I wanted to know what would be something like the best option and I went I took his uh annuity out my thinking was take a lifetime monthly benefit and so then when I went to uh Africa about it they gave me a several other options\nI'm going to the other options for tea\nIt fixed annuity monthly income which should be lower but it would include a long term care policy no neither one was to take another fixed and the lady with a nursing care home policy no\nOr another option but to take a tenure certain with which would be lower premiums are non you're alive and then it went right to be a higher premium\nNo okay let's go with a F none of the above um\nUh so uh [laughter] the anytime you started weaving in these other policies with it that's going to entail extra fees and garages notice I didn't even ask what I'm not I didn't even ask what the numbers are when that's on the insurance world what we call that his bundling\nAnd there's only one time it was only one time bundling works to the consumers advantage and that's when you put your car insurance or homeowners were church together\nThat often works to your benefit but the rest of the stuff is gimmicky gotcha garbage and so ... and you have a good you have a good nose on your kiddo [noise]\nSo what I Would tell you there's I Would tell you the check with an investment advisor like one of the smart buster pros and talk about just rolling this into some a very low risk low volatility mutual funds and then just pulling an income off of that\nI think you'll end up with more money alive and dead doing that then you will\nMessing with us or nudity because the other thing that you can be sure of with an insurance company or an investment firm anytime they give you a guarantee that means they're giving you less than you could have made if you didn't have a guarantee\nOkay oh and so I you know it's like with your home you didn't get a guarantee when you bought your home\nNo guarantee it's going to go up in value we're down in value either one no no insurance I don't know backing your home though no FDIC insurance on the value of your home and yet you felt really comfortable taking that quote unquote risk\nWhy because well we can look at their track record of homes and be very comfortable with them and if I could find a mutual fund that I was just comfortable with its track record it's volatility as I was with your home at Seventy years old\nSomething like a growth in income ponder balance fun that kind of a thing that's probably where I'm putting my money if I'm you which Seventy um and it wouldn't be anywhere near an insurance company so I'll be rolling this whole thing over into something you know\n... a day Ramsey dot com put in your info and dropped on a list of the smartest or frozen your area\nShould go

thousand of you do what's your opinion of buying a vacation home with cash and then renting it out when you're not there [noise]\nNothing wrong with the last as long as you know with cash and your debt free everything about that when your homes paid for everything else just paid for a vacation home is a wonderful extra as you start buildings from wells but basically what is it it's a very large toy\nVery expensive toy that goes up in value hopefully and if you rent it it might make you some money\nMy family not me my family the rest of them most of the rest of them including the grandkids just spent a week down at um\nWas Rosemary beach Rosemary beach the other day and\nI rented a house on the beach really nice big expensive multi million dollar house for the week and obviously some people on that and rented out by the week\nI'm here's the thing about resort rentals vacation home rentals um you're going to make some money on it but you're not gonna you're gonna make usually enough to\nAfter you pay all the fees for the maid service and the you know resort rentals aren't like a traditional rental where you know for ten percent or something you can get the property management usually take half of it to manage it and that covers you know made service and that kinda stuff and then there's a whole bunch of the time it's not rented\nAnd so while you do get a great rate per week during a high season with a ski house or your house in the mountains for ... for snow skiing or a beach house or something along those lines\nYou're you're not going to get rich on rent it out you really not\nI mean it's not gonna it's not really a great investment property it's more of a way to offset some of your annual costs of your toy\n\nIf you look at it that way you won't be disappointed but if you actually run the numbers out you're not gonna be thrilled with it as an investment you're better off to just buy investment property it'll make you more money for the ... per dollar invest it\nAnd it's not as volatile and you don't come in and you know rent or something you know vacation runners haven't torn up your stuff or to build wind on your carpet or whatever\nAnd I know the names will deposit and I know this stuff gets fixed but I also know people are living\nIn their sleeping in your bed and you just have to think about that you know and\nYou know it's just it's the way it is an even a nice home and even nice people like the Ramsey staying in your home we weren't we didn't tear up stuff or not he wasn't a frat party in there and it was you know babies and\nGrandma ... and that kind of stuff in there so we want anything like that but you know stuff I I don't think we broke English stuff gets broken and you just got to know that and for for some people\nLet me put it this way for Sharron Ramsey\nTo walk into the place where she wants to go on her second homeless or vacation and someone else to have been in there and some of the stuff is out of place or broken or dirty it would kind of take a lot of the joy out of it for vacating there for her\nAnd so you have to think about that is a price you pay to rent it out\nAnd all of that to say it's not an ideal investment property it's more like a way to cover some of the cost of your way if you want to rent it out we've got a a lake house we don't rent it out and we've got a condo in another city we don't rent it out\nAnd um so it has to be a our income and our assets have to be large enough that we can accept that thing just sitting there in the months that door weeks that we don't use it\nAnd um but it is in both of those cases there are a very small percentage of my overall met worse and so there are toy it's just a toy that happens to go up in value and both of those cases that's kind of a nice part of the toy but it goes up in value and I still have to do the maintenance on it and fool with it\nAnd you know going in and the\nYou know the the condo the other day we stopped in there we're going to get a condo over in Knoxville and when the ball game over there and the heat and air was out so it was hot air conditioner was out so three hundred dollars later it was fixed but there's always something you know you just figure that's part of the equation when you own property\nThe more crap you own the more ... more repairman you have to know [laughter] it just goes with the territory so long as you're going to animal that emotionally to go with it and you're not looking for it to be in a big time investment that you get rich from then you'll be fine\nJamie is whether Jamie is in Alexandria, Louisiana Hi Jamie How are you\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHave any ... no wait nothing on your shoulder it changes the way you play it changes the way you do you're investing it changes the you get so I got I got so enthusiastic dude when I got free with my investing and with my generosity both\nThat both of them went into outrageous mode very quickly and so yeah I don't get that fifty five back so freaking fast\nThat it it'll it'll it'll come back faster than in the first time you've got a lot faster it's not gonna take you five years this time I'm ... but you got more income now too so that's not fair but I mean mathematically relation Lee spiritually emotionally\nWhen you're free you just do better\nAnd you just make better choices and you're already making really good choices so all of that to say yes\nI Would catch all the investments that are non retirement yes I Would take that emergency fund down to about ten\nUh that doesn't quite get us there so you got a lenient out of your budget and cash flow out the rest of that thing and finish it up within\nYou know four or five months be debt free on this whatever it is six months whatever it takes and then when the house has done than you than you if you want to build up that emergency fund a little bit fun but then kick those investments in the butt get them going again and you will prosper you are on your way sir\nSo honored to talk to you very very well done\nWayne is an Indianapolis Hi Wayne welcome to the ... show\nThanks Dave I just want to first say God Bless you for all the work you do it's really made a difference in my life\nWill thank you ... help today\nWell my wife and I have been a leading the life of ... for about two years now and uh where are you pretty much become that free other than our student loans which we're working on and then we ended up getting a now I got pregnant with her\nFirst child in April so say we took your advice and stop putting everything toward their debt snowball and started a bank in all of that\nIs good and uh as of this month we we now have enough for her to take her for a month maternity leave um I mean for you for us which is great\nAnd that but the problem is is Murphy has decided to strike a last week we got a bill in the mail from our city here and they replaced and sidewalks here on our lots and or the bills for forty four hundred dollars and a\nWhat a baby on the way here in another uh two months we don't have that kind of money in our cash flow to pay that off and twelve months before they put a lean on our home so my question is um what would you do it in that situation that we we ... our maternity leave fun and pay that off or what do we do\nWhen somebody do that from\nThe beginning of December okay well the game plan that will usually out loans for folks is push paws on your total money make over your debt snowball Kobe becomes pile up the cash when baby comes pushed play again and take all that cash and throw it at your bat\nCorrect as long as baby mama come home and everybody is cool but the cash is just to make sure everybody's school there is no issues and we're not it's not really for\nMaternity leave unless you have to have it to eat with but I mean it's not um it it's so that we can use it so how much cash if you've got piled up or will you have piled up by the hour what\nSeventy five hundred dollars this month and like I said she's going to cheer wanting to take the three months off the bond with the baby on such and we can't do it on just my income alone so um that's why we were smart about this but set that\nGoal to make sure that you know so we got from now until December to continue to save right correct and what other debts do you have and your debt snowball how much I'm just about a hundred and fifty dollars a month for what we have in that um other than our car payment I mean do you have actual that balances you need to pay off\nTime no not on your car material on your car alley\nOn and on the dollars no got well then the four thousand will be yours that you pay it all up out of this guy and then as far as set aside enough for her to re month so you have the cash you should\nTake guys this is James child's producer of the Dave Ramsey show I'm excited to announce we're now period on six hundred radio stations

weeks ago and she was living with a man\nWho had family his wife had died and he had three small boys to make it short she\nFind a way a lot of things that you shouldn't have one is taken out a couple of title loans on her car a Rogue River check as credit card debt so to make a long story short she's got quite a few collection agencies after her\nShe can't be clear with me right now about how much she really knows I don't know I Believe I think it's over forty thousand and less than eight I'm not I'm not sure but she's racked up a lot of debt for us here\nShe is almost thirty four she will be next month [noise] my my question to you is she has no money I Do not want to pay our debt\nUm what does she said these collection agencies literally she has nothing\nAnd now she's still living with this guy now he's in a halfway house he was on drugs were his kids\nHis kids are now with one of his sisters and his mother so she now as a single mom with a new baby on her own\nRight to interfere in Arizona gave myself and my husband the responsibility of taking care of the baby now we can go wherever she wants but maybe stays with me\nOkay so now moved in with you\nShe's living with me the ... the baby on the mother correct\nOkay good good that's good news okay good so here's the thing that um ... what you tell the collection agencies is is that she has nothing and so for now they will get nothing\nAnd that she's dealing with bipolar and you know you date she is what we in the business called judgment proof Oh absolutely can sue your pants off but they can't if you don't have any pants and\nThat's what it amounts to okay\nWell that's what I was thinking that he wasn't you know her boyfriend had said to me well I didn't make lead find anything that she wasn't aware of it but she can't make those decisions is what I've told them\nWell she she you know we've got to come back to that in the second book let's assume that debt is valid for us it's not that much and it'll probably be good for her to work our way through it when she gets back on her feet\nShe might even got a job right now I Know I Know yeah I Know\nWhat I said when she gets back on her feet mentally emotionally is working\nYeah we're going to let her let her um probably reap the rewards of her stupid in us in the middle of bipolar okay now having said that I work with we work with bipolar for years people who have bipolar always end up in financial counseling goes on\nWith him in the past year and I realize she probably had her biological clock ticking going well mom and dad have always told me I shouldn't get pregnant oh he's mad because she's on two different mints every day so she's been at for a while your\nBottom line and asked them line is is that with good counseling\nAnd with the proper balance of medication not over medication but not under medication um that that she can live a very normal life and make good decisions\nAbout everything child rearing financially and everything in a bi ever had it but it can happen again I have no choice on what happens is is that she's got to stay plugged into a properly balanced medication regime and plugged into counseling she has to want to be well\nYeah and if she does that then she can form a very good life\nWhole life companies don't sell cheap term insurance\nRight guy I contacted Vander ... last week\nWhen you get your term insurance in place you can just cancel with the company directly if you want to call the agents you can call them I don't care but you know their job is to save the say you'll\nLose your job is to run in and rescue you from yourself and so there is no reason to have the insurance review doesn't serve any ...\nI wasn't going to have it I was just going to a hundred grand can't no matter what you know but I didn't know if there are certain steps now that if I didn't take I Would lose out on getting them the most out of the cash value whatever's there\nNo there's no difference at all all you do is you just call them and get a caller eight hundred number or whatever the name of the company is and get customer care on the line customer service on the line and you know ask them if there's something they need you to sign or if there's anything we needed ... to expedite this but we need you\nQuickly to get me my cash value what's the fastest way I can do that but no you really can't pass it up the only thing that can happen is is they may try to slow walk or nor your request and you may have to push on them it's kind of like cancer on the credit card you got to argue with him to get it done\nBut no there's not a way you can mess it up you just need to be persistent is all and make sure that they follow through and change your your check\nAnd if you need to sign a piece of paper if we get them to do that that's fine not a big deal don't cancel any life insurance until you have your new life insurance in place always remember that Denise is with us in Washington DC Hi
