I don't know yet but uh I think that's correct and so here with the agreement with our colleagues and Chris Coons was never part of the agreement he's a Democrat from Delaware L like Chris but he was never part of this agreement what\nCompromise has been reached for Chris Coons he is voting no he's asking for the investigation to continue our around whether or not he's been honest about it as drinking habits so Chris Coons is a non factor here Lisa Murkowski Susan Collins and Jeff Flake expressed a desire for the FBI\nTo talk to the witnesses around the Ford allegation and ... and the fall and incredible eat any credible lead within a week\nI think the FBI is about finished everybody can look that report for themselves and see if it's changed anything I Hope we don't move the goalpost Jeff voted yes in committee with the understanding that he wanted to see what the FBI found about these accusations and hopefully get this done this week\nAll right let's talk about this agreement because it was supposed to be limited and the scope and now it is expanded out further we now\nThe the ... ah your your colleague on the Senate Judiciary committee the great senator from the state of Hawaii who wants to men by the way to sit down and shut up\nYeah which was pretty outrageous statement but anyway a senator Hirono now is saying she wants to know the FBI investigation into the quote I throwing report yeah\nYeah that's where we're at our so my dad owns a bar and so a throw in ice is like a good day in a bar so the bottom line is that solve a bunch of BS and she's not part of the agreement she voted and she's the one that said the goal was to delay\nOr the hearing long enough to get into the mid term soon and I have a Democrat replace\nA Justice Kennedy in twenty twenty she said that not one media outlets fed ask her what did you mean but they're agreement I just outlined it was a the three witnesses that Dr Ford named mess for ... isn't there any a credible leads within that world of FBI will follow 'em and that's it and we're going to vote this week\nOkay let's talk a little bit about your on the program last night on on Hannity and I thought you dropped a huge bomb shell and I was asking you look I have no idea how Jeff Flake is going to end up voting in this\nI have no idea what Lisa Murkowski is going to do I have no idea what Susan Collins is going to do a there your colleagues maybe you have some more insight than I have but\nTo me they're the ones that met privately with Joe mansion and they decided on this course now that it's an FBI investigation but we're supposed to be limited in scope is now expanded out into other allegations but it'd be a fall one vote short you up with a pretty\nInteresting and thoughtful idea that I kind of like\n[noise] well I think we've got the votes and then some but here's the question\nDoes the Republican Party abandon Brett Kavanaugh delayed legitimize\nThe way he was treated at the Senate is it forty nine what I Would like to see happen is to appeal the verdict of the Senate and the November election\nAnd take it to some of these states and see if the people in those states agree with their senator about Brett Kavanaugh the swap\nWould abandon Kevin ... the traditional way of doing business is if he fell one vote short just pull the plug\nHe's never quit I don't want to quit on him so I think Trump might be different I think Trump would say listen this man it's been abused on not given up on hand less have an election to see if the vote in the Senate really represented the Trump states were Democrats a rain\nWell I mean this is the thing I mean we have people like Joe Donnelly he's a no he said already Claire McCaskill's know already as a matter of fact most Democrats will know no matter who Donald\nTrump ... they've already against score sick\nYeah All right so now what is going to happen to Bill Nelson of Florida and Joe Manchin and Heidi Heitkamp and Joe Donnelly and well a smart question Martha ... a great candidate for the Republicans in Arizona most served their country with honor and distinction I Hope she wins\nUm we certainly could use a win out in Nevada or do you think this impacts the race\nAnd do you actually think you're going to get the votes and why do you think you get the votes\nWell number one I think we're going to get the votes because Jeff voted in committee yes I don't believe the FBI is going to find anything a relevant to this limited investigation that would show that\nThat are ... towards claims are more credible and that there's anything new about Brett Kavanaugh in terms of the investigation I Would hope they would stay consistent with this vote I think the other two Collins and Murkowski or friends they wanting the FBI to check the committee's homework I get that\nThat will be done here shortly but you're asking the hypothetical\nI Can't imagine how we would explain to the Republican Party that we gave up on Brett Kavanaugh because for one vote short when a lot of the states that led to that vote being short Trump won I Do not believe North Dakota\nOnce a highly had camp to vote no\nI agree with you\nI Am so this is why you have an election appeal the verdict of the Senate if we have to to the people of of the country in November\nLet me ask you if you've spoken to the red state Trump state Democrats that are up for reelection if you talk to any of\nThem doing it right now uh [laughter]\nSo you mean you're you're communicating hand I don't I'm not sure if they're all Hannity listeners and viewers beyond that\nI doubt if they're lifting I think we're fine but here's the dilemma that you that this process has put us in this is about the teacher the judiciary the states couldn't be higher is about the reputation of one of the finest man I Know\nIt's about who would come forward after this debacle is about sending a tone and the standard that will destroy the ... and eat the Senate alive\nSo I Know President Trump pretty well I think we've got the votes and then some but I think he's a different kind of politician that he wouldn't let the system get off the hook\nThat if we had to as a last resort where one vote short list they have ...\nWe would take this issue to the ballot box in about thirty something days thirty five we can I find that extra vote that way we would have a good nominee or have a light salvaged have a process uh saved and the people finally get to speak up here\nI think we're fine that you asked me a question and I thought about this yesterday\nSaid if Brett Kavanaugh is on the ballot in some of the states I think it changes the election you see in North Dakota there's a poll out today the number one issue in North Dakota is I'm Brett Kavanaugh's nomination is far ahead of anything else sixty to twenty eight people in North Dakota North Dakota support Brett Kavanaugh\nAll it's fascinating to me that the Democratic leadership is showing no support or comprehension or understanding of what their colleagues from states that are not New York and California have to go through in terms of reelection but the reality is\nThat I Would even argue that if they do vote for Kavanaugh it's only an election year conversion and they're only doing it because they don't the people in their state will throw him out but they'll probably go right back to to be in a party line vote would Schumer at the end of the\nDay [laughter] well you know I'm I'm not a psychologist or political scientist I don't care is like you know I'm a bad business I don't care how you found Jesus as long as you do you know if you can figure out that Brett Kavanaugh was highly qualified and these accusations have crumbled\nAre good for you and now here's the point this has become the most despicable thing I've seen in Washington and as saying a lot it will change the face of the judiciary forever if we condone it so it's not a complicated issue for me if we follow vote short\nOr less take this to the ballot box and see what happens\nLet me ask you about this whole process now we've gone through and and I do think the Republicans and you know I'm pretty honest broker I'm pretty critical of Republicans when they're wrong I Do think that they they have handled this with the seriousness the charge deserves a ...\n[noise] yes no I think they handled it properly because these are serious allegations but she identified and and look I won't go through the ... the entire\nWe don't need to we don't need to re try this case I made I don't mind you've made

happened\nAnd she identified one person that was supposed to be a I Witness to the assault\nAnd the eyewitness that that did not happen and the other people do not remember any such party is this and then the question is do we believe in the presumption of innocence\nOr we just going to jump the gun and say guilt by association Cory Booker said something spectacular yesterday and he goes well there's an of allegations out there I mean you just you got to kind of believe that they're not qualified based on allegations\nWell look let's be clear\nCory Booker sadly somebody who I used to think that a real future as a reformer or it's just sort of the Cade I mean I don't know whether it's because he wants to run for president\nOr what but he just kind of decayed into almost making a mockery of himself me he talks whatever the Spartacus moment which is a sign of such stunning historical ignorance that has a history teacher I found it painful\nUm he he makes comments like that I mean here people should know that if allegations destroy you uh then the whole process\nOf the rule of law collapses over in totally and it's sad to watch something like that you know I think could have been a positive constructive force and who's now frankly\nAre becoming almost a caricature of himself\nIs certainly a lot at stake and then the next\nThirty three days and you know there's other good economic those that have come out today I mean on top of record low unemployment and fourteen states African Americans Hispanic Americans Asian Americans women in the workforce\nA youth unemployment fifty some odd year low a we have consumer confidence all time high for a million new jobs created for a million fewer people on on food stamps\nOr you see what the president's accomplish with NAFTA the new NAFTA the\nThe new trade agreement with Mexico and and with Canada you see that he is eliminated burdensome regulation we can now drilling and war and the forty eight states uh he is literally singlehandedly save coal mining in America and of course natural gas production will now be at an all time high\nAnd we have a Wall Street journal piece today showing more Americans getting pay raises than ever before\nAnd that's the forgotten men and women that mattered in twenty sixteen the question is will they all go out and vote to protect the progress that has been made in the last two years even maybe if they don't particularly like their individual Republican congressmen or maybe think they're weak or maybe don't even know their name is\nWhat he has put your finger on the key question of this election I have as you know I've been involved in many many campaigns are actually going all the way back to Nineteen sixty and\n[noise] one of the ... one of the lessons I learned was I I don't care about the polls show me the the things I Want to see the first real votes I Want to see\nCares enough to show up and vote because that changes everything is you know we just won a\nA sixty three percent Hispanic district in a special election for the state Senate in Texas right down along the border and this we had a candidate who got lost by twenty points four years ago came back to the special one um\nAnd is the first Hispanic Republican state senator uh in Texas and that's because people were energized enough to turn out so I Would say to everybody in our audience\nWho this is going to come down to isn't holding it isn't conversation at the coffee shop who cares enough to get an absentee ballot who cares enough to show up at boat and if our side that\nThis could be one of the most historic elections that you and I've ever covered living together for lots of elections I have a hunch this one could turn into something that we would throw us\nBehind the scenes I got to give you a lot of credit because I remember speaking with you you probably forget it the day before\nYou became speaker of the houses in Nineteen Ninety four and I remember talking to you that day and the day of the election and and you are surrounded by a group of people in Joe Gaylord and you actually shared with me the information you had and you said it was absolutely true that for the first time in forty years Republicans would take over the house\nI think you and I were two of the few people willing to go out on a limb and said yeah Donald Trump as a real shot of winning this election and\nAnd people laughed at us at the time and I I Believe that then and and we proved out to be right we also the ... both of us predicted Obama would be an abysmal failure as president based on a very rigid ideology that he seemed to be indoctrinated into\nAnd I I agree with you I think there is an opportunity here to shock the world again and it the for the people listening to this audience they're going to tune in thirty three nights from now watch election results come in and they are either going to seek ... happy\nLiberal newscasters announcing Nancy Pelosi as speaker and Chuck Schumer is the Senate majority leader and Maxine Waters will be the chairman of this committee or that committee and that the impeachment of Trump will go forward taxes will go up open borders will remain\nAn Obamacare stays all this or they're going to shock the world and all these people are going to do what they did in twenty sixteen and being the shock of their life\nWell that's right and I look I mean I think what would I Would say to everybody who's listening to us everybody cares what's countries richer make sure you vote makes sure your friends votes make sure everybody you know who favors\nA solid productive work oriented results oriented system make sure they go out and vote if that happens my I'm I'm not quite ready yet to predict what am I going to tell you that\nBecause of the intensity of anger\nAbout the way the liberal smear Kavanaugh the characterization the dishonesty\nI Believe we have seen and I've been looking at data for three days I Believe that we've seen a substantial shift towards Republicans now I think that the ... were almost certainly now going to keep the Senate and probably going to increase our or or the total number of senators by significant margins\nHeidi Heitkamp of North Dakota who's down eleven is no on Kavanaugh to me put a fork in that race it's over\nAgain I think Kramer and it was a great great guy and I've known for twenty four years and he's got to get out there and keep campaigning I mean one one of the lessons you know I I had very close races including a couple of recounts and I had very big raised my experiences and I say this every candidate\nDo not quit 'til the polls closed and do not relax until the recount are so\nUh this is a business where\nM.

know spiking the punch and put in ... Idaho I ... I saw him given rent solo cups quite a few girls during that time frame I saw him around the punch that when the mole or the punch container is\nI don't know why he did but I saw him by them or their friends who remember these parties to remember how I think everybody in the county remembers that part and we have we haven't heard from his friends so I'm asking you know are there people alive today I I have a yeah I had a way out us parties and yet there are people that do that\nThat's right he's this morning sweating it provided for names of friends she says went to the parties with her one of them said he does not recall ... sweating\nIt another of the French she named is deceased we've reached out to the other two it hasn't turned back\nSo if you cannot get a single person given to you named given to you that would corroborate their story to actually corroborate the story and you don't have it and you see a pattern of of backtracking and shifting and changing\nNot not in significant facts but the most significant facts\nRemember the story was about almost on a weekend basis and I've been to ten of these parties myself where young girls were drugged and boys lined up the hall you ... so they could gang rape them\nWell um he gave out red solo cups and I saw him at a party I don't know if he did anything to the punch\nThis is so reckless irresponsible NBC how they would ever dare run this is beyond any comprehension I have now if they had confirmation\nIf they had witnesses if there wasn't a changing shifting\nStory if there wasn't traumatic backtracking they might then have some legitimate reason to air this but because\nThey want what the Democrats want which is the smearing of judge Kavanaugh to continue well they had to air it but even they airing of it made them look really really pathetic it's not fair\nThere are ... and I'll tell you the other thing\nThere are victims people I Know in my life\nOf sexual abuse I Know there's evil in the world I wrote a whole book about evil people that would ever drug rape or girl are evil\nThese people are predators they need to get off the street but you gotta have some collaboration to these things\nAnd it just comes out of Seventeen Days ago just on the eve of the confirmation vote for judge Kavanaugh and if you go issue by issue case by case you know it it comes down to do we believe in the presumption of innocence due process\nAnd simple common sense or do we believe in guilt by accusations because in each case there hasn't been any corroborating evidence at all in each case\nWhat you see is a lot of smearing a lot of smoke a lot of blood shunning but no evidence\nPersonalities has shown axiom talking about careers and finding your passion and living your life in a way that well where you get to enjoy being at work because you spend a lot of time at work you know and you should you should get something out of it other than just money and Ken's got a show you how to do that good good stuff exciting times you guys\nSo if you want to come Kansas City it's all day long the tickets are so stinking cheap you would pay the ticket price to see any one of those speakers and there's like what eight of us or something I mean it's a it's all number one best selling author is all top flight world class communicators it's the best the best sucking all star team that's pretty cool\nLaura's with us in Houston, Texas Hi Laura welcome to the ...\nHi how are you better than I deserve what's up\nHey I'm I have a question for about a fitness trail ... going to have it or they fear strength twenty five years old I'm and I'm\nWas offered to buy that last I ... I think there are a lot and I have come back and off the bat you laugh without lie and did all that I Would have to go I think that for a back yard four\nHundred and fifty thousand dollars mhm [noise] and at the table at a temperature down fat and now I can also find my own age for thirty thousand dollar pay that cash I catch the whole thing um but I'm just wondering if that\nSort of thing but it's just better to buy it rather than start out because I Know how it started out but it's like they don't want to get your opinion on it\n[noise] well um what I have found is the number one cause of small business ... is cash flow and cash flow is restricted by primarily to things that cause businesses to fail but don't take care of their tax bill and they get bombed on their taxes and they go into debt number two\nAnd so um you you increase your probability of failure ten ... if you go into debt and do this\nAnd I have to tell you I personally don't borrow money for anything and I have never in Thirty years of doing the show advised anyone to go into debt to buy a business ever and so I'm not going to do that because you have to pay this bill wasn't all those clients leave the next month or not\nAnd that could bankrupt you\nIt could be fairly easily actually does you basically don't have any money\nAnd so I don't know what the value of an insurance agency is they are valued you know you've got a a you know you've got a book of business the book of business has a value and it has a um a persistence right and I mean the number of people you lose two attrition or don't lose too attrition each year\nUm and that persistence rate and the size of the book business creates a certain amount of cash flow generally speaking the net profit after everyone including the owner that's operating ... a business have been paid the net profit the taxable income of the business\nTimes for or maybe times five is a small business equation on insurance industry might be different than that I don't know but what what is the net profit if you were running this thing after you pay you a salary\nA\nRelief for what I haven't got you know can\nYou would make three hundred ten thousand dollars in the first year\nApparently a profit I don't have access to the book yeah profit after after\nThe rent is paid the secretary is paid\nEvery body I paint at their payroll\nAfter ... after ... after insurance I don't know well\nThat's not a bad price on a business if you can pay it all back in two years in\nA war that we can check it came out here\nWell if you if you're only paying six fifty four it was sixty five thousand down and you make three ten\nYou live on nothing you pay it all back not drink at your ten oh\nOkay well then it takes three years you know All right but uh uh that's that's about what I'm Talking about then it sounds like it sounds like there in about four times the net profit but there's that too and does not include having paid you\nAnd so there are about four factor that's a fairly normal appraisal Rachel they're not ripping you off on the price of a but I Would not go into to do it I Would start to Iran\n\nAnd then when you go make a bunch of money in your own if you want to add to your own by buying out another practice you could save up the money and do that is if you are making two ten in through every three years you could save up and buy a business is worth six hundred right\nRight and so I mean that's pretty cool we can do that later and add to your book of business by buying out other agencies are buying out other stand alone but I I Can't recommend I personally wouldn't do it if I was twenty five years old if I was forty five years older but I was put to voters will I personally wouldn't do that\nUm I Would start my own and got it out I did that with this business we started on a card table my living room we've never borrowed a dime there's just under eight hundred of us working here an extra two hundred million dollar business in seven buildings\nSo um but we started on a card table my living room and all the bumps and bruises along the way I'm really glad I didn't have any debt Vicky is with us in Orlando, Florida Hi Vicky how are you\nHigh bay and it's like if they quickie you to what's up\n[noise] okay I Am trying to save my hands of law with getting his credit report prepared and claimed that he is currently deployed in the military and Kuwait\nAnd um he had found a bad back on and a collection agency has taken that we're dealing with one and twenty ... like I said I'm not an out what they had on my editor\nThey responded and a great ... offer and they sent me back a form letter that get fed one time traveling the author only the great shadow which you put it back but now we had asked for some more skip elation like\nCan you can count them time to face you're not going to fail there for ... party\nNo longer says those is a settled in full and they're the owner of the day you're fine\nIf they were geared to pay it out of it for a little wary of counting based these guys are kinda that they are not\nFair but there are bottom feeders that's who you're dealing with are probably ... ... what kind of debt is it ...\nIt was a medical that about Hillary about three or four years old\nYou know they paid a nickel two or three cents on the dollar for it and their debt buyers and they are but there are bottom feeders you're dealing with that you're dealing with a guy to phone room that couldn't get a good job\nOf course that anything will be okay with with paint on that money and we don't have to get back\nYeah if you got it in writing and your staple a copy of the check or the cashier's check\nTo that and you keep it the rest of your life in Casey's Cooper's mess up their paperwork which they might and sell it and then somebody calls you later you go oh no I have a document this has settled in full I don't know a dime and if you've ever call me again I'm going to sue all of you\nThey will shut it back down if you want to double check I I'm not an attorney but if you want to double check my advice with an attorney ... copy the letter that's fine but I'm you're not going to get something signed out of people like that there\nThat you you are a widget on a conveyor belt and you're just you know going Willie walkers chocolate factory you're just going along getting stamped that's all it is and you're not going to get much more than you got there wanting some money you're willing to give them the amount of money you got it in writing and says it settles it in full\nIt just says no more dead as do after this has settled in full as it has that phrase on it I'm fine with it if it were me how would I Would go forward and I think you're fine but be sure you keep up the paperwork because it might come up later I mean keeping the rest of your life it might be Fifteen Years it'll pop back up you never know stuff's got life like I tend to and it's unbelievable\nHow

show up on your credit bureau report and some of the whole creditors that you bankrupt on that you don't pay they might report after the bankruptcy they're not supposed to\nBut sometimes they're computers kick out that they still haven't gotten paid well they're not going to get paid just ... percent and they got the route and I had two of 'em are three of 'em reports three years later\nAnd that started the whole process over I had to go back and dispute those because they were not allowed to report that um they did ultimately get paid ...

vehicle this Fox News [noise]\n[noise]\nIs with us from Minneapolis Carmen\nI'm doing well where are you doing this better than I deserve going to be up there to sold out of it coming up with a couple of weeks I heard yeah I mean I also want to catch\nI Would love to while I Know a guy I'll get a chance awesome but it's all about but I can get you will will get you a pair of tickets so you're here to do your net prescribe I Am a lot about how much have you paid off thirty one thousand seven hundred dollars so bright love it\nAnd how long did this take it took three years almost to the days since I started the financial ... very good and you arrange your income during that time about forty seven thousand two fifty thousand or what do you do 'em by day I'm tech support at travel and expense software\nAnd by nights and weekends I work in the film industry mostly doing onset audio a button or other things too fun good for you very cool what kind of ... was the thirty two thousand it was mostly student loans but then also a a car loan and the car repaired alone\nTo gotcha okay so you a single guy making forty seven thousand payoff thirty two thousand and three years which is a you know basically a thousand bucks a month give or take during that time average and uh that's the that's really watching what you're doing you must a casual and the whole thing\nYes it was it was a very tight ... when I was a at least at the beginning stages I figured it out that um if if I budgeted everything out and all of just the basic bills in food and gas I had about forty dollars left over for months while ago it was it was tied\nUp some extra jobs and that helped but you're over ... got a little bit out of film but some doesn't teach much okay good deal good deal so three years ago you said you started financial ... personal journey began and other\nThan that I'm kind of a story well first of all my sister who's here um I did uh did your program into their debt free scream and that's where I first heard about you and I was and so I learned some of it by us most is kind of but I also we're like oh that's good enough I got it um which wasn't smart oh\nI'm so then it was in twenty four teen which is when I moved to sixty miles away from home just getting by myself to an apartment a signed a lease everything figured out everything was good and\nI had to move on the seventh of August and the sort of August my car broke down completely engine died everything is done wow and so I'm like I Need to move I Need to move now I have no way to get there in a way to get my job when I get there don't know anybody up there\nUm so I was just ran out and bought a car and I end up to that point I'd been\nSmart and only buying a cash or using cash for cars but at this point I was like\nEvery time I get it breaks down in a year I'm tired of holy ... and I like I was just like that kind of looks nice I'm going to get that one [laughter] I paid too much for it I'm pretty sure and um and so\nBut of course I'd already signed a lease so that was something I hadn't taken into account right and so moved up there and about four months later\nMight that car the engine fried brought down the exact reason that I bought a new car is what happened and so it took out a car repair alone and um because I was like I'm not going to let go this car I just got four months ago I'm going to keep it\nAnd um so yeah so replaces the engine at that point in time it was like there was I was over drafting it was it was it was bad um and because I wasn't budgeting and um I think I don't know if it was for moving gift or if it was for um\nFor a Christmas gift corny gave me a a a box for financial peace but I was still stubborn I'm so like I put it on my dresser and I'm like I I'll probably do that to get around to sleep in the same room with the box that will be okay I just wanted to actually learn it you know by us most is\nAnd um it it didn't I didn't [laughter] so um I was still over drafting and actually it was I Believe it was April twenty Fifteen when she came up just to stay over my apartment so she could fly out of Minneapolis did your debt free scream and I'm like she knows my situation\nAnd she ... she will see that on open box as you will give me a lot of crap because she knows and I can't have that only a good sister rules are exactly [laughter] so I'm like before she gets here I'm signing up for a class and that was the motivating factor so I finally got it so it's her fault [laughter] rightful\nMinimum wage to do her debt free scream you get shamed in the process that causes you to be here to do your debt free ... back to work and I'll take it that work such good family stuff right there\nAnd I should say it ends up being a pretty good book into because I went out of them got out of debt and this last April and um the singles at my church decided to go on this big trip to Montana\nAnd I am I the same vehicle that I got replaced um you know the engine replaced is an SUB so I'm like I'll get I'll take everybody you know I can put a bunch of stuff in their home I thought I Would uh on I'll take it in for a ... you see where this kind of\nHow old are you are I'm twenty seven now how long you been married five years you all had this discussion about the way your feeling about this check yes absolutely what he's trying to\nLose any we uh they just need to pray about it and figure out what what's the most wise decision\nWhich I how much you know check for twenty seven five will not pay off everything I'm not\nQuite but we do have a five hundred and saving so we could take a I think maybe the ... of that and be done with everything\nEverything but the house yeah OK yeah good and then begin your emergency fund so who passed away\nMy grandfather okay All right\nWell there's a couple of gauges we want to do a number one we want to be biblical wise which is what she was saying and pray about this and the number two we want to do something with his money that your grandfather would be sitting in heaven and so you're doing this and smile oddly enough that these are actually the exact same things\nUm because when you start doing smart things with money that's going to be honoring to his memory in other words right there and so paying off the debt would not make him mad as long as you had a process to never go back in\nAnd that's what bothers you a little bit so what I Want you guys to do is I Want you to go back through financial peace university\nAnd I want you to park this money in a side savings account that is not attached in any way to an ATM card a debit card or your checking account where you can't do it without a better for the bank\nOr you have to physically go down there and make it hard to get to impart there for nine weeks until you go through the classes to gather you've got the one year membership I'm going to pay for it for you to go to financial piece university okay\nAnd and attributes university is a one year membership you've got nine lessons in nine weeks you've seen some of them some of them have been re done since you saw them\nAnd you go through those then when you get done with that I think you'll know what to do and you take that money and worked the baby steps but uh the problem is as you said the get out of jail free card if you don't change your behaviors and\nHave something more than just a promise to yourself you're going to straighten up then you could really cause a problem lighter um yeah and so what you want to do is proved to yourself during this nine weeks that you have changed your behaviors\nAnd when you all are looking at each other going okay we're really doing this we're not screwing around were not goofing off we're not going to\nIf we're really going to do it\nNo itching Dave a financial ... the issue wise ...\nWe're not going to ... and so that'll get you into a mess I and so you know I Would if I knew I Want to prove to myself that I'm not going to do this up\nAnd that's what I'm telling you to do a is so go to the non classes in nine weeks\nAnd then stay you can watch the videos and you can go on keep going you go to the legacy journey class online or you can you can get into groups on line and stay you know ... to continue the discussion with the tribe and talking about it you got every dollar plus connecting to your bank on line and that's there with you for a year I'm giving you every bit of that\nUm we sell all that for a hundred and twenty nine dollars just about five hundred dollars worth of stuff though\nAnd that's a really really really incredible value\nAnd uh it's all a church and we want you to take care of it all we ask is is that you follow this stuff both of you plug into this and some day when you're doing really good find the guy who um feels like a product and you help him out and that's all ask you to do\nThings for the call Megan is in Chicago Hi Megan welcome to the day Ramsey show\nHi Dave how are you better than I deserve what's up\nI'm I Am a newer listener forgive me for my ignorance um [laughter] I and on baby step to we have our um housing our savings that are currently working on our we have about thirty forty thousand dollars\nOn a night and quit their car if we do not have a mortgage we currently rent now my question is\nUm we're going to have it paid off within the next few years maybe even a year right\nNow we have a plan that we wanted to take our children into an RV for about two years and travel the country um however we would have to finance ticket Harvey and something to tell us when we feel like kind of have to ask them to her kids are getting older I'm terribly would\nNot like to wait if possible but I just want to see what your advice for something like that would be\nA certain a dream I like having the dream that's cool very cool well I'm not going to I don't tell people to borrow money because every time I find people borrowing money I'll find broke people\nRight and um and if you borrow on something that goes down in value as fast as an RV does I'm going to find really broke people have you ever tried to sell used RV\nAnd see now there are people in most jak\nPossible to get rid of them are they're hard to get financing on and they go down in value faster than almost anything what wheels motors they are mathematically horrendous\nOr they're just a mess and so um the other the other one is a big a medium sized boat if you get a hundred million dollar boat you can get financing on it and if you get a cheap bass boat you can get financing on it but the middle range of boats the fifty two hundred and fifty thousand is a difficult product\nAnd so you just about have to have the money to just consume it and be able to afford it so what I Would tell you what's your household income\nI'm sixty thousand\nOkay I Would get myself out of data worked extra jobs and then I Would save up and pay cash for an RV that would um\nThat would suffice for the two year period of time and then if you saw it at someone of a lost at least you got you know what I mean dead on it and you don't get caught in it it's not a problem it doesn't ruin your life going forward because if you take a wonderful dream like you have and you finance it you're going to turn it into a nightmare\nRight it's going to cause a problem for your family because I mean you put a hundred grand and an RV\nTime you get home is worth fifty right\nAnd you're going to be stuck and ... all that money and you know you're going to mess up your kid's college plan you're going to mess up your retirement I mean it could be disastrous if you do this wrong and so what I Do save up and buy one or look for a program where you can rent one for two years if we can do that for two years and turn it back in\nA doubt there is one they're probably very very expensive I Know you can rent them short term for the weekend and those aren't bad deals but a two year plan is different\nUm and when you add all of this up it might be\nThat you guys could stay in your you could travel in your car um or your issue be or whatever it is you own and stay in hotels cheaper by the time you out at all\nBecause you're going to lose so much money on the transaction and again I'm not trying to ruin your dream I just don't want your dream to be a nightmare show do it with no debt you do it used to\nAnd um and do some mathematical analysis on it and you got so much to do that while you're working to get your other debts paid off right now\nAnd then if you want to save up fifty grand and buy a three year old or a two year old hundred grand ... or something and and then it becomes more twenty five by the time you get home I'm mad at you for that that doesn't ruin your life\nBut if you if you just go write a check and finance something you're going to be in a mess ghetto and I don't want that for you I Want you to when they thanks for the call well with

than I deserve what's up\nWhile I Am kind of the issues going on my um my father in law recently had a stroke and um and so he has been in a nursing home for about a month and a half\nUm my husband and I are on baby steps sex so we're actually thinking of looking into buying a new house that might have an in law suite so we had maybe do home care at our house with him um we're kind of just trying to figure out what\nWould be better financially efficient half our house now which we all about um Ninety thousand on or buy a house the one that we kind of we're looking at on and\nSo it's like um like around three hundred and what's her current home worse um it's probably like one fifty or\nMove up a hundred and fifty thousand dollars yeah and you're using his moving into the father in law suite as the justification for doing that but obviously the whole house that the increase is not all about the father in law suite correct\nYeah we're going to upgrade our house within the next few years anyway what's\nYour home income um it's about two hundred and fifty thousand\nOr you can afford it if you put it on Fifteen year fixed or less All right I'd prefer to live because they don't want you every time you only get paid all starts Fifteen Years over again the kind of guy each the purpose right right purpose would be to become dead for a show is he financially I'm obviously not able to care for himself obviously there's no other family members\nUm my husband has a brother a we're kind of just a better situation I guess\nTo to take something like that on um ... my father in law does have a pretty he has a decent amount of money so he um he he could keep them in a nursing home for a little while until the money runs out stress for\nWell I mean you may want to shut down um you'll see capable of making decisions with the stroke\nIs yeah I think they're um mentally and physically it's had\nA lot so how much money when you say he's got a fair amount of money\nUm he's probably a like a three and a thousand [noise]\nOkay well I mean you could make a deal with him that if you got your half of the inheritance prior to his death that you would agree to care for him until it was a full time and go and get your one fifty and then you can about pay cash for themselves\nYeah okay\nAnd you know you would want to clear that with a brother as well everybody needs to be paid just as a kind of stuff this was apple off\nSo you're real careful with it and go okay you're still going to get your buddy but we're two hours now you know and we're going to care for him and we'll take care of him um but that's a heavy commitment on your old part right and in other words if I were in your shoes the way I Would want to analyze that would be\nIf you reach a point being at home and your husband's at work and you don't want to do this care that you guys would be willing to write the check for the in home care nurse\n... yeah I um I think that we'd probably still need a nurse to come in\nDid it the smart thing to do is just get rid of it they're horrible they never live up to the expectations the resorts sat and the only way you're going to exit you're timeshare

always think we can out earn our stupidity\nWould just make a little more it'll be okay it is you know you'd make a little more when you're selling you know I just got to make a little more it's all I got to do it for years of my income will go up and my dad would go up and if I had to change something so so Ronnie or what did she say that talked you into going\nThe one thing she just said hey we've got to get on the right page where we were both on opposite opposite ends of the spectrum ... she was a spender how is the ... and I knew how to develop spreadsheets but I didn't really know how to go about paying this all off\nMhm some strategies and you know that's\nSomething you could buy into yeah it'll be on the same page being on the same page as a big deal\nWhen we first got married day we we're all about buying a house and we got married and twenty sixteen ... and we're we're looking at houses were ready to buy and then we realize we're up to dinner eyeballs I Can't even afford it\nAt all [laughter] it's a shock yeah so we got to do something to do something okay so the spreadsheet nerd who needed a strategy goes to the clash and what did you come out with Ronnie\nWhere you were how what light bulb moment that you have a ha moment where he went oh you know David it's amazing when you\nQuincy Jones says be humble with your\nCreativity and graceful with your success

millionaire today\nThat was not your brother in law that said that that was the guy was one point to making his opinion matters\nTo Loni is with us in Hawaii are I'm Sorry I Want to Hawaii I'll get all these out a Hi Connie how are you\nThere thank you very much for taking my call sure how can I help\nI'm Wondering what like you'd have to make it in a place where the cost of housing so astronomical\nYou have to make an astronomical income right because\nYou don't get a pass on math if you live in Hawaii California or Manhattan math is still math and so if you buy something you can't afford it'll still bankrupt you write\nRight\nShoulder you know ... or so the problem and the problem is dramatic\nAh for a guy like you who probably is a a a native Hawaiian and probably your grandfather and grandmother were and uh it's all you've ever known and yet the housing prices on the islands have made it were a regular working man can hardly afford to live there\nWith\nThis like Silicon Valley right I mean you can't afford to let you can afford to work in Silicon valley but you can't afford to live there you have to live the forty five miles away an hour and a half commute to be able to afford a house their problem is you can't move that far out 'cause you have this thing called an ocean [laughter]\nCan't move that far out of town and it gets wet yeah but I I don't know I mean are there areas I Know why who in Maui and of course the big ... got his own issues right now but a little volcano action but the uh I Know a lot who in Maui are outrageous or the other islands\nI think I think so I mean I think I Would probably have ... of places\nThat you know somebody could um afford a but the problem is typically like you said it's like it\nIt's an hour and a half of your even though we're on an island and you only got to drive Fifteen or twenty miles with the worst traffic in the nation\nAs a two lane road it's a beautiful view but you get to enjoy the view yeah right\nOr the neighborhood is not you know you might not necessarily want to read if there are\nRight right okay so there is some options along those lines um then I you know there's not a magic answer to it what I don't want you to do and that's why I started the answer of the way I started to what I don't want them to do is just give yourself permission to do something that's harmful to you\nJust because it just because it's expensive and you throw up your hands go well just the way it is and they rooms you just didn't understand was not me it's math I mean math still a problem when your house payment is sixty percent of your take home pay because real estate's expensive\nYou're going to go bankrupt I mean you're not going to make it your kids aren't going to college are going to struggle financially you're going to struggle you can't keep that from happening and so you've got to uh you gotta you gotta bite the bullet into a neighborhood you don't love a commute you don't love or make some other arrangements um\nOr honestly truthfully what happens is uh are you Silicon Valley as an example of just reading an article about the other day the number of people that have left\nIs absolutely amazing 'cause they just yeah and then they're having the bus they're bussing service workers in\nBecause they can't afford to live there Ali bustle man and you know some of the ski resorts face the same thing they build housing for the workers because it's the only way they can get somebody to stay there because you can't afford to live in Aspen\nAnd work in Aspen as a as a ... you know as a ski patrol guide right you can't afford it is to expand right and so it's the same kind of an economic issue on these micro weak on economic situations but\nNo you cannot it's almost impossible to live on the island of Manhattan and make less than a hundred grand\nYou're right it just meant Iraq medically very tough and so you end up cross in one of the bridges and I'm ... and living out in one of the other boroughs um and in order to get your costs down enough to actually survive and live your dream of being there\nSo I'm hopefully you can find a way to you know mix in the neighborhood idea and the commute idea\nEnough to get a value that works what do you do for a living\nAnd I am a firefighter okay while as a part time on the flight attendants\nOkay cool and are you married yes what's your wife do\nRight now she pretty much stayed at home with the kids\nHow many kids um two two under two oh fun and what's your household income\nYeah [noise] I'm about five thousand a month a home\nOn average their town of fluctuates on my part time job kind of fluctuate depending on how much are you know work at a\nLow for a fire fighter have you got a lot of stuff coming out of your check\n'em on a really it's about\nI think my deductions for about thirty percent below\n... I mean do you have other junk like insurances are something coming out of your check\nUm no I don't know I think\nWell what it was a major city and so I'm just is this your not exactly in a rural environment here so I was just guessing I didn't know right uh I I rented a firefighter from like a hundred all over the place so I'm all yeah\nNot at all in that Hawaii has to be a a captain ... which is a promotion of the way\nProbably could be yeah\nI ... and you are you in are you doing\nAnd on for all for that kind of a routine yeah three days every other day and then for yeah you know I might instead of being a flight attendant might look at a part time a business on the side you might make more than that but on the flight attendants stuff\nA lot of firefighter guys I Know have great side hustles that they make almost as much as they do it's far off\nAnd they're really fabulous I getting in construction business painting business or something like that and they make really
