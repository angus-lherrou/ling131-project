changing\n[noise] a very low probability now if they ask you your opinion\nNow that's starting to say that they are starting to recognize that there's something wrong but right now none of them think anything is wrong with all this craziness and it's crazy and the main is what it is\nUnbelievable dysfunction but I guess you could just sit down and said mom you know enablers are the nicest people you'll ever meet mom you're one of them you're a nice person nice you're so nice you cannot say no\nYou're so nice that you think about doing things for my sister that you're doing her favor and the actual truth as enablers are not nice people because they actually bring harm to the people that they're enabling because they're enabling they're causing them they're helping them to do things that are bad [noise]\nAnd doing things you know not being a fully functioning self supporting adult to thirty eight years old is a bad thing and to enable that to cause that to occur you you've done harm to your daughter [noise]\nIf you're listening to me in Europe for thirty eight year old living in your house that has been there for a long time and you're buying them cars on unless they're mentally deficient in some way\n[noise]\nYou are doing them great harm [noise] because they have not they've never had to grow the strength of character to stand on their own and when you die they're going to be up a creek I mean you built out a trust fund baby here while you were still alive is what you did oh so awful\nDan's with us in Charlotte Hi Dan welcome to the ... show\nHow are you doing today better than I deserve sir how can I help you\nGet to hear I actually I have I was I'm twenty five years old I'm when I was born I think three months after I was born my family gave me theory\nOn ... um I've had them everything\nThey total about four thousand dollars as of march ... double check to the I haven't had time to sit down and do it but I was curious on your opinion what should I cashed in and get like liquid immediately them 'cause they're immediately even though their interest rate is four percent of\nYeah but don't you have do you have a pet at all\nNo no I'm actually graduating college uh luckily with no debt my parents helped me and I I I'm\nGood how do you have do you have a um your emergency fund built of three to six months of expense was\nActually just took a hit on my truck a water park broke\nSo I had to I Would imagine that that might have had to use this money to make sure you had an emergency fund once you've done that is there is any of it left I Would start investing\nAnd move on to what we call baby step for Fifteen Percent of your income going into retirement so but yeah they're they're not\nIt's not a great place to park money long term and it's not a great place to park on the short term either one so I don't use savings bonds for anything Jesse is with us in Fargo North Dakota Hi Jessie how are you\nCast in good how are you good how can I help\nSo [noise] I'm get free and then in my house uh about two months ago a good Mike yeah for my car uh is worth six thousand dollars and the angry and just went out on a couple of days ago ...\nNot good so I\nI have a thousand dollars in my emergency fund right now mhm I'm my I'm deciding do I go out and buy a thousand or vehicle or do I spend a three to four thousand dollars to fix my current vehicle\nMhm okay well the car is probably worth a thousand dollars as it sets salvage right\nCorrect\nAnd so if you can spend two thousand on it that big kind a like spending three 'cause you could have got one for it put two ended his worth and then you could sell it for six even if you were going to turn around and sell it if you can get it running for two\nProbably what I Would do much north of that I didn't want to start to think about it but I mean that you know you're going to lose five thousand dollars now or you're going to lose two thousand dollars by fixing it and selling it for six you follow me\nYou're right so I'm probably fixing fixing it was an old used engine what what happened to the engine\nUm [noise] he ... the mechanics said that there something\nBroke and ... and he doesn't know why it just I was driving it and it just started coloring and wouldn't go anywhere\nOkay you need a new mechanic\n'cause I Need to know what's wrong with the car I mean something broke in it well no kidding\nIt may engine how can I I Know I don't know whether there\nI Know you don't know what it is but the mechanics ought to be able to tell what it is I mean it if it dropped to ... that means that blew it it's what we call blown engine and in that case you're probably going to buy used engine from a junk yard and have someone put it in there and you can probably do that for a couple of ground what kind of car is it\nIt's a four to four ... four okay I mean you could burn a vow of\nOr something and that might be six hundred eight hundred bucks to fix it\nNow he he said he said it blew the engine\nYeah but he didn't even know what it is you said right\nYeah I mean you need another opinion dirty and find out what happened to Ted gum car but anyway the your worst case scenario is you put a used engine from a junk yard in there for a couple of grand\nAnd you sell the car for six foot six in your pocket admonished too that you've\nTaken out of your emergency fund and then you put some money with that and move up in car a little bit but you're probably going to repair this car before you sell it because you probably will make more money on it that way\nOr even net of an ancient but not not above five thousand dollar in genetic two thousand dollar engine so again a six thousand dollar car does not get a brand new engine in it\nYou put a used engine from a salvage yard and it's what you do\nKelly is with us in Antigua Hi Kelly how are you\nI'm good how are you there better than I deserve what's up\nI'm I'm okay and they had they got killed and became a crack house now and it's way below market because the lady is trying to how quickly that she can\nIn fact the u._k. and we don't have our um our downpayment saved up yet\nAnd ... and you don't even when they're still in there\nNo no no we're we're going to say\nWhy don't you said you were in it I'm Sorry okay so you're our baby step too but you don't have your emergency fund order downpayment\n... she said that he would be willing to actually kind of owner finance it or or Eighteen months and and then she would put the entirety of the payment that we may thirteenth hundred dollars a month towards the balance of alone at the end of Eighteen month old and grow\nRight no but what I pay a hundred bucks for that policy in this situation may be\nAnd that's really high for a forty year old per thousand you see what I'm saying so you know it's just a matter of relative cost to the amount of coverage and and just does it give you sticker shock when you look at it the last thing of course is if you remain on ... a long term your goal would be the same\nAs it would be for those who have insurance and that is by getting out of debt and building wealthier need for insurance goes away\nOkay because if you have a million dollars in your four one K. and you have no debt house or anything and you die your wife can probably make it\nOkay ... that's called self insured in other words okay with the increase maybe the amount of the emergency fund at all if I'm remain I'm In trouble\nProbably yeah yeah um\nYou know just because again she's going to be facing something and that would be part of your self insured wealth building picture that we're trying to go for a long term and we go for that either way I mean the goal is raise the kids get them out of the house so they're not there to have to be fed right\nA goal is to get the house paid off and everything else paid off and then build a huge mistake if you've done those three things you know somewhere in your fifties or sixties you becomes completely self insured maybe sooner because your wife would be okay if you left or behind with a huge pile of money no debt the kids are gone and make sense\nAnd so we work towards that that's why we suggest term insurance instead of one of the reasons we should disarm insurance because ... as you were finding out runs out so it's a couple of three suggestions or but I'll tell you this I think within five years you're in trouble\nOkay if you stay clear of the diabetes if if there's the diagnosis doesn't recur\nSo um but as I can tell you more or it used to be that if you had diabetes or cancer or heart you were just done no no no amount of time but the insurance market has gotten much more sophisticated in analyzing your actual situation case by case and those three things do not\nPermanently mean no life insurance ever now again\nYou know cancer diagnosis two weeks ago you're not in trouble you know but if you've been clear of cancer free for five years and somebody told you never get insurance you may be able to get insurance\nAnd start to look at that rate it but it won't be you won't get premium prices but you check on that folks you check on that no calls and talk to him no dog either it Susan is with us in a way of I don't push the wrong button Susan's with us Susan there she is on is with us in Raleigh North Carolina Hi Susan how are you\nHi there how are you there are better than I deserve how can I help\nUm my husband and I and I are about fifty eight and he plans to retire and it it can I Will probably retire earlier and that uh we're in pretty good shape how we don't have any that you have a four O. one K. and I have a great time well\nGood how much is in the four one K.\nUm [noise] the minor at Seventy five and him and he actually about\nForty and for like when ... step pepper and account with a a financial adviser that I'm probably two hundred thousand okay and what's your house for 'em to about two hundred and it's\nPaid for yes now so you're probably millionaires where to go\nUm well yeah I think but I like to think about it [laughter] it's okay I got a little bit I hear about fame okay I'm mainly you know when we retire or he won't have the insurance highway so\nWe do we have a [noise]\nA long term care insurance guarded outweigh care good and on but he does have that how how ... at MIT who are so my question as his old actually said we um [noise]\n... um I think I think the amount of money and no I Would\nI make sure you had your emergency fund and blood and keep enough in there to

data analyst for ...\nAnd I'm an event planner for crew\nVery cool good for you guys welcome very good so tell me the story what happened thirty nine months ago they put you on this journey\nWell not four years ago we were getting ready to get married and that so we had a financial talk and we realize that we had about the same amount of\nAnd going into a marriage and so we and we knew that that would limit our options and in life you know I didn't want it to move somewhere or you know such jobs things like that and so we knew we wanted to be that phrase but we didn't know how ... and that was only knew at that point and\nAnd leave at that point out you know that that's really normal and it's just part of being an adult and we didn't know it was even possible and that\nA few months later and we got married and we had a few people mention\nA Ramsey and financial PC University in passing and we didn't really find a lot of weight on it like okay that's coal and stump sounds complicated no thanks [laughter] and and then I was out at lunch out with my friend Tasha and I she had her wallet with her and I made fun of her and I was like your wallet is huge having here\nAnd she's hell you know my envelopes are in there and so I finally had asked like okay fine explain what this envelope deal is to me because I've been hearing it and know what it's about\nAnd so she told me about your podcast and Irish and on my way home and I you know just kept listening and I finally talked about Nevada and they said you know\nThere's a either a Ramsey guys than mentioned to me a few times and it looks like he has\nA financial plan and part of that is getting out of debt and maybe that's something that we need to entail mhm and that was about a month after we got married and and months after that we started our first budget mhm\nHadn't been to ... and so I didn't know he was supposed to participate in the eye and try to how I did the budget on my own and I presented it to him and I said you know if you're willing to do that thing he wise and and I was like if you're willing to this I Need you to sign this\nMade me stop you already did it they may any sign the contract yeah yeah\nShe knew you know I I was cautiously optimistic yeah um because\nAgain I had kind of lost that hope of I Would ever be out of debt I remember going up thinking praying like man it'd be nice to just be zero again you know starting a zero\nBut she made me sign it and I was like are just going to be like a a diet fat you know the next fad for a diet you get on it for two or three weeks and next thing and you know you get back to eat and um so\nShe made me sign it and you know I stuck to it you know if I put my name or something yeah I Do a big deal that's that's my name that's my word is my bond you know she made me sign it\nAnd she knew that I was very good I like that\nWow it was fun yeah and so those ... those zero base budget was born at your house ship well and it's game on him\nOn a few months later we take ... year actually coordinator for the first while you know and we've done in about five times since ...\nYeah thank you how neat course Dave and I I just take a few moments you know to the to the listeners and and those are you watching it on YouTube coordinate in a few\nClass you don't have to have the answers Dave and his team on the video have the answers you know it's nine classes over nine weeks just take two hours a week that's Eighteen hours you know instead of binge watching TV and keeping up with the ... people out of keeping up with the Joneses so\nThere were no sign you up and ask them about doing it infomercial I don't know regularly scheduled programing [laughter]\nOh thank\nYou very much well it is fun because not only to hold you accountable but you get to watch people you really get a front row seat to watch people change their lives\nAnd those nine weeks you know we've had stories folks come up to us and and and and one of the older gentleman or a class with tears in his eyes just saying you know\nI've never stuck to anything in my life and and I'm doing this and it's working I'm seeing I'm going to fall over there for a while just it blesses you and you know it's more than the facts the figures in the math it it's really changing lives I I Wish we could\n... just a temporary thing it's not that I don't like you investing in four one K. when you get to be here for you easily with no payments in the world except the house payment can put Fifteen Percent of your income in retirement\nBut the problem is you're delaying how long you get there and here's what happens the things that we focus on in our life\nAre the things we're good at are you married\n[noise] no I'm Single I Am twenty nine years old\nOkay are you dating [noise] yeah I'm actually in a relationship\nYeah I've been married for three years in actually trying to make that next step you know and then next year or so\nOkay so have you noticed that while you're in this stage of you're dating\nHow focused you are on her\nYou know what you focus on you're good at have you noticed that [laughter]\nThat is true yeah and and so you know it it's ... and it's a behavior thing it's a psychological thing it's a spiritual thing it's an emotional thing and that is is that ... and so it's more that's more of the reason to stop the investing in the math\nTen percent that you're putting in is not going to cause you to get out of debt that much faster but what does he is when you're like all in\nA mall and like you are with her you're all in ... you're all in okay you're focused you're concentrating\nAnd and that's that's what we want you to do with the debt here for a short period of time I want you to be all and I'm not doing anything I have no life I'm focused on working extra I'm selling stuff I'm not doing anything ... beans and rice rice and beans\nI'm getting out of ... ... ... and that's where it's you out of that that\nThat's what gets people out of that more than the mathematical manipulation so that's what's important about temporarily stopping you're investing when you're in baby step too and that's why we suggest that hold on I'll have Kelly pick up and we'll send you a copy of the book the total money make over and it'll help explain that a little bit further for you\nThan a is with us in a City Iowa how do they how are you\nHide eight and a huge fan I think I use your name and talking to people that my name's squared homes to [laughter] oh I'm Sorry how can I help\nAbout my um my youngest\nBrother he's Twenty years old and four years ago he like hit from behind a highway speeds train car road race [noise] my parents are going into litigation for what his future will be like um\nKids in a job training program kind of just learning basic skills like how much and you know big groceries things like that\nSo many and I got a brain in an area out of this yeah yeah the\nGrand jury and a lot of memory as you can um and coffee and so I'm not really sure how to you know my dad I Do some research and I was like well I'm gonna call Dave and she like he would say about 'em there's legal stuff as far as hot as secure as a future for Daniel that he'll be taking care of\n... I'm Sorry what a sad situation I assume they have an attorney right they do yeah and they've assessed the ability to ah that that the person to hit them had insurance and or assets that make it worth chasing them around right\n[noise] yeah it's been a long process over four years just kind of thing what would happen with Daniel or the timeframe that now that the effects of this accident\nWell there's a I mean there there's not a magic thing but a a a good attorney in this situation should be able to help you run the numbers out that basically has a you know the the accident has taken away his earning ability for the next sixty years\nMhm that's a very expensive thing that he is lost that they need to pay him for\nMillions and millions of dollars mhm it is what he would have learned in his working lifetime is now gone yeah and so to offset that due to the accident is the liability of the person that caused the accident and you don't have to be an attorney to know that okay and so the calculation\nOf that I'm ... and ... you know could we get a big enough lump sum that it that a lump sum invested\nCauses a you know Daniels income to never be a problem again mhm and so if you take a million dollars and invest it and then you know as an eighty thousand two hundred thousand dollar income the rest of his life\nAs an example you see what I'm saying and um and that's probably not enough but I mean that's that's the that's an example of a calculation to offset what he would have potentially earned in his working lifetime because that was stolen from him\nBecause of this accident and uh I'm not being angry towards the person that I have no idea the conditions are the accident but that's just the liability that that person then their insurance company has as ... as a result of law okay and your attorney's already told you all of that that's a basic thing\nIt's like business law one on one okay the very first movie learns that kinda stuff so um\nYou know once you do that then you're saying we're we're replacing his lost income and certainly then medical bills in addition to that\nAnd uh and medical bills would include any kind of job training we can do to help him have a quality life skill or you know anything we knew increases quality of life going forward right\nMhm but there's not a magic number to figure this out is just a there there's a calculation you can do to estimate these things and you know all of those things added together makes the\nUh you know the the settlement negotiation with the insurance company go on now they may be in there probably is um limits to the insurance coverage\nAnd there are limits not to the liability but to the assets that the person has let's say this person had basically no money\nAnd the insurance companies on the hook for half a million dollars\nYou negotiate the rest of your life and you're not getting more and a half million dollars because guys broke and you can't get blood out of Iraq\n[noise] okay in so you sue him into oblivion and it won't do any good suing people to make up my money it just takes money they do have if you win and I'm obviously you'd win here but um but it take a long time so the settlement\nMay be that the insurance that is the person carried maxed out and max is out there are a lot of their assets now if that person is worth two million dollars and the insurance company has a million dollars then your maximum you're going to get out of his three million dollars take everything the person\nHad if you wanted to do that\nAnd get the million dollars other insurance company to Megan from that person they solve everything they've got and give it to you\nOr or give it to Daniel in this case and so that that's how the calculation works but what most folks don't realize because this is so emotional so tragic is that the math is limited by the insurance companies max pay in their policy and the assets of the person that hit them [noise]\nThose two things out of the gathers most you're going to get that because there is no magic money doesn't just appear because something tragic\nAnd this is definitely tragic for a situation I'm so sorry you all are facing it but that's that's how your math all shake out so what I'm going to be doing is investigating what the ... on the insurance policy is and the asset based on the person who hit them that's the thing to piece of information I Want a real quick\nBecause then it doesn't matter if I calculate ten million dollars is the settlement offer if there's nobody gonna pay attention\nOr can pay it this is Dave Ramsey show [noise]\n\n\nHey guys this is James child producer of the day Ramsey show I'm excited to announce the we're now hearing on six hundred radio stations across the country to

something I Do know that you describe it while you guys are fired up I mean\nDid did what got you this on fire 'cause I mean you did go nuts and a good way of life back I mean it's got to feel great

car\nThat charge\nYeah listen I let me tell you how ... let me let me tell you how bad the decision okay here's what you make the decision the color is a she's exactly right it's completely impractical it's a toy yeah okay it's emotional but this is like asking her to show her wedding ring and she doesn't realize that\nI Would never it's good to get that right\nAnd it's a car you've had for twenty five years ... it's called actually means something to you number one number two it is a ultra small percentage of your net worth if you would call me up and said I make sixty thousand dollars a year were broken in debt and I love my car I would've said weighing little boys show your car\nWhich are not broken into your worst three freaking million dollars you could drive this car off a cliff and it you wouldn't even notice it doesn't change your net worth one iota okay it's such a small percentage of your world it doesn't matter it's like most people buying a biscuit\nOkay and so it doesn't matter it just sits there now\nAnd you ... [laughter] I got my my co pilot yeah I can tell [laughter] you understand so I I Am afraid that this would be one of those cars that if you tell it ten years from now you'll see it on TV I you know I don't even\nSee I don't even care about I don't I don't even care about that ah the point is it's a toy you like it yes and it's so freaking smaller percentage of your world it does not matter yes if it's if it if it becomes worse a dollar tomorrow it doesn't matter\nIt doesn't change your life that's right you know it's a very\n... that's how you justify toy you do it on ratios you know and I like this friend of mine just bought a jet he just bought a ten million dollar jet okay and that's a nice jak but\nHe's worth two billion\nTen million as a percentage of two billion uh-huh that's like this car for you or like most people ... it doesn't affect his world\nTen million and my my I grew up many are Tennessee ten million dollars is what we call a lot of money you know a forty thousand dollar car sitting in your garage is what we call a lot of money you know I grew up that way but it's a small\nPercentage of your world and that's how you can tell if you're out of whack or not with this it's just a toy\nIt's just a toy it's just an expensive toy and so she wants to renovate the dining room and spend forty thousand dollars a it's a you can afford it shut up you know\nAnd if you want to go on vacation and it's been ten thousand dollars on a cruise you can afford it I make two hundred fifty thousand freaking dollars a year and your debt free and you're worth three million dollars you've done it man you work like no one else can you enjoy some of it I Want you to be outrageously generous on the other hand I don't want you to be wise and continue investing\nAnd I don't want you to go buy something that costs a million dollars is a toy that would be a line in your world Yes sir but this is a small percentage of your world and so that's why you win the argument she is correct that it is a useless impractical thing\nBut it's not\n[laughter] man\nSo it's you know she wins that part of the argument I get that she doesn't get it I don't blame her for that part [laughter] she's actually using common sense but it's a small it's a limp on the lips brush you know [laughter] and that's the way you look at it and so you know I've had to learn to work with that working\nWith the wealthy people because I couldn't emotionally grass and I caught myself saying stupid stuff like ... much for a guy that guy and all that is is poor men thinking\nThat's all that is that's loser talk ... she'd ever have a house that no one should ever have two houses no one should ever have a ten million dollar jet no one should ever have a forty thousand or ... stupid stuff like that\nAnd I had to quit doing that because when I look up and I realized for some people ratio was its lent\nOn a limb brush and that's if that's what it is then you can afford to do it if you can you know burn it in the backyard as on in next week's bonfire and it doesn't change your life then you can afford to quote waste the money unquote\nFor enjoyment purposes and that's fine that's why you work but also be generous be giving be helping others with this wonderful networks in this wonderful income have that as part of the mix I'm sure you are you told me you're sending your employees through a financial piece you're doing other stuff I'm sure church or whatever that kind of stuff's all great but it just doesn't\nMatter\nAnd it's just like me I Am looking at my buddies ten million dollar jet ... dead credible such we ride I'll just tell you man but it's a small percentage of his two billion dollar world a billion you think about that way I thought I was a million [noise]\n... [noise]\nHe's got two thousand million [noise] and out of two thousand million he spent ten of them you see what I mean as a ratio that's not much it's like having two hundred thousand dollars in spending ten thousand bucks [noise] I think about\nIt didn't change your life right you'd be All right but you know when you know you don't even feel it hardly\nIt doesn't it doesn't move the needle and that's not being wasteful\nAt this stage of the game so hold on to any that's a wonderful question made my day to get to answer it and I'm Glad the co pilot was there it was a fun discussions hang on I'm going to send you a copy of the book the legacy journey you you to read that you will enjoy it it's where we discuss wealth all my other books are about money\nLuxury journeys about wealth wealth is different than money\nMoney creates wealth but wealth is different than money so different subjects are different subject biblical like if you're if for those of us that are Christians those of us are the people of faith the Bible addresses wealth differently than addresses money money as transactional money's the thing we use to buy food for kids and that kindling wealth is different\nWealth has more problems with it but more opportunities with it\nAnd one of the things is that you are encouraged scripture early to enjoy the fruits of your labor [noise]\nNot to be a heat ...
