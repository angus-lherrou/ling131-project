I'm promoting my my uh my book that today in the last couple of days mom a lot of left leaning shows and they go they go nuts so crazy on the president's response all\nYou want to illegal immigration you have democratic and Republican presidents in democratic elected officials that of voters it was I don't understand why just enforcing those laws\nHave everybody saw ... ... ... well could there anthropology\nSo why don't they well it's a lot of things are we better off economically than we were two years ago\nBy every single objective measure the answer is yes the growth of the economy consumer confidence jobs created the number of people leaving food stamps or out of poverty eight million Americans so you know by every measure and more you know\nBottom the bottom ten percent of the society shut the wages of five and a half percent according to the wall Street Journal over the last Eighteen months that is a direct result of the president's policies but also the fact that he cut the slack at the border\nAnd so he made it tightened up the labor supply and it's giving lower middle class families shot now have real living wages\nWell that's the story that you actually tell in the book by the way Anthony Scaramucci is with us author of the brand new book it's out today we put it up on Hannity dot comments on Amazon dot com and bookstores everywhere it's called Trump the blue collar president I first heard that term from one of his sons of his either Erica Don I don't remember those Donnie\n... get hit and he called them the blue collar billionaire yeah and I said ... Don if you don't mind going to hijack the nickname and just switch out billionaire and put in President because at the end of the day he resonates with these people for\nYeah look I I I think it is and you talk a lot about his background you you talk a little bit about your family background it's similar to my background and and it's amazing because the only thing that I really care about what motivates me it's not politics itself it's not a game to me\nBecause the policies that we have in a country as we do now greatly impact whether or not people are on food stamps or whether or not there are jobs we now in two years have us a scenario that is not\nUnfolded in this country since Nineteen sixty nine and that is we have a million more jobs than we have people on unemployment you know

even go get a bite to eat if you're a public figure which was really sad I mean when you're doing it in front of people's wives\nIt's not only sad it's pathetic when you're going after Pam Bondi Sarah Sanders and our kids and\nSecretary Nielsen and all she's do all they're doing is trying to sit in a restaurant and have something to eat telling you know one group of Americans they're not wanted here in any way what are you doing here get out of this you know they're going after an a Ninety year old guy Henry Kissinger now who served his country with honor and distinction is that it seems

basically lie to bamboozled whatever term you want to use the voters in their state in the case of brothers and even calling the people of Tennessee ignorant in the hopes that they'll get that seat and then they'll they'll be a a basically a Chuck Schumer senator for that state\nYeah just so that your listeners if you haven't seen every video a there's a video in Missouri we did where were they were talking about Obama's using Claire McCaskill's views and the staffer says Obama and the ... will have the same views and everything but quote people just can't know that\nWell in this video the video released last night on your show Sean there's this another guy Gordon is his name he's the staffer\nIn and Heidi Heitkamp Fargo North Dakota campaign office and we and we see an Obama poster in the office there's a big one of those are the bottle looks like the messiah on the wall this big poster\nBut then they took it down right before the press came so we asked why did you take your power closer down and the staffer says well because the presses here and and we take it down and when the press comes is what Heidi Heitkamp staff say so it's more it's basically the same thing in each of these red states\nThey have to mislead they have to moderate voters in play to the progressive base well we just have them on tape saying it we all know that Heidi is is liberal but\nShe's going to be selling liberate once you get selected that her staffers are emphasizing it here and they also say that she's not going to run again so because this what Jesse over and says in the studio quote she doesn't want to run again so she'll just do good work while she can which means that she'll do the things that she can't talk about right now\nIt's just so revealing but I I think this is really this is not an accident that you're getting very similar responses and every place you have now gone I mean these are three big huge massive Senate\nRaces and you have caught three major Senate candidates all admitting that they ... they're lying to the people of their state to get elected\nBut I Would argue that it ... represents the entirety of the Democratic party we now know what goes Maxine Waters told us that are parties pulled or they don't want me to say it they want me to stop saying it but I'm not going to stop saying it impeach forty five ... well that's ... ... ... ... ...\nIt's ... it's particularly true in these red states there's ... there's a kind of a story here that we found that were confirming suspicion is that ... that's what we do it very costly confirms suspicions and we've always known this to be true but my point is just have integrity\nDoes it it's not really left or right thing\nI was at this first and I'm In conference with all these big hon chosen media who were ... you know very cheering and and hearing it may I suggest have integrity this is about just doing what you say you're going to I think it's more pronounced in the red states with these Democrats running because they have to lie\nTo them out or if they have to work with the moderates and they and they can only make one choice\nOnce but if you're not ... choice it's lying is this a purposeful misinformation and propaganda campaign 'cause they have no intention of doing what they say they're going to do they have a very different agenda the people working for them know that they have a very different agenda\nAnd so they're really just lying manipulating I mean it is the worst of the worst in terms of politics because there was an open contempt hatred and a feeling of superiority that Claire McCaskill has that bill Brett isn't hasn't Heidi Heitkamp as towards the people\nOf their state Penn well they\nDo it so hateful Sean that Claire McCaskill has asked for a special prosecutor to look into me he asked her opponent Josh Hawley who's the attorney general I've never met Josh I yeah I don't I don't he doesn't work for me I never talked to anybody in his staff but McCaskill ask to be a special prosecutor to investigate project Vera tossed\nTo investigate hair on camera speaking her own words are there any restrictions in the state of Missouri about filming people\nNone no and it it it's in her to the attorney general asking for me to be investigated his like someone\nTelling you not to go on the radio and talk it's it's it's it's it's perfectly legal for me to do what I Do in Missouri they're just Pennsylvania I Can't do it Illinois I Can't do it but thirty eight states I can record people as long as I'm In the room with them and I'm reporting\nAnd it and let me say something else Sean if it's wrong for me to go Under Cover and record these folks then how wrong is that for them to mislead the voters if it's ... it's not fraud for me to record people but it's certainly approaches fraud for her to misrepresent in such a awful way\nTerrorized a acts are despicable and have no place in our town has been accused before making terroristic threat with

what you heard there was a video that has gone viral a viral by I'm Brandon\n... and in light of all of the news today about suspicious packages and pipe bombs and you know the very scary environment we've been talking for a month now about how\nWe had what how many women are run out of restaurants movie theaters Pam Bondi Sarah Sanders secretary Nielsen Ted Cruz and his wife Henry Kissinger we saw what happened this weekend a Boulder thrown through the window of of Kevin McCarthy's office\nOr Mitch McConnell has alluded to come up to the table just eating in a restaurant with his wife\nDied banging on his tables stealing stuff from his tables throwing it outside creating a scene\nIn a hospital in environment\nI don't see conservatives doing that and so we have this sad tragedy today where we have suspicious packages now send to people like uh the Clintons and Obama and CNN and and looks like Maxine Waters\nAnd somehow immediately ... gets turned into blame conservatives blame talk radio blame Fox News my name is mentioned in particular and I've been saying all along I don't want anybody\nAny political persuasion hurt in any of this yesterday on this program I pointed out on George Soros hates my guts\nI Believe it's spent millions of dollars to destroy those program apparently an explosive device was found near at George Soros is home and his mailbox the New York

has got to stop and that was yesterday\nI said that this all happens today and I say the same thing we did the uh if you don't call yourself conservative and go about being violent go your Thirteen Days use whatever passion you have and and vote at the ballot box that's how we do it in this country\nWe don't threaten people we don't intimidate people we don't go after women and children in

they've had\nBut [noise] I I think you just say I'm you know I don't\nDo well at this this and this and so I'm Better for that that and that and um [noise] ...\nYeah I when I come over here to your organization I Want to be bring I Want to be a game I Want to be bringing you a hundred percent competency and when I'm outside of my competency it it doesn't indicate a lack of ambition it indicates a lack of self awareness on my part and I'm self aware enough to know that I'm not good at that\nAnd um so that's why I Want to step down not good at this and if that's the truth anyway I just tell the truth it's amazing when you do that how it just kind of releases you Eric with us in Afghanistan are don't get a lot of calls from Afghanistan Eric how are you\n[laughter] pretty good how are you doing\nBetter than I deserve your military\nA ... a former military I'm a contractor announcer\nOkay well thank you for your service how can I help today\nYes sir I'm I have a rental property addition to my primary home that I also rent out um but I was just notified by my property manager that the house came up on the market or the house of\n'em that Kim ... am I kind of threw it out the uh there was an inquiry if someone to actually wanted to buy the house and I my question was whether I should just sell the house or continue renting it out\nWhereas the house a sin El Paso Texas\nWhere's your home\nIt's in southern Arizona\nOkay so when you finish contracting in Afghanistan and you live in southern Arizona if you did not on a rental property in El Paso Texas would you go by one\nOf what I go by another property if I didn't have the opportunity you know as much in your lead\nIn southern Arizona and you did not have any rental property and you got it ready to buy a rental property I suspect you by southern Arizona not al Paso I'm absolutely yeah because you'd probably have this house left over from being stationed there right\n[noise] um yeah well I bought the house right out I was a right after I got done being stationed in Fort Bliss a I bought a home there then um I moved I ah because it was it was a good deal together they're down VA loan so I took advantage of it which is stupid in hindsight\nYou know ... ... after the reason I Want to sell it is because you wouldn't buy it again\n\nAlso for the same reasons you wouldn't buy it again you wouldn't keep it by the way you can apply that decision making people do almost anything if you got a boat sitting in the yard that you never used and you look over and go you're not never buy another boat then so that one\n'cause you don't use you know for the same reasons you wouldn't buy another one you saw that one and that is true of investments that is true of rental properties true of a lot of stuff if you wouldn't buy it again\nThen don't keep it cause by keeping it tomorrow you bought it again in a sense so I think you take the offer or get a really sweet offer up the off or whatever but\nUh dumping I definitely do but\nNot only is in Little Rock Arkansas Natalie welcome to the Ramsey show\nPatty how are you\nBetter than I deserve what's up [noise]\nUm do you mean the choice you can hear I'm really not sure what you're going to tell me to do but we're working through your plans they made me sad swearing baby step to um hang up that so we only have no one dollar emergency pot and and the only thing that we have left the payoff is my car\nWhich I just discovered you recently and her six months ago and it was I really needed a new vehicle we did the damn thing and buying a brand new car\nI Do a lot on my car about thirty five thousand dollars good lord yeah well\nAbout ... less than a week ago I was involved in a pretty big car accident and that cars now total okay\nLuckily we actually bought the GAP insurance to cover the difference between um\nAwesome when you're out awesome\nThat were that free\nYeah hey but we only have one\nEmergency pond and I need a new car like yesterday gotcha\nAnd so what's your household income\nUh about a hundred and fifty okay\nAnd um and you have one car right yes okay what does it\nHit the two thousand a yeah I don't know a GMC drug has on strike good good okay they said for aren't good [noise]\nWow uh I'll tell you what I did when I was in the same situation one time\nI rented a car for a month while I saved up the money to buy a car I'll bet you could say five thousand dollars a month yeah probably so and then by five thousand dollar car and drive it for six months or four months while you're save up a bunch more money and get you a Fifteen or twenty thousand dollar car and put cash for it\nOK so rent for one month by five thousand\nThen okay then drop it for four or five months and by your Fifteen or twenty thousand all with cash\nOkay because I don't borrow money anymore\nRight well we also we consider the alternative talked about it or if they were thrilled about it but we we have a four O. one K. but no\nNo no money anymore okay we don't borrow money well okay if you borrow money over on its debt you borrow money\nIs that borrowing it er yeah it's borrowing casting or if\nIt's even worse if you catch it out they're going to charge your temperature penalty blush thirty five percent on your taxes that\nSupport us borrow money a forty five percent interest effective way to buy a car\nAnd I know yeah I ... I didn't know that those were the face yeah it's horrible horrible you know they\nAre ... and what you got something ...\nNo not not valuable enough to come back or with\nThe rent the cheapest thing you can rent or are you you're working on some\n[noise] uh no I'm not you're not and I I stay home with my kids okay I've got three kids so okay\nHow long can you make it without a car\nI Can't make it a day with it [laughter] I really can't get my husband and his hours like where he works and leaving home with three kids and having to do all of them to and from school so I Can't be without a car I I'm In a rental right now oh\nGood okay what are your what what rental costing\n[laughter] well with my my insurance is covering it right now so how long recovery\nUm for probably about another week maybe\nGood good just milk that all the way out right okay and then find you the least expensive rent or you can get for one month okay that'll get the job done please don't go rent something super nice\nYeah no [laughter] I'm not I'm ... I'm probably just trying to keep it I've got 'cause it works\nOK if it's not if it's not super because the more you spend on the real the less you can start to buy a better car right right but you just need a little five thousand dollar get around in a little mini van just something that runs yeah for just a little walk 'cause you make a ton of money\nYeah and you've been broke for long enough for you to be in broke broke business how to fix it but if you go back and start doing normal people stuff you're going to be broke\nAgain you know normal people do yeah\nThey go into the thirty five thousand dollar car prove that they were stupid the first time that is what normal people to do but don't don't borrow money you are not that desperate and you are not that needy and you are not fed entitled you're none of those things\nIf you are you're going to be broke again you're gonna be normal people as normal people were broke meeting and entitlement and you're not entitled to your mom and she'll probably something into your ... and then move up and in fact what I did when I was in your ... should\nYou should go to jail for those are the Ramsey show [noise]\nThe\nIn the production officer for the ... that was up you'll find more on our channel where we have over six million you can find Jeffrey screen\nNow for me to have that mortgage and not a PM I\nAh there had to be a certain amount of equity which I didn't have in cash at the time so my father essentially gifted\nNeeded so what's your question\nThe question is do I pay back the uh the the money to my father because I'm paying him that I'm saying and be sure\nYou have a second mortgage on your house speaker bad you're going to stay on the house you're paid off for the ... absolutely and then you pay also first mortgage and then hopefully by then that rental will have come up to its ... worth at least what you owe on it and you can get rid of it and get rid of brother out of the house\nAnd then your debt froze when I was a yeah yeah\nYeah I Would not only a rental property that I break even on dude it's not my goal I saw that rental property as soon as brother could move if you weren't forty thousand dollars upside down but you're forty thousand dollars upside down so well let's wait on that market to recover a little bit because most real estate in the U.S has not recovered you're in a weird situation there that if it hasn't\nBut I'll give it a ... a year or two or whatever and let's get it recovers wants to write a large check to get rid of it I'd rather out a hundred and thirty six dollar check than a what a forty dollar checks all do that for a little while but this idea of buying property to subsidize relatives that we're losing money on and calling the tax write off this is not good\nWith money but you didn't set out to do that it's just where you ended up by marrying into it so when it comes up in value dump it in in the meantime pay off your second and pay off your first there we go think\nKevin's with us in Denver Hi Kevin how are you\nDoing good how are you doing better than I deserve what's up\nThings taking my call a two part question I think you know the first part need help on the second part um\nMy dad came to me a couple of years ago and um he was getting ready to retire and want to take a or offered for me to take over a whole life insurance policy for them I think he just kind of looking to get rid of the premium before he retired [laughter] I Would like to get rid of it now knowing a little bit more about whole life insurance\nBut he keeps telling me I Need to hang on to it mhm and keep it so that when he retired or excuse me when he\nPasses I have money to pay the taxes on ah the inheritance money that will be coming to me and\nSo how large assistant state\n[noise] uh I Would say it's close to a million\nThere's no taxes on his estate so he doesn't know wasted on taxes on\nNo you don't have the ... there's no tax federal there is no federal or state tax on the states over ... unless they're over five points for nine million this year\n[laughter] okay so everything like so all hit so he's he is can I think he's converting most like his raw than it\nFor only caves and all those things so\nIf it was a state is one million dollars there's no taxes on the\nPhone pay any taxes on me but\nNow you might pay a state probate tax but there's no federal estate taxes on in the state of one million dollars\nNot see we're okay\nTo have over five million dollars for the fence to get ... so so if he's got you know what he's doing he's territory in the back what the idiot whole life agent told him that selling this\nUnit to keep their costs every state tax planning\nAnd and he's been hearing that since you were born and so he's a leading those same words back out like a parrot and the cage\nOkay but I don't know what he's talking about okay and neither did the whole I imaging for that matter\nBut if the okay well I'll just say okay and so as far as like a conversation with him about that because when he gave it to be obviously had some value is worth about eight thousand\nWe're down see I really appreciate you appreciate the intent behind this the more I've investigated it I think I'm positive that my son angel coaches telling me that I can do a better job with this eight thousand dollars than leaving it in this policy this policy is not couldn't grew in with\nPlans so while I Want to honor you and be grateful to you until you think you also need to let you know I'm catching it out [noise]\nAwesome and

pondering it for a while\nI'm after my divorce I moved to a guest and started working and I moved in with friends and rented their garage apartment mhm so I have used the kitchen restroom and laundry on normally think she would renting a room um\nAnd I came across a condo that I'm Wondering the realtors old and I had an opportunity to buy it\nFor about fifty two thousand and its values anywhere from sixty five Seventy or ... and ... and was rented when I bought it for a couple of years ago and it makes about Thirteen hundred dollars a month\nAnd Iran where I Am in only five hundred and this one's going to be available for the end of the year and I've been hunting do I want to move into it make it my own home now that it's making\nMe show you bought it and it's rented right okay and what's your income a average about thirty five thousand a year emissions\nMhm okay well I ... the way I answer questions is what always ends up happening with me on stuff like you're describing is um what feels good and the short term might not be taking me to my long term goal\nAnd uh so uh when I'm always asking myself as warm where am I going to be in ten years in which of these decisions takes me there okay now obviously you can live in a garage apartment how old are you\nI'm ... and you can live in a garage apartment or your sixty five and you could make the transaction will spread here I'm making extra some extra money doing that is what we're saying and then you the question to ask yourself is is that worth it to you\nDoes that get you some place that you couldn't get otherwise um my tendency personally would be to do everything I can to increase my income during the next ten years and be living in a condo or I mean you\nAnd it in the garage apartment as a a a place to heal and and get reset after a divorce right\nBut that really wasn't a it's kind of camping when you're not a college student [laughter] I mean it's just camping that's right you know and so this isn't like your destiny it's not where you want to be long term but ... and so my point is just because the numbers work on something doesn't mean it's right\nSo if you killed and you've settled you got your found floating under you again which I'm guessing you do when she bought a condo um probably moving into that condo but the ...\nWhat am I going to be doing ten years from now like Seventy thousand understood the thirty five and what trick them on their what am I going to do to get mine to part a healing as believing in yourself again at away ... Arab living yourself in a way maybe you never have to where you put yourself on a career track to get those in comes up long term\nBut er ... if that's where you are that's where your head is I think I'm going to move into the condo now if your head is saying you know I think I'm probably\nGoing to this all I'm ever going to do I'm just going to route thirty five thousand into retirement\nYou might want to know the garage department or the other money in your pocket but I don't think that you\nI'm not really like to purchase a house yeah keeps ... rental income now well let's get it paid off is paid off oh good that'd be awesome them you will by if you get an extra money to about ... to buy a house with\nI'm saving not at the moment not OK than living in that condo with no payment at all you know you can do that and again getting your income up get you into that go faster so um\nI I'm going to be working on the income side of the equation and I'm probably going to go and enjoy that paid for condo it's a it's kind of like saying uh on back\nYou know what I'm saying is that does that ring a bell with you yeah okay yeah you're back yeah they all use back and you got a future and it's right and it's going to be good and ah yeah moving in the condo but it's on my way to a house of them will pay cash for 'cause my income going to go up and goes\nBack and uh yeah I'm I'm not going camping anymore fifty five\nIt was okay to do that for a little while no shame in that game but that but you you you know you got past that stage now your back is that okay yeah it's cool thanks for dropping by saying\nOpen phones at triple eight eight to five five two to five Claire is with us in Atlanta Georgia Claire how are you\nI'm good how are you know good how can I help\n[noise] um I have a question for you with all your data for a little less in the air now and I feel like we are on it had on retirement we're behind on college savings tracked you can show how old are your kids you\nBut it's not a huge one I mean it's going to produce Fifteen twenty thousand dollars a year in income\nAnd um then they've got the other uh Fifteen or twenty thousand dollars a year coming in from Social Security give or take ... and they got to live on that otherwise they burn through this nest egg and they end up having to sell the farm and their old age right and I don't want to do that so as long as they'll keep\nA spending less than the income that is produced by the two hundred\nAnd their Social Security stay on a ... household budget that's below that then the game plan you and I just talked about will run and perpetuation no matter how long they live okay is that there's a logical to you as long as they do that then yes I Would do it in a heartbeat or because I Love the idea of going into your\nYou know your latter years with everything paid for especially your home box when your home is paid for and you're sixty seven\n[noise] stabilized for the next Thirty years till you're Ninety seven your ... your your housing costs and your housing costs as the largest cost in your budget [noise]\nSo if you're renting your rent goes up every year for the next Thirty years if you're sixty seven and and that sounds like homelessness to me later unless you've got a huge mistake\nAnd so by owning and by owning with no debt you've completely stabilized your golden years\nTyler

or five and six um when I got back to the Oklahoma City area ...\nA couple of months later he started to change my job an employer and after a ah what appeared to be a better job of it for us our family at the time and it produced nothing but a year worth of turmoil and so now I just lost my job on friday last week [laughter]\nI'm working through the debt snowball paying off my student loans [laughter] I think I pretty much a barn myself out of my career path and so\nI'm a pharmacist and light training as skilled in such that I'm at this point I don't see myself as as marketable for other areas and so that's why I'm trying to figure out I've been reading books like crazy this last year [noise]\nBecause I'm passionate about um small business I have an entrepreneurial heart and I still like working with people that work in the health care sector has just eating my lunch this past year and so I'm trying to figure out what\nTo do now so it's not actually doing pharmacy or dealing with the customers a chew up it's the bureaucracy and show how is there another way we apply your existing education skills to the market that rather than just work in a CBS\nCorrect um\nI don't know but I I Would think that there's got to be some kind of calm sea air apostolic airy idea out there kind of old school\nAnd high end delivery or something that is not all insurance based in driving me crazy right\nYou know like at the doctor's goes from the doctor docs go to the ... model right mhm correct where they lower the number of patients that they see and you pay a flat fee and you've got like they'll do house calls and everything and they actually know their patience now\nRight that kind of thing where they lower they did a different kind of practice management is the I Wonder if there's that kind of application to your moral I have no idea I'm making this up right now so I'm fully\nPharmacist job market is saturated um they've they've been dumping pharmacist more and more pharmacist and ever since I graduated\nIn ... in a CBS in Walgreens is just they're just step in and out that's the ... world so right and that's\nThe world I came from you know a smaller smaller sector and you know here I Am I lost a hundred and forty five thousand dollar income and\nI'm thinking well you know what next to it obviously I Can't pull the lead up to the doctor the doctor along and I\nWell I mean there's ... there's two things one is I'm trying to think through if I'm you a business model cars you got an entrepreneurial\nItch to scratch that is some kind of ... low insurance no insurance apostolic airy model where you use your licensing and your knowledge is you're very specialized in very valuable\nKnowledge right and that's not what's your burned out on your burn out on the corporate crap right\nAnd uh and so is there another way to be a pharmacist in today's world that you invent even if it's on a small scale I don't care I'm right I'm going to begin to investigate business model ideas like that around the country and see who's doing\nLike an old school of public area I'm almost thinking like a soda fountain and the thing like the old days you know kind of thing we're stuff but I don't know I I'm just making this up in my head sitting here I Know that ... ... here's the thing I Do know about the marketplace\nThe very very high end high service a luxury markets are booming in every sector\nThe uh low end the bottom end which is all price based is booming middle grade product lines and services are not booming in any space\nThose are people I mean in other words cheap hotels enriches or doing good the ones in the middle are struggling right\nAnd so get off on one end of those spaces you figure it out the bottom and other commodities how spacious killing you so we're probably going to some kind of high end thing is they're the ... to rich people model some way I don't know I'm making this up\nI'm just asking questions out loud now while we're discovering that I might go back in ... for another year or two of the grind\nTo put away two hundred thousand bucks to go live my dream\nWith okay but I'm not going to submit myself to Thirty years

start throwing all my extra money at it that swept in my budget\nUm because I'm thirty I'm Single I'm and I'm worried that you know when I Know one guy does provide me that women are coming up ...\nAm I going to have the house and I'm forty if I get paid off maybe she doesn't want to be here forever and I'm not sure that I'll stay here\nSo does it make sense to start throwing all that money to get paid off early um two years into the mortgage gold paid off by the time I'm forty\nYeah I was wondering I Do think it makes sense after all that money at it would depend on male not sure if I'm going to stay here forever\nAbsolutely sure throw the money that here's an interesting thing we're not spending the money when you reduce your mortgage and you're homeless paid off and you sell your home they give you a check\nAnd all that money comes back to you so it's not like you're throwing the money away you're actually investing it at the rate of interest that your mortgage interest is\nBy much is your mortgage interest rate\nIs proof points to Seventy five percent her\nTo show you have a three point three Seventy five percent savings account that you can withdraw from until you sell it it just I just got I'm Sorry I'm just trying to get in there I mean Fifteen Percent of your income and baby step for going into retirement live your life\nAnd my extra money that you find or squeeze throw it up the mortgage until the houses bite off\nIf you do pay it off and said young lady comes along and you guys choose not to live there or you just choose not to live there you sell the house they give you a check all that money comes back to you we're not spending the money the money's not leaving it's just being deposited into the house\nAnd see the difference you know her as aren't going anywhere\nSo yeah you know I'm going to go ahead and pay on average no downside to this except that you can't get to the money without selling the house which is actually kind of a good thing Cindy is with us in Houston, Texas Hi Cindy how are you\nHave that you\nCan better than I deserve was\nWell me and my head and currently for baby step when\nThey can and I'm Linda okay we were instantly hell of a wedding anniversary yeah hey hey hey dad who went now didn't kick me they all went on an average ... credit\nAnd a boy scout out like you know and I'm trying to keep it or we\nDon't understand how his brain works\n[laughter]\nI thought you said the two of you were working on a plan to get out of that\nI that we work yeah\nI'm more concerned about the fact that he's not on this plan than I Am the ring\nI agree because what my next week he's going to finance power tools\nYeah and then he's going to come on when the new ... three weeks from now\nWe'll have a lot more that you go [laughter] go what's finance that six thousand dollar drawn their lawn mower you might be a written that give you a payments on you're riding mower you know I mean Syria ... did you see the breakdown breakdown is we can't get out of a whole hour digging out the bottom\nGot cold and so I'm a lot more concerned about his lack of grass that this was the family goal that I Am whether or not you keep those ring over personally I'd take it back I mean I've been married thirty five years and you know\nIt'd be nice to have an ice rink and you can get another ring I mean there's stupid rings everywhere I mean there's not a big thing it's not like at your wedding ring or something and it was a an anniversary gift that you all couldn't afford\nIt exactly and I mean it's sweet\nBut dumb or you know right yeah I think\nSo but I think the thing is here yeah I'm probably taking it back but more importantly I Want to take his brain and ... back and a little bit better you know and to to you all the ... are we really doing this or not because otherwise you're you're never going to get there\nBecause apparently he's not on the same page or on that's big thing I mean Ninety percent of this question is around that temper sense on one of the keep the ring or not so young and so this ring is not going to make or break you get out of debt plan one way or the other but this behavior will\nA it will be twenty eight\nOkay um is what\nIs one of the nature of what's the nature of his disability\n[noise] um [noise] a losing land [noise] okay I'm In a in a concrete labor accident\nGotcha okay leg or arm what flag okay All right\nAnd I'm not to minimize that because that's a horrible thing but that's all\n[laughter] yeah and\nYou know I think basically what's been happening is there's been many different disputes back and forth in counter stewing going on inside lawyers\nAnd that's all that's all behind this you think now you think this was coming to a head\nI think it it's I'm finally getting to the point to where there's going to be actual real settlement um talk and um there's just been some shady things going on in the court cases\nWell what else what twenty million dollars is they're going to they're going to mess with it you can count on that yeah okay\nWow\nAll right so uh and what is his emotional and mental state\nI think\nHonestly he just wants to be working he wants to have you back at work\nHe doesn't want to get what a prosthetic leg and he'll be able to do something with his mind now he won't be doing heavy lifting things or something like that probably right\nExactly that's that's the hope that except for he's got a desire to do those kinds of things so it's really killing him to sit around\nWhere I don't want him around but I mean I'm you know usually actually make more money with your mind that you do with your body anyway\nRight as a career path so generally speaking is so that's forced upon him here which is I'm not not a bad thing is what I'm thinking so I I think he he gets to sit down and ask themselves the question what do I want to do if I could do anything in the world because now he can do anything in the world [laughter] right right\nAnd so I'm going to coach him on finding a career that he loves and I'm going to spend a very small percentage of this money because it won't take as much of that a small percentage of that much money to do some kind of retooling as far as education goes\nAnd saying okay I'm going to get a degree in X or y or I'm going to get some training in X or y and I'm going to learn to be one of those things over there whatever those things are that he wants to do so what's he want to be when he's fifty five years old that he's made his life's work and his career and he gets to choose\nThat now that's awesome can be a self employed track that could be a a a track of uh some kind of a a I don't know I mean anything but it's obviously not going to be something that is physically um demanding okay\nRight that's okay that's okay in terms of technology though um he's kind of wanting to start his own business now and getting all these ideas and they have no water that acts implication on something like this that you know when they'll be facing with [noise]\nIt depends on how the settlement is structured and you'd have to talk with his uh uh uh attorney and was from tax advice to find out how it's structured I shouldn't be in California as well that's correct now\nThat that's the first thing you need to figure out what the taxes are going to be and what the lawyers' fees are going to be and then you know what you're going to have met the second thing then is figure out what we're gonna do I would I Would urge him to pretend like this money's not there by and large\nI mean if let's say there's twenty million after taxes just to use a number okay and you know if you've pulled a million out to start a business and to coast for a little while emotionally\nAnd that leaves you're Nineteen making that you're just pretend like you're not there\nThat makes sense that's pretty bad yeah I mean you can buy anything you want to do with that right that's a lot of free money okay so absolutely something along those lines and then what I Want him to do is to build himself a uh the Bible says in the\nUh in ... in the abundance of counsellors there is safety in the multitude of counsellors there's safety so he needs to build himself a little board of directors a needs an estate planner\nA that's a lawyer he needs a tax professional probably that as a lawyer but at a minimum is a CPA um [noise] a needs and investment person in his corner I'm\n... probably you when someone else sitting there that will look at him and telling me stupid when he's being stupid and he needs to commit himself to\nGathering information from this group of people before he does something\nDoes that make sense because white people lose money like this is is that they go off on their own and they don't have the tools mentally to to manage this and you've got to put some people in your life not that do it for you but the coach you\nAs a group to do this I don't want one person managing it then that's how I get shy strict right\nAnd and and I don't want you doing it by yourself because you're probably not completely equipped\nBut we're going to put a group of people around him if he wants to do some real estate and he has a high quality real estate person sitting on his little board right we've got a CPA we gotta stay plan or we got a tax person may be a real estate person may be an investment person in the mutual funds world and then we're going to build a game plan here this is what we do with like an NFL player that asked us what to do\nI get a they got a ten million dollar signing bonus and they're really good at football but they are not really good money\nAnd so they don't if you don't end up on the front of Sports Illustrated be one of those stupid people that lost and million dollars here's how you do you put some people in your corner that teach you coach you and God you as a group\nYou don't have one person doing it and then you gradually over the years become very adept at managing twenty million dollars\nWith the help of these people teaching you and they all need to have the heart of a teacher they don't need to be arrogant and bossy\nBut then and they need to say they need we'll look at him and telling the truth and kindly but go listen here's why you don't want to do that you can do it but here's why you don't want to do that and then and he needs to commit to keeping his hands off of the bulk of it and put it in investments them forget it's there\nAnd he can live the rest of his life easy easy but if he goes and decides to open a twenty million dollar technology thing he's going to lose it all by the ... three years from now all the money will be gone\nYeah that's what I'm afraid of two young I'm so don't do that you know don't don't don't open the twenty million dollar business don't open a business that\nTakes up all this to open a business it's very small he's got plenty of money he doesn't have to prove anything okay take your time either tortoise don't be the hair\nAnd just take your time put a group of counselors and the multitude accounts for safety put a group of counselors in your life that are professionals in the different areas that can speak to you teach you and how old is he today\nTwenty eight so the goal is by the time he's thirty eight he has a clue okay yeah along the lines\nOf managing twenty freaking million dollars\nIn it'll take ten years for him to intellectually and emotionally get his arms around it and he'll lose it all if he starts trying to do one or two plays with all that money\nI'm going to open a journey to pizza parlors all gone it's all gone yeah I'm gonna I'm gonna be the next Facebook no you're not it's all gone\nIt's all gone OK so take a small amount of it and get yourself back to work to give you the dignity of work and to create an income where you really don't need any of that money any way and it just sitting there growing and then this horrible tragic event\nTurns into a financial blessing that changes his family tree so there you know for generations to come\nBecause he's wise with it does that make sense\nYes thank you very much appreciate all the five\nMaybe that's exactly what we would do if we were in a situation appreciate your call and thanks to James child's Kelly Daniels and Blake Thompson I Am Dave Ramsey

now retired police retired military on the perimeter in the property on every in every hall of every school and that's one way to protect our children and I always ask a simple question\nAnd it's not to me about the gun debate if you find yourself in a building with an active shooter would you prefer that there are ... you know that there are trained professionals\nIn that building with firearms as a first line of defense\nEspecially knowing that most of these shootings or over in seconds and even when you get the best response times from the greatest police departments\nIt's usually by the time they get there it's ... it's they're just counting the casualties and and trying to protect and in an orderly fashion those who either or injured or weren't injured\nSo it's a thought um\nIt's
