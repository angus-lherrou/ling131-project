{"month": "10", "state": "AL", "station": "WERC", "content": "At the party where this alleged assault had occurred and they did their due diligence and they interviewed the four people and under the penalty of a felony\nAll four people went on the record\nAnd some didn't remember the party in any way shape or form including\nProfessor for one of our best friends and professor Ford at identified more judges the one guy that would have been an eye witness to this alleged assault back thirty six years ago he said absolutely positively did not happen\nAnd then when the Democrats you know and you have senator snowflake going along with senator Coons and all we just need a limited just limited in scope just a quick short investigation FBI they should be able to wrap it up\nWell in this case and we'll talk about the other cases as well well in this particular case we don't have a place we don't have the time we don't have a location we don't know the house we don't even know the exact year to be honest\nAnyways so they had very limited\nRoom to to corroborate professor Ford story of what the the only available venue for them or avenue for them to pursue this case\nRemember they were never going to make conclusions are recommendations that's what we learn from Joe Biden back in Nineteen Ninety One anyway they sprung into action they went out we had already had professor forge a testimony now multiple\nPoints you know even though there was some inconsistencies between her testimony before the Senate and our test and the the count that she had given to the Washington Post and her attorney failing to hand over any evidence as regards in regards to how the polygraph was\nAdministered or any of the therapy notes that they willingly handed over to the Washington Post without hand that over to the FBI so\nDeborah cats who was the liberal activists attorney for professor Ford has donated tens of thousands of dollars to liberal causes and candidates and she's the one that set off Paula Jones ... it was only ten twelve minutes\nI mean that doesn't constitute any type of work for sexual harassment\nWell that shows she's not consistent on the issue that was the person recommended by Dianne Feinstein who's making the recommendation while she's meeting privately with judge Kavanaugh and not telling him of any of this is going on\nThat's the left wing activists lawyer though that professor port I don't blame her I mean Dianne Feinstein was the one that suggested at all\nAnyway so the only avenue for the FBI to pursue in the case of professor Ford was to ask\nThe for people that are ready testified under the pedal\nThe felony the same questions that you would normally ask where are you there do you ever recollection no no no no no and mark judge your supposedly an eye witness did you see this\nBehavior this account a professor ports happened no and after that I don't see any other area where the FBI has any investigative tool available to them to go down and discuss\nThe story that already been told by judge Kavanaugh as his passionate denial\nAnd the story been told and bearing accounts and the Washington Post and when professor for testified before the Senate Judiciary committee it wasn't that hard to jump for the FBI Democrat says oh now the fixes it what are you talking about\nWhat what else can they do at that point\nWhat other investigative tools they have if somebody makes a serious allegation about a a serious crime committed\nAnd they identify an eye witness in the room at the time of the alleged attack in the eye witness denies it the person that has accused denies it there's no other\nVenue avenue of of investigation that they need to go into but they went further even though the New York times had a lot of problems with Mrs Ramirez is\nStory this is the this is the case that happened that was printed by the New Yorker remember that particular case and in the ... case she was claiming well back in the first year when he was a freshman in college said he exposed himself to me\nWell after the New Yorker piece came out in the New York times they went out for over a week interviewing their words not mine dozens of people all and then the temp to corroborate the story of Mr ... New York times reported they could find no one with first hand knowledge\nNobody times doesn't like Donald Trump\nAnd then they also pointed out a bit of information that was a little bit scary and they found out that Mr Ramirez herself had been contacting former yell classmates asking if they were called the incident and told them that she could not be certain if Mr cab and all was the one\nWho exposed himself well I hate to say it based on her own words that point that's it that cases over add to it\nHer own admission achieve quickly became a ... and ... that the party that she was foggy slurring her words and admitting in her own words that she had significant memory gaps from the evening so the New York times couldn't corroborate the stories and of course we've got\nYour number three allegation number three and that was the case of Julie sweat Nick\nAs soon as the woman that as being represented by the attorney of the year for the Democratic party Michael every body\nAnyway a lot of credibility issues as it relates to her and we saw all of her allegations blow up a sheep backtrack big time on her story in an interview that I don't think ever should've added on NBC News but does she gave the names of for people that she said would be able to corroborate her story and\nWell they couldn't find two of them or they wouldn't respond one is dead and the other one said she ... they don't even know who Julie sweating it is I've never heard of this person\nSo that story fell apart and you had an ex boyfriend that have filed a restraining order against her and I'm not going to go through a whole bunch of credibility issues that she has you know I have a lot of facts evidence of what she's saying is not true at all from a former boyfriend\nAnd well anyway and that was the third allegation where are you supposed to go\nFrom here I remember Mr sweat neck was claiming that on a regular basis almost weekly weekend basis it almost happened on the weekend basis that these boys including Brett Kavanaugh as a teenager\nIn high school that they were regularly happened often almost every weekend she was a time of the parties that they were literally drugging girls against their will making sure they got an ... capacity hated and that\nThey would line up in the halls of boys and the boys would then\nGang rape these girls and it happened again almost on a weekend basis and then it became in the interview well I don't know if he's like the punch shy but I saw him give out red solo cups once and I saw him near the punch bowl and\nLining up in the home I I I didn't they weren't exactly lined up in the hall but I saw him in a whole\nIt's just not anything that would hold up anywhere under any significant scrutiny\nAnd the FBI has done the best that they can do and it's interesting that all the people that have been demanding all these FBI investigations they don't want an FBI investigation into Keith Ellison\nAnd number two guy at the DNC always now

get a vote finally on Saturday up or down if if judge Kavanaugh's if we if this stands what they have done here\nWithout any corroboration in any case and I'm not even talking about the outright lies that we're told and stories that were created and pushed into the media\nBut if you if we're now going to convict people based on accusation guilt by accusation or as Spartacus Cory Booker said\nI mean if there's enough accusations either we can't put them on the court well based on his own words when he was a teenager which I've read on this program he doesn't belong as a U.S senator\nSo my hope is that just beyond the vicious porous rancor that is going on beyond\nThe accusation we don't fight of what this moral moment is about um this country and all we ask ourselves question that the white person who's been on the highest for you know land for a life time appointment Paul mentally [noise]\nNot whether he's innocent or guilty but there's not a trial to fall asleep enough questions the rain that we should not move on to another candidate\nI mean just based on the allegations is that the ... is is now the party that doesn't believe in the constitution the rule of law due process presumption of innocence\nAnd this is a guy that admit to being a jerk when he was a teenager because he wrote about it and where are the calls the interview have the FBI interview Juanita Broderick
