I've got to be the lowest one on the market um this is not looking good you know so um I Would I drop it another fifty thousand no I wouldn't you know so you know so at some point you do you laugh right in and that's that's\nSo uh but the five thousand out of pocket to be done with those two hundred thousand dollar or a hundred and eighty dollar mortgage out yeah I'll be done with that in a heartbeat I'd do that 'cause 'cause you know waiting two years is not going to help the situation is what I think I'm hearing\n[noise] right yeah exactly and we're shouldn't it kind of thing and when the pay is not a place to move in the wintertime well but I mean\nThis winter but in general this complex is not going to heal and become worse three hundred thousand two years from now\nExactly yeah it's going the wrong way and so it's\nStarting to get out of town you know and uh yeah I'm with you I I think you're right uh I don't think you were panicking what the numbers you're giving me now you started telling me somebody wants to offer you a low ball offering you have to come out of pocket with thirty grand probably going to wait the winter out you know\nMy ... spring and see what happens but there's some point that I'm not willing to be that far below the other properties that are on the market but uh but overall yeah let's get rid of this thing [noise] good question I'm sure you're facing this\nOpen phones a AAA eight to five five two to five thanks for joining us Andrea is on Instagram I'll never got over a million people on Instagram\nWow and I'm just now figuring out how to do it myself\nUm the guys at work here do it and the one I actually put a picture of their people freak out so it doesn't cause I'm not very good at it but um I got pretty good at Twitter but nobody's on Twitter Twitter Bob ... I took a bunch of troll ... I mean it's just a bunch of angry\nPeople that um don't have a real identity or whatever so Instagram like most people ... by and large not all but a block and one woman that was being a\nTest pilot from a broom but the other day but um anyway Mr Graham Andrea by the end of the month will have four months of expenses sites\nDo we save up for a down payment on a home or we start investing are both at the same time we'd love to abide by the end of next year\nIt really doesn't change the math that much to move the baby steps away you removing it um except that you're probably gonna let your foot off the gas just a little bit which you should do when you're in baby steps four five six\nBut still you know you're making a hundred how fast you pay off a hundred and forty seven five maybe six years\nThat's probably that's about the standard that's going to work out on your land and ride in a normal case study for us so you're you're doing good doing really good Christina is with us in

for some it courage man because I'm really super nervous that I'm not going to be able to do this why\nI've been trying to offer like family finances in my husband and I became engaged in two thousand and seven at the managing everything Senate quite poorly frankly worried me he's here [laughter]\nOkay is he going to cost to what's that is he going to the class to\nHe's going to be a week after an ax could go back to that he takes them to until then\nOkay well that's on line and you got a membership so he needs to go ahead and take the look at the lesson that you've been to so he doesn't get behind because this idea that you are the only grown up in the house today\nThank you gave I appreciate that you know you got to work together on this you can do what what's your household income\n[noise] ah almost two hundred I Am I didn't want to sex and flexible changes on a weekly basis depending upon how many hours do you work\nThey go so far and wide world what somebody making two hundred dollars a year I don't think they can make progress with money\nBecause nobody ever taught me how to do like honestly a contest that I'm learning in your classes\nLike so it's kinda like somebody just gave you a brand new Ferrari and nobody ever going to be driving lessons in some scared the crap out of yeah that's exactly correct\nOkay I got it that makes sense is very powerful stuff this money especially when I got a game on a grand a year coming in I mean that's something you can ... you can drive off into a series ditch with two hundred grand so good how much that you got\n[noise] well I have student loans that won the but I'm hoping it will be forgiven after three or four more years of public service\nI doubt it [laughter] no I'm sure he's thirty thousand people have applied for public service loan forgiveness Ninety six people have gotten it so far\nOh rats yeah it's not going real well those are the government is not following\nThrough on that show you might get it I don't know your three to four more years before you get there and you make two hundred grand now I probably just by the student loans off and be done with it how much the others that have you gotten on your house\nOr not counting the house we have about between I'm Still in the past tabby reading it for class that we had the in the uh the America and a couple of the ethical alone\nOkay she'll fifty sixty plus car plus student loans\nI think it'd be sixty plus student loan out\nAll the cars are included in the student in the city to sixty correct okay All right so let's just kind of there's some quick math for a second right you make two hundred thousand dollars a year [noise] you've got two hundred and ten thousand dollars worth of that\nOK\nOkay to ten divided by three is what\nYou have to do to last for a day that's why I'm hauling you're\nTwenty one divided by three is seven seven\nSeventy thousand okay three years Seventy thousand you're a hundred percent that free knock on your house student loans cars and everything\n'cause that's what he likes teams on well but I think that's kind of will be only go do it faster than that okay I'll do it every day I Will listen\nListen if if if you if let's just pretend that you might two hundred thousand dollars a year and you lived on Ninety\nFive I'd give you a hundred and five right yeah not counting taxes I'm using real numbers here but a hundred and five\nA year for two years would be to teen and wouldn't it [noise]\nYes they were in some between two and three years I Want you out of that and what

have a yeah welcome\nTo Nashville here no debt free scream yes or how much of it paid off\nWe've paid off just over Ninety thousand and how long did this take you in Seventeen months\nWow you're kicking it and your range of income during that time\nIt was from thirty up to one thirty and then now back down to thirty\nI'm so confused [laughter] well how in the world is you go up a hundred thousand and back down a hundred\nThousand is this is where our story begins I'm I took a really good job on the project construction project manager for ... pipeline construction company\nAnd that was the the big increase in income ... and then I was able to pay off all the debt and then save up six months merges you fund and then I was laid off oh and so boom there it happen all the planning\nTo K. Bebe dot com Kelley Blue book dot com private sale what the car is actually worse\nAnd I'll just make up some numbers let's pretend that the early buyout is twenty thousand and then you look it up in the car is actually worse sixteen thousand that would leave you four thousand dollars in the whole probably not far off of what you're going to find\n... four thousand dollars in the home and you sell the car for sixteen you've got to put four thousand dollars cash with the sixteen in order to get the title for the buyer\nAnd so um you have to have that other four thousand dollars you have to be able to cover the whole the journey and the amount that you are upside down\nIn the way you would do that is obviously alone and so you start working with your local credit union with your local bank and you get a loan lined up for the amount that you're upside down and you put the car up for sale and you sell the car\nFor as much as you can possibly get for which is more than they will show at four in the report lot so bottom line is you're going to be responsible for this difference either way but the differences greater\nAnd you do more damage to your life and lose more control of your life by doing a repossession\nOn so you cover the difference cover the amount that you're upside down with another loan and I'd rather you'll be four thousand dollars in debt than twenty four thousand dollars in debt or whatever the numbers are so um they ribs utility to borrow money no day rooms you don't need to move some of the debt and get rid of the majority of the debt by doing that\nAnd so you borrow and cover the amount that you're upside down [noise]\nYou know guys we been talking a lot about this millionaire mindset around here and watch show important to be intentional even with the

know straight [laughter]\nLove a great way to go you guys yeah that's so cool so what started you're doing this what made you\nWe owe one sixty five and it's like about two Ninety five\nOkay All right you're making a little profit you may get a lot\nNow it's about a thousand in mind I mean it's definitely not\nAll that and that's you know when our Don Roche I\nKnow that your gross that's before you can't vacancy and major repairs that come up\nThat is that's the gross cash flow the difference in the rent in the payment so twelve thousand dollars a year minus vacancy minus a an occasional heating and air system or a roof occasionally you're you're making a little bit of money but yet\nYou know he yeah fire five ... five ... something like that I'm a ... a year something like that mhm overall I Am reading I mean some years will be better than others and that kind of on a bunch of rental property shark and kind of do these things in my head that's\nUm the uh uh ... and what's your household income\n[noise] um if we bring about a hundred and ten gray and what do you own your home our primary um we just heard to stay on ten months ago we\nOwe to eighty worth about three hundred\nAnd ... and ... and so he's saying um you've got a hundred and thirty and uh fifty or so so you got a hundred and eighty if you saw both of these give or take 'em expenses that you could throw at your two eighty\nAnd that's the thing to do your saying we're making a little money um I like rental property these are good runners I think I Want to keep it and that's the discussion on my right\n[noise] yeah and I thought it on a great guy and we have about a thousand dollars in and got in your ... um we combined probably twelve thousand 'cause they took up we had a lot but we took a bite out of that so\nMany helped me out of the towns like baby steps are very clearly defined that you do one before you do the other you can't sort of do them or you can have your plan but you can't call them baby steps I won't let you are going to do your plan okay if you're going to my plan you'd write a check today and be debt free\nYeah the only reason I I Would hesitate because now because you're doing airplane and you\nKnow at the end of the year I'm going to be very tough and I feel you know environment\nFairly there in the event that on my condition don't come through for the next three nights I'm afraid of liquid data Atlantic I don't know anything an actor and not being a hot spot so I figure on Christmas at every loud and I would just write the check\nMhm okay let your plane okay [noise] um uh the\nUh uh you know ... ...\nYou're not making a ton of money on these properties you don't have a ton of margin in them so they could slip on your pretty quick if a ... at a minimum you know a good compromise between the two of you I'm a rental property nut I Love it I Love real estate\nAnd I want to keep 'em if you want to keep them in the big one that got more margin in it and more equity in it is the most appealing to me\nThe three the two hundred Ninety five over one sixty five one and so a migraine one and dumped the other one\nThe fifty thousand to move the needle much but the one that only got a fifty thousand more equity you know making anything on that and that you're in gash bread on that at all in which means that it could turn upside down on ya meaning if it went biking for three months you can be writing checks\nBy the year lose money on that house if you go to three months like an ... if the market softened up so you just don't have any wiggle room and that thing so it's as much a liability is is it is an asset in your situation even though technically okay\nSo I'm probably dumping the little one as a compromise between the two of them and um\nAnd if you're going to hold the other one the new guys just got a you know let's start working these baby steps the right way\nAnd following on through in getting the emergency fund done and get a proper emergency fund in place and and if your income as volatile enough that you need to have an additional account to cover of our income volatility to separate from your emergency fund than you could build that went up to\nAnd they'll just some cash position so that you're not constantly you know in the lurch back and forth I mean you making good money overall but you kind of living hand to mouth anyway\nAnd that and that's that's the cycle you're trying to break so good question thanks for joining us\nOpen phones a triple eight eight to five five two to five Mike is with us in San Francisco Hi Mike\nHow are ya Hi Dave how are you doing better than I deserve what's up\nSo I just started in October here um and I got my that's when I got my start are set so I have um with the money make over um I got an eight hundred in my emergency fund film among baby step on um the first time I'm doing a budget and and it's a mess it just seems like I just kept dial it in\n... and you only every dollar um every dollar okay\nI Am in trouble going in\nA well I just feel like I I kind of make an estimate of where I what I think things are going to cost and then I just either it seems like it it goes over and then there's things that I think we're going to have to pay for but then there's nothing really happening it stays kind of just dorm it\nYou've been doing it a whole two weeks yeah yeah well that you're you're just takes a little while to get things adjusted the first thing you would tell you is this when you're doing your every dollar budget whatever you think you're spending on food you're wrong put more in there but you're always people are always spend more on food and they think they are\nI mean I've met people go I live on twenty five dollars a month I'm going to hold it was just no way you know I mean so whatever you think you're spending on food you're spending more\nReally quick I wanted to ask one should I invested in the financial peace university um I should I get that now are kind of get it after I'm done with my thousand just put everything in their first and\nThat's up to you I mean you you can decide what you wanted to I don't want to learn just give it to you in that way you know to worry about it\n[laughter] [noise] All right now\nThat that way you can get signed up and get the every dollar plus going and that's a one year membership to that thing and then you get in the class you know you go to the non non lessons and you've got the online experience and that's going to answer a bunch of these questions as well but basically if you just visualize a yellow pad forget every dollar forget\nA budgeting and all that and just go okay here's what I make\nAt the top of the page mhm and then every dollar of my ... not every one of those dollars needs an assignment going down the page um has been Exxon food and why on utilities and Z own rent and so on down the page until every single dollar has an assignment you don't have any leftover money in your budget\nIt is a great out by made it it's definitely the easiest one I've I've done other ones before in the past than this one is definitely the easiest is are\nThe only problem is is you're facing your realities it's not the app and it's not the system even it's just the first time you do a budget you suck at it yeah you know and it just takes a month and then the next month to get better really about the third month you're doing it it'll be accurate\nTake about the rhythm of about Ninety Days about three times through it and you'll go oh I'm not forgetting all soccer pictures in Islam bounty on you know\nKeep everything tied you throw it in a pile of cash and then we don't spend it on baby a than is necessary for my survival and we uh throw it at the dead one by being mommy come home we pushed play again the pause comes off\nAnd we get out of debt especially if we can in the meantime we just created all your loses a little bit of interest on that money between now and the time the babies delivered that's all you lose it's not a big deal\nTim is with us in West Palm Beach Florida Hi Tim welcome to the day Ramsey show\nID how you doing better than I deserve what's up\n[noise] well I Would financial piece nursery coordinator and I have a pretty interesting situation going on I have family in my class I'm In between them a mom and dad is co signed for their daughters student loans\nWhich are over one hundred thousand dollars ... into I'm trying to find a way to help them and I would come and I'm trying to get a little bit better [laughter] I Know that I'm short on knowledge and experience so what's the what's the problem [laughter] well the pollen is\nThey have kind of taking the on the dad is kind of taken on can be be collector and attrition into he's pressured his daughter and and with All right you should be um but she just not interested in and actually not interested in being responsible for it I'm into they kinda cold here now in ... financial piece\nAs well with her with them um but I don't know what to Calvin ... you know\nHow she reacting now that she's in the clients\nWell she's reacting in Iraq and like she she's kind of wanting to take it on\nOkay I'm near she have an income\nNow she doesn't really have an income she's well actually she does she's working part time um\nShe married no she's not married okay\nWell her first goal is to take a ...\nYear old twenty five okay\nAnd why should not working fulltime\nI don't know apparently the degree that she always being video editing and she hasn't been able to keep a job you're out of between a responsibility and it was bad decisions in our lifestyle\nOkay I I'm kind of hearing spoiled brat\nAnd mom and dad coached on for a spoiled brat and then they're shocked she she didn't come out and become a a a great a citizen of the United states and pay your bills or are they shocked\n\nYup yeah okay All right well I mean you're ended up being a family therapist you might want to send this family to your pastor to sit down and talk through this with them but the bottom line is legally they're both on this\nAnd that can play collector all he wants but let me tell you something about collecting you can't collect blood out of Iraq\nThere was no blood there and this girl and getting money you know I could share and work much\nRight there so she's got to take care of food shelter clothing transportation and utilities first then she pays on the student loan and if she has a one to then what change do type ... five jobs and getting gear but that's going to be a shock to hurdles system though\nShe didn't like it used to working much now so I mean that so what we're doing is we're training her to be an adult and um but you you know dad as I Walk around with his chest puffed out like he like he can just yell at somebody and I make some have money don't have any money she broke because she didn't work\nSo I'm Glad they got her in the class so let's get her into let's tell her you need you treat her like she has a hundred thousand dollars in loan debt you twenty five years old so she does\nSo her answer is you need to get six jobs live on beans and rice rice and beans live on a tight budget take into roommates sell so much stuff the dog thinks she's ... and you have no life ghetto cause you signed up for a hundred thousand dollars in debt get your budding gear go right that is what you would tell a single girl that was twenty five and your\nClash with a hundred thousand dollars in debt when you\nGet her good okay then I'll look at mom and dad and they're in my class\nAnd if I if somebody came in my class and said a day we signed up because we were stupid way co signed for our daughter who doesn't work much and ah what are we gonna do about this hundred thousand dollars in debt I'm going to go do you just bought yourself a hundred thousand dollars in debt\nAnd so I Would put that in your debt snowball and I would get my button gear and pay it off 'cause you're an idiot you coach sign this\nBecause it says in the Bible you're a fool if you ... for another\nAnd you may nicer than that but that's the message so uh you know but I Would put the responsibility on both of them and let one of them start working on the bottom of it one of them start working on the top of it and we'll see where they mate\nDoes if she doesn't pay it they

to hear you\nWell I mean it's a personal decision I made the personal surgeon I don't go into debt and once I got out I don't think I could go back\nRight and that kind of at the the you know what I'm thinking about how you know because at that point that if they actually I'd fan on and we are\nNow I mean you could benefit with Bob [laughter] but beyond that to do it I mean you know it's it's some want his ... definitely not a need you have a house so ah two hundred thousand dollars how much do you make now what's your household income\nAnd I pay twenty out okay and you don't have any ... what's your home and you don't have any doubt at all yeah we don't have any guy okay\nWith no payments in the world you're making two hundred grand how fast can you save two hundred grand\nA point that you know it's not only will lame [laughter]\nYears fifty grand a year on a two hundred and you want to buy a better house\n\nCurrently at the house unless you did this I bet I bet you could do it

on you just to make you think okay and I'm not just picking on your for the fun of it but here here's the thing what happened was sharing a nine dirty when we went broke was we should never

everything paid off so we can become very wealthy and ... and you're making two hundred thousand dollars you you're there now and then you're going to go back into this for a couple of bedrooms I couldn't do it\nIt makes me sad just hearing you talk about doing it but if you do it\nYou know you're just living a different thing so you called me to ask me my opinion what would I Do when I drew once I drew the line and this and I said I never borrow money again no matter what is in if I Want something I have to get really creative about it or I have to really work hard to save up the money for it\nAnd I have to sacrifice other stuff to get it and then it makes me go off like my lifestyle but I don't know like those two more bedroom so I'm probably not going to cut my lifestyle down to nothing to get this which is kind of what you just said and I show um which is okay that's an okay choice you made the choice though but what that does is it allows us to buy something we can't afford\nShow I mean you can do whatever you want to do what you and I'll be friends I'm not really mad at you but you called the Dave Ramsey showing us to borrow money\nAnd it just new you're not ever going to get a yes on that one um show and just makes me sad that you would go back in ...

bill\nOkay how old is she sixty three\nWhy are you know power of attorney\n[noise] she's starting to forget that um she kept getting checked out for demand shots ah she's in the process of doing that and she has been been paying a staff type on a budget and so now I'm taking care of her stuff\nWhat is your income um she makes ... about twenty eight thousand air\nMhm okay and um what is the house you were hired sorry what's the house worth\nUm my sister lives in it and she kind of destroyed it I'm sure I'm where's your mother and I have an apartment\nYour mother is paying rent an apartment so that your sister can live in the house\nYeah so what's the house worth I'm guessing sixty five\nOkay okay so how fast is are you a throwing your sister out and selling the house\n... can't drill [laughter] she's on a date I Can't figure out\n\nAre you on the deed\nLast fall in line how did she get on the deed [noise] um my sister has um a child with me so my mom wanted to make sure my niece had a place to lead so she put my sister on it\nAre you paying that is your mother paying the mortgage\nShould not any more I was it yeah I told my sister I Would not anymore yeah everything everything's in my mom's name all the utilities everything as take 'em out yeah I Can't turn the heat off\nCan't tell you Keli Goff coming your Susan directed at the ... and her name um she has said that she can't because her deposits too high\nMhm 'cause she doesn't have to pay her bills are they ready to deposit too you know compensate for that\nBut you can see to pay the bill right\nYeah okay she has to pay the bill\nThat and that's it and she used to pay the mortgage today yeah okay I got rid of fifty eight thousand of the debt good and one hundred and one thousand in student loans passes away when your mom passes away\nYep guy so we don't worry about those quit paying I did that put paying the students that equipment in the student loans so now I got eleven thousand dollars in some medical bills\nThat is the rest of it we're just not paying your mom don't have any money she broke his apparently got dementia is your message twenty eight thousand dollars a year she's sixty\nThree years old you live in an apartment where you have to make sure she's cared for first and that's food shelter clothing transportation and utility she doesn't need transportation did you say there was a car and heritage you need to be driving\n[noise] I Know you're the power of attorney yeah\nI Know that I've tried to convince her to sell her car and get a thousand dollars a pack of fifty eight hundred dollars is\nA lot for a car so\nIt's not a lot for Garber is a lot for a car for somebody that has dementia and I'm not sure they need to be driving right she can't remember to pay your bills can she remember how to get home I'm scared for her\nThat was one of the problem she forgot how did you get home that's what started it\nIs it responsible on your part to let her drive the answer is no\nRight\nShe I Love her you love or you don't want her to be hurt or to hurt someone for\nGod's sakes before she could she could go driving often end up in Tennessee for much contact them and we'd have one of those silver\nAlerts or whatever they call them right\nYeah yeah\nNo I think we're going to I think we're going to do away with cars period oh okay now we're down to medical bills\nThese are very hard decisions for you right but you have to do your job\nAs the power of attorney and as a loving daughter is do things that are good for your mom regardless of who it upsets\nYour sister is upset your mother's upset I don't care yeah it's\nVery hard for you to make those decisions but we're only going to do things that are good for your mom none of this you are doing is out of greed for yourself\nOkay\nSo that all the student loan people they get dizzy up nothing nada okay tell your sister she gets nothing not a zip sell the car\nNow I'm Down to just a few medical bills and I think you can work your way through those with her income or at least get some kind of a payment plan going this very small and ah you can let that attorney's office know that basically she has no money what ... what is the twenty eight thousand dollars coming in from\nUm he has a pension I knew it in her security\nOkay I'm than what I probably would do with these medical bills is let them know they're probably not going to get paid either except if I have a little extra money here or there after taking care of mom\nHas ended up getting paid fifty on like on each one\nYeah it's okay if you won't pay twenty five or something or if if you can work out some kind of lump sum and you know five hundred bucks settles a whole dead or something like that clears up that's fine but here's the thing if they were to sue her\nDo you know what they're going to get nothing because you know what she has nothing all of the income that she has they cannot attach you can attach pension income you can attach Social Security income and you can attach an annuity\nAnd so that she's what we called judgment proof because she's broke\nAnd so that puts you in a very strong position to talk to Mr or Mrs collections bottom feeder attorney when you do talk to them\nAnd just go here situation she sixty three she's got dementia she has no assets in her only income which pension and Social Security she's judgment proof tell them I said that only talk of the natural coach and he said they are judgment proof\nOkay and uh so what we'll do is we would like to clear this up but we're going to do it for pennies on the dollar so make me a ridiculous offer because that's the only way you're getting\nAny money and play hardball with them because we got to take care of mom here yeah I'm not trying to I'm not trying to beat him by up I'm not trying to hurt anybody I'm trying to protect your mom\nAnd the last thing I Need it she she gets her food paid her lights and water her rent and she is taking care of only then do we deal with a couple of medical bills seller car sister gets nothing student loan gets nothing\nSo I I'm I'm saying this real kind of like\n'cause I Want you to get a little that down inside 'cause I Know these are going to be hard conversations for you\nYeah but you got to be our\nCars at your mom you're protecting okay exactly you couldn't do it you\nCan do it if you need some help you call me\nBack but just to play hardball with um terms issues judgment proof my goodness what a story [noise]\nThere's reason to save for retirement ... not want to return broke save for

think the Republicans I think between the caravan that we now have coming towards us four thousand people strong\nThat want to get to the southern border where the United states from Central America\nI Know that the secretary of homeland security secretary Nielsen\nI I had an opportunity to call her office earlier today because I actually do real reporting on this show and get an update apparently as of now there's full cooperation with the Mexican government\nThat that's not gonna happen but four thousand people still four thousand people and what did Democrats what if they were just they they don't want a solution for the border problem we have with the opioids crossover human trafficking is occurring\nYou know we they now are using these drug cartels you can't say they're stupid they're evil but they're not stupid they've been using and this is I Can't even believe this is true you know these drones that they fly with cameras above him\nSo they'll fly from Mexico into the United states along our southern border they fly drones with cameras on them and what they do is they map out where the border patrol\nWhere agents aren't so then they give like the perfect entry way where it's most likely to succeed in bringing in their heroin and their fat and all and drugs that are really being targeted towards your kids your town your cities\nThat's how evil these drug cartels are and how desperate they are to be successful now the president will he offered now we spent three and a half billion dollars so far that's the only amount of money that has been allocated towards the wall these pens every penny but we need twenty five billion dollars total to get the whole job done\nThat in part is what this election is about it's also about a party that has given up any sense of honor\nAnd any sense of constitutional\nOr authority let the rule of law that is based on our constitution that would mean due process\nThat would mean equal or access on there are laws equal application of our laws\nAnd we know that they gave that up any sense of due process with judge Kavanaugh it wouldn't even give him the honor of the presumption of innocence even after an FBI
