I Would I ran into um what's his name Blumenthal the Connecticut Senator\nAnd when I was in Washington went during the Capitol hearing said he was a total jackass during those hearings it was coming out of where I was going in\nAnd that's what senator Sean Hannity how are you we had a very cordial conversation if he was sitting at a table I Would never I might go over and say you know send a drink over you know I might just because I disagreed vehemently with them I don't feel I have a right to tell them you don't belong here\nHe has a different point of view than I Do what we get to settle out of the ... ballot box I\nHave a fear and when I say feel with him we got him myself that one of these people might walk up to me in a restaurant my fear is that my response will go viral [laughter]\n\nThat's my fear I mean I've asked myself how would I have either way it's just an old man of the ... that's why I say I have a fair I'm like yeah I'm going to stand up for that all Amy the old me would come out and then if I'm with my wife told me would come out\nAnd then it will go by what my response will go by what but I think they pick and choose the targets that's exactly well\nMaybe but you know I listen I train five days a week an hour and a half ... and they know this well it's a it's it's not going to stop crazy people but I got to tell you something I Will walk away I Will do everything I can do to walk like\nI Do part of martial arts all the arts that I practice we ... we bow out if we're doing weapons training we show great respect if we're doing grappling or or\nOutright full contact we do it with respect we respect the tap we were ... you know we're not there to kill each other we're there to make each other better I'm so there's a certain discipline David associated with that and but most people age don't know how to defend themselves and be they're going to react like past\nCaught then they're going to get past and somebody's going to get hurt\nI couldn't agree more and it is a danger for people in the public square and especially people who hold themselves out as Christians whether you're a pastor or you have a Christian themed blackout you really gotta be careful at it but we do anyway we need to be civil and and when some people\nTwitter ... and our other interactions but I don't think that means we don't fight I don't think it means we don't uh communicate our ideas as passionately and as intensely as the left now that just means we don't have to get his dirty as they did\nWell I look I don't know I we just had Newt Gingrich on and passed it what he was saying is between Cavanaugh I mean all these American\nValues that have have served us so well due process presumption of innocence and then you see that there was no core operation any of these charges\nIf the Democrats really cared about the issue they'd be going after Keith Ellison right now demanding an FBI investigation of an Cory Booker will be having an FBI investigation and Claire McCaskill's husband will be having an FBI investigation and Bill Clinton would be in jail for the rest of his life but they're obviously playing politics\nWith with very important issue so the hypocrisy there but between Kavanaugh the mobs\nThe caravan that's happening and the fact that we've had on paralleled economic success fourteen state record states record low unemployment record low unemployment for African Americans Hispanic Americans Asian Americans women in the workplace are vets record low unemployment youth unemployment lowest ever\nI I'm hoping that people factor that in in fourteen days when they vote or if they vote early\nI think the man on the street will factor then I don't think the people on the street are stupid Democrat or Republican\nThen that stupid the party leaders are stupid you know but the man on the street they're able to see this process that they know that Kavanaugh was that whole cabinet issue was a sham they see the hypocrisy of the left on full display\nThey know that this a caravan is not simply a random occurrence that you know a a all these unconnected people just randomly deciding to all walk thousands of miles to America to look for better jobs they can see the orchestrated you know some people are going to vote the party regarding this\nBut the others they say listen I'm tired of this because all of the nonsense seems to be coming from the left\nAnd the very behavior that they pretended to criticize they've put it on steroids and I am elated so you know they said well we don't like the some of the behavior the president during the campaign\nBut you say that I have it to another level and you'll you'll propagating\nYou're out of Cleveland, Ohio okay you're a an African American conservative you took a lot of heat for supporting Donald Trump out at the results are in\nAnd we're seeing all of these jobs being created for the people look at a picture over there that's the forgotten men and women of America that's what that's what twenty six team was about for me the Thirteen million more Americans on food stamps the eight million more in poverty after Obama's eight years\nNow we've got four million jobs created eight million fewer people in poverty and on food stamps we have\nFour hundred thousand manufacturing jobs that Obama sober never coming back\nWhile the president didn't get credit when you break down boats demographically with the black community because they're never doing better they've never done better\nThank God he's going to get the votes you know a ... in the Bible nicotine was came to Jesus button night and there are a lot of ... diem is and they say listen we see what Trump is doing we embrace with Trump is doing is not what they told us that waking up and you know if they say is thirty six percent approval rating\nAt twenty or thirty percent to the fifty six sixty six percent believe me his message is recording tell him as a message to let them in the black community I\nCome from a traditional democratic family years voted party forever blacked it in my family and our sphere are now so ... to it that they're either going to not vote at all which is which is really go for it would do with the conservative movement or they're going to vote with\nUs because just starting to see that this is a charade here the media constantly but right and President Trump for no reason they've been doing it all day today CNN blacks used to go and get their news from CNN their politics from CNN and MSNBC just starting to see\nWe got to get in the trenches we've got to figure this out so we're getting a bunch of calls from people saying hey\nWhat's going on houses going how's Trump doing this how can we help on this particular side he's going to get on the ... the black vote\nThan any other Republican president I'll throw this day but if if we all believe in in ... the father Jesus is okay and I think all of us here do\nIf we believe that that we all believe one thing and that predicated on that he created every man woman and child on this earth we agree with that right okay yeah so in that sense where\nBrothers and sisters we're all Americans to right and\nIf we really believe that in every human soul God put some talent some ability and our goal is to create an environment where\nThat that talent that natural talent flourishes ... they weren't your education from the Latin is ... to bring forth from within that tells you the God put it there our job is to put enough sunlight and water on something make it grow and help people and that's what I see Trump's doing\nAnd it and it's now hitting the forgotten men and women David that's the great story of the two years of Trump so far\n[noise] yeah yes and and we want to get that what Trump is trying to do when he says I Want to make America great again it means to restore its founding principles is Judeo Christian founding principles which is based on the idea that we're all created in God's image and that's why we had an alien Abul lights it flows from that but I think the leftist\nAuthoritarian by nature their economic coercion can lead to political coercion and that's where they are and I I think the left is losing it because they don't have any ideas that worked and I don't have any proposal so they're frustrated and they resort to identity politics and changing the rules and this identity politics\nDividing people on the basis of race and gender is\nEvery four to four years at the same thing rich versus poor versus young black versus white or right up against a race sex\nThere's massage in this Tacoma ...

Shaun thanks for having me on they have out this week the book they want it to flip as many seats in Pennsylvania as they can\nAnd they drew the district to make it or to make it much more difficult for somebody especially somebody like me who's the Freedom Caucus member a to win and not just the you know you've kind of highlighted some of the things are doing of course the big thing they're doing which they're not just doing it to me you know in talking to all your friends whether Jim mark Louis Gates' whoever\nOr it's the same playbook which is which actually is kind of absurd when you
