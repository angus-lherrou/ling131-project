held investments I don't know that that applies\nTo upset her out and I think I think there's just passive income and doesn't apply you need to check that out I agree with them I'm not positive but I wouldn't keep I wouldn't sell a good investment just to change my Social Security stuff\nSocial Security is not that big a part of the equation these properties or two if they're good properties I'd keep 'em even if it does mess up Social Security\nWhere they're profitable we've we've been I guess you'd say successful with it but they're not the you know there is written by other tree bedroom one

you're saying you've been through with Reuters and\nIf you don't want for renters lots of different equation but I'm not selling them to get out of Social Security bravo\nI may or may not cause they're so scared a problem and may be passive income might not come up with Social Security and you might want to sell them anyway if you just don't like being on the runners and but overall Israeli

you sell any cars or did you just pay them off\nWe just pay them off in the car got us into the travel\nOkay very cool but ... months ago some kind of a switch lip because men you went all after it you went game own hair this is a pretty serious numbers wild on tell me the story what got you started\nSo probably about six months prior to that we ended up needing a new car needing right um other when you're going out and we decided to ... to yeah the emergency popped up right yeah and ah we ended up with a car you know we had some strict guidelines we wanted and probably more than we really needed to pay for it but we did the brand new\nAnd it was the end where just sick of being stuck in kind of paying the bills even over to pay it no problem it was just we didn't want to any more um we one we're more excited for the future and that was just going to be in the way for the future mhm so we just we won ... intensity near term so ...\nSo how did you end up where in the process to connect with us\nSo it I'm a huge following pod cast a lot of time on the road and always listen to and it's like they'd we can do this you know than us and I we're we've got this no problem so we started doing that at the same time it always been kind of a vision of hours to lead a few at our church celebration center and so we uh\nGot that started right about time we started we got everything in line to start a few in January at our church and\nWe did that and so it was kind of who started it and then as we ... we were learning for the first time was the mentors and now on her second session and loving it\nWow well thanks for leading the class yeah very cool well there's nothing like leading to make you do it I mean that so that you you couldn't attend and may be kinda slough off right but are not hardly it's very difficult to do that but it's almost impossible to lead it and not be game on\nExactly and I think that just kind of stems from ... to me to it because I Believe in modeling all the eight years and now if I was going to model what I wanted my children and having a future I had to model at my house\nYou know my daughter ritual cruise always says that when you're teaching kids Morris caught and taught yes the modeling thing is a big deal they're going to do what you do how many times about open my mouth and one of my parents' voice came out I mean oh my

financial peace and they're not game on because they're scared and they don't think they can do this the the whole passing kicked in yet the belief hasn't kicked in yet what do you tell them they need to do\nTo be debt free one of the things you need to do if you want to pay off sixty nine thousand dollars and nine months\nWe don't know that whenever we did\nYeah and you start your hands start waving and you start telling 'em right what do you tell them\nWell there's a couple of things I think first of all you got to believe you know I mean it's it's it's a program to believe in it works follow the program and you can do it um second all it takes a team it can't be an individual you know we're a family of four\nAnd it can't just be me doing it which is pretty much what we did in the past I was in charge of the money the budget all that it takes the team and as long as two of you can come together and really get on board\nIt can happen you know with the with the steps you lay out it's it's not rocket science you know\nOne of the main things that someone needs to do to get out of debt\nAnd budget right there but I mean I think it is amazing how much money just slice of the door that you I don't make enough no it's their you make plenty you spend too much [laughter]\nWell that's true but generally drew okay so I think that they need to focus on why they're doing it and to think further out into the future and um and to recognize that\nAnd you're you said you're a college professor or what subject do you teach\nI teach theology specifically for individuals with disabilities\nWow and I would guess that would also apply to athletes would it not\nNo my athletes it can be disability sports but my research specifically for people who have disabilities cognitive disabilities and they have trouble getting out of the couch and exercising or being physically active not more toward the competitive fun yeah\nOkay I Would think an independent practice separate from your teaching where he worked hand\nA hand in glove with some therapy people into therapy community a would be ideal for an ongoing extra income and your jacket up a lot during the summer\nOr in a sense you're you're a tutoring if you will your own students are but you're using your research in your expertise in your information that ought to be very valuable\nUh and that you could build a quote business consulting business working with therapists are that you come in and and you know supplement what they're doing it and move things alone so I I think you've got a real upside there on your income that's exciting stops\nWesley with us in Pensacola Hi Wesley welcome to the day Ramsey show\nLike a day by day better than I deserve what's up\n[noise] so a little background my wife and I graduated college last year I completely debt free I'm and I'm looking into trying to get a separate vehicle because right now we've been driving or like you said a ... you got a a United States marine driving a few hundred thousand miles Korea so thanks for that\nI I I thought driving debate but whatever having the\nOur payments because I told my buddy as you also there struck me told me about a sixty thousand dollar car and I'm like eating it anyway so my question is I'm trying to figure out what to do next because I Want to get rid of the free us they don't want to replace it with a truck and I've got a Nineteen sixty four Chevy back home mhm\nUm and my uncle is willing to your labor for me for free or to get it fixed up with a new engine it when you train Ian and all kinds of stuff it's really sweet looking shot truck a problem for the is that you know it's not going to be quite as reliable it's really not going to be reliable as a moderate are what the\nLaw which would you consider going down the road and you know stop at a couple of thousand into this job to make it you know what\nYou know driving around or do you you know save up and wait for a year later on\nI think the trucks at keeper and it's a project truck that you work on after you get your financial straightened out\nOkay um so I I think the previous was gonna say I hate it too I'm with you but [laughter] but I think it's going to be a lot more reliable than a fixed up\nSixty four I've got a ... I got a Nineteen sixty vet does rebuild from the frame up and it's got a wonderful three twenty seven to ... do four but dual so for barrels on it it's a beast or not but it is a project car I mean they you you know it it runs all most all the time\nBut I'm not getting in that car and and depending on it to be somewhere I have to be it's more of a fun thing to have\nIn the garage and I think that's what you're sixty four is going to be someday um but if you want to sell the Prius and moved to a different car that's just a cheap car was what you would have spent\nOn the truck motor and that kinda stuff and move into a little different vehicle there as long as you're paying cash for it it's a it's a who move up kind of a thing that I'd be okay with that if you want to do that but um but I don't think I'd let that truck get away and I want to do with the project 'cause it's a cool project but I wouldn't do it right now [noise]\nJosh is one of those Josh is in Madison, Wisconsin how Josh how are you\n[noise] I'm good how are you do better than I deserve\nWhat's up\nSo I've got a question um regarding a credit card for business trips and let me kind of explain the situation here 'cause I'm looking for someone by um my wife and I have never been through a few but we actually just recently paid off offered to about two and a half weeks ago\nGreat congratulations\nThank you um\nI work from home with a relatively smaller company okay and they send us on business trips every once in a while and we are required basically it you pay for some of those business expenses during the trip\nThat money is definitely reimbursed for the company that we're going to the pays for that but we have to kind of want that money had the time um\nWe'd close out all of our credit cards except for the one for the business trips because we don't have money\nKnow set aside to be able to pay for these expenses\nI might have been most of the expenses run a month\nWell I'm not I'm not traveling every single month but there I mean every time I go on a business trip it's it's anywhere from a thousand two thousand dollars covering the hotel\nOr a guy who'd and then you're you're going to get the money back then you get the money back within thirty days yeah OK correct so mean we're we're paying ... pain that often and obviously we're not going to using the credit card for our own personal use it in\nThe end of the any religion that you need to see that one time you need to ... from the ... one time with two thousand dollars in a separate new checking account that as a debit card on it and it's used only for one thing\nReimburse ... business travel and you use your money on your debit card and you pray your little company doesn't go broke and not\nPay you back a little company you're taking a big risk sure yours or\nYou're the bank or for the small company that is too small to even fund their own employees travel\nThat's pretty scary at some\nPoint they may go belly up and you're going to be left holding the two thousand dollar ticket in your hand that's the risk you're taking so\nWe'll know so the company that what do you go and visit they get it right okay don't\nPay you they pay your company and then your company pays you write your company ... they're going to take that money from that other company and pay their bills with it and you're going to be left out in the cold someday\nSure I've seen it happen I've been doing it as Thirty years or seen happen a lot okay so\nThen where does that where does that fit in with\nThat leaves you well known as up a creek because you're taking a risk for this little bitty company that's what I'm pointing out for you know what I Would do it all with a debit card if you want to do that that's fine but at least then you're admitting that you're taking this risk\nI Will tell you I'm going to go back to your little bitty company and say gosh I'm Out of that I don't like borrowing money I don't want to borrow money anymore if you want me to take business trips why don't you give me the money to take business trips and then when they pay you back you'll get your money back mhm\nIt's only two thousand dollar right\nI don't ask my people to travel here with their money I got a twenty eight year old young person\nThis trying to feed their dogs and their kids and keep their ally grown and I'm going to send them out and put airline tickets on there on them know this company here pays for their airline tickets and we pay for the rental car and we pay for their hotel and their food when they travel I don't ask somebody here to travel and\nAsk them to pay for me to pay back we just pay for and we give them a debit card we give them the cash when they leave the place you're company should do that for you and you should push 'em on it because you're taking the risk otherwise but if you don't want to change the situation you need to fund it with cash build a debit card do away with a credit going\nKind of make yet how that's going to make your stomach but those now you're realizing they're real\nLive there is this is Dave Ramsey show [noise]\n\n[noise] Mm\nHey guys this is James child producer of

out of our lifestyle\nAnd make a hundred and thirty thousand a year we got for paid for rentals but we want to act like we're broke people\nAnd pour it all on to this rental for two years is this

it off fast\nOkay and then here's the other thing no more Home Depot credit cards no more sign up for rental ... is the best way to do do it is to live debt free than actually lived debt free\nYeah stop it and\nYou got to decide which way you're going to be like you got one foot on the boat one on the dock philosophically yeah\nSo um you know decide because I think you were really doing good until we got to Home Depot and borrow money for rental and then you kinda like lost your mind for a minute\nOr so\nThat's what it sounds like ... now you can clean it up I mean you cleaned up the Home Depot it's moved over to this deal now we can clean it up by either selling it or we can lean into it for two years\nAnd I have no life and clean this thing up and is this rental wars that do we love that rental that much\nI you know I don't know if you do or not you might I like real estate I might do it but I wouldn't do it again the next time you get ready to buy something at home depot pay

Wheldon so how much of the one million and some change was the sale of the house was what the lake al spring what the springs\nSo the the ah the net off the lake house was only like one fifty but the beach house was paid for and it was about four Seventy\nOkay but the ... I mean the one point five included the pay off with a mortgage or the other one right yeah sure okay so what was the total on the two properties well it says that would have reduced the whole thing by the force Seventy and what a reduced yeah the other ...\nThe cell or the property was seven eighty on the lake house and we showed about a hundred and twenty less than that OK around\nAnd that but that that are\nSix hundred thousand or so is included in the one million paid off for assure okay Joe ... show the a a big chunk of this then if I'm hearing this year I was done with the sale at least two properties oh yeah oh yeah wow\nYeah All right at all at the I Love the extra staff which there's a challenge to an advisory or when you were me and I and we were used to doing it where you sit in the summer is being able to get a lake and now and mark caught me on board I think\nWhat made you decide because I mean I I'm kind of thinking I I might have tried to keep one or two of those are one of those the cheaper one of the four Seventy one in ... worked our way through given your income what made you decide to go show radical yeah also and you did it wrong I'm just curious\nYeah I mean for me I I think about like eternity is all the lifespan and I think you know were given maybe Ninety years if we're lucky in that full eternity which is like a a glimpse in time\nAnd then within that time I'm given even less of a time to make a generational impact on my kids mhm and so for us it was you know I created a list of things that brought me joy and a list of things that created a burden mhm and the houses were\nAt the bottom we're not on the list of the joy and there were at the top on the burden wow and so I was like you know this is let's keep it simple and\nHe wasn't that way on one of those ads [laughter] I was actually not that way for a while one of my best friend's actually said don't you ... or ... from the beginning I mean I'm\nA ... with your all's income I can say I might have sat there and argued to keep the lake house or something you know the the ...\nWhat's your wired it was really difficult to to get something that\nYou know I felt like we were doing well

so you show you do whatever you want to hunting but those qualities are crap and I wouldn't keep a thirty seconds and it wouldn't have the big discussion was stupid whole life insurance agent about it either match on the line and Los Angeles I'm Matt how're you\nDoing fabulous ... thank you for taking my call\nSure what's up\nUm my question revolves twenty five percent rule that you use for the mortgage and my wife and I bought a home about a year ago and I'm I'm One of those people were all I did not include property taxes all modern association and B\nInsurance as part of the payment to the bank I Do all of that separate way mhm so my question is is are you supposed to include the H away the property taxes and the insurance as part of your twenty five percent role in the way that you teach\nI generally just say principal interest taxes and insurance joy no but most people as you know we're paying that is one payment and the whole point is not whether it's twenty five percent or twenty seven percent or twenty three percent there is no magic number there the point is is trying to keep people from\nBeing how poor okay where they got a dead gum payment they can't breeze and then they wonder why they're broke right\nYeah well we just started here class about six months ago we actually purchased the house about a year ago and and the numbers like we we actually get a thirty year long but at the council twenty percent of our income so\nUm we have about forty thousand a month and pay off and then we are looking actually we find that your hair long while but that\nCan ... if you've got a good interest rate you can just pay that loan like it's a Fifteen minute will pay off in Fifteen\nThat's true we have the option to do that as well\nEither either one is fine I don't know if I go to refinance cost if you have a competitive interest rate but it sounds like you're fine I mean 'cause you're you're twenty percent is in great shape right now you gotta clean up this other bad but I mean the thing I don't want to have somebody with a you know six thousand\nDollar income take home pay and in a in a four thousand dollar house payment wondering why they're broke you know Hitler the whole\nThe whole point is big numbers here not the ... and not splitting hairs on it the ah and I'm not saying you're splitting hairs you're being wise to ask for details there's nothing wrong with that but but I Am saying my formula of twenty five percent is not so perfect\nBut if you're twenty five point five percent oh God you're going to you've messed up everything no no no the point is just to not be how should pour that's all it is just kind of a big number philosophy in other words big chunky numbers not fun to numbers other things I Do I Do find two numbers on but that's a good clarification thanks for calling in\nJackie's in Oklahoma City Hi Jackie how are you\nGood how are you better than I deserve what's up\nOkay I'll just start off for like ... I Am twenty seven years old I had a and a total of twenty five hundred that I or twenty five thousand a day or that including my mortgage and\nAccess that and my question is would it be worth it to say that add on to my house or to save up and buy\nAnd so at least save up for the down or if it would be more ideal pet say but just continue continue continued on sweets country every single stat and then by our dream house later on\nOkay I'm a little bit confused ... you yeah I now I Want to ... took a you're wanting to add on to this house or move up and how you\nKnow add on to this house I live in a gray area I work from home is why I have a physical neither based in what I what I have a house that\nYou're living in worse um\nRight now it's probably worth about Seventy thousand I bought it for forty\nOkay and if it's worth Seventy now um what what size edition\nWhat'd you do how much money would you spend on the addition\nI Would want to spend about twenty grand just enough to add on an expert brown jak on kids I work with children and that's\nGood and so the homes in your neighborhood on your street and then the next street over so for what price range\nThey sell for about a between seven eight ten Ninety and the Upper East side of my neighbor had just because it's a really small street has pretty nice houses I mean they're they're they're pretty darn nice and like my ... my part as a\nModel is somebody looking for a house that's worth Ninety thousand dollars it wouldn't be unusual for them to be on your street\nRight but you wouldn't want you want to come on your street to look for a hundred and ten thousand dollar house\nRight okay so don't put more than twenty into it cause Seventy plus twenty is Ninety and in order to be able to get your money back out you don't want to overbuilt the neighborhood okay right so yeah and yes we're going to pay cash for the addition and what's your household income\nUh it's about five thousand and my mortgage is uh about four hundred dollars\nYou know and your mortgage and all your debt is only twenty five thousand right right yeah and we are now much of that is mortgage and how much of the other day at\nA there is only three thousand in that and then there's twenty two and a mortgage\nOkay and you're making like Seventy thousand dollars a year right household income All right well and show how quickly could you come up with forty five thousand dollars to the debt free and have the twenty to do the ...\nWell I I I Can't do math myself but um I Know that we plan on eliminating the access that within the next life yeah and then we're going to kick off and start paying the falling out plus I'm an extra fall now between the lower my\nEggs if it takes two years from today for you to be debt free and you have the ... edition done and you've paid cash for the addition is that okay\nUm well I mean that's where I'm kind of confused I just I Want to do with that\nI just started watching it takes two years from today and you are dead for it's not a trick question is it okay with you if what if you have the addition completed and paid cash for and you're a hundred percent debt free and it's two years from today is that an okay plan\nI think so because I I honestly lover I live\nGood parenting you can do that because that's too that's twenty two thousand dollars a year out of Seventy thousand and you paid off\nEverything house and everything and you pay cash for your addition you ought to be able to do all of that within two years so I think you've got a great plan I Would become free and then I Would save up and add on to my house so more than twenty thousand like sure you get contractor Bijan\nEverything down to you know what you're getting into that ... hour that Iran's you show in the books we will be back with you before you know in the meantime remember\nThere's only one way to financial peace in that storm daily with the prince of these crises\n\nKelly income than we have with a bang at the force of the\nCat to be here thank you for helping a friend of\n\nHis house call for house maybe there was a good reason for that old adage an apple a day keeps the doctor away researchers say a chemical compound in Apple's strawberries and many other fruits and vegetables can slow down the aging process\nIt has to do with ourselves as we get older our bodies become less able to clear out damage cells that are no longer able to divide\nAnd that can cause inflammation in tissue damage but new research on my spine that a chemical known as spicy tin can help get rid of damage cells improving health and extending lifespan the research published in the journal ... medicine says\nThe chemical could help protect against strokes and ... disease but there's been no research done on humans and while eating sued containing ... seat in and save\nSome studies said there was a potential cancerous get too much is consumed for more Health News go to Fox News health dot com house call for help I'm Joyce ...

James O'Keefe is going to join us and the Democrat reticent who's running against Marsha Blackburn who's now began to pull away in the polls a little bit there him and his campaign and his campaign staff caught on tape absolutely saying he's lying to the people of tendency\nBut the very purpose of getting elected and they say it not once but they say over and over and over and over again I don't

the problem for Brett us in just like the problem for people like Claire McCaskill or Heidi Heitkamp or Joe Donnelly a or send them all way do we get to the tape on cinema today\nOr you know some of these other Democrats that are running Jon Tester is they can't be honest\nWith who they are and be honest with their voters of what they're going to do when they get to Washington if they get to Washington but then when they get there and here's what they're going to do\nEven though they're in red states that overwhelmingly voted for Donald Trump\nThey're going to get to Washington and they're going to vote for Chuck Schumer that sort of first vote and then they're going to vote with Chuck Schumer Ninety eight percent of the time because that's what Democrats do there is no voice of moderation in the modern Democratic Party\nI got to get one little tip part of the hat to Joe Manchin of West Virginia frankly why he stays a Democrat in this day and age I have no idea\nWhat Republicans also offering\nSolutions and answers and solving problems and the numbers bear it out all across the board which is why you know historically in mid term elections people don't like to show up but if you don't show up all of the progress that we've made in the next two years is in jeopardy\nAnd you're going to get endless investigation possible impeachment\nThey have stated publicly they want their crumbs back they have stated publicly in other words they want to raise taxes well that's that's what created the last eight years of Obama\nWhich put Thirteen million more Americans on food stamps eight million more in poverty and he became the only president in history ever\nTo never reach three percent GDP Growth in a single year and he gave up on manufacturing jobs of post jobs are never coming back\nWell in less than two years Trump's brought back more than four hundred thousand of them\nAre half the time he brings it back not only by ending burdensome regulation and asking businesses well what do we what can we do to help facilitate you working here in building here in grading factories manufacturing centers here and\nTell them well you know it's costing us you know a thousand dollars for this regulation per unit and a thousand dollars per unit for that ... because of that regulation\nOr the president's wiping those regulations off the books\nAnd then on top of that is created a tax incentive for business to build in America and then when that doesn't work he just gets on the phone and just walls humiliate publicly any company\nThat is not building in America and then on top of that he challenges even allies of ours that have taken advantage of us economically on bad trade deals over the years and he's telling them hey ah you're treating us unfairly this was a one sided deal I'm pulling out\nAnd we now successfully navigated thread the needle negotiated better deals with for example most recently Canada and Mexico have you don't fight for a better deal you're never gonna get a better deal\nPretty amazing I Know everybody is that all hyped up about Kanye being in the White House\nListen very closely what country it was saying and

two years in jail I had an opportunity to interview or I absolutely fell in love with this woman\nShe comes rushing out of prison after President Trump does this for her right into the arms of her loving family I've got to meet her sister and I got to meet somebody a lawyer that was working for her pro bono and help make this happen and then she goes to the microphones and she says to America thank you\nThank you for giving me a second chance I'm not going to let you down\nWell I Want to find all the Alice Murray Johnson's in prison that or like car with that attitude that deserve a second chance and you know that would that may be a bit given heavy sentences for reasons for whatever the reason happens to be I agree with you we can find those people\nYou also talked about safe neighborhoods we need safe neighborhoods I disagree with him on stop and frisk only because the murder rate in New York while I've been here under Rudy Giuliani went from about twenty five hundred a year down to three hundred\nThree or four hundred Bernie ... was a big part of the success of that program it just works unfortunately got to go into the neighborhoods where the crimes are being
