{"month": "10", "state": "AL", "station": "WERC", "content": "Right I think it was about [noise] a couple of years after the say on\nHe was in a really bad car accident he was with his sister ... eyes car accident and his healing processes hated by pain killers and some of this is um morphine and he becomes addicted to more than a need for the rest of his life as morphine and alcohol problems\nAnd I think this might have affected his ability to function as a psychic and much later near the end of his life and I'm Sorry I don't have the dates on this he was involved in a very high profile\nSaid on 'em with pike that's the name that comes\nTo my old James hike up yes he was up here on on I'm In Canada upon earn a Canadian and so there's another Canadian connection yeah\nYeah yeah and I think it's in I'm looking at it now Nineteen sixty seven for how a say on for pike now pike son had tragically committed suicide the year before\nNow what Ford did for this high profile say on with the tip of the ... do you do something that\nYou kind of breaking up on his Thomas ah I'm not sure if it's a cordless phone or a cell phone but maybe if you keep very still\nSpeak maybe OK\nI'm area it's actually a voiceover IT line and sometimes it does break up is that a little better\nIt is okay\nI'm James Pike this is the ... an Episcopal bishop his son had committed suicide a year earlier and now Ford is doing a say on a Canadian TV\nYes and and he does a little upfront research\nBrings it into the San says if he's getting it in a psychic way whereas in fact he got it from the conventional way this was discovered after Fort died and people went through his papers and found his research preparing for this say out and that's why people say this\nSo this is another black mark against or if they're bored and it's again muddy the water so this case the Houdini case\nAs fun as it is and is exciting it is it it's not going to be the first to break through convince all the hard no skeptics that just isn't\nRight but but okay so Ford is discredited because of the sands in Canada in Nineteen sixty seven but as you point out he had been taking morphine he had been drinking or perhaps that had damaged his a medium abilities does that necessarily discredit the work that he did on on the Houdini case\nYes yes that's the way I see it [noise] and it does or doesn't I I just\nIt it it puts a cloud over it but it doesn't necessarily directly bear on it\n[noise] now despite basses\nRe catching\nAnd you know saying no I I don't believe that Harry communicated with me nor could he then why did she continue to do these ... high profile public say ounces on the anniversary of Harry's death for the next ten years\n[noise] um she did it for ten years after his death but she didn't start them until a couple of years into that so she did about seven\nOf them as my count but the point is still well taken and here's the way I look at it when she was with Harry\nUm [noise] she would be on stage at times and Harry was the one in the spotlight but when Harry dies she's in the spotlight but she doesn't have anything to do [noise]\n[noise] you know and so all of a sudden she's in an unusual place and so by stepping into the spotlight only once a year for one night to do the ... and I think the last one was in LA\nI'm On the top of a building you know the first they were going to do it down into building but then they said let's do that on the top ... will be higher closer to God and the spirits\nAnyway I think she knew these were going to be a failure because she was the one that was acting as the medium and she's not a medium so you're pretty much guaranteed they're gonna fail so she can say that statement at the end you know ten years is long enough to wait for any man and\nAnd that kind of thing and it kinda makes it safe for her to say well I tried I open minded I tried but it didn't work and so I'm going to go\nBack with my friends and embrace the standard mainstream belief\nBut you're inclined to believe that the original statement released in the New York times in Nineteen twenty nine affirming that she had been contacted through a Arthur Ford has been contacted by her beloved Harry that that that quite possibly happened\nYes yes I Do in the other letter that she wrote to wind chill is also it has a fair amount of passion to it she's very strong you know and so I'm not someone would say well if she was tricked and didn't know she was tricked she would still feel very strongly so I'm I'm open minded to that comment to [noise]\nYou you finish the essay with a I don't know if you have in front of you and if you could share with is the final words of Harry Houdini as brought forth by Fletcher and Ford Flex your being spared guidance for it at the end of that successful session can you share those words as we head into the break\nHere um and this is the words of Harry so it's um\nTell the whole world that Harry Houdini still live and he will prove it a thousand times and more in my life I was perfectly honest and sincere in trying to disprove the survival of consciousness\nAnd I resorted to trick to prove my point for the simple reason that I did not believe communication was possible I\nAm now and here in my desire to do this mistake how all those who lost faith because of my mistake to lay a whole again of hope and to live with the knowledge that life is continue with\nThat is my message to the world through my wife and through this psychic media those are the were\nFantastic Thomas how do people get a hold of living the paradox of enlightenment\nAmazon dot com or both the paperback and e book and I do want to point out one interesting thing I'm Dr Gary Swartz wrote the book the afterlife experiments and he was a guest with art they'll all those years ago and I recently heard that Gary sports\nHas Harry Houdini as a spirit that he's been working with over there at the University of Arizona about\nFashion that's fantastic well we'll have to get a Dr Schwartz on the program again and follow up\nOn that yes thank you so much for this\nWell Richard you're an excellent host you have a good heart and the

and on that note carnival corporation announced a series of community projects that will support children education at emergency preparedness in the Caribbean carnival of course has a huge cuisine presents and it is the world's most popular area for Cruz vacations\nSeveral of the carnival brands have been working with both local and international non government organizations including UNICEF and United Way of Miami Dade and Puerto Rico\nAnd they are partnering with several of the island's hit the hardest in twenty Seventeen hurricane season and some of the projects include rebuilding damaged schools and bringing back children's playgrounds yeah 'cause I don't see that\nAt least they're putting a they're putting their money back out there and the communities that are participating in a nobody likes to talk a lot about ... and this week they received proposals from Wall street banks valuing the ride hailing company around a hundred and twenty billion\nAs they prepare for their ... and early twenties Nineteen that valuation Mary makes ... bigger than General Motors Ford and Chrysler combined now heading really but what also grab my attention they're competitor Lyft is launching monthly subscription service\nAvailable across its user networking which users pay a flat fee of two hundred and Ninety nine dollars they'll get thirty riots per month essentially lift subscribers or can take up to thirty rides and the value of up to Fifteen dollars\nTo go over that number or they're going to pay some more uh over that thirty minute window or and then additional rise beyond the thirty will come out of five percent discount\nInteresting I write well Jet Blue is in the news this week by the end of twenty Twenty one\nJet Blue said that it will retrofit a hundred and thirty eight Airbus a three twenty aircraft with vortex generators what's a vortex generator well apparently it reduces noise on landings\nAnd believe it or not the entire retrofit will cost less than one million dollars so that's a good thing since twenty Fifteen Jet Blue has been taking new deliveries an Airbus ... and a three twenty once with for a text generators\nAll right so now we know we all know what a vortex now with that is now too quick item landing too quick I was from a a United Airlines first this week they boosted their profit outlook for the year as the U.S economy continues to home right along\nA and they're seeing big jumps and passenger traffic at the Chicago Denver and Houston hubs plus more business travelers are paying higher fees for those premiums states\nBut they also make clear flyers who buy their cheap basic economy fares on United that they're going to continue to pay the carry on their backs despite moves by American delta\nWho have relax their policy and then this last one from Mary Elizabeth I applaud for its honesty but perhaps not for its viability did you see this week that Nebraska tourism debuted a new tagline for its new tourism campaign that says Nebraska\nHonestly it's not for everyone\nOff and I'm not making the receipt yeah obviously you know they're attracting outdoor enthusiast to his state as they have so much natural beauty there and their new slogan is going to replace the one that dates back to twenty Fifteen Nebraska nice\nBut we really need to watch this because the purpose of the tourism department and they don't need me to tell them is but maybe they do if the cast is why did that as possible and attracted many visitors possible so I'm not real sure about the success of Nebraska honestly it's not for everyone\nWill Nebraska nice it's how well when was the Nebraska's accidentally fifteenth so that clearly that wasn't working if that's the only three years old and they're ... they're getting\nReady to say well you know they have that ... the honesty thing\nAre folks before we pause for a brief sponsor break and get ready for British writer and Christine cars who are coming up

decided he wanted to wash dishes and every state in the country I guess there was a German to visit every state Capitol another who vowed to mow lawns for elderly or disabled people in every state\nMy next guest fits right in with a small army of people who've hit the road for years for a very specific purpose\nHe's known as the team man and there's a good reason for that\nI'm happy to welcome ... ... spotted a spot for it to the show we reach them today and where are you ...\nI Am in Portland, Oregon\nOkay now in a nutshell Giuseppe you've poured more than thirty five thousand cups of tea for strangers around the country give me the backstory to that what you're riding around in and serving your tea out of and why serving strangers free T is so important to you\nWell you know I accidentally stumbled upon this power serving it's pretty um I was one of those people in this country uh about forty percent of people in America\nOr experience loneliness on a regular basis and what I found was that when I started having non monetary interactions where I actually just um started simply sharing with people um that my basic human needs for you know ...\nLike my social and emotional basic needs started being that I'm the those being community genuine human interactions and things like that and so for the last Thirteen Years I've been traveling the country making the for free the last ten of those years has been an effort to lose a free T bus which is\nI'm a short school bus that's been converted into a mobile free tea house using a mostly salads materials running on recycled vegetable oil a solar power I'm actually a huddled up next to my woodstove right now making a cup of tea on the woodstove so\nThen you send the new science you live at the at the little right\nI've lived in that and to live for a little over ten years\nSo so what were you doing when the ... before you hit the road what were you doing and where\nI'm I was working fulltime as a video editor in Hollywood, California um when I first started serving T although I I had been either living in my pickup truck at that point for um for about six months or so but I you know I I was in college basically before that were from college to the full time\nSo you pull up into a new city and started brewing tea and what sort of open the back of the back of your mobile unit or put out a table and people walk by and say when a cup of tea is that it's that simple\n... pretty much I put out for a few times I invite people in the inside of the buses they really pose the warm woodwork space it feels like when people come in it's a lot of people take a deep breath and they say I feel like I'm home\nOh my goodness you have made I Know lifelong friends who had people invite you into their own free dinners to stay there to shower there to hang out with the kids and meet their friends and and there's also you also gift sometimes and receive gifts I Know that's not you know a formal thing not tell me about that\nWell you know I'm One of the beautiful things I've realizes that uh for most of our history we actually lift lived in small scale sharing society the gift economy is and so\nReally that's what I'm trying to reinvigorate and in that relationships both with people as well as the resources that we use and consumer the highest form of values so I ... I don't accept any monetary tips the donations while serving tea but I definitely um accept other kinds of gifts\nYou know fighting to stay friendship\nEt cetera et cetera and one of the other beautiful things about the bosses that it's not really just about me finding relationships it provides a place for other people I've had people literally fall in love or find a band made or childcare or something like that if he lost his well\nI Love it so you've been ... and and do you expect to just keep on doing this keep on keep an eye on\nThat's a good question uh my partner alley who travels with me part time I had been talking recently about making their home base them work as a I've been home baseless for about Thirteen Years\nSo right right\nThey are used but you'd still have a new out on the road a time serving the I Hope\nUh definitely definitely\nIn the early Eighteen hundreds we were the one percent a but it all comes crashing down due to various factors so dumb incredible revolutionary history as well\nAt least combo tours they just kind of um you can take a call ... get the ghost stories got the which stuff get the seaport history\nGiovanni I was looking on your website and I saw gallery and so now this is from people that have taken the tourists [laughter] when or Arabs and goes I mean these are that's an awful lot of oddities on these tourists um have you ever seen it goes through what you think might have been against\nOut absolutely I'm definitely seeing a ghost um yeah so\nWe are well one of the house or the way it's considered the most haunted

flights together passengers need multi leg journeys they also allow passengers and the same alliance use airline lounges you can attribute mostly usually you can attribute your miles earned I'm an alliance airline to airline where you like to collect miles you can often use your miles civil war Dick as another alliance members airlines now\nUh most of this week I've been on a trip with about a hundred and twenty airline geeks it's what they call themselves it was partially owned by hosted by the sky team alliance the consortium that includes delta kale and mayor of France and others one thing I learned as a team as a group that specializes in looking around the world tickets for passengers\nEdward hollow is senior manager for commercial development for the sky team alliance I asked him to join me to discuss how wisely using around the world ticket and let's start with that and what is the advantage to buying it around the world to get\nVersus the traditional take it to take your money to a to B and right back\nShort and thanks for giving me the time to be able to talk to you about that I really appreciate it a ... it's exactly in your question I think the difference between the around the world to get on the advantage\nOf course it was a point to point and they do is just that the round the will take you from ... to beat a CD to eat all the way back to a continuing around the world that are pretty advantageous price ... ... if you compare\nAre doing the same type of journey going from ... to beat a and then ate his seat back de ... de and back to a\nAh many Donald can they get ... ad or how many stuff's going to travel or make and how long can that around the world trip last\nSure well exactly um we have a a maximum of Fifteen stops available on the best service you leave your home you can make a number Fifteen stops before you can make it back home and that can take anywhere from ten days to one year\n[noise] um and that's typically the kind of a journey that we see for people who are going on a very long term ... lifetime but equally for business travelers a schedule was actually the first\nTo reduce the minimum number of steps to too so you can also make this a fairly simple business trip from say New York to Paris Paris to Tokyo and back to New York and we can do that again at one of these advantages prices that's included in the around the world the flexibility that we get as well\nSo you can buy and all around the world taking all classes of service can you apply you know one leg and coaching one leg in business can you mix and match it as you mind your trip around the world\nSo it's a great question at the moment we have a fair economy class and in business class of course domestically the U.S that the business class ferries and that first class cabins which is how we called up the phone Kevin ... and the U.S [noise] um so\nThis is an economy today it's not possible but uh actually is a very good timing for the conversation because we are very close to rolling knew how to Nellie on sky team dot com which is the main place where you can purchase a stick it also must travel agents um sketching dot com and travel agents you'll be able to look that ticket and economy\nAnd if you'd like to spend one of the flights in the premium economy Kevin\nYou have the option to pay up for that and similarly for business class if you're a very long clear across the water and there's a first class Kevin available will also make that available for a small fee\nJust for that segment so indeed you can mix and match a little bit [noise] that's not available yet but we are hopeful that and the next three to four months that's going to be\nA kid's going to be rolled out\nI'm Talking with a with add and hollow he's based in Amsterdam area in the Netherlands and he works at the delta excuse me with sky team which includes delta kale amateur France and others are Turkish Airlines I'd leave as members ah check airlines as a whole list of them as you go to sky sky team website\nAnd can you give me an example of a couple or at least one fare we've got about a minute have left\n[noise] sure [noise] um for your listeners in North America um we based affairs on mileage so if you can fit as many cities are you on into a certain mileage banned the farewell actually stay the same so for example if you go some\nNew York over the water to London and you're up around Europe a little bit to Rome to Amsterdam Oslo Paris\nAnd then head off to Hong Kong and then they have a visit in Shanghai soul Tokyo and then over the water again to Mexico City than to Miami for a weekend and then back to New York all and that would be just under forty five hundred dollars for economy and just under ten thousand dollars for business class\nThat is which is on a ... that is something I mean I I can spend fourteen hundred dollars a during some parts of the year to survivor Minneapolis to London and back and you can certainly spent six or seven thousand dollars flying business from\nUh New York to Hong Kong or Tokyo in Bangkok in in in in business that's an extraordinary deal and you have ...
