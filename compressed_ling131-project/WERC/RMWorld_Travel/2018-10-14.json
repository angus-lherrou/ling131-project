prelude to an out of body experience if you stay calm\nAnd react I I always I often say and people think it's strange but I Love sleep paralysis well\nThat's an indication that I'm ready to leave my body\nWill keep you safe that then you know walking off your balcony or yeah I think it's important people\nDon't know how to use it to initiate a profound experience or as science hasn't told us that\nSo many people have common phenomena and they don't know what's happening millions and millions of people have they wake up in the middle of the night and there ... all over\nOr their vibrating or they're a hearing strange sounds you know these all can be a prelude to an out of body experience if you're if you learn how to respond to these what I call them in our signals\nOf there's a shift that's occurring within you that's preparing you for this shift of consciousness that we call him out of body experience now it's important to become aware of this\nThat we do this naturally anyway I mean do you now sees when you are when people are going to be travels the game he mapped the brain argue make any type of um recording of their travel\nWe have at the Monroe Institute we have in isolation booth\nThat has been used to map brainwaves during many different altered states\nThere was a copper lines the isolation chamber huh ah at the Monroe Institute that's used for um research a matter of fact there's one in each a we have two centers and uh\nThere's there's quite a bit of research being done on different types of ... states have consciousness let's put it that way for instance we have a class called discovery\nOr twenty people are all hooked up to a mind mirror and every person they go through a series of techniques are and they're\nThey're but they're not their brain waves are mapped during every exercise\nAnd in fact I speak it one night it on this class and I talk about how to initiate obese\nBut they they cover a lot of territory they also how to go deeper and meditation very quickly how to remote view more effectively for instance there's a lot of different let's just say I'm skills that are taught any more interested in different kinds of approaches\nLet's talk about some of the findings in these wouldn't mind near twenty people hooked up to the mind\nOf the online mirrors just a device that um will it's that's the trade name of the device\nI'm In ... in our class we will have\nA four people can be monitored by each mind mirror and it's a it's a brain waves which it literally will monitor 'em your multiple different venues of the brain while you're going through an entire forty five minute program\nSo you can track it and then we can print out it resolved\nAnd again that you can tell what is what are you most responding to [noise]\nBut that's that's that's one of the beauties of the Unruh Institute is that there is research done in these areas but for me the main my main goal is to teach people\nHow to have the experience themselves and not only have it put control it and get the most of it my main goal is to teach people how to have a profound\nA spiritual experience ideally throughout a body exploration it's not just about walking\nAnd walking through a wall and a talking to someone and it's a lot more profound than that you have the we have the ability to have the literally connect with Sarah higher self with are multi dimensional self right\nAnd have the kind of experiences that\nThat a Buddhist speaks of and the ancient Hindus and missed except talked about throughout the ages\nThat we're no we're there we have that ability ourselves because we are all of us are multi dimensional being it's just a matter of of beginning to open up to our own potential\nAnd sounds and green information on

the travel rules for news\nWell as you mentioned the top of the show the country's attention has certainly been focused on the northern part of Florida the so called panhandle of Florida\nBut tourism in the south Florida's being jeopardized them as being affected by red tide along this toxic blue green algae that began working its way down southern Florida beaches at the beginning of this week beaches one after another of clothes it's considered a public health emergency it's a more serious red tide than normal according to Florida in\nA press reports it because ... trouble breathing and sinus infection simply being on the beach can affect you because the thing is is an airborne toxin which I didn't know it's not just getting in the water and touching something\nObviously the floor the economy and I have no income tax and Florida is heavily dependent on property sales taxes people buying vacation homes their homes as well as tourist dollars so this latest red tide is caught the attention of politicians and businesses were acutely aware that the tourist season for South Florida about the gear up\nThat's been touched down there I'm All right well Singapore Airlines flight ... s Q twenty two took off Thursday from Singapore and landed at Newark liberty international airport in New Jersey at five twenty four AM New York time and just yesterday friday\nEither record setting non-stop flight covered nearly nine thousand nautical miles which is about Ninety five hundred miles in Seventeen hours and twenty five minutes\nUm there was no economy classes without business class which is the way not ... that's the way you want to fly it um but so this these new uh so I think it was an Airbus a three fifty\nYeah they're well there are the Seventy at least long haul flights um it was actually an Airbus ... by that\nSo that was a record setting heightened\nOur will on airliners you know can can you hear that folks listen listen carefully let's name can you hear that [noise]\nThat if somebody is happy\nClearly why are they asking to go there is some good news out there\nNews because New York city may finally have a world class airport we can all be proud of\nI

price tag of Thirteen billion so it's not going to come cheap\nBut the specifics a you know they show that new roadways aircraft taxi ways gates vast delighted filled terminals you know that you would see anywhere in the world right now brimming with stores restaurants bars\nYou know decorating trees plants artwork all with the goal of making JFK a destination unto itself even if you're not flying construction is expected to begin a late next year should be completed by twenty twenty five but the big thing that's coming is when the projects or with the project is completed JFK's six\nTerminals are going to be reduced to for with a new Kennedy central terminal sitting in the middle of the complex\nAlso that's going to be really interesting to see and then married just mentioned Newark international as my least favorite New York airport well more good news as workers underway on a new terminal as the smallest terminal at Newark which has terminal F is getting a major upgrade\nA a to point seven billion dollar project so New Yorkers awash in cash or they will be replacing be forty five year old terminal with a new building and that should be operational by twenty twenty\nTwo so we're going to be flying out of airports that are under construction for the next seven years that's correct that's going to\nBe you know I'll just say you know how many people they expect by twenty thirty are going to be flying through JFK and you only know eighty million people here right now sixty annually and\nIt just so many so many people flying through such an important city in America you have the airports that are not exactly show pieces\nI right now he talked about this a few weeks ago ready and the international and\nHigher so excited that's why everyone is cheering and thankfully

difference is that there are around the world and appreciate those differences I think it's um made this humble and Debbie will probably say she's braver\n[laughter] I Am braver and I think that this has given us a perspective outside of our country that we could never have gotten other way to look back at America and in a different way but it's also for those out there that they might want to do this spending twenty four hours a day with your spouse or their transformation\nThat\nSo that's my question for you perfect segue Robert and I are obviously married we do the show we travel together all the time we've been doing this for not to show that traveling together for twenty five years I'd love to know why did stand for you guys as a couple because I think that's different than what it does for you individually\nI I totally agree and we're celebrating our fortieth anniversary on Sunday ...\nThank you thank you we've been kind of stuck on our on our marriage you know I think that I

Will ask this you know you're both retired you're clearly I'm somewhat of a fixed income our budget and from the day you're left over five years ago did you think you'd still be out there traveling

was another eight months um than another year and another year you know we're only doing it because we want to do it but it has worked out we've been able to stay on budget and so I think will keep going as long as we're having fun and\nWe're learning we're still love and you know the money holding out yeah I think the way\nWhen we left was could we travel with the amount of money that we would spend if we were in Seattle retired and because we don't have a whole we don't have expenses here in Seattle it's worked out so\nGreat to hear how many ... in the past five years where we now with the numbers\nWe here at two hundred two hundred that thanks wow\nI didn't think that our\nI have you have you ever taken the time Michael maybe you have to just to run the numbers and get an idea of what

Birmingham CBD CEO John RS\nWelcome to Ahram world travel John\nHello Robert how are you where I Am well I have very well thanks very much hope you are doing well in Birmingham\nSo we're going to ask you this is Mary and I we travel a lot and we have for the twenty five years we've known each other but when I think of all the places we've been over the years Birmingham is certainly near the top for us as a parent company and we also own syndicates the wrecking ball the show\nAnd we have for nearly Fifteen Years so there's so much about Birmingham that makes it a great place for travelers whether you're a history buff whether you enjoy great golf\nYou know we're other sports in outdoor activities like yours you the botanical garden or stay parked even medical tourism with your terrific doctors in the army has been so what are you most enjoy about Birmingham and experienced communities John\nI just I think one of the things or many of the things that are so unique about Birmingham and makes such a unique or travel experience for people is there's such\nA wealth of different things to do all types of people here on our website which is in Birmingham dot com we have about twenty different unique I tend to release for visitors to experience that from everything shopping to outdoor activities girls weekends out a temporary\nSports of course golf as you mentioned so many different one of the kind of unique opportunities\nExperiences here in in a Birmingham and a\nRegion you know you you mentioned it earlier that the Birmingham is a area that uh many southern city that have undergone as you do great run of the last couple of decades and we are certainly not an exception but that we have experienced so much growth\nThere's so much interest in our destination because of all the different things that you spoke about um\nI think that one of the things that work very very proud of what we are merged as we become one of the leading food destination country a lot of people don't know that about\nWhen we talk about that I don't really rent to travel really go together and that's actually what I wanted you to touch on so taken away I tell everybody about this because we know we had wonderful experiences in Birmingham is a\nWell we'd like to call ourselves a dinner table the south and\nThe reason that we do that as we over the last\nI guess the teen years we've had an emerging boots and that is just really really a a amazingly a great experience for so many people and\nAnd the uh we were just recently\nHonored with the Birmingham is the only city you can basically go to now this year and experience the best restaurant in America\nAs elected by the James Beard\nFoundation and that's the highland bar and grill it or five points out in an area\nWe which is a great restaurant huge honor yeah it is John I Want to ask you this question on that note because we're limited to a certain amount of time right now but you know for years we've seen considerable growth along the highway to any quarter but in recent years and rape highland park as you mentioned that\nIt fits into the downtown area has experienced great revitalization of the new ballpark there's a number of hotel you know he's got the civil rights museum the convention center and that's all helping to kind of fuel your airport to grow so what do you think is the biggest enhanced to Birmingham for travelers in recent years\nI I think the the the renaissance what happened down ... as a downtown spirits and started with the development of ... park and\nRailroad park you mentioned the ball park which is of course regions\nField right next to it but a\nA railroad park youthful green space today co park that that has a um a surrounding neighborhood and Los ... that are being developed great brew pub craft\nBreweries are popping up all over the place around there's all sorts of things to do it a rubber park problem people have family reunion there there's music odds are Trump festival so many interesting things to do during the winter they have ice skating\nAnd it's just on a visit and something you were ... before we let you go we're about to run into time give us a quick\nThat would surprise our audience about Birmingham and really entice them to come in it\nThat that's a tough one because there's so many different things to do we have a real\nClash

Christian pain and the people at the ... corporation which owns southern living as we want it to talk to her about the southern living hotel collection which seeks to showcase iconic southern hotel properties both new ones and the historic classics\nNice to connect with the Christian thanks for joining ...\nThanks for having me pleasure to be here\nWill pleasure to have you on the show with us so listen certainly everyone in our audience they know of the brands associated with you know a company like helping her Mariette or higher holiday ham and somebody other top grants out there I'm not purposely forgetting them but let's begin with you sharing exactly what southern living hotel collection is and does the collection cover the entire south eastern portion of the country\nIt does leave work very hard to bring together a hand picked group around twenty two independently owned hotels that includes in bed and breakfast small and large property but that is um that's how we got to discover the so there are seven living\nStory that we ever as we traveled for reading it out and we invited these numbers are winning hotel collection just a few years ago it's relatively new for us but growing rapidly\nHair so from what I understand you do have sort of a wide\nExcept the properties you've got some new properties as well as uh\nSome of the older more iconic hotels that I Would think are deeply rooted in some good old fashioned southern traditions I'm curious for our listeners who have not traveled er stayed in the southern region of our country can you just described some of our own world sort of southern hospitality that you look for in these properties\nSure I'm In southern Wyoming our bags are always that we love to travel but we like to experience very different very recently that that big\nParts of the south and hospitality is always number one when we're thinking about what property with belong in this collection except for instance you could go to greater Ashville area in the mountains of North Carolina maybe for some beautiful fall color and like I didn't like eighty percent of southern living people um consumers book a trip to go to the fall color\nAnd she's got seven rooms all decorated\nIt looks like a page of the magazine and author is based on other living recipes and her hospitality ... the owner and operator and it's like you're saying with a friend and that's\nThe perfect example of a small mountain that and then on on the flip side it could go a wall in Tennessee Knoxville and blackberry farm which is the complete opposite end of the spectrum all little cottages there's no you know vertical in her hotel like\nYou would traditionally think they're all beautifully decorated little cottages\nAnd the restaurant and\nIncredible barn that it sounds rustic but it's absolutely seventh are\nAll these properties that I'm looking at here I mean there are some cross section so who is the worst thing the hotels for inclusion in the southern women collection and you know what are some of those features that you look for require besides the obvious is married just mentioned southern hospitality aspect\nMhm or food and beverage is a big driver it has a lot of the car and they'll drive\nAnywhere to take some incredible regional their\nFood and beverage is a very big part of our criteria um the decor and the architectural integrity and does it speak to the region though Gingrich Seventy Seventy in South Carolina looks over the river and credits an old stately homes mostly done\nLooking at right now it's going if you are\n... incredible Frank and Frank and Amy or the owners and they're just great people but the hotel itself is just a fee through the eyes it's actually beautiful right down the river I Love each of these speak to that\nI Love that these are hand packed that's a great way to describe it so Chris and we have about a minute left or hospitality for a long time you work in a hotel branding I'm sure we could ask you a lot of questions but I'm curious and these are sort of more luxury and certainly boutique type hotels\nWhat's the single biggest factor if you had to choose one that you think today's luxury brand in hotels really need to get right for the traveler\nYou know it's all about the people you have to feel like you want to go back there again and again and what makes it memorable is that experience and these folks that own these properties they get into the details and making that trip special for you you might be there on a whim for a weekend or an anniversary but it's going to be a place you want to go back to\nThat but it's still hard to put on paper but that's what makes me places special every single one of them\nYeah I think anybody who's had a memorable experience and they look around and they will agree with that when the hearing that will Christian list or we could go on and on and looking at a number of these properties but you will a girl written orange Virginia so folks I'm going to give you the website for southern living hotel collection dot com southern living hotel collection dot com go check them out\nChristmas we
