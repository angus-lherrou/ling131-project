I have a sweet spot for for me caution that really creative and not just you know something with a mask swept on it\nYeah it's fun for sure um so you know you talk about the history of it we know basically what goes on now so how do you see since you studied it so much and you really continue to to to do that how do you see the future of Halloween how do you see it in about ten years Twenty years Thirty years\nWell on a really good question you know I think that um you know\nWhen I mentioned I mean it's it's it's very much wrapped up in tradition and folklore and stuff and all these things change right I mean we've we've talked about two or three different incarnations of Halloween going back to to win and then you've got the mixing it with all the ... and and you know we with each\nAnd every with each you know a couple of generations changed a bit\nUm and I think that um I think it's probably going to remain more or less the same for the time being a you have had occasional places where people taking it too far in Detroit for example it's it's known light I mean there's the other like art and stuff it's like a scary scary stuff going on\nUm but for the most part you know most people keep it keep it pretty simple I think that that there's a certain innocence about it\nBut I think is really feeling good it's not it's not Easter it's like Christmas it's not tied to a particular religion\nIt's it's something that anybody of any of any of the faith and creed hum what it was like a dry up well like a dress up right I mean eight year old kid what eighty year old kid like to dress up and so it's something that is I think just inherently\nA humanistic and fun and and I don't think that's going to go away and\nUm you know it's still gonna be knocking on doors and asking for any uh you know I don't think it's going to change dramatically in the next uh in the next you know twenty or fifty years or who knows maybe two hundred years from now a ...

Patrick welcome to the show\nI ready it's good to be back in it\nAnd nice to have you here I Know you want we want to talk about two topics but the first thing you want to mark this week being well actually I actually I guess it was a Tuesday of this week the fiftieth anniversary of the birth of the Boeing seven forty seven\n[noise] that's right ah September thirtieth was the sixtieth anniversary of the rollout of the seven forty seven which to this day if you ask me and and many other people is a most important and most influential jetliner in in history a introduced\nI didn't know introduce economies\nOf scale and then and that allowed for the first time large numbers of people to travel long distances ad affordable fares more than any other playing it changed the entire face or ...\nI didn't know that it was the first uh you know airplane with ... says I knew of course it was a double decker with that ... knows but I didn't know what was the first ...\nIt was it was the first a wide bodied jets and and watch absolutely remarkable it it went from a literal drawing on the back of a napkin to an actual flying airplane in just a little bit over two years\nOr more than it was more than double the size of any existing playing and built from scratch in just a little over twenty four months and nowadays it takes five years just to design\nA little variants of an existing play it I mean that was just incredible considering the the era and what it what had happened the Nineteen sixties the late sixties\nAnd considering what I Know from having read your column on this this week it was twice the size of any existing passenger plane at the time which is extraordinary to be able to build it in two years to\nAnd and it it's a beautiful place and it was an is a beautiful place I mean so much more elegant then then the the three eighty which is the plan that\nSuperseded it finally in in terms of size hits you know I call it the Empire State building of airplanes it's not the biggest anymore it's not flashy is but it's still the most elegant and and the classy is\nAll right I Know another thing that's been on your mind is the overcrowding of airport lounges we are talking about the ones where you have to be a member or have a credit card that allows you in a particular lines lounge and I've got to say I agree with you I mean the airport lounges don't seem necessarily quiet highways anymore or they\nYeah and I don't understand why more travelers aren't are\nConcerned about that is why it is more of a point of controversy here maybe it is and I just haven't picked up on it but you know maybe I sound really but I always thought of the the first or the business class lounge as a place of some exclusivity of of luxury or even even extravagant she to some level and yet\nYou go into the loud just today and they're kind of a cross between a cafeteria and a daycare center\nThey're nervous about it and in part because it's so easy to get in you have\nThis credit card and then this level you can command and you can bring in some cases unlimited gas I mean it's crazy the ... in in some lounges I've actually seen people standing at eating food out of place while they stand in a corner because there are no seat\nAnd on top of that you've got an issue with children being brought an eel often are very unruly baby screaming kids running and I was in ... I Want you to Amsterdam racially and they were kids running barefoot throwing themselves over the furniture I mean this is supposed to be the premium clash ... the executive lounge we used to call it right\nYeah have you heard anything in in in in hanging around airports as you do and being in the airline business whether airline companies are concerned about this I Know they're trying to you know up the food offerings and so on but are they talking about building bigger ones\nWhat can be done I mean short of building all new and and much bigger lounges which in a lot of cases of the non starter I mean really the only way to deal with it is to restrict the the passengers who can enter may be a\nYou know how to dive lounge it'd be only for first in business class passengers period or if you're going to let people in through third party perks or you know am acts and what\nI'm let that'd be the case it's only when I'm just at a certain capacity or less a land maybe limit the number of gas that people can brilliant but it's it's kind of out of control at this point and something needs to be\nIn the last Fifteen seconds we have left you want to anger parents everywhere by saying one of your wishes of the kids under a certain age will be allowed in\nWell you know ultimately it's not about kids it's about\nBad parenting I hate to say it and the topic we can talk about separately all day of one or two\nYou can read Patrick's writing an essay about his new book or the new version of his book is cockpit confidential Patrick thanks for solving by any kind of think you really\nAre immoral travel my eyes are open twenty four seven and eight hundred three eight seven eight oh two and so it was the website at R.
