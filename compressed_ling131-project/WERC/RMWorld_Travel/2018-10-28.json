I I think what was ... I I mean I I it's it's it's just it's still very solemn to me that you know the innocent people were hanged who were protesting their innocence ended the real the people who had confessed to being which is\nWe're ... let out of jail and then it's kind of you if you can test instead yet was really sorry about that then you go but it's only the people said no I'm not going to get this and then I've never been a which those are the people who ended up dying for the most part I mean there's a large percentage of them than anyone\nI didn't write ... avenue wants the tragedy of these people who did the right thing you know stuck out for their beliefs only things are told to do in your life and it ended badly for them um which is why you know Arthur Miller's crucible of such a great works of literature in place is\nBecause he kept right into that kind of idea that these guys did the right thing and by doing the right thing they ended up at the end of a rope on a hill you know O'Neill America\nWhat's the uh the end the population you said under about fifty thousand but it balloons up to two hundred and fifty during the\nThe Halloween a ... ... ... the month long festivity of Halloween\nIs is there in Salem is there any other time of year where they are they see the kind of bump like that or is it just is like a it's a I mean I realize that they always kind of get a steady stream of tourists but it's this they're big season this this this October you know these thirty one days or a tumor\nOh mathematically I mean some some ... this is only open in October and can make their whole year in October\nShot up really\nThey've been getting more and more a year round kind of tourist impulse not just for the which stuff but for the maritime stuff demanding restaurants than they have the ninth largest art museum by area in the country so they have like a lot of like kind of\nYou know arrows and their whole started to pull a tourist and still happens their biggest one is October which will never go\nWell I Do really I mean that's like a ... there are state fairs that have that right where people open up a booth at a state there they can make their entire year in the weeks that the teacher is open and I I Would never have gotten their shops that are just open for one month in the in Salem\nYeah but and but other than what the realizing there's so many tourists coming to say on all over the course of a year\nBut now they're starting to open longer so if you go in the summertime you'll still see the shops are still open you might even feel haunted house opened the monster museum ... so they're starting to realize that they can do this year round to stay on grows and becomes more even bigger in popular culture than it is now\nWhat's not cool in Salem ... or their rules a lake or curbs that they they are either written or unwritten about how people are just you know ... or to or how they want ... to be in in Salem\nYeah and they're they're getting better and better at that as figuring that especially like ... year round if you're on the other time of year there's not that many curbs\nBut in October for instance they are the burial ground which was the old seventeenth century um graveyard right in the middle of town there in Salem and this year they had to like put a cap on how many people could be in the grave at a time\nBecause it was just getting overrun and people were like using the graves as you know picnic table and climbing on them and doing all kinds of bad stuff to an actual historical artifacts\nBut that there is on Halloween Night they have a curfew I think it's around ten pm that if you're not inside of a bar or inside of a party you couldn't be on the streets so they'll shoot fireworks in the air to kind of tell people hey the nights over ... start heading the train and start having their cars so there that's\nReally lately and ten pm [noise]\nYeah I Believe it's a ten pm yeah it it might be a little later maybe eleven but yeah they're trying to get for pushing this a hundred thousand people to the train you take some time so by midnight money around on Halloween of\nIronic did they make everybody get off the streets of Salem before the wishing our\nYeah yeah it was [laughter] it just gets bad [laughter] really bad that\nThey got to get them out before the ... or maybe this was in the real thing happens after all the tourists Lee J double the locker\nOr and or Edgar Award winning author thank you so much a season with the which\nThe magic and mayhem of Halloween in Salem, Massachusetts is now on my bucket list things do you like I didn't have enough of my bucket list [laughter] things or have a great night but I'm checking off one when I go to ... in a couple of weeks I'll let you know about that coming up later on in November\nWhen I'll be back on Halloween of sorry on Thanksgiving weekend\nOn Tuesday I'm All right so the story you're going to want to hear the story you're never going to

because it's the quote unquote center of the universe\nNow listen I was born in Cleveland didn't spend a lot on there but I graduated from Ohio University but even I Would be hard to argue the Columbus is Columbus is the center of Ohio will give you that\nBut I'm not sure Ohio is the center of the world let alone the universe anybody ground as broke as this week parts of the park it'd be open as early as a year from now four times the size of December\nI maintain imagine the none of the job in January and I know I've taken that landed on\nWell I went out here in the New York area I

Cincinnati\nWith you well we appreciate you being here with us today so we're going to get right into this you're about six months or so I'm told into your position with Cincinnati USA's convention and visitors bureau but you're certainly not new to the city itself so as you're working you put your mark on Cincinnati travel and tourism what are you finding is the single biggest drawn to the city of these days generally\nWell and I really appreciate the opportunity to be with you and and it talked about this and certainly talking about this study is for the most everything that I get to do and when we think about tourism visitors and didn't\nTaste nasty you know what really stands out threats I think it would be surprising to a lot of people as how strong arts and culture is here in the speech when you look at the performance\nOrganizations that we have we arts organizations theater stage it it really a rivals like what you're going to find in Philadelphia Chicago and even sometimes that part of New York the Broadway shows\nPlays that we get here it really just aren't that it it really is not an issue with our history with the heritage and it it's really one of those things that we see people coming more and more overnight does it\nGenerally a little over a decade ago I'd say in my life had including restaurants in this in Cincinnati was pretty much nonexistent but today not only is there a hobby nightlife with tons of new restaurants have nursing unique museum like the American sign museum is the one I'm thinking of the city's flush with new hotels and people\nI I think

world Scott McCartney as the middle seat column for the wall Street Journal used in front of the show and a frequent guest delight and a friend of mine delighted to have him on and he just flew the longest flight in the world easier to tell us about it it's got willing to the show\nGreat to be with you Rudy alright what airline did you fly what can the aircraft in where did you go to\nSingapore Airlines have reclaimed the title of the longest flight in the world and the strip is from Newark to Singapore and a shame that said it's coming back\nUm it's more than Ninety five hundred miles\nAnd uh basically I'm sure the other side of the world and they're using a brand new Airbus eight three fifty dash nine hundred jet um that can figure for ultra long flying they've Airbus has modified the fuel system they restricted the cargo load\nA little bit on it uh and uh and it can um uh they face a fly for twenty hours um this this flight is scheduled at Eighteen hours forty five minutes a day when I did it we had some favorable when so it was a mere Eighteen hours\nIn the airplane and it's interesting there are no regular economy seats uh you you wrote in your column that there are sixty seven business class eats a Ninety four premium economy seats and from the photographs\nI'm On a at least on online companies with your column the seats are fairly I mean certainly better than the average economy plus a seat in the U.S airlines\nYes yes there is a difference between premium economy particularly with the international airlines and and what we think of as the economy plus or the extra leg room you get on the domestic us airlines premium economy on on on Singapore\nUm and and it is nice and you're right they don't have regular economy because they think that would really be too cruel to when somebody into a small fee for Eighteen hours\nUm but the show this sheet has an inch more ... than a typical a three twenty Nineteen inches\nInside the armrest instead of Eighteen Inches um and in about six extra inches of leg room you get a little bit more recline and it's actually if you if you think about it it's it's not all that is similar to what business class used to be long before the flat bed\nRevolution I'm so it's\nYou know it it was a comfortable seat um Singapore actually has um a specially designed this seat with some features for this particular flight is for ultra long flying\nUm whether extra support for your for your cab as your legs things that will hum\nA reduced tension but you know at the end of the day I Can't sleep sitting up on an airplane um and I know many people can\nStill and it was a flight ... was was\nFull I mean it's interesting what the premium county feeding 'em a it's two seats together on the side and that's that's nice and kind of spacious before seats in the middle so you've got your middle seats in the middle of the airplane and I think the people in that middle section in particular\nUm you know it kind of trip where uh you know after about fourteen or Fifteen hours you get really restless and humid there\nYou had some specific tips we only have about the ... you have some sort of gets which\nIs drink more water which we hear a lot but really getting up every few hours even if you have to set your your iPhone or I've had to set an alarm so you walk around right\nYeah I think that's really important really important for circulation really important for fatigue um it it it and it's a it is a good thing to do you know every two or three hours to go you're not sleeping or just you know if you're watching a movie you got to get up after the movie ... it's interesting one of the things they recommended actually drinking\nCoffee and tea and particularly herbal teas and and things and and we think of that is sort of a direct that you know ... maybe D hydrate you\nUm but in this case the recommendation is a drink coffee and tea because it forces you to go to the bathroom and going to the bathroom is a good thing that gets you up and moving around on the other thing I think is really important and and this goes for really any flight but particularly long flights if if your contact lens or anything bring I drops\nAnd and bring US Sailing nasal spray you have to do you can stay much healthier on an airplane\nIf you keep your nostrils moist um the the mucus membranes up there that the trap infection\nAnd so I bring a little bottle of failing spray very little bottle I drop so stick them in the seat back pocket and and use them are really every time I get up and walk every two or three hours\nI appreciate that 'cause I've never done that all good advice and you survived the trip obviously did round trip out and you're back home and Dallas every Thursday Scott writes a fascinating column even if you don't fly a lot it's really interesting it's called the middle seat it's in the\nWall Street journal every Thursday you can also find it online if you're subscribers in the journal Scott thank
