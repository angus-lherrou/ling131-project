I didn't accept the monetary tips the donations all serving the but I definitely um they accept other kinds of gifts you know the way to stay friendship\nEt cetera et cetera and one of the other beautiful things about the bosses that it's not really just about me finding relationships it provides a place for other people I've had people literally fall in love or find a band aid or childcare or something like that lets us as well\nI Love it so you ... do you expect to just keep on doing this keep on keep it on\nThat's a good question um my partner alley who travels with new part time here and I've been talking recently about making a home based on work as a I've been home baseless for about Thirteen Years so\n[laughter] right right if you\nUse but you'd still have the ... out on the road a time serving the idol\nUh we had over two hundred and fifty ships going around the world during a Seventeen Ninety to Eighteen fifty a and it's um the wealth of the nation was here in Salem in the early Eighteen hundreds we were the one percent a but it all comes crashing down due to various factors so dumb\nIncredible revolutionary history as well at least combo tours they just kind of um you can pick a combo get the ghost stories get the stuff you get the seaport history\nI mean I was looking on your website and I thought gallery and so now this is from people that have taken the tourists [laughter] when or Arabs and goes I mean these are that's an awful lot of oddities on these tourists um have you ever seen a ghost or what you think might have been against\nOut absolutely I'm definitely seeing a ghost um yeah so\nWe uh well one of the house or the way it's considered the most haunted house\nI'm In the city and that's where the corps when family had lived on those grounds the house is not there anymore it's another house but\nI was there telling a story and something went through the tree um we've seen stuff in our office to we're on the old custom also there's several custom houses were in the second to last so my daughter got chased out of here when I found the voices behind her head so she got a little freaked out so yeah but I've slept\nIn my own building because sometimes you know I guess stay overnight waiting there so I've never had anything happen then but I definitely have had stuff happen on my course\nYou know I think the part of the country that you're in and for folks that haven't been to Salem, Massachusetts I mentioned a just a couple of minutes ago when we were about to introduce you that\nYou know it's easy to get to I mean you're thirty forty five minutes I guess depending on traffic from Boston northeastern right there on the coasts as you said and also this time of year I mean I guess the folks want to go about forty or forty five minutes south he's got plenty of so you can kind of hit an all their uh\nYou know I got a few questions right now for you to tell us do the tours run through all types of weather and how often do they run and to you and your team you know do you ever get that real fright or scare while you're out on the tourist\nOh yeah we're on every day I'm through November for this year and then uh that Ben daylight savings time happens and so we uh go the weekends but um yeah you know the Boston sale employment combination is really\nA great combination people go to Boston and they take the train up here the train comes right through the city and it's a nice easy ride and then they do fail until the spend a couple of days here to Boston maybe go climate so\nIt's a really great combination I mean this is our areas are rich in history in our power one of the oldest parts of the country so um\nBut yeah so it's um it's it's a great combination all around\nWhen people come there for the tourists uh what do you find what surprises them the most when they leave that to you you're always going to chuckle about because you don't pay with knowing they just don't [noise]\nWell I think one of the biggest things is that we are older than Boston and everyone doesn't realize that and then when we tell them or stuff like Alexander Graham Bell lived here for three years and ah we had a very\nFamous revolutionary I'll say it's a conflict I won't say battle that preceded Lexington and Concord and it's actually the first confrontation of the revolutionary war\nSo there's a lot of like stuff like that that wall with them and then we call them all the stuff and oh my God people are just blown away because about ... and you know some of the little stories all the trials that are just so incredibly interesting and explains so much\nIn this trial certainly in visiting is something for the website it's Salem historical tours dot com Salem historical tours dot com Giovanni we
