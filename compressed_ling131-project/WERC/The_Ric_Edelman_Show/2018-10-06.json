find it to order it asks the pilot dot com Patrick welcome to the show\nI ready to be back like in it\nAnd nice to have you here I Know you want we want to talk about two topics but the first thing you want to mark this week being well actually I actually I guess it was a Tuesday of this week the fiftieth anniversary of the birth of the Boeing seven forty seven\n[noise] that's right uh September thirtieth was the fiftieth anniversary of the rollout of the seven forty seven which to this day if you ask me and and many other people is the most important and most influential jetliner in in history a introduced\nI didn't know introduce economies\nOf scale and then and that allowed for the first time large numbers of people to travel long distances ad affordable fares more than any other playing it changed the entire face or ...\nI didn't know that it was the first uh you know airplane with ... says I knew of course it was a double decker with that ... knows but I didn't know what was the first was ...\nIt was it was the first a wide bodied jets and and watch absolutely remarkable it it went from a literal drawing on the back of a napkin to an actual flying airplane in just a little bit over two years\nOr more than it was more than double the size of any existing playing and built it from scratch in just a little over twenty four months to Eddie and nowadays it takes five years just to design\nThe variants of an existing play it I mean that was just incredible considering the the era and what it what had happened the Nineteen sixties the late sixties\nAnd considering what I Know from having read your column on this this week it was twice the size of any existing passenger plane at the time which is extraordinary to be able to build it in two years do\nSurely and and it's it's a beautiful place and it was an is a beautiful place I mean so much more elegant then then to a three eighty which is the plan that superseded it\nFinally in in terms of size hits you know I call it the Empire State building of airplanes it's got the biggest anymore it's not flashy is but it's still the most elegant and and the class he is\nAll right I Know another thing that's been on your mind is the overcrowding of airport lounges we're talking about the ones where you have to be a member or have a credit card that allows you in a particular lines lounge and I've got to say I agree with you I mean ... airport lounges don't seem necessarily quiet highways anymore or they\nYeah and I don't understand why more travelers are are\nConcerned about that is why it is more of a point of controversy here maybe it is and I just haven't picked up on it but you know maybe I sounds duty but I always thought of the the first or the business class lounge as a place of some exclusivity of of luxury or even even extravagant she to some level and yet you go into the law just today\nAnd they're kind of a cross between a cafeteria and a daycare center\nIn their early ... and in part because it's so easy to get in if you have\nThis credit card and then this level you can command and you can bring in some cases unlimited guests I mean it's crazy to ... in in some lounges I've actually seen people standing at eating food out of place while they stand in a corner because there are no seat\nAnd on top of that you've got an issue with children being brought an eel off and are very unruly baby's screaming kids running I was in ... and all I Want you to Amsterdam racially and there were kids running barefoot throwing themselves or with the furniture I mean they're just supposed to be the premium clash lounge that'd be the executive lounge we used to call it right\nYeah have you heard anything in in in in hanging around airports as you do and being in the airline business whether airline companies are concerned about this I Know they're trying to you know up their food offerings and so on but are they talking about building bigger ones\nWhat can be done I mean it shorter than building all new and and much bigger lounges which in a lot of cases the non starter I mean really the only way to deal with it is to restrict the the passengers who can enter may be a\nYou know how to dive lounge it'd be only for first in business class passengers period or if you're going to let people in through third party perks or you know ... uh [noise]\nUm let that be the case it's only when I'm just at a certain capacity or less a land maybe limit the number of gas that people can bring it but it's it's kind of out of control at this point and something needs to be done\nIn the last Fifteen seconds we have left you want to anger parents everywhere by saying one of your wishes that kids under a certain age will be allowed in [laughter]\nWell you know ultimately it's not about kids it's about\nParenting I hate to say it and so the topic we can talk about separately all day of water\nYou can read Patrick's writing an essay about his new book or the new version
