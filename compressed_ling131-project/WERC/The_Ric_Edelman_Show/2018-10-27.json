destination spotlight on Cincinnati\nWith you well we appreciate your being here with us today so we're going to get rid of him to this you're about six months or so I'm told them to your position with Cincinnati USA's convention and visitors bureau but you're certainly not new to the city itself so as you're working you put your mark on Cincinnati travel and tourism what are you finding is the single biggest draw to the city of these days generally\nWell get I I really appreciate the opportunity to do it and it talked about this and certainly talking about this study is for the most everything that I get to do and what we think about towards and we think about visitors an invitation\nCincinnati you know what really stands out threats I think it would be surprising to a lot of people as how strong arts and culture is here in the speech when you look at the performance organizations that we have\nWe have arts organizations theater stage is it really a rivals like what you're going to find in Philadelphia Chicago and even sometimes right outside of New York the Broadway shows place that we get here it really just aren't that it's\n... it's really it's not an issue with our history with our heritage and it is really one of the things that we see people coming more and more for overnight that it's\nGenerally a little over a decade ago I'd say in my lifetime including restaurants in this in Cincinnati was pretty much nonexistent but today not only is there a hobby nightlife with tons of new restaurants I've never seen unique museum like the American sign museum is on what I'm thinking of the city's flush with new hotels and people\nI I think it really return to the downtown area and a big way and I know is on the planet named Cincinnati as one of the ten destinations to making twenty Eighteen best in the U.S with that huge could this be why\nIt's absolutely why we have made started up so much investment in our downtown core from our riverfront twenty blocks north up to our over\nThe Rhine area really create\nA sense of vibrancy sense of a\nPlace for ... it in restaurants and the entrepreneur would like to call them are skeptical that are popping up in these really great faces in the\nDark architecture all over town to create an experience that you know when you come in to say that ... it feels like a major metropolitan city you don't feel like you're in the mid west are steps away awards every single day we just headlines Santos and please take over the James Beard house in New York about\nA month ago and created a Cincinnati night it was one of the only night that it's sold out all year so far at the gym the original\nAnd it's certainly just the vibe and the feeling of really just electricity and just to gauge that that's happening\nIn a lot going on there sure yeah so what we'll switch gears just a bit for the business travelers in our audience Cincinnati and Delta Airlines they're certainly synonymous will link the city is also a draw for some of the top design shops in the country you're also home to major corporations like Proctor and gamble Macy's kroger's and you have the pro sports teams like the reds and the bangles\nSo how influential are all these companies and teams and raising the profile of Cincinnati was travelers\nWhat you know you mentioned are two sports teams now up to you know cracking the we now have three professional franchise\nWe're talking major league soccer correct right and I don't know if I could\nDo you know we we just got that doesn't nation back a day you know all these things have to work together from the tourism industry the business industry civic you need to really grow the reputation\nIn the vibrancy of ... of the city and when we look at what was happy and all these groups are engaged in a very big way to really grow the vibrancy of\nIt's also a huge opportunity for us to bring more talent you into this race has a huge push among many the corporations that are going to bring more jobs more\nThere was possibly that we have the hospitality industry if I sell vibrant in investing closet because nobody wants to see that they had a good example of that is really important for us to the restaurant the arts and culture the nightlife all those things because they count the tractors and and we do our responsibilities now\nRun out of time I'd love for you to briefly touch on entered ... junction and the nearby Kentucky I placed the arc encounter\nEntertaining junction about Fifteen miles\nAll the train if you're training is like history of all that

S. dot com you have a great weekend okay great thank you\n... All right and one other thing that we didn't get to with her but next year a hundred and fifty years of baseball and ...\nRight so times since we only had to see a mass media today let's say sort of divide the country and the section since we asked listeners all over the U.S why don't we start with what's America's favorite Halloween candy on the west coast and maybe a few from the south west and the mountain states\nLooking I'm so in the west coast it there's not really sort of a west coast consensus it's um it's it's a little bit divided state by state Skittles or the big one in California\nUm and that's big because it's the most populous state out there I'm getting at north to Oregon and you've got reaches cubs Washington the salt water Cassie\nUm the candy corn and do well in Idaho in Nevada and that's kind of a trend that's been a little bit controversial cross country um even in New Mexico is candy corn is the number one can\nSelf interesting um why why's that controversial to say\nOh you wouldn't believe people either really lover candy corn ... um we did we did another list we did um a survey of the forty thousand people on what what Halloween candy they don't like\nAnd candy corn was number two on that list of of the Kennedy that they don't like so it's a real lover a thing and um for example Michigan\nUh this is the third year in a row and snapping Michigan for all three years that the top ... has been candy corn and we get so much pushback from from reporters there from our customers there we get emails and tweets and\nUm they well who do I ... really not happy\nRudy I Know right now or ... what's the big thing really where you are in Minnesota apparently\nTootsie Rolls a poll very well here but what else is popular for Halloween I mean for for people who are traveling on the upper or lower mid west I live in Minnesota by the way to\nYeah so I'm In Minnesota is butter finger and start first and hot tamales or the top three\nHundred Mali is like the state to go after them spicy\nSo surprised [laughter] you\nKnow lawyers and other one that's kind of a newly come up in the rankings that game show um we sort of associated with a with a younger demographic um I don't have the data to back that up um but just anecdotally it seems like people from sort of the older generations can understand why people would like\nHot tamales and solve that kids in people from the younger generation on just love it\nUp so I can see that I Know Texas is big with races All right so Mary and I are based on the New York area so um what what are you thinking of the eastern seaboard or you're just give us one or two areas from northeast the southeast that really stuck out here\nWell what sticks out in the northeast is our patch kids there was another one candy in New York, Maine and Massachusetts\nYeah our youngest son likes them I Would say um I get I don't really understand it but the southeast are what are you seeing there\nThe southeast Skittles does really well so he is or the number two in Florida last year and there's one in Florida and that's a big state or in another one in South Carolina a and just generally in the south you see more sort of sugary sweet candy and less\nChocolate ... ...\nWell I'm going to just literally no we we have about six or seven stations in Alaska and Hawaii were not forgetting about them I Know two weeks as big in Alaska and is also in Hawaii but I'm going to ask you real quick before we let you go\nAbout thirty seconds can you tell me right now do you have a favorite candy town

world Scott McCartney as the middle seat column for the wall Street Journal is in front of the show and a frequent guest delight and a friend of mine delighted to have him on and he just flew the longest flight in the world easier to tell us about it Scott welcome to the show\nGreat to be with you Rudy alright what airline did you fly what can the aircraft and where did you go to\nSingapore Airlines have reclaimed the title of the longest flight in the world and the strip is from Newark to Singapore and a shame that said it's coming back\nUm it's more than Ninety five hundred miles and uh basically I'm sure the other side of the world and they're using a brand new Airbus\nEight three fifty dash nine hundred jet um that can figure for ultra long flying they've Airbus has modified the fuel system they restricted the cargo load a little bit on it\nUh and uh and it can um uh they face a fly for twenty hours um this this flight is\nThat Eighteen hours forty five minutes a day when I did it we had some favorable wind so it was a mere Eighteen hours\nIn the airplane and it's interesting there are no regular economy seats uh you you wrote in your column that there are sixty seven business class eats a Ninety four premium economy seats and from the photographs\nI'm On a at least on online companies with your column the seats look fairly I mean certainly better than the average economy plus seat in the U.S airlines\nYes yes there is a difference between premium economy particularly with the international airlines and and what we think of is economy plus or the extra leg room you get on the domestic us airlines premium economy on on on Singapore\nUm and and it is nice and you're right they don't have regular economy because they think that would really be too cruel to\nWhen somebody into a small fee for Eighteen hours\nUm but the show this seat has an inch more ... than a typical a three twenty Nineteen inches\nInside the armrest instead of Eighteen Inches hum and in about six extra inches of leg room you get a little bit more recline um it's actually if you if you think about it it's it's not all that is similar to what business class used to be long before the flat bed\nRevolution I'm so it's you know it it was a comfortable seat um Singapore actually has um a specially designed this seat with some features for this particular flight it for ultra long flying\nUm where their extra supports for your for your cab as your legs things that will hum\nA reduced tension but you know at the end of the day I Can't sleep sitting up on an airplane and I know many\nPeople cancer and was a flight ... was I was full\nI mean it's interesting what the premium comedy feeding 'em a it's two seats together on the side and that's that's nice and kind of spacious before seats in the middle so you've got your middle seats in the middle of the airplane and I think the people in that middle section in particular\nUm you know you know kind of trip where uh you know after about fourteen or Fifteen hours you get really restless and humid there\nYou had some specific steps we only have about the ... you have some sort of gets which is\nDrink more water which we hear a lot but really getting up every few hours even if you have to set your your iPhone or I've had to set an alarm so you walk around right\nYeah I think that's really important really important for circulation really important for fatigue um it it it and it's a it is a good thing to do you know every two or three hours particularly if you're not sleeping or just you know if you're watching a movie you got to get up after the movie ... it's interesting one of the things they recommended actually drinking\nCoffee and tea and particularly herbal teas and and things and and we think of that is sort of a direct that you know wouldn't wouldn't maybe D hydrate you are but in this case the recommendation is\nA drink coffee and tea because it forces you to go to the bathroom and going to the bathroom is a good thing that gets you up and moving around on the other thing I think is really important and and and this goes for really any flight but particularly long flights\nIf if your contact lens or anything bring eye drops and and bring a sailing nasal spray you have to do you can stay much healthier on an airplane if you keep your nostrils moist um the the mucus membranes up there that the trap infection\nAnd saw very little bottle of the when you spray it very little bottle I drop so stick 'em in the seat back pocket and and use them are really every time I get up and walk every two or three hours\nI appreciate that 'cause I've never done that all good advice and you survived the trip obviously you didn't round trip out and you're back home in Dallas every Thursday Scott writes a fascinating column even if you don't fly a lot it's really interesting it's called the middle seat\nIt's in the wall Street Journal every Thursday you can also find it online if you're
