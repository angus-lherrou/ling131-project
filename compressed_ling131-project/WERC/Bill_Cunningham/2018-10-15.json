Democrats have promoted illegal immigration which is destroyed black working class jobs than champion Bill Clinton's pro NAFTA policies\nWhich have led to a massive levels of unemployment in black communities they've also Democrats who crippled a black families by embracing welfare writes the penalize married couples who get married it goes on and on and on\nAnd this was all set in a sense to CNN's Don Lemon\nWho laughed with venomous ... at what these other African Americans were saying can you imagine if a white conservative Republican I had to call some black guy a house negro\nOr use other racial pejorative against them they would be kicked off said but not when their own get to do it and they do it with such really and you know when you think back in history\nWith CNN did the Kanye West borrows from an ugly ugly and tragic history of slavery and the pre civil war\nYou see white slave owners who wrote Democrats ruthlessly\nPunished any black man or woman who sought to educate themselves and think for themselves the Democrat white slave owners in the south headed control blacks maintaining power over them and after the civil war ended conducted by Democrats\nSlave owners head to release their slaves but they formed the Ku Klux Klan Democrats formed the Ku Klux Klan as a terrorist arm of the Democratic party to intimidate murder Lynch suppressed and destroy\nAny political activities of the newly freed black population to keep them under control if they threaten the Democratic power structure believe me the Democrats and the Ku Klux Klan went after them hard\nLater on in the era of Jim Crow white Democrats codify into law the idea of literacy test and other means and methods to dumb down and keep African Americans poorly educated and keep them all in line\nTo protect their power Ninety five percent of black people continually vote for Democrats because the sample shouldn't media like CNN and ABC NBC and CBS control black Americans to keep them in line to keep them under control\nWay of what I watch free thinking African American men and women be partially destroyed by CNN and the mainstream media Democratic Party and so then I look at the results of the Trump Administration black unemployment historically low\nCriminal justice reform is coming\nHe's fighting against illegal immigration that hurts black workers he's trying to find a solution to the never ending slaughter a black man by other black men in Chicago dominated only by the Democratic party\nAnd he's going to try to make it possible for Democrats to sit down at the table of equal economic opportunity and so what happened and Kanye West is the same crap that's happened to Clarence Thomas to Jesse ... Peterson the kinds of Lisa rice to any black who steps out of line\nThey're called madman like by Jimmy Kimble they're called uncle Tom's like by Snoop Dogg they're called mentally ill by Don Lemon and they allow the racism on CNN dummy employed against a black man if he doesn't express the right political viewpoints\nThat is why CNN working with the Democratic party much destroy Kanye West and and they do their best but I don't think it's going to work\nI have trust and faith that African Americans maybe in three weeks\nWe'll discover and learn what the Democratic Party has done to them and not for them\nThe truth is just take a look at the education system and the crime in cities like Baltimore Chicago Detroit Memphis or Milwaukee the schools are completely dysfunctional the black family is completely broken\nThere's no job creation [noise] the average black student comes out of high school in Milwaukee or Detroit or Chicago reading about the eighth grade level unprepared for the world of the twenty first century and all those cities the Democrats have been in charge for the last fifty to eighty years with no discernible results\nYet when a black man like Kanye West steps out of line him against their expressed support for a different political outlook\nHe has called every dirty rotten filthy racial name and the book because it fits the idea of the Democratic party keeping blacks in law and they want to dissuade other African American men from thinking an acting independently of the Democratic party that is cause such harm\nCan you think a worst cities to live

sold it for more money and uh it was very good but I loved since the queen city I Love the queen city let's talk about what happened today with a pastor Brunson yeah major accomplishment you're like the hostage receiving president all the world they're coming in how important was due to get back this religious leader who was being persecuted in Turkey\nWell he is that he's a great religious leader and it was a you know they accused him of things that he didn't do\nBut we got him back and we got back I uh we got back many people actually if you look at it as like seems like all the time

Mexico and South Korea [noise]\nMillions of jobs have been credit and you were told a year or two ago by Gary Cohn and others that you know the candidate deal is probably not going to happen Mexico's too tough NAFTA is ingrained what'd you do not cause Canada may not be real happy right now in Mexico may not be right in and South Korea\nTo kind of play because we're the big dog in the kennel but they don't treat it that way what did you do with the\nTrade deal and we're also the piggy banks that everybody wants to come in and Rob\nAnd uh Mexico we made a deal and we told her look otherwise we're going to have to just to actually car industry which would have been bad for them and frankly I wouldn't have wanted to do it but we were going to do it and\nWe made a deal with Mexico we could not make a deal with Canada they just wouldn't make a deal that was fair for us because NAFTA was a total and complete disaster you know the better the nomination so what happened over here with you still have building's empty with just everybody moved out\nI don't know what they were thinking so that's why I refused to call it NAFTA I said the deal with making refused so we call it the U.S MCA

[noise] with all these great\nThings happening in the media objectively covering the Trump Administration give me fifty fifty somebody stopped me the other day and said why do you think it is CBS NBC ABC\nOr the New York times Washington Post every big city newspaper Hollywood movies too late night comics they're all one way and and I said I I guess it's group think because they all live in either Hollywood or New York [noise]\nBut but it can you imagine if CBS or ABC would say you know what we're going to go a different direction [noise] we're gonna start covering the news objectively we're going to have conservatives from top to bottom in America is a conservative country right thirty two states are controlled by ... a Republican governors\nHouse the Senate Supreme Court we are basically a moderate to right wing or conservative\nOr what if CBS what say from top to bottom organ or is that what we're going to reflect conservative values and cover the news objectively [noise]\nI think those of us who are normal would flock to CBS News and the ABC NBC and CNN would take one alibi hit the only one that is conservative more or less right now is Fox you know if they're leaning left quite often was Shepard Smith and people like that\nAnd you see what the ratings have Hannity are every night John draws about four million viewers every night so those kinds of interviews I just conducted was their regular event on CBS Evening news or ABC I give up any hope for NBC or\nThose ratings would double and triple and it would become the dominant evening newscast if somehow\nOne of the other ones would say you know what from top to bottom we're going to reflect the values of people in this country that that are pro God pro family pro military pro police and we're going to reflect that [noise]\nAll you gotta do is look at Newsmax TV\n[noise] or a one American network and you'll find conservative values in the news that reflects the American people so let's

don't even know if it's still there are no\nAnd knocked down about six months ago a really yellow and gone the whole thing including the garbage day ... and what's going to happen with the making of housing development\nOh okay good but it was great for us we fixed it and sold it for more money and uh it was very good but I Love since the queen city I Love the queen\nCity let's talk about what happened today with a pastor Brunson yeah major accomplishment you're like the hostage receiving president all the world they're coming in how important was to get back this religious leader who was being persecuted in Turkey\nWell he is that he's a great religious leader and it was a you know they accused him of things that he didn't do\nBut we got him back and we got back I uh we got back many people actually if you look at it it's like seems like all the time we're bringing back people and uh I Know President Obama pay one point eight billion for nothing to bring back a few people from around one point eight billion\nAnd uh we got him back and he's going to be safe very shortly he's in the air just he literally just took off\nAnd he'll in the in the office he'll be in the oval office big welcome a big welcome yeah you know evangelical Christians everybody everybody wanted her back what happened to them was incredible and he was held hostage but now he's a he's going to be happy I'm sure he's very happy right now\nAbout your wife ... to Africa sure which was unbelievable what happened there talk about what was the goal in what was accomplished with Maloney in Africa\nWell she's a terrific first lady and a great human being and she wanted to go and see for herself Africa because we've heard so much\nAbout it some very good step but some very tough stuff in a sense of the way people live and she made for substance you also went to the pyramids and Egypt and that was quite something special [noise]\nBut uh and the poverty is incredible you know the level of poverty it was very sad a beautiful in one way and very sad and I know the kids were beautiful they loved her\nAnd she came back and she said I Hope you're going to continue to give a lot of money because they needed it's not a question of it's not a question of defense it's not a question of it it's just such on a human basis they need it and she had a big impact on me I Will tell you a\nBill she really had\nA big impact on me and the other thing the mid west I looked at Canada Mexico and South Korea [noise]\nMillions of jobs have been credit and you were told a year or two ago by Gary Cohn and others that you know the candidate deal is probably not going to happen Mexico's too tough NAFTA is ingrained what'd you do that costs Canada may not be real happy right now in Mexico may not be happy and then South Korea\nTo kind of play because we're the big dog in the kennel but they don't treat it that way what did you do with the\nDeal and we're also the piggy bank that everybody wants to come in and Rob\nAnd uh Mexico we made a deal and we told him look otherwise we're going to have to just to actually car industry which would have been bad for them and\nFrankly I wouldn't have wanted to do it but we were going to do it and we made a deal with Mexico we could not make a deal with Canada they just wouldn't make a deal that was fair for us because NAFTA was a total and complete disaster you know the better the nominees or what\nHappened over here with you still have building's empty with just everybody moved out\nI don't know what they were thinking so that's why I refused to call it NAFTA I said the deal with making our refused so we call it the U.S embassy a and it works good but we made a great deal with a with everybody what happened then is Kennedy came along in the end\nWe weren't able to make it I said we're going to tax you cars coming in and then what happened and they made a deal they made a deal they made a deal and it's a deal that we're very happy with I Hope they're very happy with hope everybody is but it's a fair deal for us and\nUh we have now just men to deal with South Korea which is fabulous much a a much improved approved deal you know improved I Will say that Hillary Clinton do you remember she made that deal and she said it's two hundred and fifty thousand jobs and she was right for South Korea so they got two hundred and fifty we didn't get two hundred and fifty\nIt was a terrible deal so essentially we terminated that deal and we made a new deal with South Korea so we're\nFriends and how many jobs and talking about you're talking about Canada Mexico we're talking about a million\nWell you're talking about millions of jobs to potential don't forget we've opened up countries that were just totally close to right if you look at Canada we couldn't sell our dairy products out there and if we did it was a three hundred percent tariff people don't talk about that you know if I put on a ten percent or twenty percent tariff they make a big deal of if they have three hundred\nActually three hundred percent two hundred and Seventy five percent two hundred and eighty five percent these are the terrorists they charge so essentially that's a wall because if you have to pay a tariff like that you can't sell the product is so expensive so we've opened up Canada\nWe have a very good relationship now I think they respect us more than they did before\nBut now at least it's fair in our farmers are in love with it you see what's going on it's beautiful now we're working on China and we're working on the European Union which of absolutely taken advantage of our country is the European Union has been brutal and the way they took advantage of the United states for many years\nI mean they were formed to take advantage of the United states that was a reason they were formed how can we\nHow can we take from the United states so the European Union they formed and they have their very unfair to us they have barriers where we can't sell into their into into their countries\nThey have a tremendous tariffs that make it impossible\nAnd yet they still Mercedes Benz and BMWs by the millions they come in during the Indians and we charge him essentially no tax it's two and a half percent but for the most part they don't even I liked it\nSo we charge them virtually nothing and they send millions and millions of cars if we want to send a a piece of grain okay we want to send a piece of grain we can't do it and to the European Union so it's unfair uh we met with them I told them I'm going to
