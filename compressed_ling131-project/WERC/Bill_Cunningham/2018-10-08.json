happening to UBA rape case I guess that's that's following through\nEvery one of these cases though and then add to it a Ferguson, Missouri Trayvon George Zimmerman Cambridge police\nFreddie Gray Baltimore there's a collective left wing rush to judgment no presumption of innocence and they get proven wrong over and over again and media companies get sued and lose over and over again and they keep making the same mistakes\nI guess the problem with the president he's the president he can't sue for slander\nWell it's right in and sadly neither can judge Kavanaugh I Believe the same reason these public figure\nUh so I don't believe it's going to be able to legally go down that road but this is what they do this is who they are and Sean I Want to see is the last couple of days you have done a fabulous job wanting out the ... year\nUh I mean if if we're going to have a serious conversation about breaking in high school and drugs and high school and adult conduct of a domestic violence on your have incumbent democratic members of the Senate with court records well out there well discuss\nUh and and and suddenly this is no longer part of the conversation or can't be discussed I mean this is crazy this is crazy I mean I think they've gone down the road here that they're going to regret long term because every\nDemocrat I I don't I don't think so because it sort of like when Harry Reid lied about Mitt Romney I didn't pay taxes in ten years and then he was asked after the election if he cared about lying about Mitt Romney's way there is no we won the election what's the difference\nAnd the ... the means for the I think the left so believes conservatives are evil that they feel justified in whatever it is that they say that's right you know but the problem is here this is so serious an allegation\nAnd you know I'm not the biggest fan of the Republican Party I'm not a Republican I've been very critical when they're weak in timid and stupid and I would say they have handled this what the appropriate amount of serious this they have balance what is a fair system\nThey've given every possibility shadow of a doubt and now it's time to vote\nNow the question is Kelly where Susan Collins where's Lisa Murkowski and wears Jeff snowflake going to vote\nAnd write it comes down to three I mean Mitch McConnell I had been a real warrior and pushing for a

you're not vote for that nominee don't ever get people to get their humor lapdog but they might get out of their own political okay for a loop Beckley right\nI mean yeah I mean high camp and and mentioned but I think I don't think they go that way a less Collins and Murkowski or\nA combination of of Collins and and flake or or Murkowski in like\nOnce the Republicans have the vote then they'll have the freedom to go and I don't think the Democratic leadership because of of flying hoot about their constituents in West Virginia Florida North Dakota Indiana Missouri\nBecause if they did they would say vote your conscience I mean Jeff Flake the hero of the Democratic party why because he admits season on principle man that would never vote the way he really felt because he's only doing this because he's he's lifted up the burden of having to face the horrible voters they get\nI mean that was a horrible admission on sixty minutes yeah\nYeah and I I mean [laughter] don't\nGet real does wrong principle is man that stands on their values\nAnd it is a man who wrote a book mimicking Barry Goldwater is a conscious of the conservative ... and ... you know if he is then now we have a

Fox News too many people are dead after a limousine crash in ... New York about thirty miles west of Albany the state capital Chris theory is with the New York state police\nSaid she was in her late teens and then she switched it back to Fifteen Years old she said it happened in the Nineteen eighties then you switch that back to Nineteen eighty two practical everything she said turn out to be false now you got to be kind to the woman because she's a allegedly a survivor of sexual assault\nBut part of the deal is when you make certain assertions and if they're refuted as they were by Brett Kavanaugh you got a proven ... supposedly\nShe was terrified of small spaces terrified of airplanes then we find out from a boyfriend that they want on John's together basically all over the globe\nShe went to Costa Rica she went to Hawaii she went to uh the south Pacific Island she went to a French Polynesia she went to Israel she went to Central America she went to Europe all by being terrified of airplanes or\nThe boyfriend also said during the six years that he dated her in a sworn statement to the Senate committee\nShe never mentioned a sexual assault never mentioned the name Brett Kavanaugh will shed no fear of flying in fact the flu around islands on single propeller airplanes sitting next to each other that she uh the the second door theory was a bunch of crap because it came out\nThey want it to second door in their home and twenty oh eight four years before the therapy session because she wanted to provide an entrance to\nHer therapist to conduct their business as a psychologist inside of her home\nShe also coached a friend about how to take a polygraph test she lied about that she also a stole money from the boyfriend so all these things that she said Dr Christina forward simply fell apart and now yesterday or today\nHer lawyer Deborah cats came out to say that she doesn't want to pursue the Kavanaugh thing anymore really she's done with it so\nMedia turned out to be liars and thieves in trucks and miscreants every every description the second accuser Debbie ...\nA dusting off the memories polling of Bill Clinton on her as a freshman in college no one supported horror story either she gave for names the FBI they checked out the stories of ... Ramirez shaking his junk and her face she must have been thinking of Bill Clinton but basically no one supported her story either\nAnd then one of the silent heroes of this has been the porn lawyer Michael Evan Eddie boy did a great job\nFor the Republicans he came out with such ridiculous antithetical information that no one believed word of what he said in fact they cast light away from a weight from a from a doctor forward and Debbie ... and put it on sweating it nobody believed in fact here's a quote from\nSenator Collins on Saturday quote some of the allegations Lebanon against judge Kavanaugh illustrate why the presumption of innocence is so important I'm thinking in particular not of the allegations raised by professor forward but at the allegation that\nWhen he was a teenager judge Kavanaugh drug multiple girls and use their weaken state to facilitate gang rape\nThis outlandish allegation was put forth without any credible supporting evidence and simply parrot it\nPublic statements of others that such an allegation can find its way into the U.S Supreme Court confirmation process\nIs a stark reminder about why the presumption of innocence is so ingrained in our American consciousness quote unquote\nSo said a Senator Susan Collins and that was a beautiful comment I Love Susan Collins I Love Lindsey Graham and I think Michael ... is doing a great job of representing the Democratic party needs to keep doing it\nPlus uh as far as supporting the me too movement and standing with Kevin\n... I read some way of a expert from the independent women's forum Julie gun coming up later on but Patrice lay on world 'cause it's been on my show many times wrote a column a sudden this morning Sunday Morning about supporting survivors and standing with Kevin ...\nShe said those who promotes the slogan set up a false dichotomy if you believe that survivors of sexual assault it it'd be should be able to tell their stories and find justice I Am with you\nThat you then must believe the allegations of Christine afford therefore you must agree the judge Kavanaugh was lying and you must opposes confirmation she said this is a false choice\nAs a woman I can be sympathetic to victims of sexual abuse but also care about the facts of each specific case if I was a member of a jury sitting at a rape matter\nMy sympathy would be what the victim\nHowever I Want to hear the evidence or lack of cooperation and inconsistencies to make sure the correct parties identified and she goes on to point out the number of times the Innocence Project and others have exonerated through late DNA testing\nRape rapist to have spent thirty seven years in jail including Gregory towns and Van Dyke Perry who spent a combined thirty seven years in prison on false rape charges DNA testing showed that the men were not connected with the crime\nAnd the victim later after they did thirty seven years in jail admitted that she lied\nOr how about the Hofstra University case\nIn which for Hofstra University men were indicted expelled from Hofstra their lives ruined about a gang rape of an Eighteen year old fellow student and twenty nine\nThe accuser later admitted that are allegation was fabricated the authorities dropped the charges but the damage to these young men and their families were already done plus innocent projects it got an innocent project dot com they have hundreds and hundreds of men or exonerated\nOf rape charges when later evidence came out why can't the United States Senate understand that about Ninety percent of the allegations of rape and sexual assault or accurate but ten percent or more are not accurate\nIn other words there are uncorroborated and you need evidence which is a bedrock of American Jurisprudence this writer goes on to say as a woman as a mother as a sister and a daughter I Believe in justice and fairness and the me too movement these values are not in competition to treat men\nFairly all victims deserve justice but justice is not one sided due process in fairness should be upheld for both the accuser and the accused for conservatives and liberals for women and for men\nSo when you look at the allegations of professor crocheting afford they completely fall apart they don't exist there is no cooperation\n... and so you can't say we support the me too movement\nAnd we also have to say that we believe in bedrock principles of due process and fairness and innocent until proven guilty\nThose two principles are not in conflict except in the minds of Cory Booker\nKamala Harris and a senator her own uh of Hawaii when asked this morning whether it's right for paid democratic activist to chase down Republicans in restaurants in elevators and airports she could not say that his wrongful activity she couldn't say that\nIn fact they indirectly demand violence against Republicans and show you where we are Steven\n... of the Late

used like a three dollar steak by Senator Feinstein and others to make public private information that she wanted to keep private because she fit their diatribe it is unbelievable\nAnd this writer for the CBS Evening show saving Kobe or aerial Duma says it clearly quote whatever happens I'm just glad ruined Brett Kavanaugh as life\nThey want it to ruin him for the sake of ruining him because he didn't vote the way they wanted him to vote and he was nominated by Trump who they hate\nThat sums up the entire difficulties with Democrats they now try to dig out from their own rubble for the

high hard Radio's news radio is one of five five tell you we are see\nI didn't think I'd ever see this in my lifetime Susan Collins stood up like a tenfold beginning the night she was brilliant [noise]\nGoing over forty five minutes why she was going to support and then I I tried to listen to Lisa Murkowski who made no sense at all it seems like slime ball tactics have good consequences as long as you make the slime ball tactics they seem to work Lisa Murkowski in Alaska\nI mean there is no reason she could not have listened to what Susan Collins had to say [noise]\nAnd maybe she hates Trump's so much you could not stand to put one of his nominees in the U.S Supreme Court [noise]\nAnd I'm so proud of ah Brett Kavanaugh was wife his mom and dad his girls and what they had to put up with like he was crucified on the Democratic cross a political correctness in title nine\nThat's what boys go through in college when charged with a girl up some sexual assault and most likely did not happen to get into title nine court and presumption of innocence cross examination of witness confronting your accuser is all that kinda stuff doesn't apply\nSo in the minds of Democrats this was a title nine case in which the allegation was made and therefore you cannot investigate professor Ford\nOnce investigated mainly by the conservative media practically everything Ford said fell apart including the four eyeball witnesses\nIncluding her river version of the facts from her twenty twelve and twenty Thirteen therapists notes including the front door the fear of flying whatever it was I'm not sure she said anything that was truthful at all nothing\nAnd so Lisa Murkowski is stupid\nThe woman from Alaska stupid Susan Collins took some serious flak from the radical left like my friend Bryan kill me did a Fox and friends and she stood up and did what was right I don't know if she's going to run for reelection and two years\nBut she ought to but now a clowns fools to come out of the woodwork to like Valerie Jarrett up and God's the fame to run against during Maine have added\nMust continue their calls us go to a Lewis in Chicago [noise] Lewis in Chicago welcome to the bill Cunningham show Lewis go ahead\nThanks bill I appreciate you taking my call Yes sir I just wanted to comment on the relationship of the Democratic party to the pornography industry if you don't mind sure yeah do you know the Democrats claim to care about women but I'm over the years\nI wanted her largest supporters has been the pornography industry and I'm just wondering if they're really cared about women why did it take money from these people who would like women that way\nNow about Michael ... the the porn lawyer and I I think he did a great job I mean he's got to be on Don Lemon but I'm On CNN or MSNBC a lot more times Michael ... is such a loud mouth clown in such an embarrassment he defends porn stars and this guy says he's going to run against the president twenty twenty\nCould we be that lucky my having any run against ...\nI Hope he does bill but I tell you you know if you look back to the Clinton years they they didn't have one criminal conviction against pornography\nAnd that opened the doors to all this I Believe I Believe it open the doors to all this you know bad stuff this pilots stuff you see out there\nDuring the porn style to porn industry has given millions of dollars that the Democrats along with the abortion industry so killing babies in sub spaghetti women to lie for sexual assault is what the Democratic Party is all about\nIf they if they cared about sexual assault or women than their leader would not be\nThe U.S Congressman Ellison and he would not be the candidate in Minnesota that they're really cared about women and sexual assault Bill Clinton will not serve out his term if they really care and the enabler Bill Clinton Hillary Clinton wouldn't have been the nominee in ...\nIf they really cared about sexual assault correct\nCorrect absolutely right and do you know but actually are doing a lot of harm to these people because of you know the old effect of the boy who cried wolf now nobody is going to believe women who are are telling the truth\nWell or if a woman comes forward with a probably eight or nine times out of ten it is correct\nBut every now and then you have Hofstra every now and then you have the Duke lacrosse team or UVA every now and then you have the Innocence Project that's listed hundreds of men cleared of rape charges from false allegations and so yeah I'm going to believe a woman a Ninety percent of the time\nBut I Want to hear the story I'm sympathetic with professor forward I Want to hear what happened how it happened\nHow did you get to the party how'd you get home from the party Hoover the eyewitnesses tell me about the second door tell me about the fear of flying all these things Lewis turned out to be a lie or a misstatement or not true you know the truth the whole thing that happened is I think in twenty twelve and twenty Thirteen\nWhen she wants to see her therapist she spoke the truth and she said and twenty twelve and twenty Thirteen before a cabin all was going to be a nominee she told the therapist\nThat she was a attempted rape by four boys in her late teens and the mid Nineteen eighties\nAnd the reason it didn't fit Kavanaugh\nIs because he was one boy\nAnd by the mid Nineteen eighties Brett Kavanaugh was not living in Maryland anymore he had moved to Connecticut\nShe had to tell the fib that it was Kevin Oh but the but the notes of the therapist clearly indicated it could not have been bred to Kevin all you see if you go to a therapist or a doctor ... and you're seeking help\nPsychiatric help or medical assistance you are incentivized to tell the truth or not going to go to a doctor and say my right arm hurts when Israeli or left foot\nOr because you want treatment\nSo when Dr Ford went to a therapist in twenty ... twenty Thirteen who made copious notes about what she said out of her own mouth she said and twenty twelve that four boys tried to rape me when I was in my late teens or in the mid Nineteen eighties ...\nShe had flipped out on Kavanaugh

[noise]\nAnd Democrats never wanted to put professor forward through a any rigorous process that determined to voice you were saying was accurate or now here we are several days later\nAfter she testified what about ten days ago\n[noise] that practically everything she said was false including the number of people that attacked or what had happened how it happened ... how old she was\nAt that time frame it happened in the two front door was the ... the fearing the fly was ridiculous in her boyfriend came out and said she was a safe and some of these other facts come out and you're thinking now wait a minute or maybe what I heard originally is not accurate or when\nChris Wallace of Fox News after she testified said the Republicans are in trouble I thought to myself now hold up in that car let's find out what Brett Kavanaugh has to say and now that she's testified there's going to be a several day process to check out what she says is if it's accurate or\nThe two front doors was either a misrepresentation or ally ... because the front door went in and twenty oh eight or not twenty twelve and it went in not because she needed an extra way out but because\nA small business

[noise]\nAnd the boyfriend follows the epidemic but saying we've for little planes all over French Polynesia and ...\nAnd uh Hawaii ... we also went on trips to Central America to South America and

she lied lied lied\nAnd she wasn't covered because she was a woman [noise]\nRight [noise] and and really let me tell you the most important thing that we learned and that is that we Republicans we didn't stand up to them before they took advantage of our moral character and we learned this time that the only way to like that is by route\nOn his political force hats off to McConnell yeah I talked to Collins hats off to Lindsey Graham about that route political horses we only way that we are going to eat them and we can avoid a civil war as your last guest said how can we do that by Bruce winning course my beat him at the ballot\nGot away and you got to vote you got to you know Schumer said one thing Saturday and that was correct you got to vote in the Denver if you take away the Democratic party from the coast and about seven or eight major cities\nThere is no Democrats hardly any where does this sea of red from seed a shining city it's a irrelevant minimalist party but the problem is the mainstream media is there a megaphone\nAnd the major media will not cover objectively this president nor any Republican president they didn't cover Alito correctly that didn't cover Roberts and look what they did a cabin all look what's next to Amy Coney Barrett ought to be the next Supreme Court justice\nAnd from Notre Dame and when that happens all hell is going to break loose and Barbie gene ... made certain maker you watch that fight\n[laughter] really didn't get a thank you today to hear Eric Holder who still contempt of Congress yeah say that now we have to call into question the legitimacy of this of the Supreme Court\nMe see Billy for the last forty years since Nineteen thirty seven says conservatives had a majority on the Supreme Court we never questioned malignancy of a prominent but now all of a sudden when we go through a legitimate process of confirmation all of a sudden they stand up and say we've got to question the whole legitimate you process do you recall outrageous\nDo recall and the third debate that Trump made a Trump was asked whether or not if he lost the election if he would accept it\nAnd the media has a meltdown one Trump made a statement to the fact that he might not accept the results in November elections if he felt it was rigged against him and the media Hillary Clinton to New York times jumped on top of Trump because he would not accept the results of the election everyone thought a course sailor was going to win\nAnd then Trump won and up to this point Hillary and the major media has not accepted the outcome of the election and so they'd be came with it criticized\nAnd the third debate Trump said I may not accept the outcome of the election because it looked like it it's rigged however\nThe media went after him Hillary one after him Hillary's there let's be clear about what are you saying and that means he's talking down in American democracy and I'm appalled that someone who's the nominee of one of the two major parties would take that position quote unquote Mallory Clinton but then Trump won\nAnd Hillary never considered the election she'd never accepted the ballot box\nNew York times never accepted the fact that Trump won so they became what they criticize it was nothing but nothing short of a ... and thank you for your call let's continue now with a Joe and New Hampshire it's been there for

summation of everything so there's no need for me to repeat any of that but what I'm calling you about tonight is so important to have you ever heard of Jonathan\nSimon and his book code red about a ... vote and racial fraud in America actually in the cities\nYeah I I think that there is a bunch of him example in the city of Cleveland there were more votes cast for Obama than citizens registered in certain words\nAnd and it's because the because Cleveland's in an important state my home state of Ohio I'm sure there's massive voter fraud and Chicago New York and whatever but Ohio in Cleveland Columbus I Would not be surprised at all if there was hundreds or thousands of illegal votes cast because of the tabulation system\nAnd there is no check and balance because there's no Republicans in Cleveland [noise]\nWell the thing is Mr Cunningham if you're ... code red China concern would be an excellent guess for your show before the terms but here's the thing\nThe way it works with the algorithms and the machine and the companies that I made a fair for the next ... only three or four for the entire country and it's done in the cities\nAnd what you would have is a situation where the machine has program where\nThe Democrat as a thousand actual votes cast a Republican has an actual votes cast for the machine has got to say\nEleven hundred for the Democrat nine hundred hundred for the Republican it's programmed in advance and the person that runs the city the Democrats in most cases\nThey're the ones that oversee the installation of the ballots for the terms who's on the ballot what have you know and the machine can be corrupted and the algorithm would\nYou take away votes from Republican to Democrat\nOr a give me the name of the guy in the book again I'm going to talk to my producer\nJonathan Simon\nThe book is code red and he was a guest on coast to coast a month ago when George ... he was on three hours and it was really riveting\nAnd it's been happening for a

about our society it really to me bill is nothing less than the continued some version of our nation beginning in the Nineteen twenties with the communist\nAnd their attempt to undermine us from
