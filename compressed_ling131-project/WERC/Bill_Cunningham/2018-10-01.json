to death their own shadow not one Republican mail center white male center was willing to interview a woman for the thought they'd be called sexist racist than thousand other words\nBy liberal they gave it to a woman a woman prosecutor named Mitchell who is the single\nWorst prosecutor I haven't seen in my entire like near you and I could have put this girl on the stand and you and I want to destroy their bill we would've had or just a apoplectic she wouldn't know what to say her entire case within ripped to shreds about five minutes and she couldn't get a decent questionnaire intent around the five minute questioning\nShe couldn't get it out and you got a thing isn't it true you fly all the time yes or no it isn't it true that you told there's too many you needed to de bred to be able to drive your he isn't it true that you will not give us a therapist no she gave the Washington Post isn't it true you've align yourself with a foreign ... most of your life\nIsn't it true not

and you built the house you did the renovation of two thousand eight not two thousand twelve you're a liar\nThey could've said are you a democratic operative how many Democrats did you speak to connect you with the top Democrat lawyers and George George lawyers\nTo get involved in this case they could have after a thousand questions they could've after ... well they did after who paid for your lie detector test and I don't know what do you mean you don't know where's the follow up question everyone knows ... why would someone do it for free the whole thing is ridiculous\nThey could've after about a thousand issues like a two thousand twelve when you claim out of the blue you enter repressed memory of rape\nIsn't it true that in two thousand twelve Mitt Romney named\nThree potential people would be a Supreme Court nominees and one of them was Brett Kavanaugh is that how you came to know Brett Kavanaugh isn't it true that Planned Parenthood two thousand twelve to ... heads the newspapers all over the country that said roe versus Wade make believe it was just overturn and they showed the pictures of the night Supreme Court justice\nAnd they replaced Ginsburg faced with Brett Kavanaugh and they said this is going to be Mitt Romney Supreme Court nominee overturns roe versus Wade is that how you got to know his name have you decided to become a heroin or the left by making up a story I mean there's a thousand things they could have said is it true\nYour father is CIA true your grandfather was CIA is a true your brother was working for a law firm that found a GPS fusion is that possible and you're not a democratic operative where all those questions\nHow bad is it true the bread Kevin O's mother a Marilyn said John trial judge Robert bonded over the foreclosure your

singer parents being questioned by a judge that you get incredible power over future of her family's life and even though of actually they can't lose out that's my understanding they did not lose the house and the judge actually in the end kind of root for them\nIt doesn't matter you may have developed a deep seated hatred for that judge and found out that that judge his son is now going to be Supreme Court nominee there's a thousand things you could say the CIA one is amazing that's not a conspiracy theory or dad CIA at her grandfather CIA and her brother is with a company that's when the

of those twenty five million Supreme Court\nYou might recall June July August that was a big deal with twenty sixteen she said that that because I'm Kevin O's name was on the Trump bliss during the campaign and also triggered some thought she had to come forward and do whatever\nIn reality Brent Kevin O's name did not hit the Trump bliss until November a twenty Seventeen more than one year after the election his name was known in the list for her to react to December twenty sixteen but the media does boy that out either\nLives in the best case I think that of all of those out of all I mean they're all standing but the best one is that Dianne Feinstein knew about this in July if this was real how can any once it gets real when they interviewed him one on one face to face and never mentioned that there's a woman claiming you attempt to rape or\nThey have that for the last days\nTo see first if they might be able to beat him\nBy the guards and more in the toilet planes the guard

I Want to tell you what troubles me greatly about Thursday\nAnd then I Want to get your perspective and I I kinda look towards Fox News often as a place I can go to ... conservative commentary and things of that character and ah after a doctor forwarded testified\nThe the son of Mike Wallace Chris Wallace said forge testimony is extremely emotional extremely Raul extremely credible\nNo uh no one could listener delivery delivery of those words and talk about the assault on the impact it at our life and not have your heart go out to her this is a disaster for the Republicans so started Chris Wallace Thursday Afternoon judge ended up ... generally I respect said\nI think Dr Ford is exceptionally credible Karl Rove\nThe great political theorist said forward as\nA credible unbelievable\nSo one when I heard those commentaries I thought we were done\nAnd then I of course watch Brett Kavanaugh's testimony and they're still in as the Democrats show toward him Thursday Afternoon and everything flipped completely\n... but when you have Chris Wallace and you have an Android Apollo Tono and Karl Rove saying that a woman is credible ...\nWho provide as witness names that turned out not to be witnesses at all\nWhat when you have ah Christine Ford straight up lying about her in capability of flying which you flew everywhere but every one of the witnesses re future story has no memory of the gathering\nAnd the woman who wants a anonymity to testify turn down the opportunity to be questioned in private then we find out or lawyers never told her she had that opportunity at all so every time I tried to test her credibility making bart that turns out to be great grossly lacking\nSo when conservative commentator said she's believable she's credible and clearly she isn't it we completely lost our way [noise]\n[laughter] well I think we have to Colorado yeah completely lost our way because he went to one telling us that Donald Trump never had a chance of winning\nThe people can see through it I think most people that I was talking to your testimony that the women and then I found ... cabinets people even though there was such a notion from falsely accused innocent\nMan who in the in the court of public opinion in the current day cleaning up to this quote unquote hearing his life was completely turned upside down and his wife was getting that threat and his career with cooking because it's highly sabotage and destroyed\nAs well as his reputation and here we have Christine horn and I do believe that something happened to her she obviously has been in therapy for that age\nI she sat her so she has two front doors you know anybody that has to door bell no there's no snow\nSo obviously she had this you know now it just because she says something happened doesn't happen and we have plenty of examples that or that it gets because she\nIt's like having a rape or maybe not but all the evidence that she's for that so far all star to being out in\n... in fact if you presented us in a court of law in which the so called victim provides for names Brett Kavanaugh mark judge PJ Smith labeling Kaiser including her best girlfriend legal in Kaiser\nWho would have no motivation align are allied all who said I don't even know pride Kevin all\nThe all of them said the event didn't happen including mark judge you wrote on the floor supposedly with the with bread Kevin on Christine forward he said it did not get discount more judging okay what about PJ Smith who simply a classmate\nWho said these events never took place when Christine Ford's said they did then wheeling Kaiser her best girlfriend\nSaid they didn't happen but she also said I believer why believer but they didn't happen I don't know\nI don't know how that works at all and then you have are saying that well I I was flabbergasted when Trump running for the president being twenty sixteen but the name of bread cabin on the Supreme Court list\nIn fact the matter is he didn't put his name on the list when he was running it didn't happen till November twenty Seventeen so how could you be frightened during the campaign about Brett Kavanaugh getting the Supreme Court what his name one on the list at all [noise]\nAnd how can she be believable to those are like you just mentioned Chris Wallace Karl Rove and all the time is up I don't know because [noise]\n... exactly what were they watching and hear like you said when I had a sexual harassment case it fell short of being an assault case\nHowever I had the burden of proof that was my responsibility short order for a present the evidence I had to be cross examined I had a beat the post and let me tell you something I wasn't given lawyers\nFrom the defensive side that treated me what's kept glove no okay it was a very uncomfortable hearing solve this talks about equal right on gender equality what do you know what\nI was treated not as a woman that as a mad at eight percent and bringing bringing forward charges against another person so to watch that lawyer that the Republicans hired\nTreat her as though she were a child she's a doctor and not take the opportunity to necessarily ... calls and then many stories that she had concocted she didn't like to fly than we find out she lives all over the world\nAh and also just the holes in our story said thank thank God
