Fox News Deborah free been lost a friend at the tree of life synagogues shooting in Pittsburgh at a vigil in the squirrel hill neighborhood she remembers Jerry Rabinowitz\nAnd the two nurses who first arrived at the scene to save the rotten filthy life for Robert Bowers\nOr Jewish or how serendipitous the Jews save the life of Robert Bowers\nAnd if I was in charge I Would deal with all the other ones first to deal with him last to know fully what a blood out but unfortunately he's alive now being cared for in a Pittsburgh hospital by Jewish doctor\nOh my God [noise] and so I look about what happened in the hate this guy exhibited for many many months and I like to know where are the people he communicated with was he\nOn friend that was ... who else knew what he was saying the things he was saying and and by the way he hated Donald Trump because Trump was a great\nFriend of Israel and Bowers also headed Trump because Trump is the only American president in history that Jewish grandchildren his daughter Ivanka\nHas become an observant Jew her husband Jared Kushner is a ah Orthodox Jews the children the president's children or Jews or the president has attended many Jewish religion\nDysfunction says I have and so this guy who\nAh hates Jews and wanted to kill Jews mentally ill no criminal past his neighbor said it was a great guy always very friendly\nAnd went after Trump for loving Jews is now Trump is being attacked by the mainstream media in Washington Post for somehow causing directly or indirectly the murder of Jews when Trump is the best friend Israel and the Jewish people I've ever had\nA few hours ago Sarah Sanders put out a tweet presidential press secretary quote is there any tragedy the Washington Post went out exploit to attack President Trump the evil act of anti Semitism in Pittsburgh\nWas committed by a coward who hated President Trump because President Trump is an unapologetic defender of the Jewish community and the state of Israel\nSo one headline Saturday yesterday in the Washington Post said bomb suspect found an inspiration and Trump\nSo the media is saying that ... was encouraging incentivized by Trump to put out a fourteen bombs simulating the killing of two ex presidents and twelve other a notable Americans\nThat the president's being tried to assassination attempts and the murder of Jews not by some far left wing website\nIs filled with hate but by CNN [noise] by MSNBC and by the Washington Post that are supposedly mainstream objective news sources which of course they're not in fact on the day that CNN received\nThe photo bomb in the mail from ...\nThe New York times ran a progressive fiction depicting the secret service itself assassinating President Trump with Russian help\nIt's it's unbelievable on that day and in fact\nCNN's parent company Time Warner as you may know was a co sponsor of the play in Washington park\nThat simulated the stabbing the murder of the president last June performing Shakespeare's Julius Caesar they had an actor playing Caesar dressed up like Trump he was stabbed to death each time and their performance\nAnd uh one of the sponsors of that was the parent company of CNN\nNow can you imagine the reaction if say the summer of twenty Fifteen that one of the parent company of Fox News had a play in Central Park that stimulated the stabbing the vicious murder upper Iraq Hussein Obama\nI Want to know\nThe media reaction to that event but the parent company of CNN paid money to sponsor see Julius Caesar's Julius Caesar that had the an actor playing Caesar dressed as Trump being stabbed to death\nIn fact after James Hodgkinson attempt to the masses cessation of Republican members of Congress resulting in the motor wounds to Stephen skill lease\nThe Washington Post the next day ran a story about stirring up violence focusing on right wing talk radio even though Hodgkinson was a supporter an advocate\nOf a Bernie Sanders\nAnd also posted many complimentary things about Rachel Maddow\nSo instead of focusing on the fact Hodgkinson actually traveling hundreds of miles to the cap and take the leadership of the house of representatives and he was a Democrat a Bernie Sanders supporter\nOr frequent viewer of MSNBC the Washington Post ran a story about violence stirred up by right wing talk radio\nOver the last several weeks much like the uh\nThe photo bomb sent to about fourteen people there have been at least twenty examples of left wing or sending envelopes filled with white powder\nTo many many Republicans in fact all Republicans people like sex defense James Mattis the president himself the vice president all the adult children of a President Trump have received in the mail\nEnvelopes containing white powder simulating rice and\nIn fact the the the rice in like substance was sent to the home of Senator Susan Collins after she voted in favor of Brett Kavanaugh so all this is going on for weeks and weeks and weeks and the media largely did not cover it because all the news that fits they print\nAnd if that doesn't fit and then they don't print it if there was a political violence committed by James Hodgkinson of Illinois they blame conservative right wing talk radio\nOf course we know about Ted Cruz an IT cruise chased out to restaurants and also when a Senator McConnell was having dinner in a ... restaurant\nA Democrat grabbed his food and threw it in the street other diners came to the assistance of Senator McConnell who's a survivor of polio ... and his wife who's in the cabinet and the media\nDoesn't want to call those actions a mob in fact one CNN anchor Brett Baldwin and Don Lemon chastised Republicans for using the quote andme word\nOne other example whenever a white nationalist they got the right to do it but I Wish they would march in the street a progressive activist cover the words they expressed as violence but win\nLargely violent left is for him in ... and other progressive groups commit acts of violence causing thousands of dollars worth of damage on college campuses the media never covers it that way at all\nAnd so this is a long history\nOf radical leftists and some on the right\nCommitting acts of violence that is covered completely differently by the objective mainstream media the worst in my opinion\nIt's Time Warner the parent company of CNN providing money to sponsor a Shakespeare play Julius Caesar\nWhen the main actors dressed up as Trump and he stabbed to death and people applied in fact when Louis ... Louis Farrakhan the left wing nation of Islam began the anti Semite\nSet a large rally that Jews are termites and thousands in attendance applauded and cheered coding juice termites\nThat is the same person Louis Farrakhan where President Bill Clinton and broccoli saying Obama stood next to ed pictures taken with\nAt the funeral of Aretha Franklin\nAnd in fact a Obama had the political sense to know when he ran for the presidency in a way not to allow the public to know that he was a friend of Louis Farrakhan they ran around together in Chicago\nAnd that that's the classic anti Semite that the media completely ignored the relationship between Farrah Khan and Obama because it was bad politically\nSo this whole thing disgust me\nI Hope soon very soon but a Bowers is killed either a by lethal injection heading electric chair shooting whatever it takes powers has got to go the way Timothy McVeigh for violence and Bowers\nWas a Trump hater but the Washington Post has somehow implicitly tied Trump to the murder of God's loving eleven Jews yesterday morning in Pittsburgh\nThe whole thing is disgusting when you get your reaction plus we're gonna have later on David Wray affair to talk about what's happening on the southern border is anyone thought about the public\nHealth crisis caused by thousands of immigrants without vaccinations flooding into the southern border

E. R. C. [noise]\nCounting others continue with the tragedies the tragedies is weak and the one that happened on Saturday ah joining me now is Thomas ... former NYPD investigator and a very knowledgeable about these situations whether it's an attempt at mass murder or whether it's an anti Semite who kept below the radar most of the reporting on this\nUh on Saturday today a has been along the lines that uh this is Robert Bowers was just a wonderful guy\nThe uh NBC News this morning at on a neighbor lived next door to him a very sad woman who said boy kept to himself quite friendly that kinda stuff joining me now is that a saint Thomas Russian former NYPD officer investigator detective and Thomas Redskin welcome again to the bill Cunningham shown Thomas are you\nA very tough situation awful um but when I watch some of the morning\nAnd afternoon coverage of Robert Bowers forty six years old I guess no previous criminal record at all\nAnd I hit menial jobs was a truck driver did various other little things next door neighbor a woman said boy he was quiet kinda shy and said oh goodbye no difficulties and he had posted online for quite a while and I ... and rabies including hatred for Donald Trump the president\nBecause he thought Trump was two uh two nights on Israel didn't like the fact that Trump's grandchildren Jewish\nAnd ah he didn't like the fact that a Trump like the state of Israel nonetheless uh the media is pointing this out somehow Trump's response of all the Washington Post ah yesterday afternoon it today did ugly reporting\nSaying that uh that uh in fact the Sarah Sanders put out something a few hours ago just said is there any tragedy the Washington Post went out exploit do attack President Trump the evil active anti Semitism in Pittsburgh was committed by a coward\nWho hated President Trump because Trump is such a on a public defender of the Jewish community in the state of Israel\nSo let's go back from a police perspective ... said uh the analysis the experts come out of the woodwork now saying the Pittsburgh Police should have known the FBI should've known\nHow many thousands or millions I I've been tempered comments rather racial anti Semitic anti woman anti male whatever anti homosexual or ... is on social media like everyday who's going to monitor that monitor that and Tom do you see any fault by by law enforcement in this case\nNot you know I always twenty twenty along horsemen or the investigative work when I get a league\nIs that no one else was monitoring his tweets his social media and his other things that he was hosting it couldn't have alerted police what the what we always say is if you see something say something [laughter] this case\nYou know someone had this scene right and could've alerted the police on the police when you find out that the police the FBI or some law enforcement agency was told about Bowers and do something or didn't look to see if this guy does have guns or potentially follow him\nAnd we can criticized the police but until that time\nPolice and law enforcement agencies and even intelligence agencies don't have the manpower the bandwidth\nTo be able to follow every single person that they get a complaint\nAnd even sometimes like the shooting and Broward County there was a woman or call FBI numerous people had called about an Eighteen year old a punk mentally ill insane person that just shot up to high school\nAnd even though call in or an FBI people call it in that wasn't followed up on even if those things happen there's no perfection there's no perfection and law enforcement correct [noise]\nKnow perfection on horse but you're only as good as shifts today and was taking on force is very easy to do after the same but law enforcement is tough on so\nI Know from my experience with the NYPD we always look back we always did a review of what had happened and what we could do better at the same way that they're doing with the case and the bombings or the bombs that were sent\n'em they're looking back and figuring out what could we do better in the future and that's what law enforcement agencies I'm sure in Pittsburgh and the FBI and other agencies are doing towards ... and ... hours\nAnd in fact a Bowers said a posted just a few hours before the slaughter on Saturday morning quote I Can't sit by and watch my people get slaughtered screw the optics I'm going in unquote so whoever he was dealing with social media or somebody knew or should have known this guy was disintegrating\nAnd I and that person did not do anything now the experts have said because I'm sure there's several thousand individuals sadly in the country like ours\nWaiting for a trigger moment that social media exacerbates the highlights these kinds of feelings because those of like minded get together and they feed on each other's hate\nBefore social media ten twelve years ago you sent letters or you made phone calls but in social media you can be a friend hundreds and thousands of people\n... other like minded like those clowns marching around Charlottesville shouting slurs against uh against Jews and against African Americans every several hundred who did that they use social media to get together in the they feed on each other and feed on their hate now the media done well report this but this guy hated Donald Trump\nHe he he'd previously road I never voted for Trump nor a vibrant own Warner even touch the mega had\nHe goes on about Trump's grandchildren being Jewish but the media still jumping on Trump for some reason because the climate out there that everyone is causing the president is one of many causing it so when you were in NYPD or you go back right now the Pittsburgh Police or go back in time and say [noise]\nSo you know I I don't think it's a matter of [noise]\nYou know what it said it's a matter of how we're saying and [noise] and it's a matter for law enforcement standpoint of it has to be dial back\nBecause you're pressing police departments to there and agree right they have to be ready to respond to a ... guy goes to Times Square for no other reason that he wants to kill innocent people going to the theater\nIn New York City on me [laughter] a bunch of years ago and thank God he failed terrorism school and couldn't blow up his own car because he would have killed\nIf not injured hundreds if not thousands of people but there are not like this around the country it's what keeps law enforcement people up at night\nWorrying about this lone wolf the guy who's not really talk to someone the guy who was sort of a loner a guy who's pretty well thought of in this neighborhood who is capable of grabbing his guns and go into a place in killing innocent people for no other reason than his ideology or his private jeeze\nThomas is out there all the way but Thomas Rosekind former NPD NYPD officer thanks for coming in the bill gonna game show and all of us need to lower the rhetoric just a little bit because

committed to trying to assist America of reasonable borders and David Wray will once again welcome to the bill Cunningham show and David how you doing\nI'm doing great my friend that you\nGo let me share with the American people something you of a put forth in one of your missteps and that is what's going on with all this stuff going on with the mailing bombs and all that stuff going on and the victims and then the potential arrest all that stuff something else is happening I think much more important in the southern border the media is covering for obvious reasons\nAnd that is that this is something being used by the mainstream media to attack the Republicans and Donald Trump but you say among other things in his article\nThe caravan of an estimated seven thousand some say it's closer to Fifteen thousand at this point\nOf Central American migrants is now you know well into Mexico with the Claritin ten of reaching us border with the migrants intend to seek political asylum\nThe impetus for this latest caravan is not a humanitarian crisis in Central America but rather as accurately described by the wall Street Journal and organized done by political agitator as an activist Noor intent on using migration is a political weapon to foment\nBorder chaos and I might add to the to hurt Donald J Trump I could not conceive on a particular day at a particular time at a particular place all of a sudden seven to ten thousand a Honduran just showed up together in one place and said let's walk through America two thousand miles away no one believes that so what happened\nWith the political agitator than the activist who got this together explained that the major media will deal with\nWell you know Bill thanks for highlighting this and this is another example of you know weaponized migration if you recall Nineteen eighty Mariel boatlift when Fidel Castro sent a hundred and twenty five thousand\nDisenfranchised in criminal and mentally ill a Cuban immigration to South Florida and the idea was to use population as a way to destabilize and disrupt a you know competing country and once again we have here\nWhere we have a leftist politician in Honduras former member of Congress\nA who's a a ... according to vice president Pence getting backing from the Venezuelan government no friend of the United states who has stirred up and created a caravan of some Thirteen thousand as many Thirteen thousand people\nSome of whom are our economic migrants and they say they're coming here just to work\nBut others are MS Thirteen a\nGang members deportees there's also\nA ... men of working age from Asia and from a a East Asia or East Asia and South Asia coming this way what you have here is uh if you just watch on TV where they try to do this you know people are just are coming along and doing it on their\nMeals are suddenly appearing pets are suddenly appearing\nMedical care is suddenly appealing this this is not\nSomething that just happened on its own nobody is coordinating this and paying for this you don't believe me why don't you take your wife and kids and try walk in Louisville, Kentucky and see where you end up tonight to who put up for you\nBut the medical care and the free hot food I mean it just doesn't happen like that these things are coordinated and there are a government behind this that are trying to destabilize the United states and let's let's be honest here\nIs it a coincidence that this is happening just ten days away probably the most important mid term election and your in my lifetime I mean that is not a coincidence vibrant and on top of that there are now three caravans coming\nTo now because the media doesn't cover this because all the news that fits they print and this doesn't fit the narrative the megaphone at the Democratic party explain why now here we are getting ready for a week from Tuesday is going to be a very important election all of a sudden\nTens of thousands of my door and show up at the same place at the same time with precision began marching together ... along with food and I'm an army marches on his belly along with water intensive medical care all these things is just came out of nowhere and now there's too many events happening with the media will uncover what are they\n... well you know there there are three separate\nUh caravans that are formed the largest one that we're talking about now and then to to smaller ones in El Salvador one that hasn't even left yet\nBut I mean on the one hand the reporters are saying these are women pushing their baby strollers and then the ... you know they make the mistake of up panning the crowd and showing the visual and I've seen a\nPictures of people handing out money to these folks I've seen trays of hot meals being handed obscene medical supplies\nAnd so on they are you know trying to uh I think you know how the Mariel boatlift\nAnd not only destabilized South Florida but it ended up leading probably two or Jimmy Carter's a election down fall and the following election although Jimmy Carter help that out quite a bit himself\nI think that that this is an attempt by leftist government and perhaps some of the open borders advocates around the world to destabilize the United states and to embarrass Donald Trump right before the most important mid term election of his lifetime\nIs embarrassing him because on balance because it was going politically against the Democrats all of a sudden a bomb scares the bomb threats began as if now the media doesn't deal at all with the migration that look so bad and according to CBS News about eighty percent", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Bill Cunningham", "city": "Birmingham", "day": "29"}
