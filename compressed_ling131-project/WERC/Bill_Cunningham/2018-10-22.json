United states after making an end run around Mexican agents who briefly ... bought them at the Guatemalan border Fox's William last year that\nToward America has made it and run this afternoon around Mexican agents who briefly stopped them the numbers have swelled to about ten thousand and every time you watch ABC or CNN interview one of them they talk about a gentleman by talking about what Trump wants you to do and the F. word all these things are shouted against our president\nThey're they're getting help from sympathetic Mexicans at every turn offer them food and water clothing transportation driving pickup trucks and vans and cargo truck stop to let them clamor board to go north\nAnd so over the next several weeks we're going to have tens of thousands of individuals or\nFrom the most violent place on Mother Earth ... make their way into Texas Nevada Arizona and basically ... the media is telling us we should encourage it and not let and let it occur like Nancy Pelosi said Saturday that she would welcome all of the migrants from Central America all of them are well\nThere's about thirty five million who live in Central America there's about a hundred and forty million in Mexico there's another two hundred million in South America polling has indicated given a choice South American Central Americans and Mexicans somebody like two hundred million would come to America ... two hundred million\nWhat would that do to our government to our welfare spending ... hospitals do our presidents we wouldn't have a country anymore to hundred million want to come here [noise] and because the way the law is constituted a that are the Democrats were not allowed to change it takes ten Democrats and the Senate to do anything\nAnd they won't permit it they will permit that because if you're from other than Mexico too you know the words from Central America and you may go to America there's a magic car that you have to read seeking refugee status and that begins a legal process it will take years\nIn the meantime you're inside of America waiting for a hearing that cannot take place we're not scaled they have enough camps they have enough judicial officers do you have enough lawyers are not scaled for any of this to allow tens of thousands or millions to arrive at our border so far this year until\nOctober first which is what about two and a half weeks ago we have a hundred and Seventy five thousand migrants have come to America this year\nFrom a central and South America hundred and Seventy five thousand we don't have the judges the lawyers the courtrooms to hold hearings hundred and seven hundred Seventy five thousand when you have five to ten year backlogs\nOf millions who not been heard yet and so the game being played by the Democrats is extremely serious if you're from Mexico here illegally you're going to take it right back immediately if you're from Central America you have the right to hear that goes on and on and on and never stops\nSo uh I I'm interested\nTo see when and if the media will change their coverage to provide objective information the damages caused\nBy unbridled massive illegal migration from third world poverty driven criminals societies into America and what the impact that has in schools orphanages hospitals\nAnd the rest there's no media coverage of what's happening in Nevada Arizona California taxes through New Mexico through legal migration ... there's no coverage it doesn't exist the murders the rapes and cetera it does not exist\nRemember that nine of the ten most violent countries in the world or south of the U.S border sixteen of the twenty most violent the other foreign Africa\nAnd they're invading our country they don't have uniforms on but they're coming here in mass incentivized by our media by the Democratic party [noise] I said in twenty sixteen the reason Trump shocked the world was because of illegal immigration\nFederal judges and the economy right now\nWith Trump is our leader everything is coming up roses it's unbelievable\nTrump has everyone from North Korea to Russia believing we're about to bust up every new trading necessary to keep to get America back on the even track\nThe trade imbalances are starting to flip it was an economy exceeding five percent GDP the unemployment numbers so not just the ... the lowest they ever could be the or the other three point seven percent of us would not work can be put a gun to their head the terrorists are on the run\nISIS is destroyed Iran is on notice and marginalized and even the Saudis now are doing some soul searching about how they treat people\nOpioid issues prison reform marijuana reform is all coming on the rise this guy is performing magnificently\nBut the media is going to use they think immigration the tank the twenty eight teams to favor the Democrats and the tank this president and twenty twenty ... now that's not the world that I live in maybe if you live in Connecticut a Las Vegas or Chicago\nCalifornia San Diego that's the world you live and you want more individuals here was a third grade education Eighteen to twenty eight years old with no marketable skills not able to speak at the English you want maybe a few thousand more in your community\nPlease bring them according to the Democratic party but that's not the word I live in Cincinnati, Ohio I don't think\nThose who think about these issues\nIn Las Vegas or Chicago or California San Diego Tampa Denver Cincinnati I don't think we think about these issues in ways\nThat the mainstream media can understand I must live in some alternative universe because according to CNN this is the issue\nOf unbridled migrants walking into America that will cause average Americans living in Wisconsin and Michigan the vote for the Democratic party if that's the case I live in some alternative universe that's not the world in which I live\nI'm Sorry and I wish there was some way through the magic wand\nThat we go to help the two or three hundred million\nMexicans Central Americans and south Americans not living a great life that don't have the opportunities that you and I have we're only four percent of the world's population but every year legally through ... says these we take in legally one point one million\nForeigners to come into America take the oath of office and become American citizens which is more than the rest of the world put together\nWe already do that one point one million\nBut I'll be damned if I'm going to sit here and and watch hordes\nOf young males from El Salvador Guatemala and Nicaragua Mexico Venezuela Colombia Peru Bolivia Paraguay why Europe why Brazil and Argentina it simply illegally make their way somehow into America\nClaim their quota refugee get in line for hearings five or ten years from now that will never happen\nThis is fundamentally changed our country that was far and it's going to be much worse\nIf in twenty Eighteen what in two weeks two weeks in two days the Democrats take the house and or the Senate\nIf that out if that happens the country we live and we'll see still exist do we have the do we have the wherewithal to take in a hundred million people\nAre the schools coined in such a fashion other hospitals ready to go or other bridges the roads the expressway ready to accept a hundred million more people because the Democratic party says that's what's coming how is this possible\nThat's the most violent places on earth and sending us largely young males to come into America\nI got a Kevin jacks and coming up later an African American leader of great note there is no race or group of people more hurt by legal immigration than African American males especially young African American males they figured out that this is not benefit\nThem at all doesn't benefit American business does it better for the American public education\nDoes it benefit the hospital systems that we have the benefit of any part of our does it benefit our jobs economy absolutely not we bring in legally one point one million\nI'm proud to say that we are a nation of immigrants but there are legal immigrants you don't determine for yourself to join the country come in walk into a country which you don't belong to a not a citizen up then demand rights are you kidding me [noise]\nOh I asked you that question tonight is that

point he might agree with\nYou I Would agree with that completely and I want to tell you you know the road again Governor Romney judge Kavanaugh right ... they were led by the Democratic party for a

spent some time with the president a privately it was wonderful you spent like\nA hundreds or thousands of hours with the guy and I said on the air the other day that uh there there's a differential between what I see in the media sometimes with the president and how he truly is\nBefore we get on to so many issues going on especially the mobs versus jobs and all that kind of stuff you know the American people a measure of the man himself [noise]\nWell yeah I've spent so much time with a then candidate Trump but now President Trump and a truly cares about other people he's extremely\nMagnanimous and private he is funny he's gracious he's always asking about how my family is doing and what he can do to me that just who he is and if you listen to the media they tell you is the worst human being on the planet help but the truth is\nHe's exceptionally gracious I've seen so many times helping people that never get the story told because he doesn't want the story told but he's always there to help whenever he can\nWhy is that because the media ought to be calling balls and strikes you know they ought to be saying well this is what's going right this is what's going wrong media worst Research Center ... well ... one of my buddies\nEvery few months as the media coverage is Ninety two percent negative Ninety five percent negative the media is protected by the U.S constitution only business in America that gets constitutional protection the media should call balls and strikes a lot of good stuff a lot of bad stuff why does the media only report the bad enough that good [noise]\nThey only report the bad in this administration the Obama administration you would think that our economy is growing at four percent and we had more Americans working than any other time in our nation's history it conflated those to see the Trump agenda is not what the mainstream media wants to talk about I here's a great example just last week I think it was\nA President Trump did an interview with least offer sixty minutes she interrupted him sixty five times during that interview to put that in comparison when sixty minutes during an interview with mom or a couple of years ago they interrupted him\nMore times and they have their own agenda their agenda is to make the president look bad not to give him credit that he deserves for the successes that he can because they no longer in the business of reporting the news they're now in the business of making the news and that the big change over the last two decades\nCorey Lewandowski the president or the other night in Montana framed it as mobs\nVersus jobs the only difference is the Edmond J and I think that's brilliant on his part because one look at Brett Kavanaugh\nAlong about a trucks that have a Trump sticker on getting burned I look at congressman getting shot I look at a Republican congressman Republican operatives getting beat up and getting stuck in the side with and\nI look at how you're confronted and airports in restaurants mobs versus jobs and do you think the average American I think forty percent of what the president\nForty percent oppose them there's twenty percent going back and forth do you think that that that model\nThey are of the president mobs versus jobs is going to stick\nI think it will stick because look the American people see and hear what people like Eric Holder had to say very recently when they're down we kick them and we kick them in the head you know the the cost of violence by the leaders of the Democratic party whether it's\nA Maxine Waters or other saying if you see them in a gas station if you see them in a restaurant you go after them you don't give them a break\nYou know that's not the way our country is supposed to be and I didn't support proper Obama but never ever ever did I ever remember Republicans or conservatives for that matter going after members of the previous administration when they're eating dinner at a restaurant we've now seen it with\nSarah Huckabee Sanders we've seen with secretary Nielsen ... we've seen it with Senator Ted Cruz we've seen what happened to Congressman Steve ... where he almost lost his life\nBecause the mob violence a antifa is so out of control here and there you go on their desire is destruction it's not to make our country better this president has created\nI think over for a million new jobs in the last Twenty one months and that's where we should be doing look even if you don't want this president if you didn't want him to succeed you want him to succeed because you want our country and succeed and that's what the differences\nThat Democrats I hate to say this and they hate this president more than they love their country\nOr the other issue the culturally acceptable to me the fame and to make fun of and dismay or the president and the first lady\nYou may recall about a week ago TI who's a rapper than I Will watch nonetheless I saw him and TMZ and I did a video in which a look alike millennia Trump was stripping nude in the oval office performing sex act in the oval office\nAnd it was culturally acceptable to do that I'm sure he might sell a lot of\nLot of his songs and records and that can you imagine three years ago if a country artist had to pick the Michelle Obama stripping naked in the oval office and performing sex acts in the oval office what would the outcry from the media have been if it was Michelle Obama\n... it wouldn't be front page news for a week on end that wrap that the uh the country artist would have\nHad his life probably threatened on multiple occasions but look let's go back to just getting about a week ago Hillary Clinton gave an interview about her husband and his relationship with Monica Lewinsky and they asked her new you think that relationship was inappropriate and less than two weeks ago her answer was\nNo it was appropriate because she was an adult he was president of the United states leader of the free world Monica Lewinsky was an intern and Hillary Clinton is still justifying her husband's\nBehavior can you imagine for one second that was the the Congress if Donald Trump had done that with during the media would be saying\nShe did a great job great job by Corey Lewandowski will do it again give me your production in about two weeks house in the Senate give me your production [noise]\nAh I think in

Clinton raped her what what the bloody lab told her roommate what happened\nThe roommate solved the blood on her lap saw her pantyhose was torn she actually had four or five corroborating witnesses as the event took place and then they also had the so called uh Arkansas state troopers confirming the fact\nThat the one eight abroad ... was actually raped and then you have while he's in the White House says president sexually groping in molesting Kathleen Willie in the White House\nAnd that was well known and corroborated but the media completely ignored both of those events because it didn't fit did it but it did go to go to Brett Kavanaugh\n... absolutely and so that that's the double standard in in the bigger double than it has to do more with men ... me too movement and trying to to I\nLove how the left tries to migrate thing how they try to get us to take ownership so the ownership of me too because a bunch of left this lecture at Hollywood lefty okay it's the Harvey Weinstein of the world with all these young on your news and he's oh school actresses and all these ... political feminist\nTaking pictures with Harvey going to his party's extending its virtues that awards dinners and so on while enabling him to do exactly what he's been doing for women for a decade\nDating back decades and and all the trail of women who did exactly what Harvey ask them to do get in there but ...\n... out and then suddenly when their careers are waning they decide they want to turn states' evidence but now it's interesting to me to a ends up being built [noise]\nEnded up being part of a ... well being used against Kavanaugh being used against a high powered CEOs of companies this movement is born of the lectures activities of left us in Hollywood\nThat and and and the entertainment industry where they marginalized objectify women like crazy and suddenly a guy like Kavanaugh they want to make him the poster child I mean it just it bores me\nAnd when it came time for Obama to put his daughters\nOn summer in terms positions with somebody ah Brock Hussein Obama and Michelle Obama is elected Harvey Weinstein to to take their daughters end of the Hollywood scene when they knew or should have known exactly what was going on from all of their connections but they couldn't care less about Harvey Weinstein was a star\nOr rewind CNN access Harvey Weinstein was are making millions of dollars and giving millions of Democratic Party including the Obamas so they sent their own daughters end of the character posted in control of Harvey Weinstein and the media didn't cover that either did they\nKnow they didn't but here's what's interesting about that so they know Harvey their daughters are untouchable\nBut you know whose daughter's aren't bill the daughters of ordinary people there and a daughter that you know that you got to be concerned about cause harm me will take advantage of them but the the what the what ... rock Obama's selling us\nI have so much power I Know that this guy the lecture is left is who will take advantage of women and every time but I could put my daughters with him but don't you dare put yours\nThat's exactly how the left stacks up I can do it you can't because I'm covered but you're not\nAnd and look at it the less than it is a precautionary tale for many many boy I said many times what harmless thing as your kid your son going to do at the age of Fifteen that some woman's gonna come back\nTwenty five thirty years later and say oh look at what you did to me more if he's not even going to remember it he is not it's going to be insignificant to him and her but because something may be important in life she decide I'll take him down for what\nWell you know it was hanging by a thread two weeks ago and now he's on the court and I think the other issue I Want to get your perspective on this Kevin Jackson and the black sphere\nWhich is the what's happening now with the Honduran migrants coming through a Guatemala into Mexico there right now is three to five thousand strong and they're heading toward the Texas border this was a terrible event for the Democrats\nOver the next two weeks before the election they have the video and the pictures of thousands of migrants\nWhenever I watch MSNBC all I hear about is women and children then I see the video of these migrants coming to urban areas in America and they're almost always young males and the young women tend to be raped or sexually molested the men are drug meals and I'm sure there's good family members among them\nAnd Kevin Jackson of you and your wife and your children were in a\nOr in Honduras in a bill Cunningham and my wife and kids were in\nAnd we're in Honduras living the horrors of socialistic left wing military hunter regime\nThe first thing I Would want to do would be to get to America I understand it completely but along the process it gives billions of dollars MS Thirteen other gang bangers to provide a passage Everytime you go through some other drug infested area Mexico you got to pay\nHomage you gotta pay either sex or money to even pass through and and live by the time you get to the northern part of Mexico according to sixty minutes about two months ago there was hundreds of dead bodies because some men did not want to participate\nAnd becoming drug meals to give drugs into America\nSome women were killed because they did not want to be ritual is typically raped on a regular basis\nThis is a horrible journey I watch MSNBC this is about refugee status of desperate people I watch other news outlets and this is terrible Trump's going to send supposedly\nOur soldiers to the southern border to stop it and all of this is playing out during an election that the Democrats supposedly have in the bag because hundreds of millions of dollars up to a billion and it's been pumped into these campaigns\nAre by a Tom Styron by Bloomberg and others in order to uh to me are Republicans all over the
