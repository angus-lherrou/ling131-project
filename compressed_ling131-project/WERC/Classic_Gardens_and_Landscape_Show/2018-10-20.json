{"month": "10", "state": "AL", "station": "WERC", "content": "[noise] I'm In debris home about four thousand a month\nMhm take home pay take home mhm mhm and like I didn't know whether\nHe's got a dead no car payment what ...\nWhat are the kind of homework mhm about two hundred and twenty thousand\nEnemy we'd need about fifty thousand dollars a phone to her case the one that we are interested in\nSo you're moving from the two and twenty thousand or as soon as I mean there was no\nYeah it's not much of a move\nNo it's not but it does have a lot more upgrade than what our house has now because if we stay there would be we would have to invest money in the house to do the upgrade um or we could move in there that have already been accomplished mhm\nOr you could stay and not do the grades\nOr we can stay in the way not do the courage or we could stand not pick up upgrades in it and save money and move with cash right\nThere's no way I wouldn't go back and I mean you've gone out and the first thing you do is go get a house fever\n[laughter] right and that's after hearing that ... that that stream that you just had on I thought I but I Know that are already\nYou know I mean you knew what you want to do I I couldn't I wouldn't call you stupid I mean you're not out of control you're not being irresponsible it's a tiny little mortgages you said but I I just I just couldn't go back\nOnce this hard to get out I mean you you have a two hundred and twenty thousand are paid for home in Roanoke, Virginia that is not a ... house that's all right great house\nAs a matter of fact I'm\nWell above average square footage and the United states in a great neighborhood by definition in their own market that's what that houses so I I couldn't do it um if you want to do it you can do it um but I certainly can't tell you to do what I what Sharon and I would do\nWhat we worked our butts off to get out of debt and there's nothing will get us back in there is nothing I Want bad enough to go back into debt\nAnd there's a lot of stuff I'd like to do a lot of things I'd like to accomplish that only the money to do but I'm not quite dead for even for a minute even for just a second 'cause my life is so good\nWithout any pay much so you do what you want to do but um I Can't tell you to do that it would it would just make me throw up to think about it\nUm I Can't there's no way so what would I Do I'd say either you know piecemeal out of your income you don't have any payments you save up some money picks up the Algerian as you should do some upgrades or if you want to move save up you know shape hard for a couple of years\nYou probably save up to a degree in two years without any payments if you watch what you're doing um but it doesn't mean means you don't get the house that you found while you were out in pulsing riding around on a Sunday afternoon solve this particular property well that one's not gonna be there\nOh well there's a house on every corner you do what you want to do I'm not going to be mad at you either way I just couldn't do it there's no way are you on a is with us in Canada hey Ariana how are you\nI think if I can I call and thank you so much for your ministry thank you how can I help him a long distance plan like by default three months ago I put my town home on the market and my sister who has my penance by default [laughter]\nUm found her own place her currently sitting empty the entire complex that it and has gone down in value from my unit is very Fifteen thousand dollars less than what I had bought it for five years ago right now I'm there for the unit of the same style and land is mine and I know the lower\nPrice as like a thousand dollars good\nUh yesterday a Himalayan it came on the market five thousand less than one hundred Ninety five out when\nI started to feel a bit of age and feed us out because it sitting empty and winter is coming you know I was thinking of capital my price to one Ninety four and adding an incentive that out over paid six months worth of condo feet\n... doing out there with me and I would pay five to six thousand dollars out of pocket Mack the market is discharged and my question is how\nWould you how much would you pay out of pocket to get rid of that thing how long would you go\nHow you'd have obviously you'd have to have the money to pay out of pocket that'd be one limiting factor in Ireland on it I don't know what I'm gonna do judge the situation and how quickly are these things dropping\nOverall and you know that's going to give me my urgency um I don't I don't want to just get emotional about it I Want to judge the future and say these things are going down in value there is already five of them on the market\nI've got to be the lowest one on the market um this is not looking good you know so I'm without dropping another fifty thousand no I wouldn't know [laughter]\nYou know so you know so in some point you do you laugh right in and that's that's\nSo uh but ... but five thousand out of pocket to be done with this two hundred thousand dollar or a hundred and eighty dollar mortgage yeah yeah I'll be done with that in a heartbeat I'd do that too 'cause 'cause you know waiting two years is not going to help the situation is what I think I'm hearing\n[noise] right yeah exactly and worst case counting and when the pay is not a place to move in the wintertime\nWell but I mean not only I mean this winter but in general this complex is not going to heal and become worse three hundred thousand two years from now exactly\nIs going the wrong way and so it's just something to get out of town you know and uh yeah I'm with you I I think you're right uh I don't think you're panicking with the numbers you're giving me now have you started telling me somebody wants to offer you a low ball offering you have to come out of pocket what thirty grand I'm\nGonna wait the winter out you know my ... spring and see what happens but there's some point that I'm not willing to be that far below the other properties that are on the market but uh but overall yeah let's get rid of this thing\nGood question I'm sure you're facing this open phones a triple eight eight to five five two to five things for joining us Andrea is on Instagram I'm now got over a million people on Instagram\nWow and I'm just now figuring out how to do it myself\nUm the guys at work here to do it and uh when I actually put a picture up there are people freak out so it doesn't it cause I'm not very good at it but um I got pretty good at Twitter but nobody's on Twitter Twitter bad except except a bunch of trolls I mean it's just a bunch of angry\nPeople that um don't have a real identity you know or whatever so Instagram nice people ... by and large not all but on the block and one woman that was being a\nTest pilot from a broom factory though the night but um anyway Instagram Andrea by the end of the month will have four months of expenses saved\nOr do we save up for a down payment on a home or do we start investing were both at the same time we'd love to buy by the end of next year\nI think it's fun to wait for one year the starch your baby steps for we call that baby step three baby if you postpone your retirement savings for a short period of time to save up a big juicy fat down payment and if you ...\nDo that in a year and I think you can sounds like you've got this thing on the run you're out of debt you got your emergency fund bing bing you've done this the right way you move into the house the house was going to be a blessing not a curse it's going to be a\nDream not a nightmare show yeah save up till the end of year and then a buy a house next spring sometime in ... in charge or a or restart either one of your retirement savings at that point\nAnd
