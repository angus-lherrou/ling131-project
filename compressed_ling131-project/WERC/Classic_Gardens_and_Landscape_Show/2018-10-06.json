{"month": "10", "state": "AL", "station": "WERC", "content": "Right okay so if you came a\nYou know you'd be at about a five year plan if you were a little under two hundred thousand right thirty six thousand divided into two hundred thousand right right it would be um six years roughly if you do the full two hundred a little over two hundred but\nSomewhere between one fifty and two hundred you could do it and about five years not counting getting raises and not counting saving even more that's the most I wouldn't want to go\nOh I don't want to wait much more than five years or to buy and I don't want to wait much more than five years\nOut of your retirement system so I mean whatever you're going to do I would try to do it in under that uh but then so the point is you're sitting with a paid for property no payment in the world at that point right and you're making really good money and you're thirty something thirty one thirty two years old\nRight and so can you can you become a multi millionaire doing that absolutely you can\nOkay is that what you just pay yourself a house payment from age thirty to age sixty you'd be a multi millionaire\nRight okay okay great so uh well\nGo ahead and get what you had lately but we did what you might be a good idea to do maybe I tend to retirement and say maybe a little bit less\nIt's up to you if you're going to go longer than five years I'm starting to get pretty nervous about it okay okay if you're going to be under five years and you want to do zero in your case you're still going to be very young and without a house payment when you pay cash for this house\nRight thirty one years old is very young with zero house payment and you got the income for the rest of your life to build wealth with I mean if you will just keep paying attention again by yourself or house payment plus or minus a little you can be a multi millionaire\nOkay great they do something like that and I appreciate your life\nVery well done good job you're thinking Deborah is with us from Tampa, Florida Hi Deborah how are you\nI'm doing well thank you for taking my call I'm\nSure what's up\nWell I'm I Am working on that you are a financial peace university and I have paid out forty thousand dollars in twelve mine good for you and yes and I'm Down to just one dead\nWhich is a hospital bill that we've been paying for many years now mhm I with very small payments mhm and uh it's been offended collection and we've been looking at a credit report just making sure that all these deaths have fallen off\nAnd um it it turns out that hospital bill Hicks falling off of our credit report\nAnd because of that my husband than a trying with the idea of just not adding that to the debt now and just continuing that men on payments or even not paying it at all and that scares me to death but I wanted to know from you what are the implications of doing something like that\nWhere there's two problems whether one is you actually owed them money so you should pay it\nYeah that's one probably the second problem is is that it's going to come back to haunt you just because they're not reporting it today doesn't mean they're not going to take an active outstanding account and reported that any time\nAnd so right what happened what's happened is is the collection a agency that you're dealing with the collections company that you're dealing with it was just not downloaded their files to credit bureau but they could do that at any time and then you've got a bad mark not just a mark what a bad mark because this is a defaulted this is a bad bill\nIt's not a current bill 'cause they didn't offer you payments at the start they only offered you payments because you couldn't pay them\nRight and you owe them the money and so uh how much is the bill\nI it's less than seven thousand at that point\nOkay what I Would do is continue to pay them I Would continue to pay them the minimum wage and I would build up a you know a lump sum up three or four thousand and offer them that a settlement and let's get it settled in full and get it in writing\nOkay but in writing settled in the fall and I I Would do that because it's already a bad mark on your credit and there's no telling how much they've added to it in collections fees and late fees anyway\nAnd so I you know I I Want to I Want to discount it a little for those reasons in those situations but just to ignore it because it's currently not showing up on your credit bureau is on was because it will end up showing up again\nAnd on top of that you owe the bill so clear the bill move on with your life it's worth it it's worth the trouble to address a good question thanks for calling in Tanya is in Lexington Hi Tania welcome to the Dave Ramsey show\nHello thank you for taking my phone call sure what I have I have a question I Am Seventy years old and I'm getting ready to think about taking the payment options for tax shelter anybody [noise] uh and I wanted to know what would be something like the best option and I\nWhen I took a annuity out my thinking was to take a lifetime monthly benefit and so then when I went to I ask about it they gave me a several other options I'm going to the other options for to take effect\nAnnuity monthly income which should be lower but it would include a long term care policy no neither one was to take another fixed and the lady with a nursing care on policy no\nOr another option but to take a tenure certain with which would be lower premiums are non you're alive and then it went right to be a higher premium\nNo okay let's go with a F none of the above um uh so uh [laughter] the anytime you started weaving in these other policies with it that's going to entail extra fees and garages notice I didn't even ask what I'm not I didn't even ask what the numbers are\nWhen that's on the insurance world what we call that his bundling\nAnd there's only one time it was only one time bundling works to the consumers advantage and that's when you put your car insurance for homeowners were church together\nThat often works to your benefit but the rest of the stuff is gimmicky gotcha garbage and show that I smelled harassed and you have a good you have a good nose on your ghetto [noise]\nSo what I Would tell you there's I Would tell you the check with an investment advisor like one of the smart buster pros and talk about just rolling this into some a very low risk low volatility mutual funds and then just pulling an income off of that\nI think you'll end up with more money alive and dead doing that then you will\nMessing with us or nudity because the other thing that you can be sure of with an insurance company or an investment firm anytime they give you a guarantee that means they're giving you less than you could have made if you didn't have a guarantee\nOkay oh and so I you know it's like with your home you didn't get a guarantee when you bought your home\nNo guarantee it's going to go up in value we're down in value either one no no insurance I don't know backing your home no nope FDIC insurance on the value of your home and yet you felt really comfortable taking that quote unquote risk\nWhy because well we can look at their track record of homes and be very comfortable with them and if I could find a mutual fund that I was comfortable with its track record it's volatility as I was with your home at Seventy years old\nSomething like a growth in income ponder balance fund that kind of a thing that's probably where I'm putting my money from you at Seventy um and it wouldn't be anywhere near an insurance company so I'll be rolling this whole thing over into something you know\nCheck smart faster at day Ramsey dot com put in your info it'll drop down a list of the smart Mr

he had won a he got one that he just bill well they did the landscaping on the left hand side of the building and the sad you know what the heck with this we're not doing this crap anymore so I went down there gave him a price to redo are made it drew up a design and gave him a price to do\nAre basically three phases it'd be a phase one is like redo the front shrubs\nAnd uh and preparing the shrubs on their others warehouse are there other building\nAnd then face too is like the right hand side\nOf the building is two hundred fifty feet long ... and they he wants like a a hate barrier\nTo write put like Nelly ... even the crate Myrtle is instead of the buildings twenty feet tall so we need like a bunch of stuff that's going to get tall just to kinda keep ... you know keep the heat off of that thing is that NATO is dark billed as it's going be it's hot you know\nAnd then we've got to plant some tea all down a left hand side is a privacy barrier or where you just can't let them grow like crazy and you know it's really a two foot spot between uh\nYou got a warehouse here in a warehouse here to be you know\nManufactured yeah things going on at one time and they're just I mean they're tied it takes man I mean they're right close together so we got to put in a little barrier for them and then I went out\nI did one out in\nGardendale really just about Morris um over in their uh this fellow was in the garden center\nAnd he brought in I guess he brought in his pictures or whatever are he brought in a design that somebody had done for them and they were about the short on his landscaping job in and said you know what I feel like you've got way too many plants in here and he said well why don't you all can give me an estimate and a price\nI went out and did an all new designed for them they did they had way how membrane of saying I rang or is it ...\nLike a seven foot deep flower bed and they had three rows of plants in there and it was just jam\nUp and say we're
