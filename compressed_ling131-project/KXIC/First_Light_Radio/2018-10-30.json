when his uh his latest recordings [noise] if you don't like them vote him out and we're all happy to be together in a company with each other this morning call us at eight hundred seven three six three six six six and tell us what you think about voting\nYear it's very interesting what is happening this year\nAbout um forty four percent of U.S companies say that they're going to carve out time for their workers to vote this year because you know one of the problems with only voting on one day basically during daylight hours is\nA lot of people can't make it to the polls they work they have jobs they have kids that they have to take care of they have all kinds of things to do and the only get one shot every other year or every four years to vote seems kind of like a precarious way to run a democracy\nYou know one day and it says such an odd lead time day the first Tuesday after the first Monday in the month of November why isn't it on a Sunday or a Saturday when more people are off work and can get to vote why isn't it both Saturday and Sunday you know why is it not a national holiday you know\nUh most of the modern democracies in the world I think just about every one except the United states holds their elections on weekends or makes election day a national holiday\nAnd uh you know once again we're behind are doing things for the two hundred and fifty year old way rather than the modern way\nSo uh maybe if you worked for companies like uber or Lyft or Tyson Foods or Patagonia you'll get the time off because your company's your stores are closing down that day on election day started it all the employees can get to vote\nAnd uh I'm Glad that the companies are doing that but I Wish we as a society we're making a little easier to vote right now some thirty seven states\nIncluding those that mail ballots to voters\nAnd the district of Columbia let citizens vote a head of election day now this has been a a growing trend back in Nineteen eighty about four million ballots were cast ahead of the actual election day last time out for the presidential year and twenty six\nBeing more than forty seven million people voted early now that the case for early voting for people who liked the idea is simple you provide citizens with more options to vote whether by mail or in person ahead of the election makes it easier for them to do so they can avoid long lines on election day [noise]\nUm [noise] but uh some say that well maybe if you do it early people don't have all the full information that they would get by paying attention to a campaign now I'm not sure what they mean by full uh information unless you're talking about what political commercials which have all the\nAll the informational nutrition of a grain of sand in them for the most part they usually just negative ads anyway with false information from both sides so you know where do you get your information from I Would think that by a week or two before election you should have a pretty good idea of what candidate you like or don't like and if you want to vote\nAnd um you know and now of course there's been a backlash and twenty sixteen in some legislatures because\nWhat they discovered after the election was that Iraq Obama's lead in many of the close states was made in early voting and he actually lost a vote that happened on election day and then of course makes the point that for a lot of working people having an only on one day during basically daylight hours is very difficult for some of those people who can't get to the polls\nAnd so some of the Republican legislatures have been trying to curtail early voting\nA especially on days for instance on Sundays when the black churches would would uh you know take their voters to the ... to the to the polls but\nBut you know where it seems to me that the more chance we have to vote the yeas are that we make it to vote and especially now you know there's so many ways of uh of doing it electronically and with all kinds of ways", "show_name": "First Light Radio", "year": "2018", "city": "Iowa City", "day": "30"}
