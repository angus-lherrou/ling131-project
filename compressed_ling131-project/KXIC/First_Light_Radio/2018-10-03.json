give us a call the eight hundred seven three six three six six six\nWe'd like to know what you think about Amazon raising the minimum wage to Fifteen dollars an hour for all of its employees you know this is part of a trend and the reason seems to be as unemployment goes down it gets harder and harder to find workers and sometimes these big companies say well you know are going to have to start paying these people more if we're going to attract some decent workers\nA lot of workers around the country have been pushing for a Fifteen dollar minimum wage uh there's a movement called fight for Fifteen that's been holding demonstrations all around the country the last couple of years\nAnd they say that this is a way to fix wage inequality they say it will boost consumer spending because these workers will now have more money to spend at places like\nAmazon or other folks say that the producers opportunities from climate especially for people like teenagers and others who are looking for entry level or low skilled jobs and they say that\nA mandating a minimum wage is difficult on some smaller companies because they can't afford it and what usually happens is the ah some of the folks end up being edged out of a job because the companies can't afford it\nBut we've been seeing a lot of companies responding to all this pressure a target raised its minimum wage for new hires to twelve bucks an hour last month\nAnd they say they're going to go to Fifteen bucks by the end of twenty twenty Disney has reached a deal with its unions to pay a minimum of Fifteen dollars an hour at places like a Disneyland and Disney World Walmart which is the country's largest private sector employer\nThey've got more than a million workers here they raised their minimum wage to eleven dollars back I think it was in February and now Amazon\nIs following suit so let's get some details on exactly what we're talking about from the past involving\nMichael the minimum wage increase will go into effect and Amazon on November first it applies to fulltime part-time and temporary workers at the company it impacts around two hundred and fifty thousand employees and one hundred thousand seasonal staff\nIt not just workers at Amazon who are getting a raise the Fifteen dollars an hour minimum laws will apply to whole foods employees\nCritics including Senator Bernie Sanders have targeted Amazon in recent months after workers complained of stressful working conditions in low pay\nAmazon senior vice president Jay Carney said they've heard the criticism and that's why they've decided to act\nAs part of our culture to to examine ourselves see if we're doing the right thing a and a Senator Sanders was was one of the people we listen to a among many and when we saw the opportunity to raise wages at Amazon we decided we wanted to lead\nAmazon is among the largest employers in the u._s. it's added more American Jobs in the past decade than any other company a move like this often causes other companies to follow suit in order to compete for employees Carney said that's what they hope will happen\nAnd this is really about America's workforce and uh you know we've seen a\nWages depressed for a long time and uh they're beginning to end up\nAmazon is also going to begin lobbying for an increase in the federal minimum wage\nYou know seven dollars and twenty five cents an hour or Amazon Fifteen dollar floor is now more than twice the federal minimum wage and hopefully Congress will take action to raise that\nSenator Sanders introduced a bill last month called the stop based those act ... found that Amazon the legislation would tax large employers when their workers need to rely on public benefits like food stamps Michael\nThank you Steve cast and bomb and Bernie is happy about this by the way he put out a statement saying it was a wonderful thing and Jeff Bezos responded by thanking the senator he says we're excited about this and also hope others will join in\nIn fact they are as a as Steve mentioned they're going to start putting some pressure on Congress to lift the national minimum twenty nine states now have their own minimum wages which are higher than the federal standard of seven dollars and twenty five cents the Amazon median pay last year was a twenty eight thousand four hundred forty six dollars and that comes out to", "show_name": "First Light
