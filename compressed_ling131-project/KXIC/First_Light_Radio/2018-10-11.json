slide Michael\nHere with us so glad that you are joining us this morning give us a call at eight hundred seven three six six six six because we're talking about Columbus Christopher Columbus Columbus Day and how we celebrate that day and should we celebrate that day a lot of places are not celebrating it anymore you just heard that tune\nA there's a new version of the lyrics goes like this in fourteen hundred night to Columbus sale the ocean blue he had three ships and left from Spain he brought with him genocide racism capitalism and enduring pain\nIs he paying for the sins of subsequent Europeans or was he a bad guy should we recognize the European visit to the new world in that way it was a not good necessarily for the people who are already here [noise]\nSo what do we do um Columbus Day as I mentioned a few minutes ago it's been a federal holiday since Nineteen thirty seven and for quite a few decades it was celebrated pretty much every place that was when I was a kid in school but now Thirteen states at all don't celebrate it they don't really observe it\nMore and more counties and cities are going that way a and many are renaming the date indigenous people day to put the focus more on the Native Americans who were here when Columbus came along today so Columbus has gone from being a hero to something much less than that\nUm [noise] so what's the deal here are we erasing history or is there something about Columbus did make some unusually bad or should we at least recognize part of what he did\nOr not what what was Columbus up to us let's go back he was looking for a route to the far east from Europe they were looking for trade routes and he kind of\nIt he he did have the courage to know that okay I don't believe the earth is flat I'm not going to fall off the end of the earth I think I'm going to be able to I think if the ball I'll be able to do around find a new way to the far east and we can sell things and buy things better\nSo that didn't actually happen he didn't succeed in his mission to discover the far east and he never actually even set foot on what would become us soil\nAnd he wasn't even the first European and the new world we now know of course the Vikings beat him here by about five hundred years so what was the difference\nWell Columbus was was well known and he was also sponsored by the government of Spain as you may recall and there was a discovery that got everybody's attention and sparked this exploration that really changed the world as we know it\nUh now I'm the downside Columbus ah enslaved people he tortured some people including as the Spanish columnist you didn't follow his rules we know that entire populations there were wiped out by the diseases about that the Europeans brought but of course that was not something they intended we didn't know about the microbes in germs back band\nSo uh you know we are sometimes you have to apply different\nDifferent uh standards when you look at people from the past you don't live the way we do now Columbus was a very much a man of his time do we take that into it\nTown it's a very very difficult thing now especially because schools have to figure out\nHow do we give a balanced approach to teaching about Christopher Columbus and that of course gets into the larger picture of how do we deal with the way white Europeans treated this continent when they got here and turned it into their own backyard never mind that there were people already here with their own culture\nAnd we just pushed them west pushed them west pushed them west\nKilled a lot of them subjugated others tried to wipe out their culture and of course on the other hand recreated the United states of America so how do you balance all that how do you teach it what do you think your group tells us now about how Los Angeles traded in Columbus Day this week in favor of indigenous people's day Jim", "show_name": "First Light Radio", "year": "2018", "city": "Iowa City",
