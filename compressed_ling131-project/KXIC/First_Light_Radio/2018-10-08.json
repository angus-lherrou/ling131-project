you think they're doing they're getting everything past that you want\nOr are they are not coming forward with things that you are are happier about so there's a lot to talk about there we also have a

that all set up in the office there had his first launch as a justice where the other associate justice is and the chief justice John Roberts so that's checked off on the\nOn the list of or to do items for the Republicans on Capitol Hill but there's a lot of work left undone and they've only got really a few days or a work schedule between now and the election which is coming up and about four weeks and then there will be a lame duck session a session after that\nLet's find out from Linda in Kenya on Capitol Hill correspondents or how the dust is settling on Capitol Hill this morning good morning Linda\nGood morning I Know there's no dust on you because you haven't stopped moving for a few days I covered [laughter]\nEverything that's going on over there so uh so they got through they they got what they wanted and uh it seemed unusually bitter at the end or were they were a lot of Democrats surprised by Susan Collins a voting the way she did or even the speech that she made which seemed unusually partisan for her\nWell she did telegraph several times throughout the process how she was going to vote people I think uh who were hoping she wouldn't vote that way where we're watching her speech on the floor and and and parsing every word until she finally said\nShe would vote chicken for Greg cabinet but she she went through a litany of of her a justification for why she thought this and then why she thought that and they seem to go back and forth back and forth until she delivered the punch line and so it was a\nIt was probably extremely disappointing to the to the Democrats but then again not exactly surprising either although\nShe did break the mold this time she does have a reputation for being a bit of a maverick within her party um she does have a tendency to vote against a lot of things that the party does vote for but you have to keep in mind she's a main Republican she's not ... if you will and Arizona Republican\nOr she is a a a a demeanor is I have a tendency to be a little bit more independently minded and so she she speaks their constituents whether they like what she did on this case a remains\nTo be seen I mean people are already talking about putting Susan Rice on the ballot to challenge her two years ago\nIs that a real thing as Susan Rice just playing around by saying you know I'm indicating sort of teasing on uh on on Twitter over the weekend is there anything real happening there\nWell she did kind of surprised people and she said that she would she would someone said let's put put someone else up against ... and a ... attack against us as ... which is nice when\nAbout me and everybody sort of took it seriously um for about a New York minute until she treated again it said you know basically you know I'm just I'm just\nKidding but she may not be she may not be so does her parents are family has a home in Maine so she does qualify\n... that's interesting well you know there's there are a record number of women running for Congress this year so I guess it would be no surprise of Maine has a another woman running against a woman senator Collins who's been there for quite a few years now", "year": "2018",
