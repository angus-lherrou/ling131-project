is always a good time to curl up with a book especially if the weather is a little a shaky where you might be this weekend well you know\nA reading is just one of those things I started reading at a very very young age and I loved reading probably spend too much time alone in my bedroom reading when I was a little kid instead of outside playing baseball and running around but you know what\nIt has a I think helped make me the person that I Am I Love to read one of the problems for me was when I went to college by the time I got into college I had to read so much for school work and then after college\nOr working in journalism and having to keep up on things I had to read so many newspapers in periodicals and and books about current events I didn't have time to read for pleasure and for a long time I did not read for pleasure I only read for work and I lost my my love of it it was a it became part of a job\nAnd I almost never got to read fiction for a long time until\nI discovered back then it was called books on tape and you get these little cassettes in a box and they would come in the mail and you'd have to uh I think I don't remember how we ordered them because this was even before the Internet\nI was really around and it would it would come in the mail and it'd be a box and you can listen to them in the car which was amazing and I would I discovered a that I'm not going to listen to music any more than a car I'm going to listen to books and I've been hooked on listening to books\nEver since I hardly ever read anything um in terms of uh novels\nI Would never get to read a novel and enjoy being in the world that an author creates for me and losing myself in that without being able to listen to it so now I'm uh driving to work or making dinner or cleaning up the house or doing yard work I've got a book going\nAnd I get lost in the world of the novel that way and I find I have better retention if a book is read to me than if I read it myself which is interesting I guess I'm a more\nAh auditory person and been in a miserable person\nUm I Do still read books occasion I've always got at least one hardcover book in the family room that I Will pick up but most of my reading comes from listening right now I can tell you what I have in my phone which is how I listen I'm listening to a Doris Kearns Goodwin is a brand new book a\nLeadership and she talks about the events in the life of four presidents that she has devoted her life to covering a theater Roosevelt Franklin Roosevelt Lyndon Johnson\nAnd Abraham Lincoln and it is fascinating I mean just in in one day yesterday just driving home from work I was thrilled I was having such a thrilling experience riding up San Juan hill with Teddy Roosevelt and the rough riders in the Spanish American war and then by the time I got home and I was making some lunch in the kitchen I ... I was tearing up\nAnd and having goose bumps and listening to her account of Franklin Roosevelt coming back from polio and having to make a national appearance at a democratic convention to place the name of somebody in nomination to run for president the Al Smith\nWho has had been the governor of New York and he had to practice for for months to be able to walk from the back of the stage up to the podium and it ... it was an incredible overcoming of this disability that had taken over his life\nThe disability that changed him and made him the man who became one of our greatest presidents and you know I it was both those things thrilling and and being moved a mentally all by the same book and the space of an hour only books can do that for us but are we still reading books well the Pew Research center says that", "year": "2018", "show_name": "First Light Radio", "city": "Iowa City", "day": "12"}
