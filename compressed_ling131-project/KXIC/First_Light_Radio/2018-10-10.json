seven three six three six six six because we'd like to know what you think about this the Mormon church the church of Jesus Christ of latter day saints or LDS for some folks\nIs joining with lawmakers and the governor of the state of Utah to support a deal to legalize medical marijuana even if a legislative initiatives on the ballot this November ends up failing this is an odd situation here because they\nThey're putting it before the voters and regardless of what the voters do the governor and some legislators and the church which carries a lot of sway in Utah are coming up with their own deal to allow the use of medical marijuana and this is the first time as far as any of us here can remember that the Mormon church has made\nA statement supporting medical marijuana is prescribed by a doctor and dispense by a pharmacy correspond a gym rupe tells us how this came about\nMichael the Mormon church is backing a compromise bill that could wind up with legal medical marijuana in the state of Utah or just one voice in the car church representative elder Jack Gerard says however it wants to be a constructive voice I Believe we have the church of Jesus Christ\nOf latter day saints has not changed its mind about marijuana\nIs still opposes it's used as a does caffeine tobacco alcohol and illegal drugs as part of its health code known as the words of wisdom and it's gotten some heavy criticism for being part of a closed door meetings with lawmakers on crafting a bill that would get ahead of a ballot initiative in November the LDS leaders believe would be much worse\nPolls indicate the ballot initiative proposition to would pass even members of the church plan to vote yes it also signaled that it could be the first time in history the church would lose a political campaign as it opposes prop to\nThe compromise bill sets a strict limits such as who will be allowed to grow it specially trained doctors will be allowed to prescribe it in pharmacies with dispensing the proposition however would allow patients to grow it doctors to suggest it and dispensaries dispensing it\nThe church believes there needs to be better safeguard so as not to make it easy for just anyone to get a medical marijuana card and it is feared that a voter approved initiative on medical marijuana could eventually lead to recreational use democratic representative Angela Romero calls the bill nothing less than voter suppression\nIn nature that a boat\nAnd they are tired that political\nTactics Gerard does say with this new bill the church quote is thrilled to be part of the effort to alleviate human pain and suffering and poked Michael [noise]\nAll right thanks Jim rope reporting for first light Twenty one minutes before they are now on for a slight call us at eight hundred seven three six three six six six tell us what you think about this\nThe way this would work as the governor in Utah will call lawmakers into a special session after the midterm election and I'll pass this compromise deal worked out with the church\nThat regardless of how the initiative fares now if the medical marijuana bill passes the voters in November it'll be revised under terms of this deal and if that a ballot initiative fails the legislature would simply consider a law as a as a brand new thing that\nThis uh ... the fact that this is being worked out on such a conservative state just shows that the nation is changing its attitude on marijuana and medical use is now legal in I think thirty one states and its on November ballot in four states Missouri and Michigan North Dakota and Utah\nAnd uh you know it's things have really been changing hair so what do you think about this what do you think about the role of the church playing such an important role making a deal with legislators\nTo get this passed because they probably couldn't get this passed through the legislature without the support of the Mormon church is that right don't we have a separation of church and state here or do you think that the church is playing a positive role in getting this done so that you could have medical use of marijuana in\nA in Utah has gyms reports said uh they they oppose the
