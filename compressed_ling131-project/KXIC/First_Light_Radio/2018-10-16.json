be in your company as we discuss what's happened to Sears call us at eight hundred seven three six six six six we'd like to know what you think about all the all of us you know because especially for some of the younger folks out there you know before there was Amazon there was fear is\nIn fact there was Sears and Roebuck and at some point Roebuck just disappeared I wondered than the people look into that what happened to Roebuck used to be Sears and Roebuck and then it just became Sears [noise]\nIt was America's everything under one roof store the biggest retailer in the world but how the mighty have fallen\nPlayed by a falling sales and heavy debt Sears as you know filed for chapter eleven bankruptcy yesterday they're closing about one in five of its remaining stores to try and stay afloat\nAnalysts doubt that rather will survive they are doing financing right now to get some stock in for the holidays and then I guess they will reassess after the holidays to see what they can do with it but\nA bankruptcy judge had to approve at yesterday everyday or financed about three hundred million dollars to keep the chain open\nBoy it's a you know for a store that once dominated all the shopping malls in America you know now they're they're hanging in there trying to remain in business and it used to anchor downtowns before there was a a a shopping mall experience and then it began anchoring a moving stuff away from downtown\nWhich helps a lot of those horse empty out so you see every time something comes along it causes changes and now of course Sears itself as being affected by the move to Amazon and all kinds of online trading so\nYou know for a lot of us uh you know especially before the Internet Sears the Sears catalog was the Internet there was this thick heavy book it would come in the mail it had tools and dishes and TVs and clothing and appliances and about everything else you need around the house and in fact it would even have the house they sold houses for a while for\nA long time they they were selling kits where you would order through the catalog you would order a house in trucks would come and dump all the stuff on your piece of property all kind of pre fabricated with directions and people would put their homes together and you know what\nA lot of those homes still stand and they are collector's items there was one you know actually our our property backs up to one and there's a\nA little um country lane behind there but the property right behind ours is one of those fabulous ears houses it is a great house in fact\nThe people who had lived in their family had lived and therefore I think since there was bought back in the Nineteen twenties\nOr the last remaining folks finally passed down the house was on the market and I really thought about moving over there because it's such a great house wow you know you could buy everything for the house and the house itself\nYou know and right now a lot of television stations or doing stories from people talking about the things they remember about serious newspapers all around the country are filled with all this ...\nWe bought all of our appliances there we bought our clothing there it'd be about getting\nBack to school clothes there I got my first credit card there it's filled with nostalgia okay everybody sad to see it going but nobody shops there anymore so that's the problem so let's see where we are right now uh let's hear from Steve cast and bomb on what happened yesterday Michael\nWhen the IRS was at the top of the game it was the Amazon of its time fears pioneered the whole mail order retail business there was a time when it's the catalog can be found that almost every home you're holding company which also owns Kmart was supposed to make one hundred
