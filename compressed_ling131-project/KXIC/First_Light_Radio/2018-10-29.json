know call us at eight hundred seven three six three six six six as we talk about hate\nIn America and you know I it we keep hearing it every time there's one of these things and I've been hearing it for the last three days we never thought it could happen here\nEvery time one of these things happened we hear that over and over and over again because we all go through our lives and we all think oh that these things are terrible but of course it could never happen here well it can happen here and it does happen here it happens there and it happens here\nAnd it seems to be accelerating the pace

of traffic and there I mean there are thousands and thousands of people there it's a very big deal and\nAnd I I'm always struck by what a diverse group they are because of course of the military ever since President Harry Truman\nUh got rid of segregation in the military has become one of the best places in America for ironing out problems between the races a mixing people together and they get to know each other they work with each other they have each other's back they save each other's lives\nAnd it's been one incredible positive influence in American Life I I really believe that going back now or some Seventy years [noise]\nAnd uh and just watching the um [noise]\nThe the people who've come back from the battlefield missing limbs arms and legs competing in a marathon and of course there are people with out legs of some of these ah you know heroes from ah the the wars of the last twenty Thirty years uh uh you know was using their their arms to power themselves or with wheels to the finish line [noise]\nUm I was in the VIP area there and not because I'm a VIP but because somebody who is an invited me there because my wife was actually running and part of the marathon they have a ten K. part and my wife who was a runner was running and that so I was invited to like it'd be right there at the finish line to get a good look at her she came across the finish line\nBut I was standing next to a General Joseph Dunford the German of the joint chiefs of staff and a couple of times I stole a look at his face he was so proud\nOf the men and women around him on this diverse diverse the of people in uniform and out of uniform and wearing runners are all working together no thought of race or class or religion or any other distinction sexual orientation none of that they were all together it was just wonderful to be around that for a day\nAnd then of course you go home and you turn the TV on and you're seeing all this sickness and hatred in America\nThere's a social media app called gab uh they finally taken it off line because apparently the gunman who shot to death eleven people in Pittsburgh over the weekend was using it\nAh ah to spout his anti Semitic hatred
