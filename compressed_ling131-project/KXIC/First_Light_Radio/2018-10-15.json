seven three six six six six we'd like to know what you think about mandating to pledge I'm Michael Toscano happy to be here with you on a Monday morning we have a boy five days ahead of us to get through lots of news and this is a this the pledge of allegiance just there's always in the news these days [noise]\nAnd uh I don't know if that's a good thing or not it's become more of a political issue than a symbol that everybody can rally around a pledging too with the same time and that's kind of unfortunate though pledge itself is simple it says I pledge allegiance to the flag of the United states of America\nAnd to the republic for which it stands one nation under God indivisible with liberty and justice for all I always thought as a kid it was odd to pledge allegiance to a flag and not the ideas behind it so it does say end of the republic for which stands so that's the good part of that\nAnd uh I didn't personally have a problem reciting it I don't personally have a problem with it now but there are those who viewed differently and they view it as first of all they don't like being coerced into having to salute and\nI'm pledge of allegiance because that's actually\nNot constitutionally protected in many cases requiring pledges the Supreme Court has ruled on this several times a day rule that for instance in Nineteen forty three the Supreme Court said Jehovah's Witnesses cannot be a compelled to stand in salute the flag during the pledge of allegiance\nAnd I'm In a more recent times I remember a Nineteen sixty nine and there was a case involving the Des Moines school district there where the school was suspending high school and middle school students who were protesting the Vietnam War by wearing black arm bands are in their schools\nAre of course this was at the height of the Vietnam War and they weren't necessarily are protesting against the pledge of allegiance but the school said you can't wear those while you're doing the pledge of allegiance while that when all the way to the Supreme Court [noise]\nAnd uh the court decided that you couldn't suspend the kids for not participating properly and the pledge of allegiance because of that violates their First Amendment right to freedom of speech of which the flag is assemble so you see it's\nIt goes back and forth and it's one of those things there is no easy answers so now because the flag itself is becoming a political issue we have people trying to find different ways to\nTo a firm belief in America and American values other than doing the pledge which for some people now is becoming a lightning rod\nIt has become a very big distraction for the national football league\nOr when some athletes thought that they would respectfully show that they thought that our country needs some improvement they weren't necessarily are concerned about the pledge or the flag but just saying that you know if we're going to pledge allegiance to the flag we also need to pledge allegiance to living up to our ideals a lot of people did not like vet including the president who\nVery quickly turned it into a political brush fire and so that has hurt everybody\nIncluding people who like to watch football games without politics so it's you know it was that inappropriate form\nBats in the eye of the beholder I Believe that to you to decide but those are the issues that we are talking about this morning\nAnd it was sort of brought to our attention because there's a case in Texas where a student has refused to recite the pledge of allegiance to state has cracked down on it saying it's the law and so now there's a lawsuit challenging the rights of Texas law to mandate that you have to say the pledge of allegiance in a public school", "show_name": "First Light Radio",
