very happy that you have joined us this morning give us a call at eight hundred seven three six three six six six because we'd like to know what you think about what is happening up in Canada\nOr Canada yesterday became the first major world economy to legalize recreational marijuana they're beginning what they're calling a national experiment and I love the word experiment everybody in Canada's going to be walking around wearing white lab coats with little flash lights on their heads\nAnd test tubes in their pockets ah this experiment that will alter the country's social cultural and economic fabric as the New York times wrote\nAn presents other nation with some challenges and some opportunities all across the country yesterday that as these government sponsored pot retailers were opening from one coast to the other\nCanadians we're waiting an hours in line to buy the first state approved joints and for many they said it was just like the ending of prohibition in the United states in the Nineteen thirties although because this happened rather quickly in some parts of the country\nA lot of the stores a lot of the shopping had to be done on line because there were no stores opened yet and consumers flock to these Web sites which are run by the provincial governments and they were license bear to uh to buy legally despite the fact that it's going to take a few days for delivery uh to start making its way all around the country so\nThere's all kinds of interesting ramifications from this you know and some things that you might not have thought of other countries now have to decide what they're going to do\nEspecially in some of the areas where it may be illegal but you know for for a long long time poor farmers in places like Jamaica or Morocco or even a in a central and South America farmers have been a breaking the law\nAnd dealing with gangsters to grow cannabis but it's a cash crop is one of the few things that keep some of those communities alive\nBut now the Canada becomes the the first big industrial country to legalize marijuana those countries where the crop as a traditionally been grown may start losing out because there'll be new legal markets available and so they are gonna have to do something to deal with the those drug cartels and all those bandits\nAnd people who were holding people hostage almost in some of those hills and mountains in those areas and now how are they going to compete with western corporations so you know that's something to consider this is interesting in Canada I mean excuse me in Colorado\nWhere recreational marijuana is legal\nThey're concerned about getting a brain drain and I'm not talking about the effect of marijuana I'm Talking about people who are in the business in Colorado which may be a little over saturated right now starting to send their workforce to the great white north\nUh because uh you don't have enough experience to shop owners and business people up there doing it so you know all kinds of interesting ramifications of course\nUh they're the ones that we more traditionally think of and of course that has been getting some attention also as this happened and uh so Jim rupe tells us that some are concerned that the policy up in Canada could do more harm than good\nMichael was a historic day across the great flight Nora how's it going to hit it is the first major country second to much smaller or way\nTo adopt a national policy the new law permits adults Eighteen and older to grow by possess end or use marijuana\nI just think this is a really bad idea\nThat age Eighteen says Dr Kevin ... with a group smart approaches to marijuana is the first major concern doctors\nSaid okay if you're going to do this we don't think you should but if you are at least make the age twenty five an older so it it's crystal clear that as your brain is developing this should be avoided\nThe government didn't listen to the doctors today marijuana is you know twenty to thirty times stronger than the Woodstock stuff it's so much more potent than it used to be it's been manufactured to increase the strength and it affects the developing brain in
