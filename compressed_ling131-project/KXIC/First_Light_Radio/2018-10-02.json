that stadium the vowels that saved the locker room my goodness I've seen\nA heist new high school stadiums that are more tech savvy and a lot cleaner that stadium is horrible man that dirt infield the whole thing\nWhat a joke I cannot wait for the raiders to get out of there and I feel bad for the Oakland A's because the raiders get to go to that brand new facility in a couple of years in Las Vegas obviously what are the Oakland A's going to do after that they need a new baseball stadium badly the\nBest part of that stadium still I think one of the best stories is how Randy Moss supposedly wouldn't run routes they're required him to run on dirt yes ah such an amazing story\nI'm about to about how messy that the that stadium is so we got the NFL uh and evidently a job is a lot to check in with that later um he's trying to get everything set up after he was in Paris after he decided to at the jet away for the Ryder Cup and watched by the way the U.S get destroyed\nBy a by Europe but we were talking about that on I guess it was friday morning was a friday morning we know is pretty good yeah it was a three one lead that the U.S had and the first four matches and then everything fell apart from uh from that point forward\nI'm One of the things that I thought was a was maybe the most intriguing in general about the er about week four in the NFL kind of across the board\nThere was one awful rough in the past or call from the Cleveland Browns game\nBut in general it seemed like there was a memo that had gone out that toll NFL officials not to be as aggressive and throwing the ... in the past or flags\nI don't have the data in front of me right now but it seemed to like the number of roughing the passer flags versus week three and certainly the first three weeks of the season were significantly diminish that I think there had to be a memo that went out to all of the different officials that said hey guys\nThe biggest complaint we are getting right now is that you guys are excessively enforcing the new ... in the past or a penalty and as a result I thought I thought all of those kind of a dried up and a substantial fashion which really I mean I've got an argument I'm In that outbreak it down for you later in the show I mean the NFL is close to getting it grew\nBack I have the sense that the ESPN CBS NBC and\nFox partnerships they all just basically to\nSo we're not going to cover the protest anymore\nAnd I don't know about you guys I don't even know how many players or kneeling now but everybody in the media has just been like screw it we're not covering this anymore it's really pretty wild to follow if you think about the last two years how every single national anthem was chronicled in an obsessive fashion\nAnd then the ratings collapsed twenty percent\nAnd I think the TV partners as well as the league have finally said something that I suggested awhile ago which is\nYou got to treat the protesting players like kids misbehave\nThe more you pay attention to them the more it continues if you ignore them I think the analogy I had was never had kids if they're running and playing in the backyard and they trip and fall and everybody pays attention to them then they start to cry\nBut if they look around and realized that nobody saw them or at least they can't tell that somebody saw them they often just get up and continue to run\nAnd I think the fact that I don't know about you guys have you seen a story about protesting players\nAt all this year from any of those major league partners I think everybody got together and finally said guys were getting killed a year we lost hundreds of millions of dollars because of all the ... of the NFL and the ... at them and everything else I don't even know if anybody ... right now is anybody even though we\nDon't even know because like you said nobody's covering the story line just\nDie I mean I I'm\nI'm not a conspiracy guide generally speaking because I've been conspiracies are hard to follow there is one hundred percent but in agreement\nA handshake by all of the league TV partners\nAnd everyone else associated with the NFL that they will not cover this anymore because that story just went away I mean think about it did they ever even officially announced any kind of policy that was a huge story around Memorial Day when they said hey we got a new policy for the national anthem and then it just vanished\nAnd the result has been fans are coming back into the game it feels like\nThe overall quality of the game has increased in terms of points being scored entertaining uh overtime three different overtime game the amount of ah\nUnexpected outcomes in games whether it was the buck starting off the season\nBy whipping the New Orleans saints on the road or whether it was something as crazy as the bill's going on the road\nAs one of the biggest underdogs and twenty five years to win in the NFL it's been hard to project from week to week

Ben Roethlisberger ruffled some feathers and\nBecause he made it or suggested that he flop there's no need to suggest or intimate\nOf obvious here they're better off his burger fly off in the Monday Night football game to sell a roughing the pastor call on his radio show and he gets paid a lot of money to call into sports radio Pittsburgh brothers burger essentially confirmed that is what happens so people are upset around the NFL\nAnd if you've not been following this\nThere's one person in particular that rant and rave there was asked specifically about profit ... comments that would be ravens defensive coordinator wink Martin Dale that's right wing Martin do his nickname is ... Don Martin do they call them with a\nWink Martin the ravens playing the Steelers this week and he didn't hold back a Martin Dale defensive coordinator in Baltimore criticized not just raw fish burger\nBut all quarterbacks we're looking to draw roughing the pastor penalties through north various\nWays tried to Seoul flopping thing and all that\nSo [noise] uh the specific quote here just just imagine that I'm with Martin do\nThe quote was let's not turn this into the NBA ... Martin Martin do complain because now the quarterbacks are making a mockery of it the rivers offensive for Nader fulltime duty officials and the little league and now\nYou're insinuating the officials [noise] or actually insulting and insulting the officials and the league if you do that\nTo get the rest of one big men set pod cast it by searching the Ben ... show and is always you can hear the Ben Miller show weekdays it do any I mean during eleven pm Pacific right here on Fox Sports radio\n[laughter]\nFriend my price Harper opposed to the very cryptic message on his Instagram page after playing his final home game\nHe put a picture of himself waving\nTo the Washington fans for the captions to the fans and city of D.C thank you [laughter] now let me just say there's nothing cryptic about that I Know it's not saying I Am leaving why most affected by when they're still playing games and the the there's not even over yet this is my first one let you guys use the\nI'm leaving I mean I'm I'm leaving\nI this is not one of those home made no no I'm leaving I mean I'm Out the door I Am leaving and you're figuring it's friday so most people are going to pay attention to the next few days 'cause they're all watching college football in the NFL to this is your last chance\nTo grab onto their attention\nYou are listening to Jesus man when white Carmine yes the last man standing\nWhen I broke down at Fort forgive\nI mean who knew Matheny when you were alone\nYou for ... for ... brain ... remembers boom\nBoom boom boom boom you can ...\nFrom his new forgive me when wrinkles numbers you know working\nFor me I didn't really know how many him room learning leaning now you learn from\nYour skin melanoma second most common cancer onion leaning twenty nine years old and protect you learn more skin cancer or a message from the American Academy of ...\nIn some way to competition itself do you get that sense when you were calling the game that the NFL after a couple of years stumble may finally be returning to just being a football games are being football entertainment again\n[noise] absolutely and I think it's a huge sigh of relief for most people and I don't care which side of the spectrum you fall off they're a good number of people who have their issues with the NFL that I Would sit down and listen to [noise]\nAnd not dispute like I don't like it for this this this isn't as an IRS was bothered me this that and most of those people that I that had those issues the NFL\nThey've you know some of them would say well I'm not going back you know I'm done with the NFL and\nMost of them are really saying I just want to find a reason to love the NFL again give it today\nAnd this field this season feels like they're giving it to the people that get in so many different ways look the anthem thing we're not discussing it right now I think we're essentially down to Kenny still now but Wilson with Miami\nThat that we're discussing ... much of a discussion I think that the Kenny Stills when you talk about what he's done in this community and everything else there's there's almost a hey he's kneeling but look at all these other doing we're just not talking about and then the game\nHad been extremely compelling what are we at six overtime games already we go down to the wire on Monday Night football again last night those things are really helping when we're able to put it back on the field it takes away from just about everything else and that's a good thing for the NFL but I think you're right most shows there for the league and let's hope that it continues\nWhat do you think about the Frank right that we are I obviously I'm In love with my ... I live here in Nashville what ... done the last three weeks three straight wins as an underdog this team seems to love him saying hey we're not going to attempt to field goal and go for the tide against the eagles was an incredible game in overtime came down to Marcus Mario to throwing a touchdown pass with Eighteen seconds left\n... wins everybody says he's a genius what did you think about the Frank right decision in Indianapolis getting that game my thought in general was it was a context of the time that was left on the ...\nUm it would have been hard even if they got in that first down potentially for them to get into a field goal of you know kind of range yeah uh whereas they basically gave the Texans an opportunity there your coach you're making that decision what would your analysis of the Frank right decision of that\nI thought he was being a little overly aggressive there because of where he was an all things you point out especially where he was on the field and what do we always talk about when you make a decision you often have to have the context of what if your decision goes the opposite of what you're trying to accomplish what was the fallout\nAnd the fall out there it was really kind of setting themselves up setting them up for pretty easy shot at a field and and that's actually what happened but here's the flip side of it all brand new heads\nMaryland's veterans showing how stupid and know a career I was Airforce from Ninety three Ninety eight they got hurt practicing\nGovernment search and rescue villa ... I'm ... I don't know where I deal with them and I've only seen that now\nYou know through struggle you know that's when the marine corps and services and all about unions tie in those bonds will get stronger and stronger in the more you struggled together and the the harder the hardship and um I don't know if it gets any harder than being a quadriplegic so you know we instantly bond\nParalyzed veterans of America is a nonprofit and it gets a new federal funding and we provide every service free of charge in every veteran interior where we ... a veteran and PVA executive director Sherman Gillum junior\nEvery life every success every recovery it's tied to the initial investment you've had enough to learn more news at ... or a public service message from paralyzed veterans of America\nA I'm an unabashed Tennessee University of Tennessee fan unabashed heightened fan\nAnd it's rare you have a coach who you are I Would I say is like if somebody tried to take it tried to shoot him I Would Secret Service dive in front of him and [laughter] All right ed so uh it so I loved every I still love Bruce Pearl I Love everything about what he's done for his entirety but\nYou come in after just along the mole lays I Would say where you're just like man there's no reason to be excited or energetic about this program or about this team\nAnd he immediately flip the switch and everything changes and I see a little bit of my ... uh in his parole and the same way that I felt\nWell well well to your point on that Mike ... has been telling his team and he really told them and this one because they are planning to send all champs we're going after him we're going to be aggressive\nI I don't know what kind of speech he gave but almost felt like her Brooks talking to his team in in the locker room and it was it before the game against the Russian but during practice session when he said there's a way to beat that\nYou don't defend them you attack\nThem right you remember that the yeah he's like yeah to tackle\nAnd he told his team that we were going to be aggressive going to do that and then he is head coach had to symbolize that and I loved his explanation post game when he ran a field goal unit ... we were never going to feel ... and my team knew that\nBut we were going to show this and then we came back we went for it and it worked out I just love that approach and I think Frank Reich is probably trying to do something similar to Indianapolis\nHis results probably in the wrong spot\nBut I'm not doing it in for given at a given it a try because we ask anyone preseason does Indianapolis contender you've got to resolve to do and trying to build a program there\nYou've got giants Panthers coming up the Panthers coming off of by week the giants sitting at one and three we mentioned the NFC earlier and what exactly was going to help it happened in that division is camp back\nA because it wasn't too long ago Cam Newton and the Carolina Panthers were going up against the Denver Broncos and Peyton Manning and the and the Panthers were nearly a touchdown favored in that game and everybody was talking about cameras the reigning league MVP in the face of the NFL for years to come and the last couple of years have been a real struggle for him\nDo you think the Panthers are back to being that upper echelon team can can play at maybe not exactly the MVP caliber but can he demonstrate that he is an upper echelon quarterback as well in this like\nI say yes from what I've seen on a three games sample and I think it's got a chance to keep getting better and you\nRemember when north Turner was hired as off into coordinated there's a lot of head scratching people who are who what North Turner Cam Newton don't see that at all and that's because we get very stuck in\nThis is what this coached it before and this is who we had playing quarterback for my you're not going to run Troy Aikman like you're going to run camp I mean that's just stupid but everybody seems to everybody there's a lot of discussion that\nNor wouldn't be able to change quote unquote and can wouldn't be able to change and I said right from the beginning I said it these to meet half way\nWhich actually expected them to do because cameras now in his eight year\nThey've got a chance to be successful that did I say that there's going to be this this and now I just that they have to be half way meaning\nNorth can't just you know chain him to the pocket and can't can't just say I'm going to run it and run around and do all this other stuff you get it checked out so well he's doing all of that plays like sixty five percent ... percent grown up cans of career fifty eight fifty nine percent thrower\nSo he's doing more this duck nor is asking and then return nor has kept the quarterback run game in effect would that offsets and I think that's paying them great dividends and last but not least\nI said it before the draft I'm going to say\nIt can now I screamed get from the rooftops and I'm not sure it won't hurt me to hear me down every one more time\nChristian McCaffrey can run in ... okay I act like you can't run between the tackles he could at Stanford I was ... he couldn't have pros he's doing it now and he's catching ten passes it get give it to our", "year": "2018", "show_name": "First Light Radio", "city": "Iowa City", "day": "02"}
