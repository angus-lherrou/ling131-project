arsenal until other nations calls come to their senses so what do you think\nAre you ready for a return to Cold War era style arms races taking money away from things like rebuilding America call us

from the American Academy of orthopedic surgeons and the or could be the trauma association visit or throat info dot org slash prescription safety one\n[noise]\nTwenty four minutes before the hour an hour on first morning Michael Toscano so happy\nThat you have joined us this morning and we're a hope that you all are joined us on the air by calling eight hundred seven three six six six six\nWe'd like to know your thoughts on President Trump's threatening to pull the U.S out of this uh intermediate range this nuclear weapons deal that's been in effect since Nineteen eighty seven\nUp primarily of course between the United states and the then Soviet Union but of course it also stops the United states from doing things elsewhere for instance countering China's military buildup with nuclear weapons\nSo the president says that Russia has been disregarding the treaty the last couple of years under Vladimir ... and violating the treaty in fact the NATO says that the twenty nine of the NATO allies also believe that Russia is violating his arms control treaty and they've been trying to get information about their new missile systems in Russia and have not been able to [noise]\nBut uh there are some pros and cons obviously obviously you get out of the treaty and freeze your hands to do what you want in terms of developing weapons now just because there has been a treaty in effect since Nineteen eighty seven does not mean that the United states has not move forward with developing weapons weapons can be a\nYou can be drawn up they can be designed you can study them on computers you can do everything but actually build them\nIn terms of this deal so it's not as if we would be so far behind that we could never catch up the problem is Russia if you believe some of the allies and President Trump Russia may actually be going ahead and building some new missiles in violation of this treaty that goes back all the way to the\nDays of Ronald Reagan and my column Gorbachev\nAre being pretty good buddies they're toward the end of the Soviet Union which was crumbling partly because they couldn't keep up with the United states and the arms race we had a lot more money\nAnd so every time they would do something and try to build up some weapons we were just build more and bigger and better weapons and that all that bankrupted that country they've never been a rich nation but the arms race really bankrupted the Soviet Union\nAnd pretty much put them out of business now ... running an even poor nation and the Soviet Union was\nAnd yet he has been building up his weapons so do we follow the old Cold War method of building up our weapons and scaring the Russians and the you know bankrupting them well that of course is a destabilize Russia a good thing they do have nuclear weapons we'd like them to release have enough money to\nKeep it together stay in power and keep those things under control we don't want them to fall into the hands of insurgents or some of the folks that surround Russia in some of the former Soviet Union satellite so this was a very very complicated issue it seems as if the president caught some of his own people by surprise by announcing he was going to withdraw the U.S from this treaty\nIs national security adviser John Bolton has been in Russia yeah he was in Russia yesterday to meet with a Russian foreign minister staff and people to talk about this and how this would work to withdraw from the system of course now Russia\nIs saying that the accusation is that they're not\nComplying with the deal are groundless\nAnd they claim that us violations of the treaty ah are happening and they don't like that either so they're saying that uh they hope beneficial word from the Kremlin has that quote we are prepared to work together with our us colleagues\nOn the entire set of problems regarding the INS now of course you have to remember President Trump is a businessman he likes to negotiate so there may be some thought that what he's doing here is perhaps not throwing out the treaty maybe that was first bargaining position\nAnd what he might be able to do is negotiate a better deal as he did with the NAFTA\nOr with Mexico and Canada you know we're pulling out of this so you have a chance if you want to come in and give us some better and better deals but it's hard to think how you could do this with the Russians because building up weapons and national defense there's a lot different from trade because you have lives at stake here\nSo the first thing we're going to do this morning before we take your calls and by the way our number is eight hundred seven three six three six six six and I want to know what you think about this are you willing to trash a treaty and return to the old arms race of the past and put more and more billions of dollars into using weapons or to building weapons that hopefully we would never be able to or have to use", "show_name": "First Light Radio", "year": "2018", "city": "Iowa
