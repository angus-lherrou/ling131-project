I had put food up on the counter and I still am guarded right now when I put it up there I go now got to put it away because\nOh wait no Gilbert can't get it nor can our little dogs so it's kind of just nice it's convenient it's not a big deal tell us about the hog the pug so where do you think the puck originates\nFrom a its mother good answer expand please\nWhat can you really want me to explain the birthing process what country or or ... as usual Jerry is very lively All right you're not going to if you're not playing with me fair right now I don't want to play with you uh England no\nSomething ... ...\n... it wasn't going no no ... no get out of Europe\n... get a New Zealand\nRight let's let's fight to the pug is well described by the phrase and this is that there's a there's a ...\nHurting here that makes me uncomfortable ... in ... though\nI didn't know what that meant until I read it which means a lot of dog in a small space which gets to our earlier conversation gosh those are just so energetic\nThey are recognized for their even tempers playful personalities and they're outgoing loving disposition and Jerry just says yet but to an extreme on that one this square\nAnd copy breed comes in ... yeah that's a good good ah additive apricots font or black with well defined mask on his muzzle a popular companion dogs the pug also excels in the show bring\nThe history of the ... where we where did they come from the bug\nThe pug is one of the oldest breeds of dogs I I had to remind myself of that one I didn't know and his lawyer is since before for four hundred BC most researchers agree that the ... comes from Asia due to its similarities in the ...\nChina is the earliest known source of ... where they were\nPets of the Buddhist monasteries in Tibet the breed next appeared in Japan and Europe becoming popular with Prince William ... become and became a king who became the king of England he owned dogs and they became the fashionable read for generations\nIncluding now so the temperament like what we were getting into the bugs reason for a living is to be near their people and to please them and they're starting this makes them up family favorite they are comfortable in small apartments because they need minimal exercise but the breed can adapt easily to all situations the pug\nSheds but as short has a short court and requires little grooming\nSong that we talk a lot about you know if it's a large breeding it sheds especially if the hair is a little longer or you'll see it all over the place as the dog gets smaller\nThat shedding becomes less noticeable in this case the plugs share is short not the shortest of of all breeds like a dachshund or a miniature pincher their hair's even shorter [noise]\nUh see see it last a and it and it becomes less of an issue in your house but you will see some shedding on your dogs especially if you have a color contrast on a sofa or something [noise] um\nThey were recognized by Casey back in Eighteen eighty five their weight fourteen to Eighteen pounds but that that's deceiving because\nWhen they're born in ... when they're born Mm I Would say site\nI think it's just that they're close in their eyes okay so it still works their death\nOkay isn't that interesting I Wonder I ... I don't think there's a real purpose other than it's still working or maybe it's trying to figure it out or we born deaf to I don't know I we because we talk about all the\nBaby can hear me in your in utero so I I was assuming yeah I Would assume that but yeah we we we hear that but then is that a misperception as well All right ah Dalmatians\nAre born with what color black\nAnd white completely white completely Y DNA established the develop there's there are spots as they grow older I Know uh I don't know what week they start coming in but I think it's fairly rapidly I Know at eight weeks they're fully spotted and everything is going you know in that direction [noise] All right\nSo now we're going to go on taste do you think dogs\nCan sense taste better or worse than we do have\nMy first inkling as to say worse yeah they are much worse there so not quite as and they only the only reason I said that if the if it balances the equation that they can smell better than we can so I Would think that just from\nJust balancing the equation right yeah that they would be better at one worse at the other were\nBetter tasters than we are smaller yeah I Wonder if they like don't care as much about taste like we are really all about taste and then like you know we all have ... admitted we all have tried dog food try to get a dog to eat a piece of broccoli I think that they know exactly [laughter]\nOr be the salary if it's green yeah they're not into it yeah our dogs ... our dogs will eat like a cabbage you know if it falls down they'll rip carrots\nThey like Harris yeah yeah Kelly likes ... texture thing yeah maybe that's it she likes\nIt better stomach does not so she's a carrot she's not good dogs have about Seventeen hundred one thousand seven hundred taste buds we have two thousand to ten thousand a that's a\n... think about us man there's some of us it taste really really good and some of us that have no taste at I think there are and there's I mean there's obviously humans out there that can't smell either and so\nA ... and that's a whole different topic anyway continuing on so we get a kick out of our own dogs on his why the dogs kickback word after they go to the bathroom\nI'm\n[laughter] I'm not going to give you my first answer that popped into my head something to do with releasing the\nReleasing the tension toll wow you are you I thought you were you had it I I didn't want so should I have gone with my first thought tell us what it is [laughter]\nAfter they go to the bathroom it's not it's not to cover it up but too and that's what I thought it was it's to mark their territory using the scent clans in their feet\nOh see now that's not where I was thinking the back and trying to release all that tension is [noise] although no but that makes sense also is yeah ah they're trying to mark their territory yeah and there actually is a sense that's coming out of their feet and all that we get a kick out of our own dogs because we have three\nOf them at our house right now and we have one of them that kicks and I know she's aiming because she aims at one of the dogs and if one of the dogs aren't there just seems that writer you shift starts kicking\nAlright alright and then uh my last one that we have and there were more of them but I just skipped over some a recent study showed that dogs are among a small group of animals who show voluntary unselfish\nKindness towards others without any reward and that is something that we all know but they're just doing studies and you know a defining and all that kind of stuff so those\nAre really cool you can check that out a case sees website will have all of this\nYou should post that on your Facebook page oh very good idea we will have that done here within minutes in tag
