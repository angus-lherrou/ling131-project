fundamental problem in American society which is really not so much the political process or solutions but the\nThe fraying social fabric where the American people are looking at one another as enemies or his adversaries versus as friends or neighbors\nAnd so the way you pose the question is how does that move the needle that benefit well the benefit is just the release intention benefits just looking another human being in the eyes and talking about what's most personal to you and that alone relieves a lot of attention that we're feeling\nAs it sounds like what you're ... you're

unfortunately Ninety percent of everything you see\nIn the products that number who does is look how bad they are\n... and you know exaggerated example of something on the other side and look how bad

little vignettes on any I mean even counted how many breeds I've got up there but it's hundreds of breeds up there that you can research learn a little bit about 'em and and so you make a more educated decisions so the the Boston Terrier is indeed and we're going to learn more about why it is the all American dog\nConveying an impression of determination strength an activity he is\nShort headed I've have you ever been described\nAs my picture next to this description uh it just as funny\nSome of the additives are descriptions are you I'm an ... okay compact rebuild I met on that\nOne I used to be back leave out not so much anymore\nAnd must be okay so the colors are black brindle or seal with white markings often the history of them this is where the all American following the civil war the Boston Terrier breed was developed in the stables of Boston, Massachusetts it's like one of the few breeds that were\nAnd they came from the place it sounds like they should come from right yeah then on\nTop of everything from America let alone I'm here what do you think the Boston was bred for you it it's like it doesn't do this at all or to drink tea I oh that's fun\nIt was bred as a fighting dog which back then I Know it's not right today but back then a lot of dogs were bred I must have been like I don't know they didn't have TV so they had that as entertainment you know I don't really quite get it\nUm but they are boxers are bulldogs that's I mean gosh they went up against bowls and so\nThere was all sorts that was the culture you know ... so while we might not agree with it and everything we definitely can I I'm fascinated with history and just that oh that's we we are blessed today with the breed because of it\nI'm In a case so a little further back and imported dog known as Hoover's judge\nAnd so it was Robert Hooper that had a dog named judge and they called it supers judge 'em sold to a Boston man in Eighteen Seventy or became the ancestor of all most all true modern Boston terriers what do you think the Boston Terrier\nThere they they say there is a bulldog mix of some kind in their eyes they never distinguish which one it was what do you think I I think primarily what was the breed that it it's coming from with another mix of something else when he ... what do you think the Boston looks most like\nOther ... well I\nI don't know my breathing names very well so the French she looks really\nTo a Boston I in fact some people will mistake Boston from ... and if you know a a Boston's and you know they go vice versa and everything so\nYeah the French ... so if you are looking for a friend she ah right now the nation's going goofy on French you so the pricing is just crazy high\nGet a Boston you're almost getting the same I read within a Boston Terrier so and they do look a little different I I'm not denying the dog and a bunch of price [laughter] sort of Austin ... uh the breed is an American creation resulting from a ... oh here we go across between English\nOoh ah they say English I'm gonna have to correct this because it is a French bull dog which\nGoes back to the English so that that would be a a true statement and a white English terrier that's where the that white English terrier is the other bulldog you kind of a breed that comes into it in Nineteen Ninety One or Eighteen Ninety One the breed became known as Boston terriers taking the name of the city where they originated\nThe temperament the Boston has been nicknamed the American gentleman\nBecause of the dapper parents a care characteristic ally gentle disposition and suitable as companion and house pet\nThey require only a moderate amount of exercise in a minimum\nAmount of grooming the breed is it is easy to train and they are easy keeper prefer anchor remained by their owners size so yeah so this is a kind of a small to medium breed a they kind of top out in the twenties\nUm that it is a shutting dog but because it's smaller in nature you don't really notice the shed your uh\nThe ... what's the breed that you have at\nOur Josie as a black lab\nAnd so you're going to see it's shutting dog you're going to see a lot more shedding even though they both had the same like I'm Out but it's just a with a smaller dog you see less of it sure and so for a lot of people they go wow I I really like that it's not a big deal anymore for me when it's a smaller dog\nUm it is an energetic dogs they kind of play down the exercise which I think long term exercise yeah they don't play for a long time that kind of\nDo this muscle a move stuff and then they get worn out fairly quickly and so I think that's where they come up with the moderate exercise um and they can get that out within the house just throwing the ball you know or the money thing around the house not another dog I'm Talking about I'm Talking about a toy here just and you were going off in the\nWrong direction I kept thinking about oh I Wish I could get away with modern or my [laughter] and so so\nThey are easy there and then a a overall fairly easy\nDog and especially if you're looking for that medium a short little on the smaller size dog this is going to be great for you you got boys and young girls at home they're going to have a blast because this one's going to have that rough and tumble ... to it and everything and they'll love playing with it [laughter]\nBoston Terrier breed of the week up breed of the week he's rounds altered I marked is this is the positively at that land show and uh uh yeah I Know you want to talk a little bit ah fleeing tick and are also getting those dogs out fitted properly for colder weather\nYeah so the ... and a lot of people think hey I can start backing off on the ... this is not the time to do it right now so\nWe're in the month of October you know and nobody says you should back off they all all the data says that you should keep it on\nAll year long and it's so cheap now it's like there's no reason not to do it you're you're down at ten dollars a dose if you've got got fleas in your house you got a whole nother year in thousands of dollars and it's uncomfortable when they're in your house so ten dollars a month that's a pretty easy fix\n'em keep that going because the two seasons for fleas are spring and fall\nInto because we isolate in that Seventy degree range\nUm he'll plus or minus tend to agree that prime time for fleas actually hate the middle of the summer okay so it gets too hot they go dormant in that point in the winter they also go dormant but I'm going to tell you where are where your dog is in the middle of winter what temperature is it\nKind of a trick question\nI follow me follow me walk with me right now to ... ... s S. sorry so I'm going on with the technical aspects of the show and I just I I I and I didn't I lost track of ... I think the rest of us so that the the audio slicing live so in the middle of winter during the show is still going\nIn the middle of winter what primarily is your what temperature does your dog\nBe and what are we talking when he's inside yeah inside somewhere right around Seventy degree oh hey wait I'm just connected guy yes\nAnd so if your dog or cat for that matter got a little bit of infestation maybe you didn't even know it ... you know it's just one or two right at the tail end of the whole season outside\nAnd brought a man well now they're on your dog or cat\nUm and now you're backing off on your ... products\nAnd all of a sudden you've got to flee infestation right around January and you're like where did these come from that how that that whole process for us so that's why you want to keep it going noticed thing on the ... if your dog or cat if you found sleeves on him know that there is now eggs underneath their skin\nAnd so those are going to hatch when the temperatures right which is your around in your house you know and so you have to treat a nonstop now or two while those eggs hatch you want to have protection so that they get killed and all that kind of stuff as are hatching and everything\nSo um that's kind of the extent of what I wanted to go to if you're in the middle of all we have a fully infestation we have a problem\nOr know that you needed to have that first line of defense ... one of those topic was a good quality one there's a lot of cheap I was out there if you're paying less than ten dollars a dose you're probably are using one of the cheaper ones that don't work the veterinarian will even say the same exact thing um but if you have a were noticed in some fleas on her cat or dog\nGo get kept guard we have it at our store patently in Iowa City\nIt will kill every walking fleas and not the eggs or larvae and all that every walking flea that on your dog or cat within thirty minutes they literally you'll see little dot driving off of the pet it's that\nCool a product and it's safe for your dog and cat as well it's not a dangerous little product or anything so make sure you get that\nUm and then okay so now we can talk about winter hey all of our winter stuff is in the store we have all of our jackets sweaters boots slippers or we bought I think three times the amount of last year that we've sold so we are definitely well stock\nAnd I suspect we're going to sell out again this year on our boots I Believe I did that five to\nMight even used ten times the amount we sold out so quickly\nIn the city sold out like nobody can get 'em anywhere and\nOnline they sold out so I'm like All right we are not going to have that problem so I ordered me once shame on you right\nSo we've really ordered out so now you right now is your best selection on color styles and all that kind of stuff so get in on it lie on 'em and and take advantage of that because before you know it will says he's sassy Suzie is not going to want to go outside because it's too old is your dog ear you got a bigger dog how does a bigger dog deal with\nComing to Atlantic City night vision goggles [laughter] so\nYou can see where the cats are at night so that is a we can go into more but a rounding out the shows where we want to be right now yeah All right so we are ... this is what we do in the store worker punch a tech geeks uh we go through an educator\nCalled pet theory is now yeah scientist go up and\nIt's a fun place to work out and I uh Wendy and I do demand our our uh employees to work very hard so you will see them boy they're always they're cracking the weapon and are in really uh they're usually running to get things done so\nUh we're all about educating our customers on the pets that they have a so if you if you don't have a pet we've got plenty of has to choose from to come in and check them out if you have a pet come on in and if you've got you know the ... question how do I do this how do I do that um ask us\n...
