{"month": "10", "state": "IA", "station": "KXIC", "content": "Through the changes that were passed in August is there are several\nUh pockets but the ones that kind of impact us the most here in Iowa will be one or allowing for some form of absentee participation for those who will not be able to or could not attend\nTo a recording of the raw results from the first ... white men to phase of the carcasses are ensuring that we have a recount procedure in place so that we can if a if it's a\nClose and if the campaign requested that we can in fact recreate what happens in a caucus site in ... be able to make sure that the results are accurate um those are really kind of the three big buckets that we are are looking at as we go forward here the other one to you is that\nLocking the caucus night result is the final result so what has happened in years past is that you know the county level if one side doesn't get the uh their folks out that\nIt can change and then they can change again at the district convention that could change again at the state convention here um is\nThe what happens on caucus night will beep or is the winner and so from that point forward and everything will be preserved for going up through the chain and so [noise] uh if it's projected that candidate acts gets for delegates to the DMZ well then they'll get for do you ... so we've got to work through\nIf candidate acts wins that many delegates in Iowa but does it make it past South Carolina doesn't make it past Florida if they released their delegates does that then open it up either for free connection or for some sort of a portion met or am I premature in that\nI think that uh this is where the devil is going to be the details yeah we\nAre also a starting the process now we're out doing some listening posts across the states they're translucent feedback on how we might be able to do that sort of thinking through this we have until approximately\nYou know springtime for a first part is trying to be able to figure all this stuff out you know do your selection plans written and submitted to the DNC and so for us where his during that process to really\nPick up in earnest after after election day but it's a but we're in the process right now it's starting to think through that so to answer your specific question I don't know the answer to that yet and uh\nOther states where that has happened before we got to go take a look at how other states have dealt with this when they have primaries for example you know in New Hampshire the urban candidates you drop out shortly after New Hampshire but they still have so many do against that they were secure on 'em that night\nSo we just go through that process and will figure out exactly how to do that [noise]\nOne of the big sticking points of courses then how does Iowa State distinctive from New Hampshire and one of the concerns some hit had\nWas if you report raw vote totals ... starting to look like New Hampshire if you have an absentee process it may be too much like New Hampshire the first question is do you think that our singular identity will remain pure and secondly are the folks in New Hampshire happy [laughter]\nWell for us uh again or we\nWant to preserve the spirit of the Iowa caucuses and so we want to preserve that feeling where folks can come together and actually discuss this you are because it's one of the few places in politics that you can actually do that anymore and so we do want to make sure that but we also want to make sure that we're giving folks the opportunity to have their\nVoices heard um er and for folks who may not be able to participate that's always been a challenge in years past us or we're gonna take a really in earnest looking at how we might be able to make that happen\nIn terms of New Hampshire you know I travelled out there are a\nEarlier this year and I talked with or secretary of state and I say in regular communication with my counterpart miniature\n[noise] and so you know we will continue to work with them and make sure that you know as we were going through this process keeps them up to date and you know is there any land mines that are or challenges that may be further down the road that we're not seeing [noise]\nMake sure that we're keeping from some of the loop on that so that the for early States I've always worked really well together Iowa New Hampshire has definitely worked very well together over the last Thirty years [laughter]\nFor sure and so um you know we want to make sure that we are continuing that process and also continue to work with our folks across the aisle here in the state I'm obviously the Republicans\nRepublican process looks different than ours does report raw total 'em and they do allocate their dog it's based upon that and so for us we want to you\nYou know this is a a a lot of conversations go into this process and that's\nNot something that I get to decide a or a you know your SEC just unilaterally gets to decide we're obviously want to make sure that people have a chance to have their voices heard in this conversation if they have thoughts of something we haven't even thought about it yet hoping that we can salute or you know here that feedback can hear those thoughts will be able to put that out there\nTroy price chair of the Iowa Democratic party we spoke at West point on September twenty seven some final words for context now from former state party chair and former congressman Dave May\nWas Daniel Webster view the dictionary fame who wrote in the federalist papers most people don't realize it was a constitutional is before he was a dictionary experts that it's important to the Democratic process that we talk to each other\nAs you put people into a room of all the persuasion to all of the candidates\nAnd they talk to each other and a half to clear their PR efforts in public through there for an here why their neighbors are for somebody else\nThat's that's healthy that's democracy it to the lowest possible political nomination you can get and I think that's important particularly it was important before it's even more important now for the things I said we started the show is we got to start talking to each other we got to start listening to each other\nAnd that brings us to the close of this week's program were back again next week at the same time
