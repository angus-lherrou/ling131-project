S. sorry so I'm going to do with the technical aspects of the show and I just I I I did I lost track of ... I think the rest of us so that the the audio wise anyway so in\nThe middle of the winter [laughter] she'll is still going [laughter]\nIn the middle of winter what primarily is your what temperature does your dog\nBe and what are we talking when he's inside yeah inside somewhere right around Seventy degree oh\nHey wait I'm just connect the dots yes\nAnd so if your dog or cat for that matter got a little bit of flea infestation maybe you didn't even know it ... yeah I was just one or two right at the tail end of the whole season outside\nAnd brought a man well now they're on your dog or cat\nUm and now you're back off on your ... products\nAnd all of a sudden you've got to flee infestation rats come around January and you're like where did these come from that's how that that whole process work so that's why you want to keep it going now this thing on the ... if your dog or cat if you found fleas on him know that there is now eggs underneath their skin\nAnd so those are going to hatch when the temperatures right which is your around in your house you know and so you have to treat a nonstop now or two while those eggs hatch you want to have protection so that they get killed and all that kinda stuff as they're hedging and everything so\nUm that's kind of the extent of what I wanted to go to if you're in the middle of all we have a fully infestation we have a problem\nOr know that you needed to have that first line of defense ... one of those topic was a good quality one there's a lot of cheap bows out there if you're paying less than ten dollars a dose you're probably are using one of the cheaper ones that don't work the veterinarian will even say the same exact thing um but if you have a were noticed in some fleas on our cat or dog\nOurs did this like screaming old lady yell and and right before we fall and then they can't get up yet [laughter] he backed the window so hard that you would think somebody's breaking in and then yell\nLike an old lady and ears laying in bed and you're like goose bumps or like holy cow out what's going on out there and get off my lawn right\nOh it usually was when uh when I could catch it was just another cat now that was wandering the neighborhood\nOr something like that or does it real quick we're talking with Ron ... land of Iowa City it's the positively pet land GeoEye markets in for Jerry welder here on eight hundred ... got about four or five minutes or left year round so up a few more cat fat okay the kicker and like normal around like a ball when we started this\nSegment I'm like oh I don't know if I have enough but we're I'm ... I'm not even halfway through so this is like the uh oh here I like this we can finish it up this one or the segment a cat's powerful vision allows them to see\nLight at levels how many times less than what a human can see because we know they can see at night but this kind of puts it to a number\nI what what was the ... the the ratio\nIt's a ... yeah it's a ratio how many times more you know more can they\nSee you again trying to gain I don't know no I I I I was just trying to measure I had like a very good question and exactly right or how you put Fifteen six\nTimes lower okay\nIt which is yeah that's why they can see dogs can do the same not I don't know about six times I've not ever seen a number put to that one I'm so somebody I don't know if they've done the study yet but six times lower so that's why\nWhen I'm walking around when Gilbert was ... in the house you fall over Gilbert because he's coming up to the uh not knowing that you can see him and then all of a sudden you're that I think that's where the the term I just kick the cat I come from 'cause you're like I Can't see the cap\nAnd so yes Gilbert got a couple of ... and Julie ... coming to Atlanta city night vision goggles [laughter] you could see where the cats are at night so that is a we can go into more but I'm rounding out the shows where we want to be right now yeah\nAll right so we are pat land of Iowa see this is what we do in the store where ... tech geeks uh we go through an educator contesting\nPet theories and all [laughter] scientist with us and it's a fun\nPlace to work out and I are Wendy and I do demand our our uh employees to work very hard so you will see them boy they're always they're cracking the weapon and are in really a ... they're usually running to get things done so ah we're all\nEducating our customers on the pets that they have a so if you if you don't have a pet we've got plenty of has to choose from to come in and check them out if you have a pet come on in and if you've got you know the number of a question how do I do this how do I do that I'm asked us\nTo I Am amazed of our population so don't be embarrassed to ask the stupid questions forty percent of our population is easily more than that I don't know the main product you need to use if your cat or dog here and it's in your house you know it maybe\nBy our show and sure but\nAh they don't know that there's this thing called a stain a notary mover and it has to have the enzyme in it for pets in it\nAnd that removes the permission to pay for your dog or cat in that same spot over and over again so many people walk in the door and we'd go is there anything that you're having difficulty with your cat or dog yeah keep some pain in the spots and never did this and all of a sudden it's doing it now\nHey use this product and it it it's I Gilbert started doing it he had an operation urine ate it and they kept on urinating in that area I cleaned it up\nUh after I figured out what was going on and he went back there and he was like what the heck happened it's gone with my spot yeah who movement spot and then stop marinating in her house again so getting it back to and it\nBroke into his old man now [laughter] you\nKnow so uh so come on and ask questions to take advantage of her by ten get one free on all our dog and cat food take advantage of that five dollar nail Trump or the free one if you've got your pet from us a and all the knowledge that we bring to the table\nPet land in Iowa City run cells were positive like that land thank you very much thank you day yeah positive positively ... show Sunday mornings in the nine o'clock hour on eight hundred they actually I see [noise]\nWe know joined Fox Sports radio already in progress on eight hundred cats icy and the ... on your Amazon smart speakers just by seeing Alexa played every tax icy on I heard radio\nOr cook we talked about him as one of the hot place as well the rest of the receiving or\nMore of a role of the guys because Jody Nelson has been inconsistent at a couple of big games and a couple of quiet ones much like this team overall uh where there's been some moments of\nOr if they're turning a corner and then they immediately retreat on the other side Andrew Luck getting great protection you've got to the Y.
