Anderson Justin Tucker is going to be a whole ... like\nThose in a blender ... up there he played quarterback and a kicker\nWell we had a very long career yeah like a Nolan Ryan type of long career yes they didn't used to make the goals that often backdrop okay uh Justin Tucker missing the first PAT of his career as you mentioned it looked like it was going straight down the middle and then somebody maybe a thousand people blew it to the right I immediately\nBut they lost by a play or to the back of the stadium giants to anything [laughter] I actually like that and as\nFar as him never

seven and after a thirty nine ten when a San Francisco the lead was twenty two nothing late in the first set\nIt again with every one is looking at the rams everyone thinks well outside of John grown in Oakland everyone thinks they have a pretty good roster and they look at the rams and say look what they're doing not necessarily seven to know Arnie but moving the football like they are having

some more of the post game sound as this acre brought up\nHe had been absolutely perfect absolutely perfect and extra points in his career and Justin Tucker\nMy fantasy kicker my aunt's steps up to try to tie the game and potentially send us into overtime\n\nFor forty four seconds then let's say twenty five hundred twenty three\nBelievable\nI mean I I don't know if that was just a pure mind blown I didn't ... celebration I didn't\nSee the replay was one of those times were the quarterback they scored an and Flaco wasn't even watching just assuming that that was going to be an automatic or what\nOh no no no they were all watching and they all saw it and their reactions were priceless hey speaking of Flaco here's what he said sometimes\nI watch some time to do this one you can't really tell from the sidelines anyway or listen to us into great friend of mine and we've all been through\nFootball games where it looks like it's you're the guy that\nYou know he's in the spotlight at the end of the game when you can kind of be determined we go to overtime win that game or prevent them from going down a kick in a field goal\nSo a lot of things go through your mind but I've been there are plenty of times I mean if you play football long enough you're going to be there are some points so we're very tight team here in the first thing you think about is your brother up in him dealing with it and I mean just the best in the world and what he does and he's most confident person that I Know it's not going to be an issue\nHere one hundred percent one hundred percent from thirty three\nYards in in your career and that happens so real quick here already yeah I give credit to Justin talker it was kind of a goofy dude but he wouldn't answer every question they asked him\nTo the challenging data taken our stadium but\nWe're here because we make it not only in our stadium but anywhere we go and that's exactly what we're going to do moving forward it's going to keep working out on our practice field and hopefully turn those kicks they're into more may feel ... and ... he's in games\nI'd be what what can you say I don't\nReally want is for the hell out of me so much about you suck I mean you missed the an easy one by the way she can be criticized even though it is your first extra point Mr ... you'd be criticized because the dean the game or no that doesn't matter\nYou take that someone in the report or pools should go yeah we'll listen you suck okay you miss the way the broad\nJames missed the dog with one second love a down by one you don't think he'd be criticized\nWell I'm I don't think Justin Tucker isn't being criticized drawn out All right just I don't think that even if LeBron does that you have reporters and walk up and say well you're stuck\nSo I don't know what you're doing here in the league right now you miss the gimme a to win the game I mean what do you expect ... as he said you're in this position because you make kicks look at look at Mason Crosby yeah two weeks ago Arnie well yes five field goals five opportunity so\nKicking man it's the most ... thing to try to figure out and here we are probably\nA probably putting everyone asleep talking about taking a little bit too much but that's the story of a day in the NFL amiss kick in Dallas the mist kicked in Baltimore ultimately I think I think it was a nightmare day uh in Tampa for the browns the buccaneers but\nRegardless champions of getting the game when a field goal and it just it's crazy how it works out All right when we come back to the guy go Fox Sports

could lose that getting very easily even though oh issue struggles All right we'll get back to the NFL when we come back to the gecko Fox Sports radio studios but for one final time tonight let's check in with their buddies Steve this egg or to see what we missed out on what's going on in the world of sports what's going on Steve\nGood evening once again you know I read this tweet last night and looked it up and it's true that next Sunday in downtown LA all four major sports could be an action same day\nDay game for the rams day game for the LA kings that staple center then they gave a staple center with the clippers and then the Dodgers World Series game which way way way way way way way way one\nMore time kings playing at home and then they got to turn the ice into basketball and I long\nCorrect that happens all the time on weekends in LA and the ... double checked out to say your ambulance news take and with the Packers jealousy so it's not just for sports for sports in one area of one town on one not it will be a lot of traffic that if there's even a gay I thought\nI was at the kings game or the keys him on Saturday with king sabers and figure out what Brian was a bronze home to be with us ... four or five hours after the game that's where I might as well have been behind us with pitchforks poking at the door [laughter] I haven't seen them pushed you out the door staples in that that quickly that fast\nLewis error the four games from the floor sports next Sunday in downtown LA\nBy all means drive in downtown LA next time I'm sure the roads will be quite free as always in downtown Los Angeles\nLetting you know in advance all the world series games will started about eight pm eastern time on Fox TV beginning with game one at Boston on Tuesday temperature about fifty degrees there they say any rain should end before game one it's the weather will count on in LA next week in temperature in the eighties\nI only know up here today in Vermont\nI don't think the world series being played in Vermont and I go around and I get a new one already Marino to move the angels to too so [laughter]\nWe talked last hour about Drew Brees with this five hundred career touchdown pass one point went over the ravens today\nSo he goes on a list with Peyton Manning Brett Farr and Tom Brady he's also want to live with manning and far he's defeated every NFL team at least once\nA while and Tom Brady has not because those are breeding Quinn pointed out last show Tom Brady has never faced the patriots therefore throw in every other day on that list but good for anyone and a couple of years ago when they get rid of them twenty four twenty three New England what Baltimore because the ravens did score late touchdown but then miss the extra points\nAnd Washington beat Dallas twenty to Seventeen is Dallas missed a fifty two yard field goal attempt on the final play hit the upright\nKansas City is six and wanted one tonight's game over Cincinnati forty five to ten Patrick my home's four touchdown passes\nThe chiefs had over five hundred and fifty yards of off ants in other words about eight yards per play tonight against Cincinnati\nOnline car shopping can be confusing not anymore withdrew price from true car now you can do the exact price you pay for your next cars to visit true car do enjoy it more confidence car buying experience wins for the rams in New England for Carolina and a comeback Tampa Bay in overtime just for NFL a and a\nNBA games after all the NFL talk there was basketball the clippers won the lake came over Houston one Fifteen one twelve\nAnd know Chris Paul and that one starting his two game suspension Russia and ... got a three games for the fight against Houston why they're saying that he did spit yeah it was just saying they use that word the NBA and its release Brandon anger I'm a four game suspension\nSo the clippers win by three and an upset and the clippers on free throws tonight we're twenty six for twenty six and ... game Denver is three and now after beating Golden State one hundred and Ninety eight even those Steph Curry has thirty points that I get the flock to laugh at them at the buzzer Cleveland without LeBron is old and three Atlanta beat him one\nThirty three to one eleven is Ricky tray young at thirty five points and eleven assess Oklahoma City oh and three they did have Russell Westbrook he scored thirty two but Sacramento beat him one thirty one one twenty back\nTo the G ... wow now out of it is it is it ... the clippers though that Blake Griffin anymore when they're twenty ... twenty six and the ... [laughter]\n... Jordan's\nYes master a yet to come up with that one day I'll\nI'll I'll say this much I still I'm Sorry and I will not let my Laker Homer them allow me to believe that regime of that round those spit Chris Paul sorry NBA I completely disagree with that well they're getting all three games because of it right\nWell and then here's a here's the crazy thing about what is it well first of all what does it mean when Geico says just Fifteen minutes good safety Fifteen Percent or more on car insurance well\nIt means you probably should have gone to a guy called ... Fifteen minutes ago we've obviously we're we're in NFL show but there's been so much going on we haven't given the world series the attention that it deserves I'm not a Big Bend will do that coming up next we probably haven't given this suspension the attention that it deserves but think about this army\nUh Carmelo Anthony threw a punch in two thousand and six and was suspended for fifth\nTeen gained yeah yeah I'm In Brandon Ingram of all the things that happen in\nEvery year you have a team that people just assume is going to win at all we have the rams this year in the NFL you kinda I don't I don't know if there was ever a time where people said last year oh it's the Astros\nBut everyone will get on board I don't know if I've ever seen anything more definitive\nIn most people's minds as they feel seem to be and feel about Boston that this is the best Boston Red Sox team we've seen in a while well managed a well prepared a deep decent rotation so\nThey're going to ruin the rotation in disarray that's the problem sale coming back after that illness a price got his first win and I mean his first one in the playoffs as a starter he was only nine up to that within the array of about seven so you kick out of all these been the best started they've had\nThe only thing about the red Sox is the bottom of the light up like Jackie Braley junior and guys like that are starting to head so ah but I still think the Dodgers have better overall so I I liked it they might not even take seven games for the Dodgers\nI Would like that now here's here's a question I have because I'm obviously very biased and I think if I throw that out there you all can accept it\nBut did you have a problem with Joe Buck and John smoked at all with the way that they seem to be skewed towards the greatest pitching staff in the history of mankind in the Milwaukee Brewers and the greatest picture that's ever stepped on a ball diamond before and Josh hater did you seem to have a problem with that or not because I'll be honest\nWith you I don't either talking about bringing them into the the third inning is that what\nYou know no no I used to be a while that was one time when they talk it appeared as if they really like Josh ... like like really really really like Josh ... now I Want to be real clear I have a problem with it I it didn't bother me too bad because I thought how good their bullpen was and how good he was\nYou just got to kind of take it a little bit but there was a faction of Dodger fans it felt like it was a bit over the top\nWhen I was listening about bringing them in the third inning they're like Dodgers will take the ... the rest of the game so let's get his ah two or three innings other the way in and they'll move on from that I I don't I didn't have a big problem with that I don't know why Dodger fans\nWill no no no just in general you you're focusing on one thing this is the anger that had built through the whole series about\nHow they do they get the point about Joe Buck no matter what gave me call and this is Martin this coerce suit this color tie you're pulling for this team you're pulling for that the way you could be neutral one hundred percent anyway\nI dig 'em I thought he and small are great I really didn't and I thought a John ... add an element and has improved every year that he's called baseball so I get it every one wants Thirteen to ... to ... over and I understand it but hey crank down to the TV crank up the radio trolley Steiner all have your back\nA one quick tweet we got two minutes before we get out of here in big big Mauer takes over to get you through and\nThrough your Monday Matt writes I thought this was great we are talking about the browns and what they could do at the head coach in position and there are some rumors out of Cleveland that huge action could be done as soon as maybe today we'll find out we'll see matter rights I think guys like Dorsey go after guys who they have roots with\nDorsey who's the gym and Cleveland ... is an established executive one name I think you guys should watch for is Mike mccarthy what the Packers why appears to be having issues with Aaron Rodgers and who is three million up toward the end of the matter is yeah\nYeah so I I Love that I loved that as a possibility but again you're talking about a guy that won the super bowl has had incredible roots there but every every relationship comes to an end at some point right could we see Mike mccarthy on the move in the off season\nOf course I mean look what's going on in Dallas I mean even at one point Jimi had to go uh you know Barry Switzer had to go Tom what had to go everybody's got to go one time or another they're ...\nI Know we play this game a lot very early in the season much like me looking at playoffs standing after seven of the NFL\nBut you start looking around the league there could be quite a few big time vacancies out there\nAre any upcoming off season and then when you're a fan of a team that is one in five you're already looking out the off season out my goodness wow already whether keep it on the weather up in the Boston area this we rainy for Tuesday get ready for my goodness

Carolinas all like\nA I'm not overly impressed with the Carolina Panthers\nThis was a game Carolina had to win though\nConsidering that we we mentioned this we did Benny versus the penny and you look at the Carolina Panthers and their situation and several Carolina last a look ahead game against the Redskins if you lose the look ahead game you then have to win the game\nBut yet they looked ahead to Philadelphia and lost to the Redskins so now you've got to beat Philadelphia which they did\nBut you can't play a full sixty minutes the blowout win against the giants ... the the NFC ease stinks\nIt sucks I and in Philadelphia has wins against the falcons colds and giants those are there when so far this year those teams are combined five in fourteen\nThat's their record five in fourteen the eagles for losses are against the bucks titans Vikings and Panthers score fourteen eleven and one\nWhich is not all that great either three games above five hundred so I've made the analysis is my theory on this is boring some kind of radical transformation\nThis legal team is destined to end up eight and eight nine and seven seven and nine we call that the Jeff Fisher special they are going to be somewhere in that seven and nine eight and eight nine and seven area which while it could be good enough to win the NFC East because the division blows\nIn the big picture they they don't match up\nAgainst the better teams in the NFC we've seen that they lost the Vikings they lost the Carolina Panthers they play the rams later\nAnd we'll see what happens ... down the line but even in Philadelphia beats the rams in that game which is at the coliseum that's a a a rematch of last year's match you up when Carson when she was injured at the coliseum\nI was there I saw him being carted out on a golf cart up the tunnel at the coliseum in that game last year they don't meet too weak Fifteen the rams could already wrapped up the number one seed by we Fifteen thinking about the other end but the things keep going the way they're going for the rams but wait Fifteen they can be resting players week Fifteen week sixteen weeks Seventeen\nBy that point I usually been matter

you own\nThe Kennedys were on the road\nThe Huck I always play on AM eight hundred ticks icy\nCity hurricanes in earthquake Simon and Carrick Fox News extremely dangerous is how forecasters are describing hurricane Wilma in the Eastern Pacific now almost a category ... storm on track\nIn Cleveland although he was given the opportunity\nBut Jacksonville despite all that they have to start him give him an opportunity to practice with the number one's the start him in London and see how he does it gets to be very questionable Philadelphia Eagles defense\nAnd those cheese steaks and they're not very good that is you you think about the perfect placebo Cody Kessler starting for Jacksonville you would think would be the magic magic formula to get out of the doldrums for the Philadelphia Eagles defensively but they can't play a full game\nThey can have not played a full game they did not play for game here other than the giants just not showing up which is more about the giants than it is about the Philadelphia Eagles\nBut ... the the cast of the another reason you started [noise] that you could\nGet one of those corn ball Disney esque small C feel good for a week or two stories were Kessler plays pretty well\nRight because it gives the arguments men Jacksonville their defense we keep hearing how wonderful their defense isn't that great the defenses and all they need is a game manager and they just have to have someone not turn the ball over to give them an opportunity to win again Kessler did have an interception\nWhich was more about the receiver than it was about him but he did throw the interceptions on his resume in this particular game\nBut the schedule is messed up you don't normally changed quarterbacks going to London\nBut this is a unique set of circumstances it again you keep looking at the Philadelphia secondary where you say hey maybe just maybe we can catch lightning in a bottle if were dug Malone\nIn Jacksonville now though the partying shot on this\nPraise of quarterbacks in the NFL are extremely rare you have a better chance of seeing the Loch ness monster as the second reference to Loch Ness monster on the show than you do have seen a trade starting quarterback in the NFL but if ever\nThere was a team that should flip a quarterback and and you know that John grew is crazy enough and just nuts so to consider\nA Derek car Blake board all swap of starting quarterback\nIf Jacksonville tossed in a draft pick\nIt is something that yeah at least have to consider if you're Jacksonville you ... you know you go out you make a move 'cause you can't go with Cody Kessler more than a couple of weeks and the trade deadlines coming up we're closing in on the straight line in the NFL it's always right around Halloween so if you're going to make a move\nThe clock is ticking the doomsday clock is ticking on Jacksonville and the only plausible quarterback you can get not that there are cars great 'cause he's not but he's better than you have\nWho else is what what other decent quarterback would likely be traded at the deadline\nYou lie manning sucks and the giants they can't trade him 'cause the fans would revolt so they can't get rid of him who else is going to be go through the list a crappy teams and that's who you look to who's going to trade their starting quarterback\nWho is who is it going to be\nYou know there's there's there's no other than the raiders there's no way\nThere's no one\nAnd we should point out that Tom Coughlin any other Jacksonville executives but mainly Tom Coughlin I Do not believe that they were put into a straight jacket enforced the sign Blake borders to contract but they were clearly prisoners of the moment here\nAnd and they were they were seduced\nAnd smitten by the playoff run and they did not look at this objectively\nAnd I'm not talking about hindsight bias we said at the time we talked about what are they doing what are they thinking you're giving ... even though they went halfway but giving him a contract with the pretty much all married to him they they've got to Blake portals tattoo on their ass at least for the next couple of years they can't get that tattoo remove\nSo this was a very predictable pickle that the jags find themselves in the ... again my theory you go with Kessler you hope you find something with shutdown Cody for the next couple of weeks you start him against\nThe Philadelphia Eagles you do that that's the first move you assume that he doesn't vomit all over the field in London\nAnd that you put them out there in that game and you at least get the game manager that Blake portals cannot be and then you reevaluate the eat the Jacksonville jacks have thereby week after the game in London\nAnd then you have Indianapolis at Indianapolis I say winnable game because they they stink so that's a winnable game therefore Jacksonville and and and there were reports of fighting in the locker room and see to me that's embellish\nI pointed this out before I don't have an issue with guys fighting with each other after games 'cause that shows they care and supposedly the locker room door swung open and reporters witness Calais is Campbell holding back\nAnother teammate and apparently the teammate through off the layers Campbell and they were going after each other in the locker room and they were at odds with each other and all that\nI don't have a problem idle because it doesn't that doesn't matter to me it doesn't matter if guys or fight with each other a locker was long as they play well in the game and the issue the issue is portals and he he thinks that the issue is terrible not only is he a quarterback heath sucks and that's the problem [noise]\nAll right let's see if I hear from Blake porous borders you've just been best are you going to Disney World or Disneyland where are you going like morals\nThat's obviously not what you want to hear ...\nAs a quarterback or really the word that goes to save you ... percent enough to watch any of this thing and maybe the guy that they want to fight for half of it was the most\nSome of those when I tried to do\nSo let me ask Roberta Roberta what would you do if the raiders announced we've treated Derek car to\nJacksonville for Blake ... and a second round pick what would you do\nMan I wouldn't be surprised you wouldn't be surprised wouldn't be surprised you're you're being ... them full tank mon you're in the morning all Dodger Ben I'm forgot about football season I really was that a World Series sure you have us right man let me see all of that\nWow you already got a World Series sure that's right [laughter] you didn't waste any time that's not that's not an old last\nYear she oh this year\nI didn't even know they have those out already yeah right here in Studio ... really oh yeah there's an official shirt places packed yes it is\nI Would I Do is I buy the ones off the street men there what I did and you weren't here last year but the are there when I did coup last year I bought a couple of World Series shirts from uh for like ten bucks each time the U.S [laughter] yeah they're pretty good\nAnd I and unlike\nThe rumors that those shirts you know you wash them a couple of times the now you should not by counterfeiters that's illegal you should not do that I buy those awesome but it's a great deal yeah it's a very good deal you just watch them inside out\nThat's a good move yeah yeah I bought a couple and they're still they're holding up then they're not they haven't gone back so anyway ah

Carrick Fox News hurricane gaining strength of Mexico's Pacific coast now nearing a category five with one hundred fifty five miles per hour winds the storm is set to make landfall Tuesday in West central and south western Mexico between mindset lawn and Puerto Vallarta\nReally terrible that is about as bad as it gets and the very unreliable Adrian Peterson who goes really bad game good game bad game good game\nHe had Ninety nine yards in this game which means he'll run for thirty yards in the next Redskins game but he was better\nThat at that press got a you know you didn't get any help from from ... that is fair and Adrian Peterson did help out the Redskins and Alex Smith was mediocre as always\nHe was game manager didn't have an interception but he only had a hundred and Seventy eight yards and we gave the stat last\nWeek I'm Glad we did do you remember one of the questions we had an English ... versus the penny the only quarterback in the NFL that had had just one of his passes drop\nWas Alex Smith now when I was watching the Redskins cowboys game it looked like at least three passes were dropped by Redskins receiver so that's that goes out the window\nBut he's very unremarkable performance by Alex Smith\nAre ... there were several occasions where he missed open receivers in the end zone a and and it just twice the Washington office had to get short fewer goals in the second half despite having first and goal opportunities\nAnd is there anything that sucks more when you're watching a game of you're pulling for a team\nAnd they get down and you have to kick a cheap shot a chip shot cheap field goal at the end and that that happened several times for the Washington Redskins office if you look at you saw the game you know exactly what I'm Talking about but it was ... it was ridiculous\nThe Redskins had a Twenty one and twenty five yard field goal in the in this game\nTwenty one and twenty five yard field goal that you realize the end zones ten yards you'd the balls pushback seven yards so do the math on that that means the ball was it the four yard line when they kicked one of the field goals and at the eight yard line on the other fuel go what do you do\nWhat the hell that all about\nIt's pathetic is what it is\nSo but they still won the game they still won the game but it's come back to the cowboys are this NFC ease is a plotting\nUnremarkable division entire division\nWhich makes Jason Garrett the perfect coach because he seems to be the plotting coach that doesn't really know what he's doing just mediocre as what he is a ... and so let's hear from Jason Garret who is trying to celebrate the positive and not the negative\nBoth defenses play well battled back and forth low scoring game it was going to come down to what it came down to a beneficial at the end of the ball game do you need to do to get yourself back in it and then you have the opportunity kick the game time field on all of them I didn't work out for us\nI Want to be addressed that Prescott giving a touchdown away in the fourth quarter with five minutes to go to the address that I don't know here's another one from Jason Garrett on his idiot kick\nYou know he's done very well obviously chicken of all we're going the right direction you know at the end I think it was fifty three is that correct [noise] you know we've seen to make those kinds of kicks unfortunately to make this one\nYeah All right what's your age your last point you Jerry Jones or has the cowboys in a holding pattern you know when you you fly to a city and there's a lot of congestion and you're you're waiting for\nThe the chance to land you're circling the airport that's essentially what the cowboys are doing they're in a holding pattern there circling around waiting for a runway to land because the NFL has figured out that Prescott we say it was beaten\nDead horse week after week here but just double laborer point even more\nIf you go back to the point of demarcation week nine of last season the cowboys are seven and eight there last Fifteen games with decked Prescott and in those Fifteen games that Prescott even with this game which by his standards was a positive performance for Prescott\nFourteen touchdowns Thirteen interceptions six point six yards per attempt and a quarterback rating over his last eighty games of\nNot only nothing memorable very ... by the cowboys and Prescott singlehandedly is holding back the Dallas often and it continues to be false advertising that Prescott was billed as a headliner\nBy Jerry Jones and he's playing like a supporting actor\nMe take away the ... the cowboys logo and all the bluster of Jerry Jones and it's a very mediocre performer jak Prescott and they figure them out teams to figure them out ideas the bend now their show on Fox\nAs we press on and we'll take your calls eight\nSeven seven Ninety nine on Fox eight seven seven nine nine six six three six and I were also on Twitter\nAt Bain manpower that's at Ben Mather you can be part\nOf the show in the Minnesota Vikings feeling good about it so this is again they could not afford to overlook the New York jets they did not do that\nWas not an over the top great performance by Kurt cousins but the Viking defense twisting around Sam Donaldson three interceptions\nIn this game and was all around miserable and more importantly for the Vikings their defense which has had no real identity shut down and bottled up the jets running game that had been\nThe crime data grandmother jets they're running game and they were unable to matriculate the ball anywhere\nYou know that it loses we can ban who's that Roberta greater than it loses\nWe'll read the novel I don't know I think John growing might have been in Vegas he might have lost a couple of million the blackjack table [laughter] am I lost a couple of bucks\nBut he made it back he made it back so unfortunately that's the goodness what cowboys called up he has a correction did I make them as a cowboy correcting me or you're correcting yourself cowboy\nKnow corrected myself you know I mentioned um\nUh the hundreds for the former big league pitcher a keg leery I botched a giant surely for fifty third grader getting rain or half the farmer growing they are all even rang Marty pattern and that's a big leap third base but Wayne credit chicken so thanks for putting me on

divine the Parker is a receiver although he doesn't play very much is often injured for the Miami Dolphins his age in his someone named genes gold I don't know who that is\nA but I I like him because he said something good that we can use on TALK radio so this agent James goal unloaded on Adam gays the dolphin coach\nAnd it it's one thing for an Asian to call out to coach but this was above and
