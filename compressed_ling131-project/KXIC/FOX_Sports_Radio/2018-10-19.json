then\nPeople start painting murals for LeBron James ... and they start being the face yeah because LeBron is not one over\nA large enough population of Laker fans that will never happen in Cleveland it would never happen in Miami but here in LA it happens\nHe still is not met the media to talk to fans done anything he promised well I'm going to talk at media day becomes a media day and what does he do we talked for eleven minutes eleven minutes so you got to leave him wanting more in a whole crowded situation\nThis is not gone well it's not going smoothly and he's kind of like it\nNo I I like\nIt on a on a larger scale of you know what I'm just going to let the basketball do the talking and whatever TV shows and movies I create with my creative team ear you've heard me speak for Fifteen Years\nWhat do you need to know for me now had plenty of time to do that because like for deals you know in a TV show that he had plenty of time for that but he didn't have any time for basketball for the for the fan what did he needed any fans didn't care surely you care to facing is we all know that's a couple of Kobe doesn't matter it go be\nJokes that are going out there trying

[noise]\n[laughter]\nAnother one [noise]\n[noise]\n\n[laughter]\nGot off on me\nChris Weber's ripping off it was close getting ready to go out that I like that like that moment when he called time out and said hey I got\nYou saw the reaction on social media the reaction where suddenly LeBron James became the number one trending topics were the red Sox are clinch in the world series or to go to the world series and we have a Thursday Night Football game and the electricity that came through the television\nTold you okay and told me LeBron's a Laker now now this is the moment he's now a Laker\nBut just a number of people that decided to flip on their phones and record the introduction in Portland\nAnd this isn't a staple center hey let's wait to hear the home crowd this was he's on the road first game as a Laker and\nMy timeline was inundated with every I could probably put together a full three sixty of videos from every section in that place that appeared on my timeline of LeBron James introduction and the crowd's reaction in each section\nBut that's the whole thing is that you can't quantify a moment like that\nYou can say okay once again it's one of those things that happens or doesn't happen and it organically I think you could say after that\nYou know yeah the guy's a lake or an outer layer your ... and we watch the game and he's extremely involved and engaged with his teammates where we expected\nBut this was this was a moment where it was okay\nNow he's a Laker does not going to be\nWhen you get some in first place not going to be when he gets rid of the play offs and he's a Laker now and now I feel like the season can begin and I'm I'm ... I didn't know it was going to be the first game when was it going to be if they start out six and six is it going to be ... got to be fired and everybody's blaming LeBron James and we're covering up everything when it comes to murals and pictures of billboards from abroad\nKnow it'd be it'd be came and it happened in the first three minutes of the first game well you know there's\nJust some degree here in Los Angeles has got me if the guy go studios that there there is a percentage that wants to see that early season struggled seeing exactly what happens how quickly do they record on

evolves what Luke Waltons fate is all of that you know the question of what to address in as coach Luke whatever you know based on their\nTheir ... same draft class I mean the same age so you you look at the way this roles and in as much as we've always said hey\nThe NBA season doesn't start 'til Christmas well it's it's different animal when you're talking about LeBron James coming to a market like Los Angeles hungry to get back on top after a couple of last year's and all the organizational turmoil and all the last thing\nThat was done at the front office and the bus family and everything that's going on that you're looking to rebuild and reclaim your ways\nIn the NBA and yet there's a little bit of the schadenfreude that people wanting to see LeBron James struggle perhaps even fail Gary Wright say it and getting out of the gate and then losing game on will give people a thousand words and\nA couple of minutes on TV to start doing just that\nTwitter at how about a fresco Mike

fourth interview for a director of operation it was overwhelming running again today and being yellow it puts on the job I can hit from Allison ... thought what really connected with me when I'm passionate about something a logical this operation\nMix the temple more up tempo because ... going to be running things as they come in he comes in for re John Ron do it's a different team Lorenzo and LeBron maybe better when they're not on the court as much together and you saw tonight Alonzo ball came into the game when LeBron comes out for the first time\nBecause the ball leads to we said this many times the ball needs to go through what brought lawns all ball will lose his effectiveness because he's the guy that needs the ball most of the time to be effective but\nBut bronze going to be the one grabbing the rebounds take it up court and starting a break or getting up he needs the ball in his hands so he can do what he does best and that's either\nHit it hit a fade away get to the ram make a big pass he needs the ball lawns though is not going to have the bold enough to affect the game so he's maybe better suited coming off the bench but this is certainly a unit that can push the tempo and score points and not only be hey the second unit comes in we're not just\nYou know playing at an even zero sum but we're adding to our lead this is going to be a huge\nFactor for the Lakers as a season gets on you already have abroad and Brennan increments going to have I have a big year you got called well pope I think he's going to have a big here too they have enough you should be thinking top of the western conference western conference finals that the ceiling and what realistic expectations are for the Lakers oh he talked about it\nA a bunch of coming into the preseason yeah the warriors you have the rockets last year and then you had three through nine three through ten essentially the same thirty five when Los Angeles Lakers team got deeper it's it's a curious mix to just start but they'll find the roles and and as we said LeBron James'\nCoach GM whatever role you want to ascribe to him eventually he's got a shovel up and deal the guys he doesn't think fit and you're not going to see this twelve and if the man run a isn't going to be together that long especially if he sees where there's obvious\nNeed for improvement so when we look at the the western conference overall you're looking at all just leap frog a bunch of those teams just by adding LeBron James and that seems fairly a certain to occur I Am looking at Minnesota wondering with Jimmy Butler how long\nWhile he's on the court and they didn't make the train right you'd think you'd figure out a way to make that happen before we talk to a rigid we talked\nTo our guide crumb butler and even ... like your show up for work until you're working someplace else\nAnd right and that's what he did he came out and he he played a good game uh they got lost but I think they're good and they were a number four seed last year had he not gotten hurt so looking for more of the same\nOut of them are and then you you mentioned the pelican so I Would put them in that you know top for top five

winning tonight and they'll await the winner of the Dodgers and the brewers Dodgers can punch their tickets with the wind tomorrow night game six in Milwaukee\nWhat kind of role to Joel West and is overturned home run for Roosevelt do they play in the Astros defeat\nWe said last night it was more about getting the call right than it was about did the Astros lose the game because of it this was not a whole run in the ninth inning that was taken away that would have tied the game this is the home run in the first\nInning it would have been a different game even if you want to add those two runs to the Astros total the game is still tied going the extra ... well yeah I mean you don't know how it's going to turn out that she\nDid it even in the ebb and flow they had the lead after five\nRight so just to hold up and doing your job if one more hit with a lead one fewer mistake covering second base as you go to turn a double play the hair correll with the neighborhood yeah play and they don't get the call and then you end up walking around there seven five there's another run\nIt would've been a different game that's that would have been to not to say the Astros one but it would have been a different game when you lose the series four games to one there's a reason why you lose that because the other team played and was better\nThan you the red Sox it better the red Sox pitch better the red Sox bullpen was better they were better in every phase of the game than the Astros were certainly if the Astros have won the game would've been close yeah but you're saying but if they had one more game if you if the other one for games they wouldn't want to feel about that\nWhen the red Sox won for this wasn't for three the home team wins every one and it comes down to ...\nKnow this was the red Sox win in a dominant\nFashion and their bullpen was terrific for all the things you want to say yes Joe West helped yes David Price was phenomenal tonight the first time you've ever patrolling the playoffs he's gonna play Fortnite for like three straight days can be so excited\nBut the red Sox bullpen which I never thought would pitch this will\nShut down the Yankees shut down the Astros two teams that tattoo the baseball that I did not see coming in that you got to give them the nod for pitching as well as they did everything was great Red Sox they deserve to when they were the best team in baseball this year the actors are the defending champions but the red Sox were a little bit better\nThe shows you how hard it is to repeat in major league baseball because the Astros come off the world series there's no hanging over there is no enough and then with a hundred and three games right they go through the Indians like a ... knife or butter\nAnd they lose here because a couple of ... which way plays they don't make in the red Sox do Korea doesn't get the second base Ben intend to make that catch in the outfield I mean they made more plays than the Astros at the big which way place\nThey made him they deserved to win the actress you can be mad at Joe West I'm not saying don't do not be mad because he blew that cold he was arrogant about it 'cause that's your job West is but you didn't lose the series because of job do you\nGet a catch ... that was a according to all the advance stats and all those metrics that they run was a Twenty one percent probability that he makes that catch\nIt the way the the ball was falling he dies and makes a tremendous play at a book and what was an odd game would that that's the one thing we can say about these plants that a lot of games where you you finish them to go All right what did I just see\nOne twenty eight one Nineteen I think the blazers now beating the Lakers won sixteen and a rope Seventeen and wrote what Broncos for twenty six twelve rebounds six justice and the steel but they shoot just seven for\nThirty from three point range that's much better than the first twenty that they put up yeah well it's funny I missed the have you do a sample size of that final and they were on fire\nNow here's the thing about the Lakers is that look as we said you should think they can finish high second in the west western conference finals they can do that because the western conference nobody got better in the off season and you had the best player in the game to attend to one thirty five games yeah OK you can do that\nBut the number one thing they're going to you know I have no doubt that they'll hit their threes but they need a shooter do you need someone who can step up and be somebody besides liberal on who can hit a shot their athletic dig it up and down the floor but\nWho's going to hit those shots swag if he was volunteering and he's right here I mean by that I'm right here eventually deleted accuse people were parading in yeah because he was saying he would just shoot a thousand times it would have been on though at the end of the mix wow what\nThey need it as like a J J rhetoric that's the type of player they needed to bringing in the off season that's the one thing they're going to struggle at but if they find somebody if suddenly who's gonna start sending shots like that or they\nThey are going to be a lot to handle very early I fully expect them to go like six and six and then start to lock things down defensively the second year that starts to play better when they get on the field together when they go to the court together they did not play great tonight they\nGave up the lead right away when LeBron came out of the game yeah they ... yeah I can take them to be like ... and they take off but they get a shooter and they will almost be unstoppable but that's the big thing either they're going to find what on the roster or they need to go figure out how do we go get\nSome a Gmail abroad is going to be hard at work here over these first couple of weeks evaluating all those teammates and and actually get out with the front office

then that's breaking ball right isn't that the show is it is\n[laughter]\nI think it was trying to figure out how to ask you as you so I think it's got to be [noise] that's got to be that's gotta be fastball 'cause you can't just have one class because once she got to go [noise] that's fast ball and then if you're if you're the only one here let's go [noise] [noise] that's breaking ball [laughter] [noise] I Want to get into mind the Astros the astro away do things the right way\n[laughter]\nSo so now the\nYes it is over we get officially said every one set with me now come on everyone now the Houston Astros imposter is that's right the Houston Astros are frauds that's what he wanders mill even nearly a is what [laughter]\nThat's great [noise] ah man if they weren't investors they would not be Warren Buffett they would be Bernie made office would it would be\nThat's who they say okay this is not time test it over the years living the same house you\nKnow how to brass get when you first made some money no no this is Bernie made off living a luxury condo in Manhattan and then realizing wait a minute what happened the Ponzi scheme is over [laughter]\nThey're people thought at one point Bernie Madoff was the wall street tycoon right and then it was revealed he was a phony\nThis and the Astros cheated in game seven last year they've been accused and I think it's based on the circumstantial evidence more likely than not that the Astros were doctoring baseball's here and running the tape eleven and oh in the post season they were going to go [laughter]\n[noise] ah I Love it they were loaded into a fall state of of comfort because of the misleading regular season we pointed out where the only show on radio that did this at the Astros really we're not that great against the better teams in baseball they ... they had a a worst record than the red Sox against teams above five hundred\nAnd their dominance was greatly exaggerated now that swagger that bluster that the Astros carried that\nThey had was was essentially brow beating out of the pie by the red Sox I think I'm Molly ... the last four games the Astros and this confirms what we all anticipated along the way or that\nThe the Astros though the whole way this was built together\nThe foundation was not secure I don't know how they're going to recover\nFrom this I mean they've been exposed now they've got stay calm them brag men out to a Springer\nThese ... I go on with ... is\nAmazing how bad they looked after they were exposed for their their evil ways that's a likely will likely over for the astronaut they will see him in the playoffs next year I think they're done missed the postseason next\nSeason how 'bout that yeah Berlin and didn't look that good did he know what's going on there couldn't get enough spin\nOn the baseball or something like that may be possible yeah see Ben our show on Fox will take your phone calls have you like to be part we have\nRyan who did not think that monologue needed any sound a rise in for Cooper who we also have a Ralph those in for ... the and then we've got Roberta shows\nSo that's the the cast of characters we got some sound than\nWe do am I supposed to guess what it is how I should I guess what it what am I suppose the gas you want me to guess what it is I guess what it is\nI mean I mean I'm a psychic I might miss clear why I'm a distant relative and those numbers but that works for baseball previews in NFL predictions who's next hour Benny versus the penny that's right we are doing Benny versus the pen and there's still time of\nYour way and jokes have you want to do that for our number three uh we're still submitting jokes you can still send them in care of the ... show it's been matters show at Gmail dot com if you like to be part that's been our show a Gmail dot com is rough not hearing and then I ...\nI don't know ... me up you know wow right\nAway while low blow the goal you know I mean who use you introduce me and I was an adult I said hello right then you write on something like a person around relatively fair\nWhen you're even when you're here you're not\nReally up you know you're here but just following your lead their chief\nOr is that your is that your big comeback Ralph is a\nMess not very impressive\nAs I said just following your lead\nTo better than that I think right yes you can\nDo your your humble guy\nGot bad bad bad bad bad bad yeah bad bad bad\nThere were some tell you what are some other things that are not as good as advertised the Astros right the Astros were billed as this wonderful team that was going to go Lebanon no clue that was false advertising they were hyped up there were publicized as as wonderful team\nDoes it got to kind of weird that band that ever since they got caught or they lost will do it three games in a row that come up for\nA long hot or ... or ... I mean I I I'm remembering the major league vessel report saying what they did I I'm trying to remember exactly what they did wrong\nYes rhythmic clapping they had a guy and in fact I'm Glad you brought that up\nI'm going to remember what major league baseball penalties this week and the only one I can think of is for a punk you kicked a player or in the ankle\nPart restaurant here's what I Want you to route 'cause I Know you're not that bright don't keep up on the news so I Want you to go to my Twitter feed there's a photo here and it shows the guy in the act this weasel this a slime ball for the Astros he's one of the Tonys for the owner and he's in an illegal area and he's doing the deed\nLet me check ... no they didn't know that that's all good\nI don't need the commission did it tell me what's illegal I'm all I Know the right you want to make it up moving it up Ralph again fabric\nHoliday [noise] I that's fast\nBall and then [noise] breaking ball bam done\nWhen you get rid of that suddenly the Astros get out scored by Fifteen runs over four games shocking some Mazie how that happened I mean it's just a coincidence uh-huh it's just a coincidence yeah\nJust one so the Astros have off season to approve a you know trying to come up with a new technique to cheat next year she would they come up with what kind of arithmetic clapping or\nYeah well they were on trial Clinton said ... let's see who won the series oh a guy who last year was coaching where oh with the stress right 'cause he was he is that what do you go to a yeah exactly he was the only real you know I tried off he exposed them and it was actually pose\nThat he knew how to cheat a gal Dodger last year right who scored more lawyers who scored the most runs in the world I just don't know how to get

even be Thirty years old I don't know if he remembers the dodge I'm not talking about right and that's a red herring I Know you like Ryan you want to talk about Ryan you like as you know his Kendal look we're not talking about\nWhy we're talking about twenty seven of the world series\nWhich is one of the great injustice in my lifetime we need someone to Neal for that I think someone should Neal during the anthem because of the twenty Seventeen World Series that's what I Believe rough\nIf that's what you want to do it and go right ahead yes what I wanted to rough clearly\nWhat are you on the Astros payroll ...\nNo I'm just keeping an older residents of sanity here\nSay that there's a photographic evidence it would be like if you have video of OJ chopping off those to people's heads back in the day there's there's a picture of it\nTo me [laughter]\nThere's no debate there there's there's no ... they're not they're looking at it right in front of me and your question in just the commissioner\nIs just because I can I use it or who is who is in charge of all this what is it what is your definition of a thorough\nInvestigation Ralph because the the Mueller investigation has been going on for like two years this lasted less than five days is that a thorough investigation\nHow do you know he's really in Europe years for all intents and purposes\nOr this person's says why are you arguing with his ... bag right now question ban\nOr no type request to win the world series no time for a question of who's going to win the world student who's in the world series yet uh let's

to eighty one more or do I talk about Ben eighty one more just like the basketball season starts in Christmas Day I flipped over just to see the end of it\nIs good [laughter] you know the clippers and Lakers at the same record you know that\nThat was going to suck probably [laughter] well that's probably true but but uh that's\nWhat brought I I think he's right they did not need outside shooting new it's good it's like a throwback to weigh the Lakers are going to play this year outside shooting is so out of style now no one's taking three point shots nobody\nNo seriously\nNo no no you don't need outside shooting it's perfectly acceptable to shoot twenty three percent from three portrayed in a modern NBA that's you know when you were a lot of games\nA lot of it is probably not\nHow's that now we heard off season that Lorenzo balls shot was much better how's that going\nI think he went five for five today from three point line no that was on your video game you want five the all the real game he was too of seven\nWhich\nYou know I don't think that is I don't think that's good I using mathematical that's twenty eight percent [laughter]\nHow the clippers doing that\nAre doing great they've got the bull by the biggest star in the NBA ... I've got wonderful that's right we love him [laughter] I'd rather pay to see both bonding with Brian James\nBoth on it's like an old school freak show at the circus I Love that guy\nThe fact you have like these ... you see the highlights I say I actually had the guy didn't he was yes dunk he's just a dog but there were two nugget players these two guys built like a dinosaur that were running and jumping trying to stop bull by states there and he looked like it looks like it\nOr you know the summertime you go to a barbecue like a family barbecue and there's like a forty year old playing against like a an eight year old and the other players the eight year olds and then in the yeah\nAll right any what's he been out of the show on Fox with any paranoid Bruce crew and got a bunch of people lined up here in the phones is well run through some of them and eight seven seven Ninety nine on Fox from like I go Fox Sports radio studios but right now\n[noise] Ralph [noise]\nThank you very much ban and it was quite a night for the Boston Red Sox\nSassy is a fine here's the patch the strains that has won in the air to\nFor the wall fucking hand that\nRed Sox Red Sox radio network for the call is Boston would win the American league championship series four to one over Houston they take the series four games to one next up we'll be World Series game number one again side of the Dodgers\nWere the brewers weeks after the NFL season kicked off with gender hammering Arizona forty five to ten five cardinals turnovers in that game three games in the NBA including were brawn James\nLater how do they probably one ever Brian James they can't lose\nWeight when I got a welcome to the western conference with one Twenty one Nineteen lost at Portland how can they literally just how could they lose all brawn James\nLeBron James for Brian James doesn't play well against the western conference call we know they play the east though wrong they play the eastern conference each play two games against these but the problem might be on vacation by then or maybe it'll be over the Warner Brothers lot because they might be working on a project still have a he'll have a\nForm of some sort shall we say that you have the Warner Brothers flu or maybe they have to shoot that movie the er whose face jam to or whatever that yeah yes okay online car shopping can be confusing not any more mature price from true car now you know the exact phrase you'll pay for your NASCAR so it was a true car to enjoy more confident car buying experience to other games\nYou in the NBA Philadelphia one twenty seven one white women over Chicago and Kelly Olympics put back in the last second lifted Miami passed Washington one Thirteen one twelve\nBut some things even more important\nTo [noise]\nGet received\nA notification in my linked in today yeah there today is Ben Miller Eighteen years\nReally here at Fox Sports radio I it might be wrong and it's been eight seniors were that's what I got today\nNow there are [noise]\nIt would be Nineteen years but they got rid of me [noise] [noise] but there you\nGo head to celebrate that\nGreatly actually Ralf in working with great people like yourself is why I keep\nComing vials having their problems on the road I'm ... Kansas City fighting for the American league central the White Sox there in Texas\nOn this Labor Day and the rangers have spread out so\nRefreshing I've decided to put on my friend function dive right in the me now [laughter]\nYou know clearly not the highlights gradually ... do all rise and the rangers are fighting [laughter] nobody wants\nTo [noise] find that for that I'm sure I Would if I go watch [noise] we'll give you a nice gold watch right [noise]\nWith ... with us a holiday party [noise]\nOh that's from they used to have him back in the day though yeah it'll be an appetizer or something like that I got rid of them now\nYou got those little hotdog the dog's gonna you know it was hot dogs and they got those I was going to the phones ... an hour show on Fox before we knew that the record I Want to mention the Milwaukee Brewers the most paranoid team in baseball now the brewers\nWho I think the game will stop at every moment Craig council has to come out in ...\nAnd so now the the ... I think that the Dodgers have figured out the signs of their catcher and\nSo they are they're freaking out there having a temper tantrum they're whining to Ken Rosenthal\nIs what they're doing a and they're complaining\nThat the Dodgers know the science from the sequences and the players and the the difference between this though on the plane because I Know you're a hypocrite no the difference between this is it's not some guy in a suit who's holding something some device it's good players like they believe that many Machado when he was standing at second base that\nHe began to there was leaning emotion by Machado with Chris Taylor and that that was a sign that\nIs not illegal right that's not illegal when you have a guy in a in a skinny suit or any restricted area and he is relaying stuff using video equipment daddy's illegal\nSo here's what the Dodgers I Do ... I got it all figured okay we tell you what the Dodgers do tonight when they get runners on base which won't be very often I guess the brewers they should make all of these gyrations and fish the brewer pitchers will\nLose their mind right they should be leaning back and forth arms here hands their fingers everywhere that's where they ought to be\nDoing it will mess that the brewers are already fragile team they're already mentally weak team the Milwaukee Brewers I that's that's the reality and can you imagine these these mental midgets what's gonna happen\nTo the recovery is going to talk to the umpire about this you know to allow play in the second any probably oh yeah it'll come out there you\nKnow mental toughness the brewers this off the steam out to the Milwaukee Brewers budget crybaby do exactly\nEvery one of those guys about to have a nervous breakdown because at Dodger leaned over [laughter] let's go now to Houston the belly of the beach oh yarn their morning\nNo that's not Chris Chris didn't call and he's done he's a he's very disastrous stuff but we go to Houston now and transgender Dave is on Fox Sports radio hello transgender Dave\nOh you're a member what I promised to do if the Astros fail the when the world series\nAnd more now back to the guy told Fox Sports radio studios and knowledge and wisdom and even prevent mallard\nMoney you got to listen to other people working at the point that out of the guy we're gonna have the\nNFL pick a in a moment we'll have that real quick I Want to say it will not pay off the who am I getting blind willy are you there blind will be my guy blind Willie\nWas a man a long time know her from and where are you\n...

operating off the coast of the Philippines\nAnd it comes from a family of wealth and one of the reasons NFL teams often look for players that don't have a lot of money is because those players aren't going to go off and do something else they're going to keep playing football they're not going to be dragged away from the game what Rosen doesn't really need the NFL\nI Would argue the NFL doesn't really need just rose in the way he played in the Thursday night game but that's my arm I somehow may give it a ten percent chance\nBecause think about the football life the cardinals aren't irrelevant franchise now they're back to the way they used to be back in the olden days they stink out loud the roster blows there there are bad football the\nNo one pays attention they can be off the grid Rosen's not going to like it a lot of fun and you\nThink about where he's at ... am I going to want to keep going through this especially if he doesn't get better they just go off and do something else he doesn't\nNeed this if you don't need it and you've got enough money why would you keep doing it I didn't go off and do something else that's what I think he's gonna end up doing now the last ... wall bronco\nFans feel pretty good how are you a thirty five point when that's pretty that's pretty neat\nThis is a bad when I tell you why I I got something to say about the Bronx why is this a bad bad with misleading to misleading right Arizona didn't show up\nDo you think that now Vance Joseph is a good coach after those last for losses that Vance Joseph is figured things out\nAnd that the [noise] fortunate\nSo what's gonna happen here is people say well they won by thirty five points of view there you go they rallied around their coach Vance Joseph he's having the time of his life I heard Joe Buck used that line at one point during the game he really is I mean the time of his life\nBut the the understanding was it just it was going to be fired if the cardinals and won this game but\nBecause Rosen gave the game away Vance Joseph continued to get to stay of execution delaying the inevitable that delaying the inevitable and so you look at this at some point all coaches end up getting decapitated it happens or to everyone but\nThe Broncos have Kansas City again that's in arrowhead next week\nThey've got that they've got the Texans and then they've got the by\nSo he gets Joseph a stay of execution but really it's a short term stay because\nI've done the calculation on this and should the Broncos lose well they're gonna lose the Kansas City so it really comes down to a home game with the Texans\nAnd those are two teams they're the ones that good so if the Broncos win against the taxes that could be another stay of execution but if you're looking for the date that Vance Joseph could be fired the next day I'm going to go with November fourth after the game with taxes\nThat's a son that's what I'm going to go but it's a bad one because it gives people the false sense of belief that Vance Joseph now knows what he's doing all this year though before we a press on here let's hear from some of the participants here I mentioned the cardinals and we thought about how messed up that team was poorly coach\nMIke McCoy the officer coordinator who I\nThink it was playing video games all week when he was supposed to be game planning for the Broncos are here is Steve Wilkes talking about he's the head coach you but they don't learn his name because he won't be there long here is the Wilkes talking about the issues the cardinals had another car does this say they have issues\n[noise] uh what would be saying kind of like ... likes to eat you know that's that's a bit of an understatement that's a bit of an understatement the Arizona Cardinals find themselves now after this game with a one in six records so Steve we'll see what the hell happened\nGot to find ways to get this thing corrected yeah wrecked assume Ferris guys going to ask you about changes that's premature no it's not about any changes right now no everybody's going to be evaluated across the board yeah as I said before we got to find ways to get this thing moving the right direction not acceptable our finances are better\nYeah so you'd be resigning as kosher the F ... premature it's not\nYou know for the seven people that care about the Arizona Cardinals it's not premature for that solid fan base of seven they would like human flesh they would like a pound of human flesh we can start with the officer Porter MIke McCoy and will he have a\nJob will MIke McCoy have a job ... let's see here chances that Mike records survive is what ... what do we even know if he gets like they wouldn't even know if he got rid of my record the office of coordinator\nLike who would replace it they just promote someone else what a mess that is wow\nHey there was supposed to suck and they've lived up to the hype let's hear from Josh Rosen Josh Rosen you just went out there and vomited all over the field what do you have to save yourself\nThey drafted me to do it so I'm gonna try other coming back I lost quite a couple of games so hopefully we'll try to go a week by week find the first one

News\nIt's going to be an election of the caravan you know what I'm Talking about resident\nTelling him onto a campaign rally last night the thousands of Hondurans marching through Central America toward the U.S our political pond\nWhat else are we going to work towards to not only because of\nTheir profits [noise]\nYou know what that sounded like to me [noise] that sounded like a man that knows he made a mistake that that sounded like the [noise] the ... for what am I what am I done [noise]\nWhat have I mean at least I get to hang out at Warner Brothers but one of my done here well Brian James debut a loss in Portland was blank I've got the fleeting and flawed\nI've got those two things I first of all it's the fighting because of the amount of hype not I don't watch too much television these there's other than games uh other than ... not that I'm Better than you put the I married I and I have a job and I work a lot so that those kinda things cut down on the TV and I\nKnow\nBack in my old days I used to watch eight hours of television the day or whatever but I'm On the Internet a lot I think that's what I but I go to the gym they have these shows and sometimes they have the morning talk shows the talking heads doing the breaking down and I've seen more coverage of LeBron James how great the Lakers going to be this that\nBlah blah blah blah blah blah blah so this ... it's one game right one out of eighty two and LeBron James talked about instant oatmeal or whatever that it is a buzz\nKill right it's also a bit miffed busting because the believe is LeBron James can walk into any team we've heard this how many times from the LeBron James fan boys it think he's a God and they treat him like a God there you go to any team in the NBA and this team would make the playoffs and they'd be great and all that\nIs far from a guarantee that this lake your team is a playoff team is far from a a guilty and think about what that would do to the legacy LeBron James\nHe would be a myth busting if LeBron James can't even get to the playoffs in a western Congress it would also be confirmation that all of those cheap shots that were taken it upon James over the years has said he's a product of the eastern conference he couldn't do it in the in the west those would also be verified\nSo it's it's obviously way early but\nYou start thinking about that and I I heard the brown I somebody sounded like a scared man he says try to deflect and all that China I every time the process anything there's so many fan boys right next to laugh at every\nWhat Brian could make a statement about Adolf Hitler and the media would laugh history to replay that soundbite again listen to this listen to the media is reaction forget what branch says listen to the media fan boys that covered the Lakers and listen to their reaction as was\nNot as fast as you guys [laughter]\nIs not a ton of her you know so it's not that fast the types of oh what can we get to where you\nGo your eyes and those guys are so [noise]\nWhat else are we going to work towards to know the best we can get a big profit\nFor\nRoss sounded like he's like the closest ... and get the hell out of the Lakers that's what he sounded like to me\nWas that movie magic [noise] now my theory here is\nThis this is a flawed blueprint or what do you need to win in the modern NBA you need a mix but you need a lot of outside shoot\nYou got to keep up with the Joneses or in this case the curies and the Thompson the splash brothers and all they've got the reins in Oakland\nAnd there's there's no way outside of an out of body cosmic experience that this roster can get that done it's a flawed Ross and if you look at the western conference food chain the Portland TrailBlazers while they technically had the third best record\nThe western conference last year they were like one game a away from being like this seven seed west there it was all jammed up\nThere was a bottleneck in the western conference\nAnd so you you say the Lakers if it takes them let's say half the season to get going they're very they're very they're done by saying about instant oatmeal but if it takes them a half a season to kind of get the old engine going by the time they've gotta going\nThat's it you're you're done I mean you\nGet along gym in the west and you know some of these guys on this Laker roster are going to mail it in\nYou know that they've got reputations for doing that shut out your veil muggy shot outweigh Stephen ... this is why these guys have bounced around the end he played get to the man that yeah okay how's he going to play a game number thirty six he doesn't play good you sure about that guaranteed positive\nPositive positive a hundred percent a hundred percent\nSo in the fourth quarter of this game\nIt was at one point ... number one but it gives you an idea of the margins are so so thin right margins are so so thin\nIn these NBA games and in the fourth quarter Portland out scored the Lakers by seven\nPoints in the fourth quarter said LeBron James had three turnovers in the fourth quarter he had more turnovers than the entire blazers team had\nIn the fourth report only turned the ball over one time which tells you what tells you Lakers aren't playing very good\nDefense it tells you that and the Portland TrailBlazers were ten of pen from the foul and they got to get a lot of the points in the foul line and the Lakers could not stop Damien Willard and CJ McCollum ... with the trailblazers there twenty points to gather in the fourth quarter\nAnd LeBron James had eight in the fourth quarter the Lakers always struggle up important in looking my main report\nOn these Chinese coming up with every defense technique you can come up with what else you got game one game on how you doing game one always lose in Portland what else\nWhat else you got ... and make the play offs to relax I'm fine I got\nBull by I'm Glad you're fascinated by the Lakers are fascinated by the longest bringing a lake or ... you can wear it\nI'm ...
