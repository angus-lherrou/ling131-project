Francisco set up a game winning drive led by Aaron Rodgers and a forest again money can't buy this guy for me [laughter]\nRight now and they called us they need that to shake things up whether it's shuffling the light up when the cases I mean he can't hit for the there's the there's the biggest problem and it could come up with every solution in the book there are still standing there with their bats on their shoulders\nWith big pitches in big situations time and time again frozen by the brewers bull but except for Jeffers him they seem to seem to feel OK about\nJust enough to make things dangerous now and then most dodge dove alternate\nThat's the Dodgers strategy right now what\nAre they getting a ... threat they gotta get 'em in right you've got to have been right down and write as much as he's worried about hater he's excited age do you look we got to ride it out we'll get to Jeffers\nEventually yeah and that's the other thing they're they're playing from behind and every one of these games right and know poorly\nNeither did I. ... they're not getting the brewery started which is the big thing they're not getting to them\nBut you're not you're not putting runners on you're not able to chase them early just seen gets into the six today\nAnd you don't really have much in the way of threats to where you you're chasing them early so the bullpen is going by their normal\nMechanics going through their mobile paces and and you're playing catch up in the seventh eighth and ninth inning each game of this series you can only go to the well so many times before it comes up dry\nAnd we saw it happen again tonight\nSpeaking of Craig council the guy has no concerts he met the media few moments ago let's hear from the brewers manager\n[laughter] yeah I mean I think I'm looking at least was just outstanding tonight I'm named made big pitches the the\nThe strike out the ground all was a it was a huge pitch 'em and he is you know the last um [noise] let's see uh four times we'd given on the ball it it's just been a big time performance um each and every page and every time so [noise]\nYou know our our our guys uh that are that were given the ball to the start of the game they're they're doing a heck of a job man and they are um they're setting the tone really for games they're they're putting us in a good position\nThey're putting us in a a very advantageous position to use our guys in the bullpen um and that's going to lead to wins\nOn the second World War or what you're getting for starter ... and very\nJust a question on that when you guys make decisions on their starting pitching does it come in\nYou and your pitching coach how in in your organization to do this [noise] um\nYeah I did a ... conversation with a deeds Derrick Johnson are pitching coach with with David our general manager and [noise] and um we we kind of lay out we laid out some scenarios kind of going into today's game what a what the possibilities were for tomorrow [noise]\nAnd um you know we were if\n\nWe lose the rest of shaping area was she was always going to be the guy and the fourth wrote Tim when you go up by four in the seventh was there any thought to trying to stay away from Jeffress or hate her tonight [noise]\nYeah I I think [noise] you know there certainly was a\nThought [noise] um you know I I just\nI think really it's at some point you know the other team's pretty good and you respect their hair as any other team and I thought um [noise]\nYou know getting getting Peterson in Muncie out of the game and then for for pinch hitters with Josh was was a good way to get out um you know Josh the limited work tonight\nI'm JJ finished that off so we feel like we're in really good shape Corey got five adults and Nineteen pitches which is is important for us [noise] um\nSo what we feel like we know we're trying to win the series we're not just trying to win games here we're trying to win the series and uh we've put herself in good shape a kind of pre games foreign five I feel like with tonight's up or\nStaying aback Raasch a correct just straight from the back of the room just with with Pedro going so such a limited a limited time what's his availability for tomorrow [noise]\nUm you know always check on it and see how he feels and everything but obviously the part of taking them out of the game was um to have them available for for games foreign five if\nWe need in Sacramento Valley I'm Craig Lewis the when you when it came out to talk to the umpires after McDonald's first slide into second what was that\nWas just an ... I I I wanted to see what Jim saw on the sly there sometimes [noise] um\nI think especially is particular on that play you can get some um the umpire can kind of let you know what he sees in the play and I can kind of guy knew as to whether um what the what the guys in New York will think as well\nUm so I'm a big thing was that he said or Leno didn't try to make a throw on that plane that as a factor in and whether they will um [noise] you know use they well they were considered an illegal side if if the guy is an attempt to finish the devil\nEyes there's great counsel as you hear geo Gonzales is going to start tomorrow in game for for the Milwaukee Brewers and and honestly you know that's that's a bigger thing forget about the bullpen for a second I forget about the but we spend a lot of time talking to the bullpen with the Dodgers they're preoccupied but this is just as big a deal\nThey have to make hay against the starting pitchers I this is they have not come out with a big enough sense of urgency and so far Milwaukee starters and they're all not great this is geo Gonzales this is Julie ... and this is way my mother banjo guys they have combined to pitch Thirteen innings\nAnd have given up five or six six and one run\nIn Thirteen innings the Dodgers have to get to the starting pitching for at least a couple of runs because when you get to the brewers bullpen and you haven't given up and run well\nThat's a huge advance obviously you're talking about well of course when you score runs what you're supposed to score runs against their starting pitchers it's supposed to be harder against the bullpen you weren't giving the brewers the series you should be coming through against the starting pitchers but they're not\nAnd I look he can Hernandez said we don't have a lot of energy this did you have to come out with a bigger sense of urgency and that's what the Dodgers are not doing and and tonight there was a bit of well Walker Beeler was pitching well\nHe battled the bases loaded and and to ask the third any case the third inning he strikes out he backs again in the fifth inning with a runner a second and one out and the Dodgers down to run he strikes out\nNow you do that to keep the game because you think he's going to give you a zero through the until the seventh rape thing but then he gives up are running the sex and if you run home in the seventh and now suddenly boy that backfires you just I Need to see more aggressiveness out of the Dodgers tomorrow I Need that because that's what they are going to do that so they are going to win\nTwitter out how about a fresco Mike rolling down the Jason Smith show with my best friend\nMy comment coming up next the big night for Aaron Rodgers what's the big take away we got it for you

not really turned to the sideline yeah we got wild up one morning I got one\nBecause what happens if he gets hit what happened to me and they don't have any time outside he gets it they they they run around it's either got a new idea really what was the ... and the niners did know at that point okay this has to be a quick play where they throw a fade so they were on it but still how many teams would go I mean no no no no no we weren't we let's take the field All right um do a trick would have picked a field goal\nBut right now that we're gonna we're not one more like All right let's run one

Hernandez says this following the game tonight that you know yeah we didn't play well but you know the fans they weren't that good either\n... you've got a woman and today it was just was in our day we had no energy stadium and no energy defense in order to do so overall is a pretty big game for\nEverybody that call themselves Dodgers off the\nTop count on it if you will\nDefend fault because they're not cheering now that's not the only that he went on to double down and say look we feed off each other this is what it's all about\nMe while ... who was had a horrendous ... with ... errors three strike after night he got booed all night long\nAt one point fans are chanting we want often as the\nFans want an awesome foreigners to come in for Mardi Gras doll and Hernandez had to weigh in on that as well\nHe said it sucks there's nothing going on in the stands since the first anyone brought it that double the stadiums kind of quiet for the rest of the evening and it sucks they got loud just to show up the money he's trying his best catchers have a lot going on\nWhat about ... he was asked about his past balls and wild pitches nice of you know honestly it's\nReally affecting you guys and driving you guys nuts more than it's driving me\nNumber one okay the Dodgers are close to a meltdown number too serious with these comments that this is you're going to spend all this time your frustration and you're going to take on the fans because of the fans were louder you would have gone\nBetter than old for ten with runners at scoring position really that's what he can hear now there's a saying we feed off you guys all luckily kept the fans quiet or you know somebody would have hit a double with a runner at second and third I mean really this is what he's this wasn't what I mean the Dodgers are close the melting down 'cause they're blaming the fans\nDoubling down tonight for whatever reason I guess it's contagious as energy can be from the fans to the players it was for players to\nI though well ...\nI made the hulk Hogan reference earlier memory be getting beaten down and all of a sudden the crowd and get all fired up and eat hulk out and then he kick ass and finish the match\nIs that would get her ... I Can't do it without you really want to give a speech before the next pitch as you're standing currently over six\nWith a couple of strike outs in this in this series and he's not done his job at the plate and limited opportunity and obviously ... dollars head of the the double that he had an idea that horrible series at the plate ... ... and and behind the plate and get it it's not an easy job blocking the ball or whatever but\nCertainly the you've got to internalize a little more than just fighting back on the ...\nOh yeah I mean look if it's if you want to say we didn't play well and it's on us and this is something that obviously we need to change for tomorrow I get it\nAnd I get the point of hey we want the fans to be loud but then just say hey\nAh offensively like defensively no not so much\nSo there's there's still enough holes but so long is number twelve under there you're going to put up ... points you got to have an opportunity and now comes down to ... years and you saw the trust and faith in Mason Crosby and he delivered in a big way so do I buy them\nNo I think I hold them for a little while the strike price I Need to see go up a little bit more before I buy\nNot buying them the ... the NFL is the most mediocre that it's been there just okay you\nKnow you add all but that's the beauty but in the end but even find out what I'm Talking about she's patriot betcha it in the NFL\nBut even the rams are given a points right in the defense has not been and there's some injuries but the defense hasn't been all that it was cracked up to be ... and you got a lot of still question marks for other teams right we watch Kurt cousins we watched that often fly around the defense is still struggling\nYeah this week didn't count but [laughter] but in general I mean they they haven't been world leaders and and you can find obvious flaws with pretty much every other team held look at the bears that you thought their their defense when you got to be all everything in a record a second they make ... swallow look like\nHe's Joe Montana standing back they're usually he looks like Joe Montana\nAnd ... which is not a bad thing I mean story or what if I were going to make it by an honorary October Fifteen or accept these a cubs fan so I wouldn't get along but the the fact is that you you're looking at every one of those teams that you're like wow I Can't get in you know maybe there's still a problem\nNo levy on bell he said he was going to report or as\nThe Steelers now he is not coming in today they have a by coming up they gotta practice next couple of days then they're off until Monday look I never bought lady on bell coming in\nFor the ... we talked about this because if you were going to come in why wouldn't you come in when you announced it why do you have to wait until the by week that makes no sense he said I'm ready to play why wouldn't you come in practice and be ready to go you can be it could have been ready to go for this week ready to go earlier but he says two and a half weeks ago and coming in during the\nDuring the ... that makes no sense so ... it's one of those when lady on his actually in in practicing then I'll believe it but\nThis is more just politics stuff yeah I'm going to come in here was he trying to push for a trade what\nI Believe it when I said\nWell just as we talked about with Adam cap one earlier in the show you got all the teammates that he'd been in communication with that suddenly he is\nHe's absent he there there is a boy there's no tax there is no calls coming as your wedding is actually going to be there people were doing a minute by minute count down a meetings and availability today oh no ... and so\nIt's a big question mark ... it's a nice consolation prize they've seen you found in James Carter who's a hell of a back as a writer and a receiver out of the backfield he's been a\nHuge jumpstart or to dissolve fence and and creates havoc down field for them as well so I I think there'll be just fine in the interim and playing the waiting game\nMean on the waiting game sucks luckily I'm actually done I just put that on a tea and you knocked it out\nOr do you believe the Oakland Raiders shopping I'm Ari Cooper and other players apparently it's a raider tear down that is on the way Jake lazy reporting this I agree with that simply from this perspective John Gurdon wins fans and buy some self time by\nHaving a big sell off and trading players by the deadline because\nThis is a mess they have one witness against the browns and overtime and almost shouldn't have gotten that one\nSo how does he by himself another year of goodwill you're not going anywhere obviously got a hundred million dollar contract but you know what no I Know this is the team that won the AFC was

on Fox Sports radio the Dodgers would have better luck\nIf they put a trash can behind home plate and it had the pitchers throw into the trash can there would be less pass balls if that happens [laughter] that would be a more efficient use of team resources then putting grand all behind the plate\nHe makes me want to ... watching him play catch her at this point\nIs an eyesore he must be corrected it has to be corrected and the fact that Austin Barnes who is a marginal player in his own right let's not get carried away Austin bonds is nothing to get excited about and post on Instagram however as long as he just merely catches the ball\nHe will be a dramatic improvement over grand dog and as long as he doesn't strike out every other at bat he will be an offensive improvement over grand all behind the plate\nAnd if the Dodgers do not have the balls to remove ... from the roster they should at least forcing him to get him Roy DHS from sitting on the bench and watching Austin Barnes play\nI only in an emergency situation should grand they'll be removed from the bench and we have seen this if you're an old timer you remember some of the history of baseball and the ... players that have had they call the gifts\nBut typically it involves throwing not just catching [laughter] this is bizarre I I don't recall this I Know I I'm I'm getting up there I guess I remember

catcher ... incident but he couldn't his problems he couldn't throw the ball back to the mounted this weird kind of pick up and his guinea up but I don't ever recall maybe yeah there there have been a case of a guy just can't\nCatch ... that he eats the name of the physician is catcher and he's having problems catching you know what do you\nDo he should be banished from the roster and if not just don't play that's the growing up thing to do that to the final word here the Dodgers are the mortality but that alone is not going to win the brewers are are a feisty bunch\nAnd the Dodgers have to get the old smelling salts going here and we'll see I I did as I say I pick the Dodgers insects and as you know I'm a distant relative of the great Nostradamus we go way back to my DNA\nUh and so I'm sticking with the Dodgers in six inch but should they continue this the collapse then heads will will roll of the the Milwaukee Brewers play a side show freak show style baseball they have bullpen neurosis they suffer from\nAnd it's a good bolted but you know the ... not supposed to be something you look forward to going to you should only do that when the starting pitcher failed on this

changes he doesn't it sure does your does yeah I'll take your calls a lot to talk\nAbout here obviously I was focused on the baseball game but I did have any I did have the Packer forty niner game up

for thirty minutes of that game out played the Green Bay Packers for the middle part of that game forty niners with the better team at ... feel they\nAre real quick and we know the Packers are the team in the state of Wisconsin the great state of Wisconsin yeah ... but you know the brewers are also involved there where do you think the attention of the ... of Wisconsin islands were focused

number eight seven seven\nNine nine six six thirty six and I were going through our ports and on Twitter at ...\nA whole lot chutzpah and a whole lot of explaining to do well get to that and we will do it next\nHow the\nThe\nFor teams to buy the MLD\nBoth Fox Sports radio\nBut neither here even if you're a big time basketball fan there might be a few facts about the game you don't know like did you know that the first groups were actually peach baskets whether they warned basketball is bouncy than a cold one or the players can run as much as four miles during a game with another fact\nYou don't want to get behind on quite a lot a lot of baseball\nAnd that's how I Wish I Wish I had to you as a parent time when I made in my mind that well I Know it's wonderful you like the greatest paradox he's a terrible he did a terrible thing but I'm Wondering why the terrible thing I got to the fence for I mean Mike during this time\nOkay the people don't want to think we should be really really upset with all that foreign office ... for not but we need to bart situation when we got down on on forty second worst second and third\nWhere we can work and and specially when they're playing in the show they're giving us a pay ...\nWith us and talk to his wife upon a time if you watch you watch the Dodgers all your how often did\nThey button right you can count you know you can count on one hand the times they bought it I just read any time there's a reason they don't but but that's why they don't ... and I were to one of my favorite stories\nI've told this before but many years ago when I was covering the angels and Terry ... was the manager and this is a long time ago 'cause he's man is like a bunch of team says that but I asked uh we we asked her why he didn't want\nA and he proceeded to go down the angels line up and explain how this guy doesn't know how to but that got hit by it was hilarious if it was it was just wonderful yeah nobody\nKnows how to find any more that's\nAnd that they they don't need\nMore more in wells much sugar morning well she was one of the greatest pointers of all time but what they're giving him if they're on the shift and they're giving you for\nI Know you know and you know what I Want to go they don't want to tell you\nI'm telling you they ... they ... they\nLove you don't watch it when it comes to body at all to do with just lay that but there's nobody in that area it's it's an interesting I think\nIf you don't even know if you hit the ball the ... billion that's better than a bullet though that's the that's their argument I tell you I got to go do something\nYou can call anytime you're free\nWill not use that kind of gays or if it's a defense all oh I've got that's a lot of votes but we get to that it's on my list will get there and more your phone calls years we yeah the night away burning the midnight all quite them into us it depends where you are\nOn the west coast is not quite but for everybody else has to be way after but way way past we get to all that and\nThe most punishable face in baseball so I my list is well we'll do all that right\nNow though any Garcia from the studios is going to make this really quick because you've got one put out the door Eddie Garcia we start with posts\nIs it baseball game three National League championship series and the brewers shut off the Dodgers in LA for nothing Ryan Braun RBI double in the first while pitch school in ... and she has been a cheater before yes in Orlando are seeing whether to run home or not I haven't been there is all plenty of run support for joining these just seen who went five and a bird\nNo runs three has been for relievers when three and two thirds endings are shown on baseball long just two heads\nLA do load the bases and then I Would run does your struck out against Jeremy Jeffries typical Minnesota the tying run the place that clean humor took them on the runway\nAnd Milwaukee now leads the best of seven series two games to one game for coming up on Tuesday in LA nine eastern on up as one of the there'd be square and Monday Night football the Packers had a rally in the fourth quarter to beat the forty niners low ... thirty in the final Mason Crosby was\nHorrific last week for for for on field goals including a twenty seven you order as time expired I could have made a twenty seven you're probably not I would have Aaron Rodgers to touchdown passes to divide the Adams in the ... three two and one with a victory\nAnd San Francisco dropping to one and find an area code somewhere in the last he might be my gun especially from the Sesame Street and a three to one\nMiserable brought you about your car my car shopping can be confusing but not any more with the price of fuel car now you can do the exact price you pay for your next car so\nIt's a true ... joined more confident the car buying an experience been sad news is Paul Allen the owner of the Seattle Seahawks and for all your way out his heritage away at the age of sixty five due to complications from non Hodgkin's lymphoma\nOne of those stories that I was talking to somebody ah my buddy ... about this we're like you know you have all the money in the world just assume if you're a poor person you assume if you're rich person you get cancer you have enough money that you can you can beat him or he had the best or yeah it'll yeah the turnstile\nThe Microsoft cofounder had on this Iraq since Ninety seven of course he was ordered the team when they when they're only Super Bowl title had on the trail blazers since eighty eight also was the co owner of the Seattle ... in major league soccer so obviously a big presence in the sports world in the Pacific northwest again Paul Allen passing away at the age of sixty five\nAll right ah condos is there it is the Ben Matlock show on Fox we continue on from the guy go Fox Sports radio studios Fifteen minutes could save you Fifteen Percent or more on your car insurance just visit Geico dot com for a free\nRape quote so all you have to do so let's go to the audio tape that we have this ... Hernandez soundbite I think we is that the one we have there are no do we we have that's the one right we don't we have that\nThat's not ... oh 'cause that's his real name is in ... right that they call them ...\nI'm not a Dodger fan but I don't know these things are a lot\nAbout this is this I Believe this is the soundbite that is going to make TK her name is public enemy number one guaranteed to get booze or for the rest of the post season here here's what he had to say following a lifeless gutless performance ... by the Dodgers\nPlay I'll see you got to want it and today was it just was in our day we had no energy stadium and no energy defense in order to do so overall is a pretty big game for\nEverybody that call themselves Dodgers\n[laughter]\nOn a huge man\nWhat were they supposed to cheer for every time you struck out with the runners in scoring position that guy is ... is breaking batting average man are bitch in in ... total climate show when he went in to pitch their in Philadelphia\nAnd uh yeah so ... maybe ... ... what was the follow up question like what were the fans supposed to do when the Dodgers were motionless on the field where they support what we're supposed to do that\nOh what did you want to see somebody run on the field maybe I Would feel more life and the Dodger players showed\nOn the field so that is the car do send though we're kicking your name is dead is he did the thing you cannot do you can rip your teammates you can rip\nThe media you can rip management you can rip ownership but the one thing you cannot\nDo is a tax the fan\nAttacked the fed especially if you think about that this start time\nUh in in LA people had to leave most people I think have normal jobs not like you know overnight radio gas bags and they have to like leave their jobs\nCome up with some kind of excuse and then deal with the worst traffic in the world in Los Angeles at least in America\nAnd get that to Dodger Stadium and people did that and the stadium was almost all the way forward started the game and yet he has the B ... kick in and this again this is kicking in is after the Dodgers plenty boring monotonous game\nSpirit list baseball a runner leadership and this is what he says\n... you got one today it was it just wasn't our day we had no energy stadium had no energy the fence in order to overthrow the pretty name for\nEverybody that call themselves Dodgers\nExcept nobody in the crowd struck out with runners in scoring position not a single praying do no man woman or child and the crowd struck out with a runner's Lewis is used for having no energy\nHe says bet that is just bad bad bad bad bad bad bad\nI just I've been out of the show on Fox just keep it going to go to Adam who is in Southern California on Fox Sports radio hello Adam you're on Fox\nOh yeah I bet uh\nRegarding ground I think you hit the nail on the head you make it sound like a good point aside from the fact that he didn't do it number one and number two on the field is number three is all over the field and so I just don't understand I thought for sure when the bases recused from the Knight\nPenchant for him I mean obviously not handling high pressure situation whatsoever\nAnd I think Robert ... single handedly I mean you know what\nWhat's that other than what the parts okay you know yeah we're not time to change your identity and do that but\nYou know it's kinda like in basketball when somebody wants to when they're not ... shot and you know you got to try and you gotta get get gotta get free throw line this fall and then the other thing happened let's get one run on the board let's get a lot of fun let's do something different and you know what if we miss\nThis quest once or twice what's the name of the famous Willie strike out anyway I mean it's just so ridiculous to watch but I Do have faith that they're going to come back up but I Do agree with you yeah money's got it right\nAll right I think you add them yeah I think the word you're looking for is multi faceted you have to be able to do more than just one thing and if you only do one thing and then you don't do that one thing or then you are terrible but to be you know be perfectly honest the Dodgers had punted and it didn't work you would have been why were you doing is\nThat's not who they are how dare you and as much as I Want to roast they Roberts we should also mention the front office they're the ones\nThat I Believe have much influence on who actually playing for the Dodgers and who doesn't play they're the ones that type all the information that there's super computer and the spits out who's supposed to play\nFrom Ed in Spokane any do you have an answer yes the answer is John struck John struck a find find gas incorrect do [noise]\nAnd Matthew has a mad and receive that has Blake ... milkman Mike you went with a travel agent you know the correct answer none other than Josh Rosen of the cardinals has passed a rating on\nTwenty five point by which is a good scoring average in the NBA\nBut not when you're looking for\nOn third down Josh Allen is next on the bad list followed by Ryan tannahill of your Miami Dolphins let's go to ... in San Diego's next room\nWhat's up man how you doing man welcome\n... we don't have much time when he got for me\nAnd I got two things first thing I heard the fans and clear to me is when they were very for the catcher and also calling from ... barn soldier category\nYeah they were chanting for Austin Barnes I did there was they were ... brand dog with Austin bars name I liked it a try\nSo he can't complain about that and second thing I got a good boss man unlike other clowns that get mad when you talk about their two young men about your team sucked\nThat I'm writing background exactly I was saying when they suck when they blow I Will now sit on the air absolutely correct\nThat's right that's right and like their\nZach you'd have this guy golden ticket you know what\nDo you get to go out of that I get a\nGood job bank you will recall anytime\nA Anthony in Pasadena is next real quick and then we have to get through this NHL ... last day and he's going on a a a long vacation what's going on it today\nBecause I think so\nUm\nI I think what I needed to get in line up and never played the oh I think I\nReally\nCan't get any more bread dough and oh yeah I think that like I\nDidn't like it it's bad but the ... the ... the problem is that the Dodgers are trying to their reactive to what the brewers are doing rather than just leaving their guy then they'd been it\nThere's more and the games in Milwaukee but the brewers use these open games and so the Dodgers end up they start their ... and they bring in that they bring in the starters and so there I\nDon't understand why you know make it out get out\nAnd you don't have time I mean I I don't I think\nAnd if your guest analytical at your violating the law of the analytics were you the data's says you go with the guys that

what I was a witness to watching this particular game that the last\nWord on this the Packers are now on the by week which means they tropical\nVacation and they have a gargantuan match you up and we said against the team the team the only team in the NFL\nI ask you a question do you know the answer the only team in the national football league that has yet\nAnd you name the team that has yet to lose a game and the end of the raiders\nNah I think you can ram it all day and\nYou can write out on ... on the\nRams thank you very much and that's at the coliseum pit of ... their\nLos Angeles no chance Green Bay will lose that game that's a loss loss loss loss loss loss for the Green Bay Packers\nThey're not on the same level the rams and on the same level as soon as you look at the NFC that I have Green Bay on my second line not my first line I don't have Green Bay on my first line I have the Packers as a second tier contender in the NFC they got some\nWork to do work to do I how about the lack of void\nA a a you know in other states bomb like this just gives you happen to win this game this and you avoided the demoralizing loss does not mean that you should celebrate with cake and

lot of mistakes and you can look and he needs to be cleaned up that has to be addressed\nBut he he's God compared to Nathan Peter ...\nShe's probably pop Warner football they're better than they've been but at least there's something to work with with CJ bath or not that the niners are going to be any more than a top ten pick team in the NFL that's already been\nWas pretty much been submitted at this point the niners play the rams the rams are eight ten and a half point favorite in that game and that's another game as you look at that game you say well divisional game\nI haven't even handicap the game but I Would lean toward staking the niners plus the pen and a half\nThe rams the last couple of weeks if not covered as road favorites that's their third road game and early didn't cover in Seattle they didn't cover in Denver they won both those games that appears to be another game where the niners will be able to hang around on a short weak and they'll lose their one in five now there'll be one in six after that\nSo but ... again maybe he's a poor man's she'd you bet there's like a a a poor man is a ... he can be a poor man's\nAmish rife I that's how I can be a backup

that's it they're like why am I off this late boy this radio sucks late at night I Wish I was on during the day stuff like that thinking about the choices they made in life yeah yeah\nSo Jason waiting now did you watch the Monday Night game indeed\nI watched more but then I thought I was going to I I thought oh you know focus on the baseball and I was just kind of flip over during the commercials and see what's going on with a football game and then I found myself actually being more interested in the football game which is not the way I thought it was going to\nDo you notice when the baseball game wasn't competitive that's why you\nYeah I Know well I think that was going to be the case\nSo Jason waiting or who you're talking is not his friend or English as a second language ... not at all

for relievers goodbye for three and two thirds shutout innings along just two hits\nThe Dodgers did load the bases and the night with Brian does your struck out with the tying run at the plate bases are are you with looking against the Jeremy Jeffress Walker viewer took the last seven innings for runs on five is Milwaukee now we've said this is really what you look for a few games to one during a

submission hole without dad\nWould he have been able to win if it was just a you have to fight each other with your hands and all that I always\nEnd McGregor\nYou know he he I still can miss it ultimately what's going to happen is team McGregor is going to end up circling back around and fight may whether again\nI maintain that now\nThe story has changed the fact that McGregor last year and the value go down shirt goes down a little bit so it's changed the narrative is changed but ultimately if may weather's going to go back into a fight and em eh main guy he's going to go fight McGregor 'cause there's more money in it then how beep\nJust the reality\nAnd again this will be a bigger share of it happened it would be a bigger sham a Habib against McGregor then may weather versus um McGregor I Would just give me a little chance of it I mean now the\nThe last particular point now Mayweather is trying again should get a fight you know work out big paid I and he also wants to do the least amount of work\nHe wants to sure thing if you fight a washed up many pack yeah you know you're going to get a lot of ... to pay for the fight you know when the fight no concern there McGregor nose or that he he can get another big payday he's got this deal with in Hawaii but if he wants another massive pay day you got to go to may what\nRight McGregor may wit and may whether I how would he be 'cause there's only one way\nThat may weather can be convinced the fight ... you know what is\nVladimir ... and has to enter into this he's got a lot of buddies who are Russian oligarchs 'cause she's a Russian oligarch and if ... ... there's so much money in in mother Russia and if ... you can get these people together\nAnd they throw up enough gold bars at Floyd Mayweather me why they would fight in Moscow he doesn't care uh you know you go to Moscow and\nFight if there's enough gold bars on the table and it doesn't matter at that point whether or not he horns ... people to pay for the fight if there's bankrolling sugar daddies that bank roll to fight the Russian oligarchs who step in\nBut any fight between a professional boxer and an amateur UFC fighter who's not a trained boxer is going to be a cat and mouse situation it would be the same thing and I give them they were the credit\nBecause may weather pulled off the cod right the con and that fight against macgregor was hey let me just stand there and let\nMcGregor do whatever he wants for the first four or five rounds and then after that I'll Fox and the fight will be over and that'll be so exactly what at\nThe same thing
