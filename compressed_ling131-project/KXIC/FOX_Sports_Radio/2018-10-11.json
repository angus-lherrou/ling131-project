Beasley launch those Stevenson adjacent heart that's a really good second unit\nThat's one of those like wow these guys could gel like the raptors and suddenly they put out there so I could eat it last year they blow teams away if this turns out to be their second unit oh my God would they be really really good\nThis is why I say the Lakers can finished second in the west and they should finished second and they should lose the wars in the western conference finals 'cause they're just not quite there yet at\nThat level but what would be funny about it is with that ... what what do we say about the wars all last year they didn't have the death particularly\nIn in the middle in with the big men so come second unit you might have a distinct advantage that and since LeBron's cyborg he can still play forty eight at night\nYeah yeah I mean they'll they'll cut it down a little bit for him in the beginning because they don't want to do it to him right away I got a buddy actually that's always going to be but for lunch or ball he's realizes and all of our bowl realizes now that boy are they really don't need me anymore\nUh okay that was pretty boy\nThat was that was fantastic ... land I don't I don't mean that does stop your train of thought there but that was the most spectacular miss dunk we've seen in a while it was a big mess done all the lights here and the guy go Fox Sports radio studios that are not blinding me\nBut for long so\nIf I can finish now I cannot okay so where is it is now is he's\nHe realizes that he is on his last chance as bill plastic you said when he joined us earlier in the show this is a three or four months audition can LeBron play with law and so I have no doubt the beginning of the year the next couple of months LeBron is going to be very\nWelcoming to Alonzo ball let's you know we can do all the giving advice all these things because the one thing LeBron doesn't want to do is he never wants to be seen as being a bad team may being a bad guy says you everything he can to help Lorenzo ball knowing full well if it does it work\nHe's easily tradable easily and horrible knows that if I say one thing that turns out to be wrong that could be at that can be you know what I'm done with them I'm done with his dad I'm moving on because LeBron already doesn't like him\nFor the war of words they got into last year when the brunt of the say keep my kids' names out of your mouth when he was talking about why his kid isn't as good as ... better\nAnd so that that's the that's where they sit right now it's a it's a last chance time for Lorenzo ball he's gone from I'm the savior of this team to now he could be gone and what do we tell you\nAll last year launch those time with the Lakers is going to be short because all of our and lawn so will burn it out they will burn out it's time to the lake or say you know what we're done and now especially\nThat timeline has been sped up because getting LeBron James he doesn't need Alonzo ball threatening him passes he's going to be the guy starting the break he'll be okay with Ron do continue is called well pumping the starting lineup and ... really is it's going to be a case where if he gets traded\nBy the deadline if they realize you need a shooter we need something else I'm not going to be surprised at all about trading I thought it might be one more year after this but this could actually happen during the year so I could actually be early on my production of ... onto getting traded\nYeah and it has nothing to do it anybody spouting their mouth off it just\nMerely basketball needs you\nGot a team that needs the second score and they could be bland and anger could be ... and those could be the guys that you're leaning on the backup LeBron James when he takes it so we know that ... not pets we know that we know we you know the comparisons to Jason Kidd a year ago that that's asked\nWhether he gets that court division and can consistently put up those kind of numbers that's fine but\nTen eight and eight that's great but that's that transcended and it's certainly not going to get them to that next level where you're building a team\nAround ... ball so if he shows at all there's still plenty of teams that need guards that can use a young player of his ilk still on the rookie deal and you can bring in another shooting or another defensive stop or whatever the case may be so yeah it's a short audition and\nIt's more just how he fits into the off chance than anything else\nLakers it's a final beat the warriors one twenty three one

juniors antics over the course of the uh opening game of weak sixth against the eagles so excited for that I Can't wait that's all we need is oh backing beat an old Allen Barclay odds going to be awesome awesome tomorrow night\nBut the one thing you can say about the NFL through five weeks is that it is not been this mediocre\nIn years\nAnd everybody likes the idea of parity because you had your team can be involved but hey the jets or two and three I Love the fact we're a game out of first place after these despite the fact they played like ask for three weeks in a row [noise] hey I'm okay with that I work at it there too and\nHey hope is an okay thing isn't it when we always argue ... metal ... that was the other and we always say it's a day you never ... thing you are always a dangerous thing guy you're young maybe I'm flipping the script maybe maybe I'm going to find time are you really what are you really sure\nYou could have set up there either so of all the teams in the NFL\nThe only two that you really believe in now that don't have problems or the chief in the rams oh you can look at every team and say oh God yeah the chiefs defense can be a little bit of a problem but\nThe cheese and the rams are five and no and they are steaming towards home field advantage in the playoffs and likely going to the super bowl that's how good they are everybody else has problems yeah\nYou want to think that the patriots they're getting it now but they still show dad problems a couple of weeks ago if you have an injury to a wide receiver they're going to have trouble scoring points\nA desert is still out jak jaguars ultimately look like they could be good but they've missed a couple of times the same ... we thought they are going to just kill everybody but they had really struggled week one of the game they they shouldn't have there's a couple of teams you could say All right maybe but usually\nBy five weeks there six or eight teams we know already they're going to be really good we always in years past it's been we know we know that the patriots were really good we know the Steelers are going to be really good we know that the sea hawks or do we know the Packers are good we do the\nAll up and down we know at least six or eight teams the they're on their way to being good\nThere's nobody like that now even teams that are foreign one people aren't buying no one's buying the bangles no one's buying the dolphins at three into they all have issues it's a\nBut because the NFL is mediocre yes somebody's going to win the AFC North because somebody's got to win it but you can we did at nine and seven you know the Bengals ... we don't know if the Steelers are any good they're struggling all these teams the NFL the overall product is mediocre there's two teams right now\nThat don't have problems that number normally is greater despite the fact the NFL wants to push teams\nTo have everybody be eight ... we can everybody's in it and all exciting ratings are up and nobody is is tuning out on their local team and weak eleven because you know they're four and seven so that's what the NFL wants but that's really the reality of it now is that the reason we're at\nIs the games the teams there mediocre\nI nobody ... you saw what the jets were able to do this past week and it reinforced that the big way no you're you're looking at ratings are up right everybody's excited you're seeing a lot of games coming down to the wire we get overtime games each week you've got ... up almost nine point four percent\nOver last year in terms of white rate when you're looking at the penalties being called and and just the rules\nTailor made for the officer gets people excited now with records mediocrity parity ... everybody pushes the word parity I hate it\nUh and I agree mediocrity but you know what everybody's got punched his chance\nAt any given Sunday we don't we're not going to have an old when are we could still have an outlet\n[laughter] we're

audio we don't have any photos but I was able to watch the interview and they have a saying when you read body language for the face the eyes or the window to the so\nIt's an old saying you've probably heard that over the years maybe your mom told you your grandma your answer your uncle or maybe nobody told you but I watched\nThis and I noticed Jimmy Butler often looking down okay that's what I Know what does that tell the eyes were looking down at several ... what does that mean\nGenerally speaking downcast eyes are a sign of deception or lie\nYeah go back and look I wasn't always looking down but he was kind enough he was holding linking the NBA fan and a lot of them bought it they loved it they want\nMore and more and more and more and more and again I like Jimmy but I Want

the show\nYeah your body former big week after the Lenny ... to buy a New Jersey grand jury might guy nails\nThird degree charges a possession of cocaine possession of methamphetamine and making terrorist threats this stems from a ... incident in which ... was a\nIn a confrontation with the pooper driver and now we were ... held a gun to his head ... said that was through that he was the spirit of his wife because the Hoover driver was trying to kidnap him now but we never found a weapon but he did find the drugs and ... you know he's up to ten years in prison if\nThey did see I can

okay but he is he still won\nLike he got a job as soon as he still on probation or ... when he got out of jail you got to be good for a while don't you usually that's how that work\nYeah you got to be aware of that is how it works yeah I don't I don't know if he's still on probation or not but what I Would think that uh yeah he's still a required to check in with people every now and then my\nTheory is that this is not a big deal I'll tell you why because he was offered a plea deal by the authorities there and he chose not to take\nWell he does make great decision like ... that's the result MFL or those that\nAre uh I'll I'll never forget when Lenny first got arrested we were doing the story and his estranged brother and he was his brother called up\nAnd was blown away by he was leaving the ducks playoff game and he was like shocked by it and he wanted to talk about it and he found out from our show because he's a strange like when he was I guess at that time I don't know if he's made up but he was a separated from his his relatives there are these the the ... an hour show on Fox on Fox is we press on\nAnd an honor of Jimmy Buffett everyone loves lists people love ways\nSo we we have to give you all is not the the Jimmy Butler practice saga which some are saying is one of the great practice stories of our time I disagree I Do not have the Jimmy butler\nPractice story in my ... my practice yeah exactly these are these are things that I recall happening in my lifetime that I I remember talking about on the radio\nBut I Know one that just popped in my head immediately\nOkay I'll give you my heart you can tell me maybe one side of the number seven on my list number seven seven no top ten we're going to go top said like I can only thinking about doing this\nParker was playing for Cleveland and he asked to be excused from practice the Cavaliers were terrible at this time this was before they got LeBron James he asked to be excused from practice because he had he had to look at some real estate and and\nUh it's it's not wondering we should've been trees yeah I mean listen when you\nWhen the houses on the market it's nice you have to look at it right away that's number seven number [laughter] this is one of the great stories of all time Andrew buying them I think he was with Cleveland also we might have been with the Sixers he got thrown out of practice you remember this story\nHe got suspended because he was so ... he was such a ... every time he got the ball in practice\nEvery time he touched the ball he shot even when he was in mid court if they pass laws like the half court line he would shoot every time he touched the ball he shot that that's a a legendary story from Andrew buying them\nNumber five on that's number six number five happened was it last year the year before the tortilla soup you remember the tortilla soup\nWhen we brush my memory JR Smith toss the bullet Porto yeah so they shifted the cabs assistant coach that's a wonderful story a number four also involves\nSmokes Parker he was playing for the liars two of my top seven ... uh Kobe Bryant el supposedly got in ... park his face and told him he was the worst and never to talk to them again\n[laughter]\n... motion and went to an apartment to look real estate and all that but uh that's number was that number\nNumber for a number three\nThe famous jail blazers brawl you remember the jail blazers of core yeah could forget and the legend is and this is a story that has been passed down that Zach Randolph\nGot into such a dust up with Ruben Patterson that they he actually hit out at a teammates house because he was convinced that Ruben Patterson and some of his friends were going to come with guns\nAnd damage to Zach Randall so that's number three\nNumber two also involves guns Gilbert Arenas engine forest Clinton then who's now in jail for a killing getting into a gambling disagreement with the Washington\nWizards and a gun was pulled a\nGun was pulled in the wizards locker room that's pretty good right practice after practice that's wonderful and the number one I don't know how you could top number one ... spring will choking out dating her the mole\nOr that I mean that's just tremendous and that was pre social media imagine if we had social media and means and all that stuff wow that was good and I miss anything any is there any other\nProbably the only the only one I remember was a football practice in numbers Steven Davis the running back for the Redskins got beaten up by whom was a\nBill Roman now scale Roman asking beat somebody up it was is that ...\nWestbrook wide receiver\nTrying to remember that one yeah well he he hurt him so bad and Steven Davis ... couldn't play and then of course Westbrook was suspended beating up his teammate and so a Redskins wants to start or ... or for that we skate because the fighting oh God I'm sure it was very important whatever was\nA woman money usually those two things one

these leagues are not going to get the money plus you have to go state by state it's a big nightmare to go state by state that has gambling\nSo what's gonna happen is these leagues in America are going to lobby politicians they're going to try to get legislation a national governing body to oversee sports wage ring and then take a cut of the money off of that\nSo it will be a donnybrook
