to sell the positive for the opposition after the game\nYou know they've been playing that all your yard you know we haven't gotten it out you know the conditions but\n\nI'm I'm going to give Brady the benefit of the doubt that he said that the bills I must say defense was playing well all year because the bills let's see here there last game against the colds they lost thirty seven to five\nThey lost early in the year to the ravens when they had everyone healthy forty seven to three they played Green Bay and got a shutout twenty two to nothing\nSo that they'd been playing well all year\n[laughter]\nSee that's Brady knowing that many people are just dumb and they're idiots and they whatever he says or whatever you say Mr Brady okay oh we'll we'll just keep going through the motions there that's the way to do it anyway see the ... of the other thing that caught my attention eating is\nThe morning if you will because we'll pretend It's MORNING everywhere even on the west coast it's not but a morning of the trade deadline in the NFL we got trade act we add frayed gossip\nAnd much of it centering around the New England patriots all day Monday if you follow the ebb and flow\nOf NFL chatter\nThere was much discussion about Joshua Gordon who was not supposed to start he was supposed to be limited in action that he was going to be disciplined\nFor his party this at patriot practice big scandal brewing in Fox borough is this the beginning of the end of Josh Gordon so every two bit NFL insider had a scoop like a big nice school book chocolate chip ice cream\nAnd they were all laying it out here I Josh Gordon had done this wrong and he had done that wrong\nAnd he wasn't going to start the game he was going to play very much and ballot check was going to send him a message and send him a message he did not only did Gordon start the game he played in Nineteen twenty snaps the first two series of the game you talk about discipline\nYou talk about sending a message\nThat that is the way to go for the patriots that's a good job by ballot jak\nOutstanding out say so then they asked spell check after the game is a coach you there were these reports all day that\nGordon head screwed up and he was to fish and you had to punish him and then they asked ... about that and he said quote you have to talk to whoever wrote that I have no idea [laughter]\nWhich of course probably live ... that was exactly what's going on and off at times ... the one feeding that stuff or to his buddies and he's feeding it out\nBut uh but meanwhile the the the the reason that ties into the trade deadline which is later today the state run NFL media reporting the patriots are\nLooking to pluck a receiver at the trade deadline or they want to go through and the two names that are being popped up on the the trade gossip pages Marius Thomas of Denver and\nGolden Tate of your Detroit Lions that\nThey are supposedly hot and heavy after golden they put they would be willing to take the marriage times now tossup question you make the call you or the general manager let's assume you're not a patriots fan and you're just a neutral party you like me like Switzerland\nAnd you have to decide who would you rather get you can get either one of those guys you can get golden tape from the lions or dumb areas Thomas of the Denver Broncos who would you rather have now the ... the guy I Would rather have is Golden State why he's better at this point I Would rather\nHave Golden Gate if I'm the patriots I could see him sliding in to the patron\nIt's all fans and you know kind of been the or you know another version of Edelman that kind of pass get your reliable past get your uh for the patriots\nThe guy I think the patriots are going to get the always not golden ... who they should get its dumb areas Thomas because of nepotism right because of nepotism because Josh ... Daniels\nWho was in Denver back in the day drafted the Marius Thomas so because of that kinship it's the same reason\nThat the patriots who went out and side Eric Decker who couldn't play anymore and they brought him into training camp and then he dropped every pass that when his way or the wife finally released and while you were I retired quote unquote a but but yeah so I mean if it comes down to this based on past\nResults which don't always guarantee future outcomes much like analytics shed at Dodger front office job the this sentiment would be that they\nDid they make a trade the patriots were receive what's going to be for your Marius Thomas other should be for gold and take because he's the better player they're relatively the same age I think that takes a little bit younger than did Mary's Thomas petite would be the better player\nAnd just what I Know my I have great scouting pedigree tremendous scouting pedigree I Do I have that\nAre unless they don't I Would take your phone calls have you like to be part the number eight seven seven Ninety nine on Fox eight seven seven nine nine six six three six nine were also on Twitter at ... that's at Ben ... another\nGood loss for the Lakers are coming together I think they're playing very well and the bronze doing a great job he's got those guys playing right where they want to be so that's equality laws and um I don't know how it is sort of won that game but the Lakers really look good in that last this solemn loss for the Lakers\nSo good job by them when's game six of the world series was that that'd be on Tuesday night Tuesday night at Fenway it's on ... you better watch pretty good chance he an gene review is going to get the start\nAnd he will be on demand for the Dodgers game six the temperatures a little bit warmer in Boston on Tuesday and it's kinda odd though the Dodgers going to spend the morning going to a Red Sox parade and then they're going to go out and play baseball that night and Chris will Chris Shelby pitching though that's the question\nSome uh you know some evidence that show I I [laughter]\n[laughter]\nNow Ralph how much of those things cost route that do you have a couple of how much would that item costs like if you want to buy one Ralph I Know you have a few hours radical\nI'm just going to stop you there because you don't want me to say one of my answer [laughter]\n[laughter] I'm trying to walk away they keep telling me that company or work but I don't know when I was your name on this schedule I Want to run away is what I ...

nevertheless there there is a risk\nIn making this move now the risk is not that Gregg Williams is going to injure players because he's a uh uh he's got no hard these barbaric as a coach not that the risk when you changed coaches in the middle of the year is that you actually become good\nAnd you become good over the final games now that the browns\nThey'll see a path for them to be Kansas City

things that Rick Pitino very proud men would have to do even though he's been embarrassed on the Internet because of some of his shenanigans in restaurants that were close in the greater Louisville area but there are two things that Pacino as to do our number one\nShe asked to work sheet okay I said cheap and that's cheap by NBA standards now Pitino expects to be the highest paid coach that's not going to happen Pitino can get a job\nIn the NBA if he's willing to work for a reasonable some that's number one and number two he asked to be willing to go to the basketball version of Siberia which right now would be what Cleveland\nCavaliers job is open that won the Sacramento Kings come to mind is Pitino is willing to go to a place like that and not the glitz and glamour of New York city
