disagree Arnie you lived there you know ... what do you think\nUh I live there I Lived in Atlanta\nUm [laughter] Dallas\nIs you can vote for a lot of them know there was a lot of transplants obviously but I think that what that that makes it a great sport city it's not just you know one set of fans even though that the majority you still have the splash of New Yorkers the splash of people from Boston\nAs just saw the game today so yeah it is a big melting pot I like it\nI'm though I think it does take away from a few things like maybe a little college sports or you know I I don't know if the NFL even with the rams author that grade started as popular as it used to be with the old rams teams\nI Will say this I I I Love it I think you hit it right on the head Arnie mark the tape on that one he's a hundred percent right now just because not everyone in the town is it is is a passionate Dodger fan or a passionate rams fan I\nMean what's how many millions of people live in LA so you're going to have this cultural melting pot and I think it's great whenever you see and then it's a destination for fans I'm Sorry I have\nTwo teams upbeat sport 'til you got angels Dodgers clippers Lakers or you know a rams in whoever I guess you know at that age Don kings\n[laughter] by the way I I Do believe that if the NFL was smart\nThey'd go to Mark Davis and said he just let the chargers moved to Vegas less ... random you guys come to LA and share the stadium with the rams but I really get this thing could get a one one more quick tweet because I think this is a really good point this was off my old man yell at the clouds segment a little bit earlier in the show\nOr in case the sly brings up a great point he writes when it comes to tie Montgomery\nWell this was a I was frustrated that he had left the locker room without answering questions from reporters\nWhat do you want him to say exactly I think that's in line with what you were asking you wonder if you want to hear him say I made a mistake or I should have secured the ball better know as we all know so who cares I never understood the media asking the obvious question well to that point\nAny time any one makes a mistake and the game that's the obvious questions Justin talker I mean whenever he went in after its midst extra points it cost him the game what he did the question is going to be hey what happened\nIt's not about getting the same questions over and over its about accepting responsibility so I get I'm I'm the first one to admit\nIt's probably short sighted up me it's probably fair of me but on the I think whenever if you're going to be there to get the interviews when things are going well and you're winning titles in your scorn touchdowns by God when you screw something up you got to be there to face the music because\nThat means there's got to see this let's just say well All right well I'll I'll bring this up about the some of the problems that went with the red Sox so that they should have

Fifteen minutes ago I by the way it is able to try it I didn't hear what Robert been taking shots at you Arnie\nWell David Price took a shot at the media I guess\nWhy am I yeah about Fifteen or Fifteen minutes ago or twenty minutes ago are at one of ... at the press conference or whatever you want to call it um I'll have to get the sound and I'm not I can't wait to see exactly what he had this guy not be happy no no you can't that's the way he is I'm Serious he no he can't be happy I've talked about this nausea met my local show\n'em because that's all he does is it's either because of the fans this or you know this going on or that going on\n'em or Dennis Eckersley it always seems like there's some type of problem and really from what I hear he's like the ... a nice guy does great things with charity work so I I don't know why brings us on himself you would think after tonight you would call off the you know the the dogs are I guess\nNot celebrate celebrate your rain and joy and race it but it looks as if he has a little\nAh axe to grind and he's not going to let it go up by the way Sean I agree with this tweet Shaun Hayes is up and said this is the worst show you to have done during an NFL season I thought this was a football show if I wanted World Series coverage I Would listen to that fan boy bin ... who is coming up why\nI got in that I I it though I Am I'm you know ... this is always one of those challenging dilemmas for me personally because\nDon't want to talk about this game tonight are you kidding me this was a disaster of a World Series for the Dodgers I don't want to mention a word of it and part of it too is because of you know you're so laid back Boston the enemy and you're just you're so humble about things you you you just try [laughter] but can you can't help but just congratulate him I mean\nSee I Wonder if his son's favorite team um or the one I guess he's a Dodger fan because he put am five Seventy LA sports so I Wonder if the Dodgers were the one he was oh let's talk about it all week and that's fine let's do this all we\nA couple of quick tweets before I get back to uh buy or sell stock upside down whatever goofy way you want to phrase it matter writes cursed chosen going anywhere\nThe main reason is no other team is going to give him Seventy million dollars including the pro rated signing bonus over the next two years like the Dodgers have to maybe that's part of this discovery process because\nI Know he can't go out and contact teams right but I'm sure his agent is laying some ground war cry hey what kind of deal could he possibly get what's the market look like I mean he I'm\nSure there would be ... willing to pay him a lot of\nMoney rather have Seventy million for two years and then the Dodgers say well we're not going to resign you after that or somebody like the ... I just making the team of like the Texas Rangers but these from now has a say in you know what I'm Will give you the two years Seventy million then we'll sign yeah for another three more years after that\n[noise] boy that's tough ah I Would I Would probably go just to do something different I mean\nI I Can't get inside crush us mind I understand what you're saying that if you look at it from a pure financial perspective it's LA he he's not going to go anywhere else\nBut this dude money is not a problem he's made a ton of money in his career and I'm not ever saying you don't reach a point where you're like no no no I'm good I don't want any more money I still have yet to meet that person in my life that says no don't pay me any more money on do it\nBut maybe he wants to go somewhere else maybe he wants to do something experience a different town I don't know and maybe that's probably leading\nTo those those taxes yeah there or slow state taxes down there and in\nA you know I Know you're you're you're good and you're good in taxes if you want to get much better in Texas and you wouldn't be in California from a state income tax perspective a mat rights to our conversation about sports towns\nGreat sports towns give their teams that distinct home field advantage the coliseum sounded like land both feel today there was no help for the rams from the crowd because it was a pro Packers\nAgain you're white but we're seeing part of what makes LA great is that melting pot of all places and ...\nYear are coming out there with the ... cheese heads I'll probably make a lot of money if I Do that\n[laughter] you you might you might make a little more than some money whenever you get going and uh I like this from Jeremy who writes everyone keeps talking payroll aren't the Dodgers third or something like that correct Jeremy you're right but it just it makes for a little bit more of that bitterness to come off\nOr not we'll try to reverse that they're not they're not birds are just trying to we're trying to to to do some water on this under dog story that knows Bruins way\nAnd I just got oh let's keep hearing about how great the Oakland A's are are with their little payroll even though they have not won anything so it's just going to throw that out there\nYou know what that's a good point let's talk about the Asian Arnie what do you think about opens chances next year yeah yeah\nI I like the kids in the lowest payroll I think it's very good for some reason\nI got to they've got a tough decision to make on the joy as well to they've got a lot of money tied up in hand with nothing but joy you yeah\nThose those as I think he's got like another three years left on that ... that's ... them all up to no end so yeah bump put joy I just laugh all the way to the bank because you're not going anywhere they didn't even play this year and\nYou know what those savings spot at second base but but if they were smart they go for somebody young and starts ... replacing him because he's he's worthless from now on out he's he's talking about more than two fifty what a worthless contract that one was\nAll right let me we back in a couple of by ourselves here before we wrap up and get your picks in her final segment Pittsburgh army I'm buying that you're good with James Carter might be a fantasy conversation will save that for later but if you're the Steelers\nBuying the con or is it OK replacement the rest of the way from Les beyond bell are you in there with me or no\nOh of course one hundred percent of the kid is showed enough\nUm we did talk about the one glaring thing the fumble I think he's that to this year one of them caused them the game in Cleveland which ended up at a tie but other than that changing of the guard I Want to go beyond bell even if cutter\nWasn't even all that great I Would still say okay does it change the guards that are living on bell on back on this team but he's more than just serviceable so yeah a good by levy on a whole James\nAnd then one more from today one of the more impressive performances the Carolina Panthers who just for Ronald the ravens army that division is insane right now the saints at six in one Panthers at five and two are you buying Carolina right now is a potential Superbowl contender in the NFC\nAnd when the south so ah and they're still in there but it looks like the same so the class that division yeah bike here why to get new playing another level is he not I mean we always do it was a good quarterback vote\nThis year for some reason it looks like it's even and I know we had a Super Bowl that year but jeeze they look so much better and you know what's great about this team is there's so much better defensively now they don't obviously you have the up and so the saints have or or even Tampa Bay as but the feds will be their head and shoulders better than anybody else in the division\nHe was Twenty one twenty nine today\nFor two hundred Nineteen yard you into sports and he had in why aries for fifty two yards and a touchdown you don't run into much sure you've been in Louis what eight years I Know it's two hundred Seventy one total yards three touchdowns and oh by the way wasn't fat\nZero sacks today for Cam Newton so look out care lined up five into right now they went today while six to Twenty one\nEvery one has been waiting for everybody has been talking about at parties allegedly been on fire with this picks on so when my when we come back to the guy go Fox Sports radio studios armies picks take us home it was already in blank on Fox Sports radio\nI Want to see what the other broadcast that they're being shown that dirty water\nThat this team's going to roll over at home not going to happen defensively I think they can't stop Alabama but they can slow them down offensively that's the part that scares me will they be able to put up enough points to beat them [noise]\nI think they can give me LSU over our pick of the force that points for\nGame number two [noise]\nDid you see the light in this one did you happen to see the wind and I\nI haven't seen the line and this one is Michigan's favorite over Penn State what do you think oh uh I Would guess it'd be like six\nCan\nGet one state that's way too many points against the Michigan team who may win\nBut I got to get that ten points in there you've got to be kidding me give me a Penn State plus the gets ... to ... games I have taken the Green Bay Packers again plus the Seventy gets the patriots on the road\nAnd I have taken the same at home to beat the rams so there you have a big deal with them as you please but remember now they're strictly for the payments purposes only Arnie\nYou're not picking the battle of the bay you're not picking theirs and others that could listen to it all day stored Gilligan Griffin you're not picking the battle by debate Thursday Night Football the raiders and the niners how dare you and I mean where everyone is watching\nHow can I missed that one I may have to pass on that one I'm Sorry about that what we watch World Series or something\nWhat is your thought on this number real quick 'cause I ... I I don't care about this Alabama's not just the best team in college football this year they're one of the best not Oklahoma sooner teams I've seen in a long time\nOr they haven't beaten but what two teams with winning records this year in ... so how does that do anything for you does that affect your your your pick this week in or not or you just rolling with them for whoa Alabama Alabama has only been two teams were winning with a winning record the show\nThough I mean there's still a kitten knock them they're still impressive world David able to do but um that's why like el issue and playing at home and all the points and again even though they know beaten teams inside the top that I still feel like it was she was under rated so um I Would have picked those points and and and enjoy that game\nI Will say this Tuesday is not only the NFL trade deadline but Tuesdays off so the first time that we'll get an opportunity to see how the four team playoff committee is viewing the top\nFour six eight teams whatever they rank ... remember do they always say they pick it as if the seas in war to end today which is kind of unfair because we I think in our minds Arnie we look ahead quite a bit\nWhich is why I think that they also get this is all they also get try to sell the sport a bit I think that's why you'll see LSU number two\nBecause they're went over Florida it might be ... excuse me uh they went over Georgia might be the most impressive when of any of the top ten teams so far this season so I think you'll see them high but it's going to be real interesting to see what they do with Michigan to see what they do with Oklahoma to one last teams that have been very impressive and you have to have Notre Dame that's undefeated in that four teams\n... you know it's so funny you brought that up I got breaking news on them just real quick uh northwestern just beat Notre Dame so you didn't you didn't hear that one does that surprise you know no it doesn't surprise me at all it was good cheated on remember they had mentioned about Seventy nothing northwest sued over Notre Dame\nBy the way joke clap Fox Sports analyst on college football the number one dude here's

now are just playing a game a year in London and so they put the Philadelphia Eagles not much of a game as Jacksonville continues to\nCircle the toilet offensively a while the team that after they\nBeat the patriots and week too was complaining that ESPN did not cover them enough they were complaining about that and now here we are they are three and five to get there by week and the Jacksonville jak since they beat the patriots and week to a convincing eleven point win over time radio the patriots\nSince that week Jacksonville is gone loss when loss loss loss loss that's five out of six or in a row\nThat Jacksonville has lost the did not cover the spread in a six point defeat at the hands of the Philadelphia Eagles and it continues to be the same old story\nFor Jacksonville they are not much trickier leading the ball down the field enough eagles had six more first downs in this can be averaged a yard point at one point two yards more ... in his\nThat's not bad I don't buy man for different Jacksonville players detained by police in London\nBecause of a night out at a pub white night out it is reported the Jacksonville players decided they didn't want to pay their bar tab how much was their bar tab fifty thousand British pounds sixty four thousand dollars\nSixty four grand\n[noise] these local heads would charge for uh the the bar tab in London\nSixty four thousand dollars and they ended up getting into a dust up the saw in the great tabloid of London has all the delicious details I Love how they see for Jacksonville Jaguars stars\nArrested by cops at four AM after a night club brawl big headline in the tabloids of London and this is American football this is how we Barnes storm are American football to the people of the United kingdom\nHow great is that these guys are in London they're out there to look for in the morning just going for it they were at the London rain nightclub that's where I was going on in London and that's where I hang out absolutely and they were accused of security of trying to leave the London ranged show club without pay\nThe tab now how many pounds per week the or they say the the Jacksonville players earning forty three thousand pounds a week a lot of ...\nAnd uh they they apparently square up quarterly tablet they squared off so bouncers outside the night it was just thinking is this for knuckleheads like All right we're going to fight with the ...\nThe the West End equivalent of King Kong meeting Godzilla\nAccording to the tabloid in la [noise]\nYeah [laughter] just absolutely this is great oh they ah they were drinking champagne starting at four hundred and fifty pounds a bottle and vodka\nThe total bill was as we said sixty four thousand dollars and some of the guys tried to leave they were stopped by security and so how does this all play now some of the Jacksonville players they're trying to downplay there's no no no this is all big misunderstanding\nIn fact very church one of the players were Jacksonville\nUh said that this is all the aim is to understand do we first of all we think it was a misunderstand know do we think that the Jacksonville players left without paying yes absolutely did we think the Jacksonville players realized how much alcohol they were consuming and what the bill ... no we don't think that was the case at all\nBut they're claiming this was a misunderstanding now the good thing about being in London is that the police are like I just pay the bill your good and so they the NFL team had to come in and pay the bill\nAnd then the nightclub decided not to press charges\nBut the players you had very church the strong safety for Jacksonville the other players involved included fellow safety is Ronny Harrison and Jared Wilson quarterback DJ Hayden but that they were all the rest\nBut it's a misunderstanding so that's what church it at ... stadium [laughter] what's the most expensive meal you've ever been part of\n\nFor me it was a little

Cooper loose the big Hollywood yeah he's been time yeah\nWhat's your number coup you got to number\nI mean not in my adult years nothing close to seven hundred dollars but I mean back when I was a kid

Jamison Wednesday in my trash or your garbage Jacksonville Tampa board does goes to Tampa Jacksonville says okay we'll take Davis once\nBut wait there's more where else can James which didn't end up because of his youth\nThe New York giants the giants are going to be out of the allies remaining business\nHe'll be out so they need to get another quarterback and say those rafts somebody's supposed to not be a great year for the draft how 'bout genus Winston in New York playing for the giants for that but what about the Miami Dolphins and other Florida teen\nRyan tannahill clearly on the couch he's injured right now he's on the outs with Adam gays get rid of him\nThe raiders Seamus Winston till the raiders John Bruton we know he likes James Winston from his Monday Night football he's very excited about his ability James Winston or what about the writer's Derek ... regime is Winston\nI got her so I got a couple of\nCurve balls okay since we're playing the where is James which then going to go game how about this better off his burger retires famous Seamus to the Pittsburgh Steelers\nThat did you see that happening\nIn your quarterback and ... ... ... you know as well they drafted this guy okay but they must jams how about the chargers Philip Rivers also an older quarterback they don't have to be the the air to the\nThrone would be\nLA charges of course in California how about that possibility but the are the odds are slim there'll be traded this week but we will keep an eye on that it is the better now their show on Fox congratulations the red Sox\nThey when\nThey when the world series very\nAnd wouldn't be great if they Roberts had come out and just said boy we saw that and just started listening names but he didn't do that he played it close to the best than\nGraduation that the robbers for stealing another one for the red socks\nThat size keeps helping those Red Sox up twenty four twenty Eighteen yep back at it hey he might the Dodgers did not pick up the Roberts option for twenty Nineteen earlier so he is technically not under contract right now\nSo it wouldn't really be of his hope it stays out so that gives them plausible deniability what I mean by that is if the Dodgers do not bring Roberts back\nThey could say hey we didn't fire him we just could not come to contract terms which means the Dodgers he's with the move I noticed working in radio they could low balled they've Roberts right give him a contract offer how like kind of like what the Carolina Hurricanes did with her longtime play by play a guy who had been with the teams that they weren't Hartford\nAnd they offered him a wage was like not even a living wage and so the guy had to turn it down by the Dodgers offered Dave Roberts what they paid the guys to clean Chavez Ravine I'm guessing that day Roberts would turn it down yes\nAnd then the Dodgers could say hey we offered him a contract he just did not agree to our terms\nSo keep an eye that'll be the story of the of the week here at least in Dodger land or as they say goodbye to\nMany of their but mainly Machado he'll be gone mats and thank God does your guest Mardi Gras dolls are free agent the U.N General view is also a free agent I'd like your bat keep him I'll keep him around I don't hate him and ...\nOf all the ... of all the people that I Would do with that thank God he's gonna retire the silver me as a

would you lie manning the giants on pace to allow sixty two sacks in his but wait there's more un manning has now eight touchdown passes in eight games eight touchdown passes in eight games this year now I Believe that's one of the game\nFor math is correct on that I went to settled by college I learned a lot of things and settled by ... I Believe that's one touchdown every game\nRyan Tannehill has not played in three consecutive weeks he has a touchdown pass so you can do the math on that you can do there's a lot of ways to do the math on that they're they're calling for a a fire sale and the trade all these players a trade or the back of an Eli Manning but again many says he's not going anywhere\nRight now I'm going to go anywhere will the giants bench you I'm manning or attempt to bench in for the second consecutive year will they do it I've shown no indication no no sign that the giants are willing to do that that\nTheir coach and we've talked a lot about the giants they're not very good team but ... uh he will be for NATO and dawn as coach of the giants before he decides the bench you I may maybe I'm wrong on that but I've seen no indication\nThat the giants coaches willing to do that though\nI haven't seen any plus talk football not drama I'd rather talk about the drama your team sucks\nIt's terrible when one of the giants win another game what play that game one with the giants win [laughter]\nAnother another football game let's see if you look at the giants schedule they have a ... I think they could lose the by\nI think somebody will be arrested so I Believe that that's a loss so I'll take a loss on that at San Francisco uh well there's a chance to win a game right they don't beat the niners wow they don't you measure the jazz loose the niners and CJ better\nThen you've got Tampa but it's Patrick will be back eagles bears loss loss Redskins laws titans that's a home game in New Jersey coal always able to beat the cold schools aren't that good\nLast year by the raiders though are you a of three touchdowns or the fourth quarter\nI haven't heard anything about the raiders there Roberta you watch the raider game Noel man [laughter] what did they opt to fire up uh twenty eight Twenty one right I looked at the school only one they gave up three touchdowns in the fourth quarter\nI Want to take more than ...
