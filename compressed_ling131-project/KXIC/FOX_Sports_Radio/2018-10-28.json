Cooper was a smart pick of the time he said so when he was in ESPN commentator\nYes and now we've had a chance to work with a mark Cooper and so your opinions change a little bit as far as being with a player and you know it's interesting my my serious are kind of co host on Saturday morning as Tim brown\nAnd to him as a line to the raiders organization and he revealed yesterday that you know the raiders were concerned that this guy would just disappear and they often he just wouldn't be there there there be game stretches that go by that are more Cooper's getting one target\nOh and and you know they think OK also too I just don't know if he ever really one John Gordon's trust I mean and Tim was saying that sometimes you would start to see Jared cooked a tight end lined up\nFor plays that are more Cooper would normally be running so you know consistency has been an issue for him you know and and then I'll also includes drops you know that's been an issue for him as well he's just been an inconsistent player\nTremendous talent don't get me wrong there's a reason he was picked in the top five but when you're a raiders team is looking ahead to twenty twenty I mean they're not like let's even skipped twenty Nineteen realistically here guys right with the raiders because\nThey're going to be a nomadic team until they get into their new stadium and twenty twenty so\nYou know while they run out the string they know mark Cooper his contract you know he's got one more year on and then twenty Nineteen they weren't going to extend them\nThey don't ... it was part of their long term future so now they get another first round pick I Believe this gives them five first round pegs in twenty Nineteen and twenty twenty they will be able to rebuild from there are just going to be a long ago again for raiders fans who are just tired of this\nYou know Alex looking at this Sunday night game it's the match up of the week where the saints go to Minnesota and I can't imagine that the last game in the stadium is in on the mind of mark is William ... who mid to tackle against the findings\nAnd so I think that his teammates are gonna wanna pick him up as well do you see at the same way how much of a positive impact could the last\nGame against the Vikings have on this game against the Vikings for this thing\nIt could I think there's another issue in the secondary as well but that we do know is going to make an impact and that's a fact that can Crowley they're starting corner opposite of march ... not going to play tonight according to media reports and if he is out that means Eli Apple thrown into the fire immediately and would be making his first start\nFor the saints and that could be you know could there be communication issues potentially and that's not something that you know because just because he just got there and so that's not something you want to hear about\nIf you're a saints fan knowing that you got Stefan de oh an ad I'm feeling by the way on his record setting pace\nFor about an Eighteen NFL season those are the guys that you have to go against with I I get Marcus Williams credit you know he stood up after the game he admitted he made a mistake and it was a huge mistake you know I don't ever think one player makes a football game that things can go back and look at a lot of it but you know and and say we should have done this we should have done that but\nYou know what his teammates have embrace do I do think that they want to make a statement tonight against the Minnesota Vikings but you know and for the Viking standpoint that they can just keep it running game going and keep a little more about you see that by the way her cousins get into football out of his hands very quickly but he also had leads the NFL and passes patted down\nFourteen of them he's on actually a record setting pace for having passes shot you know slapped down so be interesting to see how the Vikings tried to fix that problem and also ... Murray do is Alvin cook was another game because of his hamstring injury\nAlex more of this package passed these things be enough today to stop those high flying rams\nNo no no no no no no no no and by the way Todd girlie him into this mix\nAs well I mean this is just a special off as you know one thing to their offensive line started every game all five guys the same offensive line in fact often plays a seventh round pick by the Indianapolis Colts and twenty sixteen he was cut\nPlaying by the rams nice pickup he is actually quite men playing so well it right guard the term on brown a guy who has served a two game suspension and start to season has not reclaimed his starting position I think it's one of the most underrated groups in the NFL because they can a droid Lee run and pass block\nI I just think that the Packers this is going to be one of these games where it's like the Packers are going to have to keep up with the rams in my opinion and I just don't think they have the firepower\nTo do it either running game they don't have a ... Gurley they they do running back by committee and it's not an especially impressive committee to be quite honest with you I think it's a pretty average bunch\nI think the Packers lose this one but you know what all the money a lot of money coming in to Las Vegas right now because the rams are nine and a half point favorite a lot of folks are picking up that special here with the Packers I'm not sure if the rams beat him by by nine and a half and how that spreads going to go but I just think that they ultimately have too much firepower take the over in my opinion on this one\n... there's a lot of off the seal drama with numerous teams if you go cliff notes version the Jacksonville Jaguars they had\nFour players detained at the whole thing where they allegedly skipped out on a bill in London think about Denver what's going on near this week with Chad Kelly going into a stranger's home and mumbling while the brother of pat bowling filed a court motion to remove trust deeds from power\nYou look at Sean Jackson requesting a tray of brown coaching that could have changes all this off the field drama\nWhere do you see at translating to on the field with any of the teams that I mentioned\nWell it's funny 'cause you notice that we don't have this with the New England patriots that we know about right and they were made the gold standard of the NFL and its teams that minimizes sort of drama are usually the ones that are successful right I mean you write a whole bunch of things you you mentioned a number of teams right there and the impact that it you know these types of things can have on them and none of them I Believe have a winning record", "year": "2018", "show_name": "FOX Sports Radio", "city": "Iowa City", "day": "28"}
