I\nThink it's Brady who are trying to my homes and I think a lot of that is because of built by electric and what they can provide defensively I think they're going to throw some different looks at her home so I think they're going to try you know one thing that you look at it fell a trick successor gets quarterbacks and his greatest homes is banned he's taking the NFL by storm\nMaybe the patriots can come up with something ski medically that he hasn't seen yet cause confusion caused those turnovers there really haven't come to watch them you know obviously you open the fees without growing and he picks\nAt two last week against Jacksonville maybe there's a way the patriots can I can get back on the other thing that I like about this master for New England is they're receiving corps and I were driven out of an backdrop scored and taking on a bigger role and the fact that the chiefs are going to be with a vote starting safety's\nBailout excuse me there are also on top of that you know dressed in future not going to be able to go today so I think that when you put all that together I think the patriots going to be able to score some points in Kansas City comes back to her\nWhole Dallas mothers I may not be small but the one thing I Do try to pry myself as an loyal because I got to defend my partner Brian oh until about the\nThose right now the eagles Thirteen and three last year and the first if any chance to begin to increase his dosage Steelers now get this of the seven previous rainy champs just start to in three only in the nineties cowboys reached a postseason so Brian knows curse looks pretty good right now that they will need to play us\nWell I mean where where are we out in the division right now I mean you are Manning's darn right I mean we can pretty much the way this is going and if you're the giants I'll tell you keep playing and you don't why keep losing you all the other bad teams in\nThe NFL have quarterbacks right I mean when you look at teams are losing record around the league most of them have TVs are already there said at the position so the giants put themselves in a great spot in two thousand nine team to get\nTheir franchise quarterback they gave you a ... year it didn't work out if not working out now he's so jittery you could just tell how he's just shake it off into line is really giving in much of a chance and\nIt's a mess and of course defensively they're not supporting the fence and caring um so we have a very bad giants team the cowboys are hit and miss you know really each week ... it's\nThe lack of all kinds of production at the wide receiver position is catching up with 'em tight and Jeff Swain doesn't scare anybody I mean of course all the heat falling on the Prescott high and you know his inability to ... games but not for Dallas wedding this division and who knows what rights conceive you get from week to week they were absolutely abysmal\nAgainst the wall and St on Monday Night at coming off a by as well where they had all that extra prep time so in the land of the blind a one eyed man is king that's why I think the Philadelphia Eagles even if it than mine and seven tightened fix they probably wouldn't division\nHow about this big game and the AFC North dealers at the bangles we've talked extensively about the bangles and not truly being able to buy in Kenya call it before it happens Alex or do you have to see it just saying well All right the Bengals finally won one against the Steelers\nYou got it for you to believe that I I just Pittsburgh is hazard number for so\nMuch for somebody you're not out of the past ten games\nOr you know the Pittsburgh Steelers have one and usually there's carnage that takes place in these cases well injuries that happened memorable moments guys losing their mind on each other it is a very bad rivalry I Will I ever press this week that the Bengals actually not fed into it it's been a different approach this year I think you're a little bit more of a professional approach", "year": "2018", "show_name": "FOX Sports Radio", "city": "Iowa City", "day": "14"}
