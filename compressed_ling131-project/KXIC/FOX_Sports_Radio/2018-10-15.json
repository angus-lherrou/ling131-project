had all the momentum\nFirst two weeks a year beat the giants beat the patriots feeling good mocking television channels for not covering their games\nHow's that going how's that working out for you we\nHad heard that Blake portals it reinvented himself that he had some some confidence now because of that championship game performance of the first half when he was good against the patrons he stuck to the second half\nAnd then you come out and play like this party shot here we'll hear from some of the participants in a minute or but dogma Rhone out\nThis is not one of his finest efforts here he has some explaining to do the jags have lost their identity this is a sloppy football team right now is a careless football team\nAnd you can't be flamboyant and hockey in Stratton around like a peacock when you're getting smashed on a weekly basis Jacksonville has now at Seventy points and over eight hundred yards\nThe past two weeks top defense compared to some of the all time great defenses in the NFL they've given up over eight hundred yards in Seventy points the last two games\n\nThat's one thing to give up points to Kansas City but the cowboys not a positive note Jacksonville does play the Texans and that game is in the swimming pool in Duvall can\nBelieve that game is in a home game for for Jacksonville so they'll they have that and the Texans are three and three and we know the Texans it three and three\nAre the worst three and three team in the history of the NFL the three winners have been gifted the three ... given away by Indianapolis who said we\nDon't want it we'd rather lose the anti bold move by Frank right but that's exactly what happened member that back we talked a lot about it here on this show\nWhat are you doing yeah had a tie and the the culture like we don't want to ...\nWe don't need a tie we're not going to take to die and they lost in overtime\nAnd then the cowboys that Sunday night game when Jason Garrett decided I have the greatest running back and football I have a highly paid office of line I'm going to ... an for that one I Would not want to go for I don't trust my office Irvine I don't trust the Z Chiarelli so I'm going to punt the ball way cowboys lost\nThat game and then this past week the Texans they won because of the peanut effect it was ridiculous oh several dogma Rhone\nCoach your team has now lost three of their last four games you're defense has been humiliated on a weekly basis here what do you ever say for yourself\nThere's no excuses you know what I mean we just got to do a better job I Wish I could sit up here and say that was a great play it I was a great catch it and were there were a good place I I don't want to take away from them you know we've got to take a good look at ourselves you know we've got to look ourselves and you know we've got to put the responsibility on all of us aren't with me and you know pull your bootstraps up and let's go\nDo they actually have bootstraps I don't think so this is an expression I don't know if if they actually have boots that'd be something for the bootstraps Blake board does your allege Blake\nTremendous effort their way to really guide Jacksonville is often so I think we can all say job well done I'm sure you're happy with your performance yes\nWe've got to do a better job of ... early ... games we've played was an off and we got started early you know so that that'd be and so that's how we need to start and find a way to start but we also got to find a way to where if we don't start like that to Dover come back and get rolling\nYou know I think we're three three and how to start the game not what you're looking for but you got to find a way to score points you can score seven points you got to find a way to move the ball [laughter] we got to continue to try to do a better job taking care of it and turn him over too much [laughter] that's kind of battle her off\nI have noticed the only thing Jacksonville does well in ... is the crossing patterns and if you can stop the crossing patterns and force plate borders to do something else he can't do it like that's the the kryptonite unborn does is anything other than the crossing pass against the patriots and wheat too\nAnd I happened to do some radio right after that game I recall it was just non stop the patriots were not quick enough\nThat particular day with who they had on the field to stop the Jacksonville receivers from slicing up the patriots the France is so cool and Westbrook and those guys just had a field day and teams have figured it out\nIt would appear that they are now saying okay we'll ... we'll take away the crossing patterns beat or somewhere else in the field how's that working\nAt a yeah not good not so good the real Christopher who's uh he's\nThe brewers fan so I Do not as good as it dopey brewers fan or he says Kobe's we had a hundred yards and two touchdowns undo wall\nThey are garbage so from the real Christopher that's

time they were up by Seventeen a and they were you were comfortably ahead it when they were by ten and go into the fourth quarter they really they were up by two scores most of the ... that's what I'm\nAbout to scores you're not really in danger of losing the game and the Broncos when they scored the final the the final touchdown was like how much time was up like a there wasn't three minutes and someone was even that much I don't even think there was I think there was like two minutes or something left on the clock so it wasn't that much time left anyway\nSo the amount of show that's
