picks\nIt's not just about first round pick that you are getting\nThat are going to be great for you what it's about getting the extra first round picks that you can trade up\nA package hey we're going to give you are picking Eighteen and and and Twenty one and move up to and we're going to give you all were going to get our picks at sixteen and not to move up to five whatever it is\nIt's valuable it's also valuable and trades because James Watt first round picks there's plenty of teams that have players that are really good but you don't run the hook with a little bit too much money for them we want to move on and they might be players who are really desirable the other teams but\nWhat can they give up the seams want first round picks salary first great great great great great will take the Celtic the guy will take the first round ...\nHaving a first round pick is so valuable and you want to give up for them you will torpedo the future of your franchise and the rockets no doubt to be our panicking at the early fought in the western conference\nOf so many teams that we thought we are going to be just okay that are actually looking legit the nuggets are legit\nThe pelicans look like they might be a legit the Lakers added the best player in the game the warriors are still the warriors this is a panic situation from the rocket through thick hey we better go out and try to get somebody because all of these teams may pass in\nPortland Maine wind up being really really good this is how it goes we can't get past a complete panic offer this is by the rocket certainly can't\nBe complacent and obviously you're still wondering how long the injury to James Hard will impact\nThe roster how much time he misses and whether that lingers as the season goes on but you know you had the muddled middle right it was it was two\nTwo teams at the top the warriors in the rockets and then three through nine you didn't have a lot of separation that you two more teams just on the outside looking in we thought the order it could be um the pelicans I should say could be solid\nQuite clearly they've got six or seven deep go double digits every night so that makes it

going to say we need a player too\nI mean I Know and and but I think that's it if you're looking short term you're not getting the ... you know initial\nRush because you're not getting a top ten or

with LeBron's can launch zone knocked down some shots we know it we know is somebody that can that can\nGet the ball up and down the floor phenomenal court vision but Kenny knocked down a few shots can he get the ball to LeBron James where LeBron needs it for most of the shot clock and Lorenzo doesn't\n... can ... be the shot maker that LeBron James needs because now the team is built differently\nAnd the team is built around abroad and LeBron needs his guys we heard this before the season he wants his players to have the specific roles 'cause this is what a succeeded for him when he knows what he can get from every guy on the floor and every second of the game and\nHe is\nAbsolutely the guy you have to change the team around to make that happen and look where you are now after three games\nLosing Ron do for the suspension and losing Ingram\n... you cannot deny his chemistry with LeBron on the floor abroad is finding him he knows where to be already he's only started three games with the brunt of abroad is looking for him all the time Lorenzo is knocking down shots just have to knock down a lot he\nScored twelve tonight that's fine if he's five out of ten he scores twelve is two out of five from three point range that's all they need from Lorenzo he also dished out eight assists five steel six rebound you get that from ... and I know how talented brand and ... and I know they brought in a rage on Rhonda but when these guys come back\nThey have to go to the bench because this is the lake or line up that is doing the most damage with these guys starting over by the way don't forget about Josh hearts starting\nTwelve points tonight five rebounds and says he's given them what they need out of shooting guard even though he didn't have a great night shooting but he clearly has earned this chance this clearly is the most dangerous Laker lined up because they're scoring twenty more points a game that is the first couple of games with the season\nSo this is where it's got to go in a brand name becomes the main catalyst behind the second unit then that's what they got to do because that's what's going to be what's best for the Lakers and oh by the way now

it's\nShot the bad shot just inside the two point inside the three point line last year now he's stepping back and said All right with confidence I'm letting it launched so now you got that value coming to it and\nIt's a wide open game and obviously LeBron James is going to pick the four guys he wants to run with\nBut I gotta think after these this game auditioned you're feeling pretty good about it and now it's just Ingram Enron do an ego management and that's what ... is getting paid for you gotta go figure out and make sure that they're cool uh with what their roles will be and I got

national league I don't like the fact that the American the national league have two different set of rules but that's the way they've done it and the Dodgers are going to benefit\nBeing at Dodger Stadium and the red Sox are not going to have ... one of their key hitters in the lineup\nAnd the world series this not dramatically shift the pendulum does not go to Boston in favor of completely until the Dodgers lose the game\nAt home I so as far as I'm concerned by the time we get back here Sunday night and the Monday the Dodgers will be trying to decide how to win games six to win the world series four games to to that's the belief right that is the belief\nAnyway it is the Britain our show on Fox is we press on here and we say hello to ah right over their scheme\nDe savior have mean Perot who you are a very positive person sir\nThat's right you're the negative guy on the positive in the way was actually doing positive stuff\nAre you positive you will make game three by first pitch after hosting at these late hours\nAh yeah but I said that is problematic [laughter] and I'm going to have to I'm going to give in to my health because\nThey usually go to the gym after these are these things but I Will be going right to bed my beautiful sleep number but I Will be doing that we have a guess by the way it is so don't don't don't act or there's a big celebrity here so we have to be we have to be in her best\n[laughter] since when by the way Hank Aaron himself will be a game three because they're gonna be giving out the Hank Aaron awards for the years Ellen\nWorld Series last year that I saw her wrecked not the greatest health not these good they are yeah legend is always a legend I get I I just wonder what\nThat's the Thursday night NFL game I did watch I I was observing and and I was very active on social media the Texans won they won big they wouldn't forty two to twenty three over the Miami Dolphins and so this is like I got people on the Houston\nWho were there for the Sean watch and he's great he had five touchdowns going on about Watson and he caught your eye on your car and a and are you going on about that I Believe\nDuring your monologue Miami just gave up another forty or play\nNow I got two thoughts and I'm not wrong about anything I'm right I don't think any I'm not impressed with the taxes they won five games in a row you talk about being hand delivered five wins in a row\nThe Houston says I put the is right next to the ... game I put this white you know Frank right just starting I don't want to tie I Would like to lose the game back in late September and wait for\nThe we the wins a a five in a row you know it could go to six in a row they play at coop Denver next\nBut they're not I'm not impressed with what I'm seeing with the Texas and and my argument\nWas the reason the shower and wash and if you're new to the show he got upset with me because of some things we sit on the show a while back the reason the Sean washing got upset was because I said he was going to\nGet hurt who had to take a boss who last road game the Texans played because he was unable to fly because of injury risking concerned about the cabin air pressure in a flight from Houston in Jacksonville who had to take a bus\nThat was a nice boss it was a luxury bus and it was likely more enjoyable\nThan wine or a bar after I didn't get there and to\nOur ... was that 'cause he was healthy do they know it was like the Eighteen right Mr T. yet it you know they don't want to fly know shown watching couldn't fly\nSpeaking of injuries MRI friday according to the Houston Chronicle for Texans wide receiver will fuller\nTheir fragile that ... that one sixth doing seven no way I'm not impressed\nNot impressed sorry\nThat so often I if I owned the dolphins I Would fire and I'd have a fire party I Would fire ever did you see them ... they looked like the Keystone Cops on defense\nIt was like plan to prevent defense in the second quarter of the game they were waiting to the Texas players to stop running before they chased him down\nAnd the defensive coordinator toss the tablet to the ground it probably valid in wind up about\n... ... that he gave us um I don't think it was a defense reporter give this whole thing about maybe it was one of the position of cold you know we can change this guy's ... directed that can Derek I'm just going to go to\nBen Ben one play three guys got called for a penalty there is a lemon guys on the field they will call for free penalties on one play\nThree so let's use some other math on that to say you're twenty seven percent of the Texas ... committed a penalty on one play\nAbout that\nAt the Saddleback College education and they're now they're mad baby that's I'm here Steve\nWhat'd you think about uh Ben monologue there about the Dodgers\nGame I've ... been most positive about going into the world series\nWell they say all of you are at home he'll be there to say is going to\nReport cell is that a great year but it's not like a ... a\nRegression to them and I got to make it up that the red Sox simulate commend you twenty seven Yankees or some murders row and they're not really I Would just wait if they win oh my ...\nWell it's five and a half or on the game and plenty of playoff games with more than five rounds per\nGame but would you agree they're not

Jacksonville the last couple of weeks but let me go back to the well to get burned one more time the public loves the eagles it's all about the eagles in fact Seventy nine percent of the freight

forward pass but even then I Would have my doubts I Would still running quarterback keeper a but that's the ... and then number two Carson and when\nI play play well last week until the game mattered and the fourth quarter\nUntil the gay marriage and the fourth quarter and remember just fifty nine percent of the yards gained by opponents against Jacksonville have been through the year that the jags defense while they're not as good as last year they have been very good at stopping the opposing team's passing yards\nOr you know they're holding their own in that department in Jacksonville is the problem they've had and this is why ... got taken out of the game they're averaging three point three turnovers\nThe last three weeks those are self inflicted wounds and since the jags became a contender again for the playoffs in last season\nAs an underdog they've been pretty good they're six and three the last two years as an underdog you're getting three points here that's a good spot the public has turned on the jags that gives them some value you want to be on the other side of the public\nI'll take Jacksonville to win the game out right twenty to twenty the jags get the

Baker may feel that I've said this before he has not been as productive lately in fact the last four weeks Baker Mayfield is the thirtieth rank quarterback part of the problem the browns have punted
