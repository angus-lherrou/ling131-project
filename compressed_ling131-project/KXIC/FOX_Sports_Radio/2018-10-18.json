I'll worry about that after the world series which is what Clinton personal got to say because he's bleeping pitching today but Andrew Freedman who's been running the Dodgers front office\nHad the most telling comment today when he was asked about hey what do you feel at this being Clinton Kirsch laws potentially his last game but the Dodgers and he says\nWe're not thinking about that we're focused on this twenty Eighteen season there's ongoing dialogue we'll discuss this after the season is over that was the statement from Andrew Freedman\nThat tells me they are pushing Clinton ... out

ago this is the Dodgers pushing Clinton Herschel out and so many people on social media and Twitter on the show were like oh you're crazy the Dodgers want to keep a guy like this and that means a lot

every right to be pissed off about first of all it's Joe West Joel West to someone who has a history of being a guy who thinks people come to the major league ballpark to watch me on part they don't and ... but he thinks they\nDo or did you get excited when he's on the cargo you should do something good habits yeah he does yeah he does and it's like that when you see special guest they go to a

and low interest so [laughter]\nI\nGot to listen to the whole show and the history ... downloaded on ice you know I'm so glad I never have to watch another problem that I Would say oh my God\nI'm but Joe West\nIs not an empire that enforces the rules he has his own interpretation of the rules he runs out to the outfield and with his naked eye says that ... jumping up for the ball was fan interference that he couldn't catch it so he calls and out\nThey actually review it in New York and here's what I don't get first of all I don't get out Joe ... fan interference with the naked eye I Would get that you call it a home run\nAnd then you go back and look at it on replay to make sure there is no fan interference but how does he see that he doesn't see where ... glove is he can't see it from where he's at sort of call fan interference on the field is ridiculous absolutely ridiculous\nBut he does call for review I'm like okay well this is where it's going to get changed\nAnd despite the fact that the fans in the first row\nDo not reach over the field of play for the ball in fact they're doing everything to make sure they're not reaching forward their hands are tied to their chest elbows are down there trying to grab the ball and kind of ... in uh\nOh that's how they're trying to catch it they're not on the field of play ... jumps up his glove touches the fans if the fans are reaching out over the field of play ... love is in the stands I'm Sorry but it is it was easy to see instead\nNope\nIt's still ruled they're sticking behind Joe West for that call and I can't understand how they would do that major league baseball is so inconsistent with how they call things on replay it's embarrassing\nAnd I ... I mean we're ... we got AJ Hinch coming up is talking right now we're going to hear from him coming up in a few minutes his impression what he thinks about the the play with ... and the first inning\nBut I I really don't understand I I Want to hear I Need to hear from Joe ... easier for major league baseball but again I'm probably not because today was a day where Rob Manfred decided well we're just going to find many Machado and\nEven though a story is less than twenty four hours old yeah the actors were stealing signs and and it was illegal and and we have five teams involved we conducted a comprehensive in investigation and decided there's nothing\nTo see here and this story has closed funny it was a defensive move based on what other teams might have been doing you don't buy that excuse [laughter] you don't believe that he had like a hundred percent that that's exactly what they were doing this story broke twenty four hours ago five teams had yes we complained a major league and all the ashes of stealing signs we'd have astro Spygate\nAnd instead of well we got to look into this baseball says no we had a comprehensive investigation and we believe the Astros were taping the red Sox to make sure they weren't doing anything illegal we've warned all the teams to say hey don't do this anymore\nCase closed Rob Manfred Mike I I don't know who I get disappointed in more it's like Rob Manfred\nAnd Adam Silver have hold my beer contest oh you think on a barrel thing Ofeibea watch this Rob Manfred and Adam Silver want to do nothing they never want to do anything they were afraid to have an impact on the game this is now free things that you're going to figure that the major league baseball say\nWe stand behind her on pious when clearly they blew that play they clearly blew that play because there's nobody that can tell me that\n... was in the field of play the fact that his glove touches the fans who are not reaching over I mean there there's a there's a there's a full foot foot and a half between where the fences and the line is and where the fans hands are\nWell that's the biggest thing based on the way the rule is explicitly written it's not fan interference if the player goes into into the crowd is it\nIs at their own peril like the way they\nPhrased it that kind of grandiose terminology but the fact of the matter is you got the glove closing\nAnd we can argue based on the different camera angles how much of that was that's closing it himself versus contact with a fan and was he ever going to catch the ball anyway because the ball seemed to be coming a inches\nGood nine to twelve inches away from\nWhere his glove is at that moment like I don't agree with with ... I agree with everybody else uh is that as the world's about is I don't know how you assume it out\nWell you know and that's one thing that I don't know can you look at the replay because I just I I don't believe that the fan made that closes love he was closing his level rather looked at me like you know it's already coast that ball\nHe was not going to catch it right he's not going to catch that ball because he's jumping up and he's putting his glove up there he is not in a position to catch the ball he is going into the stands and try to make an incredible catch now I don't know if that's part of the review process I mean I'll I'll tell you when I Know stuff and don't know stuff\nIs that part of where they can look at it and say for fan interference can they interpret it and say well he wasn't going to catch this ball and\nSo that so that's out the window is and I didn't know what it's gotta be an unwritten rule and that's the case because as this lays out it's the rules as if it's out of the field to play\nThere is no fan interference they've got to be reaching into the field of play taken further than wasn't ejected ... for interfering with a a bad a ball in play right isn't that the normal protocol\nJob if you're if you had a shot it out on the line or something and I had to reach over\nYou're out you're getting a nice security escort to the to your seats\nUh and then grab your stuff and then we're going to take you out in a in a way you go into the parking lot for a good night\nHere fan was evidently talk to for a minute or two but didn't get himself injected so the that and that's in Congress you might as well just put up the the Plexiglas I wasn't like hockey then everything ... monster sure\nSo you don't have any jumping over the fence unless they become super humans with pogo steaks and met a human Janelle running out in the outfield so we might lose a little bit of the excitement of my trout and blew the bats and these guys but we'll have fans banging on the glass in person to people so that's good\nWell they they don't apply at all but my beer where it's like people are saying hey I Know you gotta let them have a place for their beer

review we have to stick with Joe West call I I don't want to know what I Need that call to begin with and say yeah\nThat's that's gonna be interference well how do you decide it's obviously going to be caught like that's really where it comes down to in terms of a fan interference detailing that you interfered with a ball that should've been an easy routine routine play\nSteph Curry oral abroad taking the shot clock all the way down for a shop it's either going to win or lose a playoff game Ben intending made an all or nothing play he's either going to catch that ball with the bases loaded into action they are going to win or the ball's gonna bounce get five and they're going to lose\nAny made the play it was a gutsy play and pregnant banks his helmet down to these rounding first base not yet a shore base hit the Astros wind up losing in those two\nRuns they could have got at the end it might not an either we could still be playing an extra innings because of Joe West call and clearly UC replace fans are not reaching out to the field ... love is touching the fans the rules three sixteen and major league baseball states that\nThere is no fan interference when a player is in the stands to try to catch the ball and you look and see where the fans are looking buses lovers touching the fans the fans are not leaning over their hands are at at in right in front of them that's a home run\nBut let's hear from the manager Shelley oh let's get oh here's the Astros manager AJ Hinch a few moments ago meeting the media following the Astros lost the red Sox now up three games to one in his thoughts on the job west call\nIs your what did you think of the call on I was able to be what do you think uh what what what did what did I see I saw fan interference with just a couple of times or we have as a team and they deemed the fan reached over [noise]\nDirectory the ball looked like he was going to leave\nWe assume and you can assume a lot with because credible actually we assume he's going to make this spectacular cash jumping is hardly cannon uh [noise]\n[laughter]\nWants to fan reaches in you know pass a line of defense they were going to penalize hitters\nSo there is AJ here and I like his ah I like his first thing what'd you say what do you think I saw oh go ahead AJ Jay ... what do you got that what do you go what are you got [laughter] well now we're starting to get from the pool reporters oh\nI always I Love to pull reporters anything from an empire is always a pool reporter there's no cameras I didn't even think I I think it's just made up I think if someone comes out with a piece of paper and says yeah here's what Joe said here you are lucky cub reporter go give it to the rest of the media\nAll right so we got west to the pool reporter quote a band reached out of the stands and hit that's over the playing field and closed his glove west here's the whole plane hit the ball to right field he jumped up to try to make a catch fan interfered with him over the playing field that's why I called spectators here\nYeah it's like and and you can't tell me that a player it did in interfere over the playing field and this was the other part of it let's say you're on the side that it's too questionable right did you say it's too questionable because maybe the angle this guys reaching here all that\nIs that enough for ... that it's definitively fan interference then it's not ... but he called it like it was definitively fan interference and it wasn't it wasn't you're deciding that that's what he was tried I may play you just saw\nI don't really play because you know what I can see that there's no way ... even Joe what's there's no way he saw that there's no way he saw no chance and he's and he's he's being typical Joe West in his explanation on\nYour here yet and we got angles you're guessing that the fan reached over know that there's evidence of one of the fans in the front row he's got a brace themselves that there's some bodies flying and bats is getting about about the crash in but there's no evidence of that reaching over ... into the stands\nAre they in ads from orange drama and now the red Sox go up

what happens when you assume so it could be the you know assumed Berlin is going to pitch great\nBut I remember last year in the world series the Dodgers ended up winning both games he started I

lack funding triple the missing journalist returning\nNow I have a theory on this if there\nWere a lot of lawyers in the United states of America some would say too many I pointed out before that\nEvery year based on the number of people that take the bar exam we have roughly sixty thousand new attorneys\nIn the United states now they are not all practicing attorney some people for reasons beyond me go through the process or process they take the bar exam with no intention of ever actually practicing law\nBut there are sixty thousand new attorneys every year and the United states Venus has class action lawsuit written all over it with the Milwaukee Brewers have done\nIt if you bought a ticket to look at it this way it let's if you like news\nI'm trying to relate to the common man let's say like music you like Jay Z you're a fan of Jaycee Jaycee announces you know what I'm going to go on tour I'm going to go and it gives us with the opposite\nRight around ... you're going on in the middle east who are you going around the United states and you buy tickets to see Jay Z you like a big fan of Jaycee\nAnd you go and you spend a hundred two hundred bucks a ticket you know you go there with your significant other other are your friends you go see Jay Z he comes out on stage he starts performing midway through the first song\nThe stage manager manager comes out on a stage and says All right Jay Z that's enough at some other ... comes out there and start saying how would that go you go to a concert to see someone in the other person runs that that's one cracked cats that that's why he did with white Miley\nTotally opposite January it's the bait and switch and what about the kids what about the children that love way Miley he's their favorite player and they wanted to go see wait Miley pitch you hey ...\nWhat about the children the parents don't care about kids that's what I'm saying hey wait a\nMinute is one of the ... way mine is dignified he's a he's a stately man although he's a disingenuous man from his news cameras but\nJust think that the fans were deprived\nThat's class action lawsuit the brewers are going to get sued up the lawsuit for this and they showed they showed [noise]\nNow second point not to be overly dramatic because that's not my style to be overly dramatic and I certainly do I do not do snark I Do not do snack on the radio I Do not do that\nBut because you know that's just I Do other stick that's not much but this is a\nPaying them make in baseball\nI this is a is a pandemic it is now\nI Would put this on par with what the NBA has had the last couple of years where players are Jerry rigging the schedule except this is the playoffs now I you know in the NBA playoffs players\nMissed games during the regular season now the ... the reason they start to the NBA season way before they should have started the NBA season\nWas because they wanted to give them more days off because the minute the NBA players are delicate little flowers and they you know they can't work back to back days because they they actually just they melt when they they play back to back this and so that's become a thing and the Jerry rigged the schedule\nTaking healthy days off to rest up for the playoffs a and it's it's absurd\nRight but this is also upset Rob Manfred and the powers that be neat to nip this in the bud and they won't do it\nBecause they don't do anything to sit on their hands that's baseball management style to sit on their hands while saying we don't like the ratings now we don't like the attendance is not going the right and but it's it's it's ridiculous Rob Manfred the powers that be have an opportunity to do something it's bad for baseball\nIf you catch in illness you fight the illness when you find out if you catch it early you got a chance to beat it your chances go up if you let it get out of control you are doomed\n[noise] now one last point\nAnd it needs to be city the Dodgers have a better rosters I pointed out then the brewers we can agree on that they gave me one that knows baseball knows the Dodgers have a better team than Milwaukee but have you also noticed that the brewers are losing the mental\nPart of this now what do I mean by that\nCraig council literally bitches about everything that happens during the game he complains about everything now they're turning to decoys like that they've now gone to the deep coy card\n... clearly they didn't think branding Woodrow was a qualified enough Petrou to go against the meat and potatoes the of the Dodgers lined up and so they decided well we'll help 'em out we'll put weight my way out there for five pictures I'm also convinced that the brewers\nThe Dodgers are in their head so much being a spit roasted here recently that\nThey're convinced every single player to Dodger uniforms dirty I and there's this great injustice against the Milwaukee Brewers by these players led by many Machado and friends\nOr even the first dating there was a play at second base max Muncie tagging the runner Lorenz okayed and K O pushed me off the bat you slip past the bags stupid that's what you did\nComplain whining and complaining and all that\nBut the Dodgers are winning the mental warfare\nPart of the ... the series is what they're doing and it's great and this is what it is\nAnd they have to because they are not a dominating offensively they're making some very marginal pictures look very good is what they're doing well let's hear from the the the man of the hour here they won that complains about everything Craig council\nAnd he explains his disingenuous this honest decision with the five pitch starting pitcher weighed Miley\nSo we were going to do all along the way it is going to pitch game six men always if if we went down three one way we're considering having away pitch this game man although now this was this kind of what we were ah were decided we're going to do\nYeah who's going to pitch game one of the world series while you have to ask the Dodgers that cause the brewers will be watching so de Robertson\nThe key for analytics department will have the decision to make on that ah here's more from a crack house who admits\nHe's ... at least I've given this isn't meeting the brewers just aren't good enough so they're trying to essentially a push the rules\nThey're trying to get match ups were trying to get matchups there are very tough team to get matchups against and um we were able to get what is the match ups\nYeah how's that going count would pose a credit counseling seriously I'd be

not made up for the radio that was from the Cold War I hate you\nKind of stuff\nI was so terrible that works up by a like a three and a half minute phone call from Chris in Houston your word ...\nCalls who get more down most\nOf the guys are starting to start you know they we got a lot of the legend of the show the key members of the amount of Moshe are branching out doing podcast who would get more downloads though\nReal talk or Christian used\nWho win the podcast download battle between these it'd be real talk by far and not necessarily because he'd be better or would have a better show but it's the polarizing people will flock to listen just hate on it\nYeah it's race the Israelis racy and he's on the age and all he is I it's the best show on Fox where maybe you've heard

a two year deal with the warriors and according to at least one insider the NBA is hoping that he go somewhere else next season than you think it would really help the or the lead for him to leave [noise]\nYes by all means to be good for talk radio I'm worried about me it gives us stuff to talk about new stuff is interesting and a couple of weeks now eight people get excited about the transaction the anticipation not only would add a layer of injury\nTo see how the warriors would handle Duran leaving\nBut to see how he handles it\nIn a relocation situation in the if the Iran\nWe just we warriors\nThen it will be ridiculous to go play for another super team he's going to have to go out and do it again right with somebody else who's going to have to recreate something so you think New York with the Knickerbockers or the morbid Knicks or come to LA and play for the clippers the blue collar clippers one of those facts\nThat are a couple more years left on your lap that's just funny [noise] so there are a couple more years left on Clayton curve shot seven year contract the Dodgers but\nPersonal has an opt out clause after this season yeah been do you want him to opt out [noise]\nYes and no by main answer is yes I I'm not convinced he pitched well congratulations I don't trust\nDon't trust the man\nAnd that scares but I I mainly concerned if Chris shops out it was kind of got two years left in this country [noise] my concern is that if you opt out that the Dodger ownership will do something irrational and instead of having you on a contract for two years they'll send them to a five year contract\nThink you can get enough toothpaste out of the two for a couple of years with Kurdish off\nWhat he's going to be thirty one next season he's got a lot of

see what I heard\nWhat facts if any did he find a jak Callahan Fox News secretary of\nThe late great Tommy Hawkins he passed away recently us up to me is ... maybe it was two years ago maybe last year\nI forget exactly what battalion Hawkins was an executive with the Dodgers but before that he was a basketball player in the NBA and one of the nicest people I ever met in professional sports was Tommy Hawkins and Tommy\nOne time told me a story when he was with the Minneapolis Lakers I Want to tell you how life where there was a different time writes back in the Nineteen sixties but Tommy Hawkins was on the Minneapolis Lakers for one year and then the franchise relocated to Los Angeles and so Tommy Hawkins was on the original LA Lakers team when they move from Minneapolis\nAnd he told me how people didn't care about the Lakers when they moved to LA and it was so bad and the Lakers you know such a hoagie time I guess in sports history and in in just in life that Tommy Hawkins said\nThat he and some of his teammates before games the day of a game\nWould go on a flatbed truck with a bullhorn and they drive around neighborhoods in Los Angeles inviting people to come out and see the Lakers play that night against the\nWhoever the Cincinnati Royals and the St Louis hawks in the Syracuse Nationals and and no telling me out because he he the way he told the story was was romanticize those were good memories for him it was a different time and all that now the Lakers are\nAre you know again not my my choice but other people seem to enjoy them and they have a a pretty decent following how can you imagine Philip Rivers\nAnd Gordon and these guys in both uh getting on a flatbed truck the morning charger game with Pearl horn saying come out and see the chargers this afternoon when we take on the Denver Broncos\n[laughter]\n... those were different times I I Know those were different times\nBut the real question is do the NFL Owners have the patience to wait this out I say no\nI that no one has patience anymore we the the old line a goldfish has more patients than we do a ... the way they pay attention they pay attention longer than we do a their attention span so\nThe planet been for the span of his family to eventually sell the team they anticipated the value would skyrocket in the LA mark hasn't happened right is it ever going to happen what we don't know yet it could turn around the charges are pretty good team this year\nAnd they certainly look like they've got a chance to win the AFC while not when the AFC West 'cause the the chiefs will but they have a chance at a wildcard birds\nAnd the AFC so it could be a playoff team\nAnd we'll see how that shakes out but what is the endgame let's say the chargers don't turn this around the people just don't buy it and the people from San Diego continue to boycott now the assumption many you're making is that will move back to San Diego\nThat's not a lot I I Would say there's a less than twenty percent chance of that I'm going to give you a wild scenario which\nIs he's going to blow your mind okay how about this to their\nThe chargers moved to Las Vegas\nHow about an eleventh hour switch by the NFL they say you know what the people of Vegas would support the charges because it's new it's professional football they go out and support the charters why don't we just put the raiders in LA within ray [noise]\nAbout that [noise] I could point out of getting a standing ovation from\n\nWe have record Ralph here somewhere he's using a sandwich van ... exactly what I was going to say right now no job really\nWouldn't it wouldn't work then why not wet blanket coup aloof why not well while I I Do believe that LA would welcome the raiders with open arms they would already have\nI don't think that Vegas would welcome the charters I think you're wrong there no they would the chargers are two lame from Vegas [laughter] ... yeah they don't they don't have that I mean as much as I hate the raiders the charges don't even have that same kind of swag Iran's the brand\nNow now the thing is is it how many have you ever go outside outside the strip coup have you ever been there were people actually live life in Vegas not in the strip would actually have like normal houses in\nIn ... yeah ... areas yes yeah right on a regular people I guess but you wanna you want to appeal to so I mean sure maybe they'd have like a a fan base of all the people that live in Vegas but you if you move your team there you want the tourists you want you know everybody that's coming to gamble people would\nGo but people would go to Vegas to see what were the chargers play anyway we'd be the same thing like in LA when they go to cars and\nI'll tell you I'll tell you this what when I heard the raiders you're going to Vegas I thought awesome like I go to Vegas all the time I'm totally down to just you know cannot raiders game have no interest in seeing a charges game the lessons against the Broncos okay fine\nNo but my point is that it's like they they you know you've got a sure thing if the raiders if they flip the teams at the eleventh hour said you know what will just can put the raiders in LA\nThe colors don't even sound like Vegas the powder flew in and buy and oh my God and black and silver that's begun\nAnd marketing for two years the el camino was a combination Sudan

who are baseball writers is fat and lazy they didn't investigate this they didn't look into this is what baseball said there's nothing to see it has nothing to see\nThey're helping cover up the story\n[noise] number two it's clear what happened major league baseball does not want to deal with this I'd so\nThey use the term thorough investigation Rob Manfred should've just announced after spending no time we determine we don't care it's really shoot up and now it's that would've been\nThe proper statement and he could have finished the statement by say by the way I watch the playoffs on Fox Sports one and Turner\n[laughter]\nAt the very best if you're giving baseball the benefit of the doubt this was one sided right baseball started with the conclusion and then work backwards to come up with that conclusion although I don't even think they put that much effort into it the Astros we mentioned this the other day it bears repeating the Astros used an excuse\nMade by Chris ... who was the cheating cardinals old executive that's what he said in a courtroom a federal courtroom\nAnd how does that go he spent four years in the gulag using the same issues that major league baseball bought Korea said the reason I was committing espionage on the Astros is because like I think the Astros are spying on the cardinals\nAnd he got four years in jail for that major league baseball when it's the Astros\nI agree that's what they were doing\nSo I conducted my own independent investigation and I've certainly the Astros are guilty what's my evidence fourteen percent of the twenty nine teams not named Astros believe Houston's dirty\nAthletics Indians Dodgers check check check now what were they doing\nBut we don't all the details the early reports say rhythmic clapping to indicate fastball breaking ball banging uh\nGarbage can with some kind of estimate the indicate again fastball breaking ball in addition that bad actor who was photographed with blood on his hands at the murder scene ... what kind of investigation is\nSee Saudi Arabia and like it but it's the issue is what it is it just paint over the ... were good that management Tony right is more my evidence you know what he did when the poop hit the fan he changed\nHis Instagram profile removing the fact that he was an Astros employee does that sound like someone who's an innocent man or does that sound like someone who's trying to you know paint over the blood spots on the wall yes\nCover your tracks and we haven't even\nGotten into the increase spin rate there are other major league baseball player shot a Cleveland Indians who suspect the Astros are cheating using spit balls or doctor and baseball and Rob Manfred who lives in that Manhattan bubble he has his blinders up\nAnd he's mimicking Leslie Nielsen from that great scene in the naked gun move on nothing to see here please the spices\nAnd the baseball writers many of them yeah you're right make sure I get those free hotdogs yep where to go to our last word here that isn't as big a joke as the Peyton Manning investigation by the NFL\nPeyton Manning was caught much like this do red handed using his wife has a drug Newell by the fine investigative reporting of al Jazeera did a great job\nIn the dark side documentary which is still available on YouTube assuming YouTube doesn't go out the painting denied it said all these nasty things in a interview that was all choreographed the NFL had their associates bury the story\nTo give you an idea I I remember this kind of stuff that the fertilizer that was being served up by associates of the NFL\nWhoever wrote that America shoved out and where the sun don't shine this is a\nQuote from someone who was a a network broadcast at that time on Peyton Manning\nHeat many Payton he said he didn't do it\nIf he said he didn't do it it didn't happen then it didn't happen he didn't do it that's it that quote came from key Shawn Johnson who was working as an NFL broadcaster ESPN he said he he uh paint and he said he said he didn't do it if he said he didn't do it it didn't happen that he didn't it didn't happen he didn't do it that's\nHow about this this is Jim from Jim Nance it's a story that's on all levels a non story\nHere's the problem in court\nMany of the claims made by al Jazeera's investigative team against Peyton Manning wife were proven correct\nThe HGH worship to Manning's house and the wife was the cover yeah\nWhere's gymnasts where's key Shawn Johnson I don't know where these in these bozos are but we'll get to the bottom of this high crimes and misdemeanors the Astros edition the Astros will be expose all this will come out you know what's going to come out\nWhen guys start writing books that someone is going to come out a couple of years

run as much as four miles during a game we use another fact\nYou might not know that's actually really helpful if you need to buy a car true car also helps people get used cars that's right true car

Broncos are one and a half point favorite in this game the pick is in\nThe back\nUp and [noise] I'm taking the cardinals are they the car to get a couple of reasons why the storyline is Vance Joseph is you know the ... they're fighting for his job the players you know rally around their embattled coach don't hold your breath\nThings have gone upside down just like the red Sox broadcaster there the Broncos\nHave had the lead for just twelve percent of their all offensive snaps lowest rate in the league if you get smashed by the jets you can get smashed by the Arizona Cardinals Denver's a bad football team\nThey dropped four straight games Vance Joseph is record on the road as an atrocity since he took over as the Broncos coach their defense has already quit I don't see a change here your case Keenan puts up some decent numbers but a lot of ... forest errors\nThe Broncos also have a achieve divisional game next week against the Kansas City chiefs of rematch dare\nI say key that's if you think Denver's a good team and be but I don't think there's much difference between the Broncos and the cardinals Arizona's not a good team either\nBut I I've seen how terrible the Denver\nDefense has been against the run and I look at David Johnson over there and I said boy he hasn't had that breakout signature game yet this could this should be should be the game and in spite of Josh Rose [noise] the cardinals thirty one Broncos twenty seven [noise]\nThursday even though the giants poop to bed last week pennies picking the Broncos sure pays picking the bronco\nIs the best show on Fox
