you're\nNot winning a lot of games with three hits and then in the evenings where you do potentially have the opportunity to do really caused some addict and and chase the starter and do damage you lean we get one or two runs and you're retired Dodgers that for the ad price on the ropes\nAnd they didn't knock him out they didn't get the big knockout blow to yeah they score to one and momentarily add the lead but that was it was a great threat\nAnd wet quietly into the night and then once they took the lead into fist after the\nRBI single for Martinez that play that you made it for

I don't want to be part of your stupid tieing aligned and rather than take a walk which\nWould have forced\nTo my knowledge would've or would it would blow to the base is right what if we continue the the merry go round situation but rather that kick here and then there's the size you know what I Do\nI Am going to swing I Am going to swing from for the heavens and and uh yeah you know what his signature moment he struck out on hold on some high cheese by a by David Price and then we got the head but if if you know Enrique that's his like his given name\n... been on base then\nIt would've been a resort and and now you are you know what a signature moment is up for this postseason I looked it up his signature moment as a Dodger this postseason ... is is telling the Dodger fans that they were to blame for a lawsuit against the Milwaukee Brewers\nThat's his signature moment is a Dodger and the post season this year what a bomb what an absolute ... and he's batting now own Ninety four\nIn this post season and for some reason\nHe is not being handcuffed to the bench they Roberts keep sending him out there and the analytical department the Dodgers keep sending ... Hernandez out there he's hitting own Ninety four\nNow the Dodgers appointed land they played Milwaukee they're now in the world series they've got a guy heating under a hundred so essentially when they ... Fernandez placing the games in LA they will have to automatic outs in a line up with the picture spot\nSo then if you're the red Sox pitcher you only have to worry about seven players you don't have to worry about that it was to automatic outs that's rest up times we just talk down to mental let them headed\nAnd what what about Chris Taylor Chris Taylor last you reminded me of pall mall toward and even the beginning of a plus the world series he has not only been a baseball player he is sucking All right I don't\nHappened or none of them you know spell or food to some of my Red Sox friends put on Chris Taylor but he's over five and he's drowning in the playoffs drowning and\nFor reasons beyond explanation\nThe Dodgers who've been criticized repeatedly by some of their biggest fans for not wanting for not taking advantage of opportunities to advance runners we're the bond Chris Taylor decides when they're down by two runs that this is the time the but [laughter]\nNo not when they had a couple of runners on and nobody out earlier that you could have\nGotten arena runners the second third or the other situations that have come up\nNow this is the time and uh yeah of course you know just hand delivering an out hand delivering an out when you don't get the benefit of advancing a run another party shot in the LA often\nThey went limp I saw the Fox broadcast there were plenty of commercials for products that can help when you go limb maybe the Dodgers at a cost some of those up ah because my God after the fourth any\nStuff for thing when you asked your HP we had that big hit for the Dodgers they decided when they fell behind that seat or even that J. C. L. A. they're boys out of here\nYou know what they did they actually left the that they left the dog out they went up to the ... the runway there they walked up to the clubhouse the visitors' clubhouse they took it over they went over to Logan Airport and they waited for their equipment to calm so they can get on a flight back to LA\nThey lost the lead and they lost their will they raised the white flag\nIs what they did it was both toothless and spineless offensive baseball the red Sox have good pitching the Dodgers have good party but what happened to the ... I was praising them for their moxie and they're fighting spirit in game one\nNone of that I take that back I take it back then none of that\nAfter the fourth any none of\nThey were going through the motions they looked over my they look like they didn't belong in the same feel with the red Sox they at the final sixteen but is it a game\nOut out out out you want to keep going out out out out out\nSeven mostly week ground ball out for a strike as how about the the the cherry on top of the Sunday ... money grand daughter who is useless striking out window shopping Randolph\nHe comes off the bench and looks at the pitch go into the catch is Robyn amazement and then me clean walks away oh no see him again patch you\nThree weeks fly ball out it's only a couple a line drive pathetic play like ... like a bunch of light weights as what they did\nAnd you don't want my most upset with Steve this egg ... he told me the Dodgers going three in a row and he lied to me he lied to me how dare he said they were going to win three in a row and they didn't win three\nHundred ... hold on male quota to go to the tapes on the pocket or well I hear you saying that a couple of times last night I didn't say anything well you certainly intimated that no actually my exact quote was is it reasonable to think about ... the authors can get the David Price and they had him in that inning and\nThen what we've seen so many times this year you know games one and two I never got the feeling Boston was kind of lose ... either game at any point in either game and they weren't as long as the days of but they just not been critical refers to shock\nWave it they really only scored three legitimate runs I'm not counting the walk because that was a gift don't count the bases loaded walks I don't ... so he scored three runs that's it three runs\nWell you could go back to the first game in Milwaukee where the Dodgers had essentially ... including [laughter] it's just\nYou don't win championships like that you can ... Hernandez I thought his signature moment of these playoffs was game seven that Milwaukee when they put 'em at second base and he went to his right on the ground or to his left I thought that was his highlight of this ...\nHow are you saying he's fundamentally unsound is that what you're saying\nHe's having a bad month let's leave it at that yeah [laughter] okay\nBut we did talk last night about foster any number of the twins are some Boston hitting with two hours and that's all they're doing all postseason it's just a continuation of the great on the regular host\nWhen there's nobody on base and two outs this is not a time to to implode this is not this is a time to celebrate and if you give up a hit with two outs that's not the end of the world that's right I mean it's so ridiculous\nUnless of course you're the red Sox his batting average this postseason with two outs in runners in scoring position is over four\nHundred well for the month there do for a regression doesn't mean they are they are which we agreed last night however yeah well you know what they need\nWhile the Dodgers were freezing their ass off like a bunch of push the willows at Fenway the red Sox when they come the Dodgers stadium they're going to melt that's right you're going to melt in that LA he by\nHigh eighties this weekend high eighties\nWhy are those guys who are they all the you know what they I got an idea about this ... beds in JD Martinez and all those Red Sox guys they are going to overdose on ... on sun tan lotion how 'bout that\nThat's another thing I said on the show last night ... is too good not to break out three hits than I\nEver really want to break ground followed face and all that one of the ground ball and\nThree hits for runs throughout two games to none of these are the facts and I don't like [laughter] you know I don't need your fat [laughter] I mean these stupid fat okay yeah yeah I mean the ... more about feelings in fact this is why I've\nRyan ... was it not a problem when you were in Philadelphia why was that not a problem or Kansas City ... was it a problem now what's up with that I Need access to a man answers\nMeanwhile the amount of emotion is one thing about the amount of emotion I had to you guys are so understanding your so supportive I there's no negative people here you're ... you're so positive every one of you I Love you all\nAre here's a are if he writes and he says I Hope the Dodgers fired Dave Robert's on the LAX tarmac he's [laughter] the link Kevin yeah that'd be good or at least fire the analytics crew Taylor bunting tweak not in position\nYanking pitchers in solving players again they just let baseball blow exact don't over think baseball that's tomorrow\nActually and we didn't get into this enough last night okay but we did mention remember to one caller last night if Roberts weren't wasn't doing things the analytic way\nNo front office would just be on the higher ... they were just tired of what else is the way or the highway guess who doesn't have a contract for next season by the way they Roberts and he has no games with the analytic waste time they robbers to to start ... Hernandez with a\nNinety batting average or the ... exactly yeah there's thank you for bringing that are they as you say it's a left handed starter so we don't want like someone Ballenger Peterson or some left hand but you don't have a\nIn the box when you have any ... starting this John\n... you're pretty much habits like weekend at Bernie's when you when you have him about his box that's what you got going on\nAnd a buddy of mine who I've known for you is one of my old gambling buddies he was he's not a Dodger fan or Red Sox fan he knows that I had\nSome joy and both these things and he he's taxing me he says\nIs the Dodgers goal to play every second baseman they can possibly play in the starting line up they had they had does your does he was actually playing second base but they had ... Hernandez who occasionally play second the months he came in the game later but he didn't start the game Machado I guess could play second but they had\nTailor it was a parade in basements in the\nHands on the shift Justin Turner often play secondary yo\n... they they had to sit some kind of World Series record for most second baseman\nActually Chris Taylor didn't they set a record for game one and three positions something else he gay oh he came here and edits with three yeah ... yeah 'cause it was a I think each for those guys ... would do it in a way\nThat match and went out there and and had a ... they might as well put you can imagine\nBeing in a takeout we've seen that I think are really they're\nPutting Pedro by the guys who've been pitching best out of anybody in the Israeli tonight's dinner roll call there by if I Would have you know Dodger fan I Would I mean I wouldn't pick out there but if we can bring in somebody bringing your best really people were saying you know they should've left by if he had never spoken before by a Dodger fan\nAnd I want to complain about something else that bothers me then I and I we need to change this I'd like to change the rules of baseball because I feel like there's a great injustice done in baseball and I need to explain I'll do that\nThe minute we usually been rather show no calls right now I have a lot to say I have a lot of things I must express a bull press on from the guy go Fox Sports radio studios but right now Steve this eggers\nWho in late and you know what this is a good for your health by the way I support you getting this off your therapeutic or therapeutic yet it's a and not just for you certainly for some listeners as you well know game three friday night in LA\nOften lead the world series two games to that after beating the Dodgers again tonight fortitude JD Martinez the to run single and the fifth will keep that said three hits the why do you have to start with ... [laughter] I'll start with the Sacramento Kings game next time how 'bout that well a kings fan or a letter in Sacramento [laughter]\nDavid Price fixing to get that when he had been on night as a starter remember in the postseason until just last week saved Craig kimbrell the red Sox batting average this postseason with two outs and runners in scoring position over four hundred the twins are due to higher Rocco bell deli\nThey held the LA well that'll sell tickets age thirty L line them up in Minnesota Twins that gives with Rocco but so what I guess what they're really saying is that moms who is just too All right 'cause vault Delhi's manager of the year a couple of years ago yeah but I bought Delhi's younger I used that as more recent\nPlayer he plays all haven't years American League mostly with Tampa Bay mall to sue the twins for ages [laughter]\nI mean I Do is that where you're planning to maybe around here one day how the heck ... NBA Golden State Washington one forty four one twenty two as Steph Curry and three quarters of work\nHad fifty one points on three pointers pretty good curry was eleven for sixteen the Lakers aren't as yet the waiters weren't really trying to play the ... say well you could say that about a lot of wizards games in recent years according to\nThe Lakers were oh and three but one easily at Phoenix tonight one thirty one one Thirteen Devin effort by the sun or not really except for Devon Booker who looked like he was going to go off with a forty five we have predicted last night said he left with a strain hamstring so Booker\nThe sons played three good quarters and just one batch of course the bad quarter they got out scored by twenty\nUh yeah they gave up all at forty forty four in the second quarter yeah yeah do you take away that second quarter and the Lakers have a problem so maybe they can fish in the league\nDevon ... you take away the second quarter as I said well I don't think because I think the sun's why don't you think it's like ... you know going to the umpires every thirty he's asking you can ask yeah sure this is ... Lakers had a two point lead it in the first quarter\nThe sun's out scored the Lakers in the third and fourth quarter\nSo if you take away the second quarter the sun's won the game [noise]\nThe ... yeah I don't think that as we call Adam Silver wake him up someone we'd like to do that\n[laughter] no I don't think that our anyway Booker finished with twenty three point seven ... seven assist and

argument wow these these shoot people they need to go to jail because they were manipulating these basketball players future for personal benefit\nThat's farcical what that is\nIt is absolutely for sure if all the big schools were offering big money let's assume that to be the case 'cause I think you're pretty naive if you don't think that's the case what happened here is these players took the

bragged about that it was different\nThey never mailed it in the you know you can have baseball teams give up and throw up the white flag and basketball teams do it but it does not part of the football DNA it's not how can you feel\nThey deliberately uncompetitive roster that's not what for poor people do well [noise]\nThe giants and the raiders there in the middle of a demo you watch HDTV if you're gonna you know upgrade your house you have to do the demo I ever give you give somebody a sledgehammer glad it so they're demolishing their roster\nAnd they are reluctant to publicly admit that this is going on John crude and I love John ... for these quotes because John grown and has a public position that Oakland is still trying to win\nThat hey we're getting up at four in the morning and five in the morning we're not doing this because we want to lose so that's just public position while privately he is removing the kitchen counter out of the the raiders locker room and he's replacing the cabinets in the locker room and holding a Jack hammer while he's doing it per se not is not going to\nThis is not going to he's smiling\nAnd to the radio thing I get a little\n... the ... thing the mindset is hey let's take a page out of the rams play book the rams didn't even give a damn once they determine we're moving to LA they had announced it publicly uh but they were bad anyway before that but they went Superbad they went super duper bad when they were in St Louis last couple of years and and now\nWe're hiring the proper coach and spend the money of free agency it's like the perfect storm now and the rams have this this fine roster and all that and they're set up pretty good\nFor the last couple years so that the goal the raiders I guess I don't really care about the people vogue when they're going to say publicly they care about the people of Oakland but they don't really care about people in Oakland doesn't matter stadiums that toilet bowl them you know they're moving to Vegas the building a stadium right on the raiders right near the Mandalay Bay there in Vegas and so they've got that going on\nAnd they're trying to time it exactly right\nWhere once that stadium opens up the raiders will have the fruits of the the ... and they will benefit and then they'll spend some money and free agency and when they get there to Vegas will be the greatest show on the strip in Vegas I write off Las Vegas boulevard there there'll be man will they be more of those\nNow in a dish trust the process right now this is an annoying\nCatchphrase this this NBA disease from Philadelphia and it just I guess starting to affect the giants and there's a the the Cleveland Browns have been doing this for years and Roger Goodell and his buddies\nShould have some banks and they can sit on their hands if they want but the casual fan I get the casual fan that that bright the uneducated family love these these roster dumps because they get excited about draft picks I ... and it's it's the easiest\nCon game it's a parlor game he strapped picks you can always sell the future of draft picks because it's unknown you can say this is gonna be the greatest quarterback in the world is gonna be the greatest linebacker they're gonna raise receiver they haven't done anything and by the time they actually play it's like you're on to the next ...\n... and many of the the fan base is by this because they're not that bright it's the same crowd who think you know\nI'm going to win the mega millions up some doping rural South Carolina ended up winning the ah went into one point six billion whoever that one\nSo you know hoarding draft capital seems like a good idea but it's a fool's gold ... most of these ... don't live up to the building the hype you get quantity over quality oftentimes\nYou get a lot of hype ... me or the equality and generally speaking the teams at the top of the draft continue to suck for generation\nThey only marginally get better the bangles or a great example is the bagels were horrible for years and then eventually they became average and occasionally they make the playoffs they don't want a playoff game but they're competitive but they had tons of bad drought picture it took a draft picks for years\nHere's my theory by my theory is\nThat you don't ignore the draft you can't ignore it it's a necessary evil but you can't make it the centerpiece of your operations\nAnd I use the patriots the shining example\nPerennial championship contenders\nBill Belichick has not had a top five pick his entire tenure in New England not one top five ...\nHe did have the number six pick and Twenty one that was Richard Seymour but for the past Seventeen years it has mostly been nothing but late first round pegs trading out of the first round altogether\nOr sometimes not even having a picking the first or second round\nBill Belichick takes players off the scrappy he uses other teams as minor league system he uses the Buffalo Bills with the Detroit Lions they draft players it doesn't quite work out in those cities they come to New England they turn out to be good plus he he does this thing called it's amazing coaching players up\nTaking them off the scrap heap and getting them guys it either are drafted lower maybe they're not great in other cities or\nEven on non drafted altogether and turns them into a fishing players and the F\nBut this is this is like the plague if you bring this last observation taking as a general philosophy in the sport of football should not be celebrated and those that celebrated a bad people Derek Jeter can stay in baseball and take all the ones with the Marlins have a good time\nBut it's making a deal with the devil and the ... the average career in the NFL anyways like they says about five and a half years I guess the study that came out a couple of years ago or give or take five and a half years so you're in a tank and then by the time you're good these guys will be out of somebody's got to be out of the NFL altogether\nWhite comes that fast and I have a visualize for years NFL Draft is the biggest\nCrap shoot in all the dress because there is no telling who is going to be the best player in a given you guys you will get a twenty Nineteen mock drafts and they've got Nick ... is being hyped up as this great defensive player from the Ohio a form of the of the Ohio State university\nBut no guarantee that he's going to be a dominant NFL players don't get it all and it it might not be number one but it could be some guy you've never heard from a directional school in Michigan\nWho ends up being drafted in the fourth or fifth round it turns out to be looking looking Antonio Brown Antonio Brown wasn't like a top pick any been wonderful for the Steelers there are plenty of examples like that we say hello to Steve the savior who's right over there\nTo have me borough I looked at the twenty Thirteen NFL Draft just randomly when you said that or do you know that only a two of the top twelve selections in that first round have made the ... only to going back five\nYears and everyone makes a pro ball because the guys don't want to go to the pro ball and then they make their added on the roster\nShy and are you aware sir that your Dodger is facing the Boston Red Sox here in the world series and in a few months it could be your rams against the New England

see how this plays out and they say like if they lose Rogers better than us well you know you go out with little tough it's a little determination that\nThose are not bad things which show some

welcome\n[noise] it's time now [laughter] [noise]\nAnd it is we ate in the national football league it kicks off with a Thursday night\n[noise] put balls situation and yes it is on Fox you need to watch the Miami Dolphins that foreign three the Houston Texans at four in through the Texans should be for two and one at best they've got three of their wings were gifted\nVia incompetence by the other team but it's on Fox and yes Joe Buck on his way to LA you will stop in Houston which is actually good for him breaks up that long coast to coast flight against the jet stream so we'll stop and Houston and called the game on Fox tonight and every media critic will celebrate the hustle\nJoe Buck traveling first class\nTo call a football game ... should win the Nobel Peace prize for that or what a tremendous acts of courage anyway [noise] I Can't because I care\nSo the Texans opened up a seven and a half point favorite the line is still at seven and a half the public loves Houston and in this game almost eighty percent betting\nOn the Texans I get it I understand the logic behind that but I'm going to go sideways I'm going to take the Miami Dolphins a small play on the dolphins but a play nonetheless I I'll tell you why\n[noise] hey\nI'm uncomfortable with the Texans being favored by more than a touchdown considering their quarterback situation and the way the team has played most of the year I feel like that's an unrealistic number to reach and I get that Miami's defense blows the dolphins are they have been\nBetter on the road though than they've ever been home they have to figure out how to stop the run that's been a problem but you can make adjustments that does happen the dolphins actually average more yards for play than the Texans on often put that in the\nFiles of hard to believe and B why do generally like home teams are you listening to me I usually pick the home teams on Thursday night we've seen that go sideways a little bit [noise]\nUh recently but the Sean watching belongs in a full body cast at this point you can call me a clown all he wants the Texas home favorites in the bill Brian era had been favor [noise]\nWhether it be by a little bit or a lot twenty five times they're two games above five hundred as the home favorite in the bill O'Brian here that's not very good\nThe dolphins defense has to clearly step up keep the game post you put eight men in the box you focus on the running game you're forced to Sean watching in his fragile delicate body to make plays\nCall it ... veins\nNot to win the game but the cover the spread\nTexans Nineteen dolphins Thirteen ended up penny back [noise] and he agrees\nWith your band do the dolphins alright pick that up I'll be watching because there's nothing else to watch off [laughter] so I'm ... the hell else you know watch some random NBA game or a terrible game was wow\nWell see I don't know what will the Sean walks and make it through the game will he ended up in the injury ... owner that changes the whole thing you go to the backup quarterback and then we're like wow we\nBringing steam this shaker right on the ...\nNFL on Fox TV and college football on fs one Thursday nights number Thirteen West Virginia host Baylor tomorrow\nYou have any new negative statue you want to throw that hey if you do you know who the backup\nQuarterback for the Texans is it's not time Savage a no no it is brain didn't we\nAll just shown watching as one twisted ankle or one ...\nAway from brain than we do you want brand and we didn't as a seven and a half point favorite if you're a gambler I Would say no to save your hates game you're not again we get all the say you're a you know I hate is no I I don't have become legal the Supreme Court signed off on it\nYes yeah ah by the way you is not a negative that but you were talking the Dodgers didn't play my first month and a half sixteen and twenty five was the record that was the franchises worst starts in year one in Los Angeles they were on pace for nearly a hundred last year and made the world series\nThey were sixteen and twenty six Seventeen from that point forward they were pretty much even with the red Sox and the standings so they decided not to show up for the first month and a half and Justin Turner without\nMuch like your favorite ... like no one no one ... it's it's weird thing in baseball the culture of baseball where people are homeless against baseball teams and then I'll be the greatest record in basketball you see guys sandbagging your team's same back the other guy is not good\nAnd they still end up winning like last year the Golden State warriors did not have a better record in the Houston Rockets did that matter when they played in the in the play I don't know exactly my point acts\nLakers always topsy not at all\nSo my friends are ... who worked here for about two weeks and then he left us or is it about two or three months\nOr whatever but anyway ... good guys with veteran a media guy and radio guy and all that stuff\nSo he sends me that she says the Dodgers ... this is like you you must have sent this to him your shadow texting my friend said so so so ... is writing a book and he sends me mistakes he says the Dodgers are two losses away from going zero for their three back to back World Series opportunities\nIn the fifties seventies and now here in the twenty Seventeen to twenty Eighteen and he said if the Dodgers lose the world series\nThey will be the loan losing his franchise in the world series history with fourteen World Series losses if they do not come back\nI think I mentioned it last night the world series this would be losing fourteen out of the twenty in other words since Sandy Koufax retired they've won to write in fifty years\nAnd that is such a negative\nJust dealing with the facts here I mean how many somebody else has Thirteen losses in the little tiny ... has a mess the pessimistic I Am so ah so opposite view\nI Am so positive over here and you're sitting there you reject all my positive then valor yes Mr positive or negative over there it's very uncooperative is well how does already put up with you I don't understand uncooperative yes\nNegative Nancy at least you actually show up on my house is going to say you can you hear somebody else to do the differences one Ralph senior he's like the Dodgers those final sixteen\nOunce ground top off like a low key and that's that's my man Ralph right there yeah\nWell not everybody stays up normally 'til six am eastern I think that may have something to do with his not speaking for him but that may have something to\nDo it well again get some get some ... like you just like when you're standing in the dugout it's embarrassing when you're wearing mittens\nIn the world series you should never wear it I mean unless it's snowing and even then and trying to fix or were they officially license meant and yeah they had the Dodgers logo and oh well then they he had the support of major league baseball by a lot of people over and van eyes are going to be buying Dodger MIT [laughter]\n\n\nSorry it's a it's great yeah now I have some movies that are out a way\nSo when I called in the morning showing in Maine in the morning job I we talked a lot about Blair we were we were going over Blair's some of his work here it was fascinating Blair the caller for me\nIt's great my line
