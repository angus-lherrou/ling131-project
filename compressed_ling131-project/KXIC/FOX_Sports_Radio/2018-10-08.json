... at least eighty percent raiders fans have to charge your home game while and it was of course it was a lot of charger noise by the second half\nBut I've been there for a year and a half of games it's a great great setting for this twenty five thousand feet stadium and seeing NFL up close these three years that the chargers are playing in the soccer stadium in LA\nAnd it's a great atmosphere and you can bring the family and this was today of course with the raiders visiting the first fight I've ever seen in the stands in the year and a half but the church that been there to women against each other in the first row behind me and so\nWhat are they just go play at the local park that we'll just go ahead like they do with a few weeks football ... walking off with owns and we'll just watch from the south I Would just stand there I\nKnow these are better seats they actually go up a couple of levels there while\nSometime I by the way the Monday Night game Drew Brees ex charger quarterback yes over Seventy one thousand yards passing it his career he needs to old one to pass Peyton Manning for most all time tomorrow night to oh button that's happening and a mark Ingram is set to return from its four game suspension and its Adrian Peterson and Washington at\nNew Orleans tomorrow night course Peterson started last year with the saints\nUh one of the many things I Love about status in whatever sport you read it you think are you kidding me and for example you mentioned the chargers they've been in LA year and a half\nAnd not once said they had a touchdown on an opening drive in any game since they moved up here and you'd have to go back to twenty sixteen and San Diego it's been twenty two straight games and sad and open to drive down\nAnd yet Philip Rivers is still sensational\nThis guy and he played game number two hundred of his career last week five games this year Philip Rivers Thirteen touchdowns only two interceptions Patrick my home has fourteen touchdowns two interceptions just to compare how good a start this is through the season for him\nHe's now throwing more TD pass is against the raiders than any other opponent in his career when you've got the two today twenty six ten chargers was the final\nAnd Philippe rivers when he has a pastor rating of one twenty or better in a game the chargers record is forty and five today is ...\n... ... ... when this quarter back to ... percent of his passes ah there are a hundred and all that we do not like that at our why\nNot like that look at the Atlanta Falcons already good quarterback play and how are they doing and the charges do have running backs by the way already in five games about a thousand yards from scrimmage just from their two running backs\nMelvin Gordon in Austin at color but I said I Would mention the kicking because we mentioned on the show last week that the LA Chargers had just eight extra points since the start of last season most in the league hey they missed another one today and another try as well yeah such awful weather you know last year when the chargers tried for different characters\nFrom forty yards and beyond I mentioned this before they were three for eleven from long distance professional kicker is theoretically\nIt's always great that they're missing kicks in the soccer stadium I mean that's that's right\nDid I you're right Steve that instead of making a change kicker they change their holder this week that was right and working your lungs are already they regulate instead of changing the kicker they're like you know what let's go to older and I were to happen at punting had been like thirty four yards per cash so they got this veteran Donny Jones and he was forty two that today so\nVery good for him but Kirk Cousins Minnesota over three hundred yards passing thirtieth thirty seven in the win at Philly\nThirty completion for him first player in NFL history for for consecutive games of completing at least thirty passes at odd year age actually what I mean an ad on TV Lynn or the Vikings he was over a hundred yards receiving again on seven catches\nWait a minute wait a minute you're told what first quarter backed up thirty completion for games in a row correct at Dan Marino it's not I'm not with thirty completion snow because they don't use to attempt fifty and sixty pack ... check we are\nAlso Adam ceiling first player in the super bowl era so that's over fifty years to have at least a hundred yards receiving in each of his team's first five games of a season\nGo fake that's incredible as well to fact check\nThat one [laughter] she suddenly already hitched to act like you've got a little cocky later out you're going to say that I wouldn't have already spent on the air for years it's

I'm sure you all know by now a very ... get a call to go forward on fourth down\nPeople were crushing Pete Carroll for taking time out so here's the situation is for the one that a sea hawks are are down they get the whole they call a timeout and during that time out Sean McVeigh says\nAll right guys we're going for it's thirty three thirty one they're getting the ball back is Seattle looks like with a couple of a of a minute lab maybe a minute twenty left or something like that and\nThey decide you know what we're going for Jared golf quarterbacks need gets there first down here it's golf afterwards\nWe'll all the time to decide and he was kind of going back and forth and I was off that were piling on back on the field just to talk to one\nOfficials about something and some turnaround officers running back home and it's real [laughter] so I go to Sean I'm like all the excuse me\n[noise] I got one question for you sure what does that have to be snapped to the quarterback does he updates you take into this hands or touches hands that could you put it right back to the center for him to get the extra yard or whatever\nI think there's a rule about that\nBecause that will read the fumble risky but they stopped it because it's something\nThat why are you thinking that it because this worked so well they should have done something different\nLike well I I just think that sometimes if you're the quarterback you just get right up there under the center the center takes the ball a hikes if you were just touches your hand pose it back to himself and and one just forward for a yard if its fourth and then just you know\n[laughter] okay well you know I I don't I don't know if that's legal though I don't think it was legal I think it actually has to leave the centers hanging out that\nIs what I think the actual rule was but hey we've got a commercial break coming up and I can Google the hell out of that bad boy Sean McVeigh on his decision to go for it as\nWell I think really when you look at it initially to talk about putting it you look at the the belief that they had and how much they wanted to do it and because of their belief it made me feel confident and it made us as the coaching staff feel confident to make that decision and ultimately it's a good decision because they made it right\nAll right already who would you rather hear from a oh del vacuum or a patch trimmer all give us a motel back them first give me some that\nAre All right let's start with oh down\nFrom Sherman who was living with you I don't know and ask you I don't think that has this report you\nKnow I don't think that happened here is more\nIt had been on my heart honestly since the other thing it had been on my heart [noise] um and I think all the stuff that was both of his other just kind of came out in the wrong way I'm In touch with him and I as I can have a minute to talk to the same goes\nFor like we don't we don't know if we're not on the same page if it's not authentic and ... and we can all understand each other and then there's going to always miss you in ... so\nTo be able to do that was big for me I was nervous to get up and and and these are your brothers you see every day but once it up there in front of all of them a little nerve racking so I'm just excited about the way we pull together I'm like I said we came up short but we refer to them\nAnd that bothers you that Bob oil it's awesome yeah that's awesome [noise]\nAh it's and I know he's got to listen I'm telling you I Know Arnie you're going to have to be a Twitter to fend for him because he's going to get destroyed he's going to be called a prima Donna and he even said it you know I didn't uh I I didn't handle it it came out wrong is what he said and some of the ... were you told to apologize like yeah that that that didn't happen and I know we all have our sources\nTell us [laughter] I thought that was pretty awesome I Know it was All right\nThat was equally is awesome to me was patch armor\nOr a salmon after all the drama questions right now\nI'm going to go back to what I said All right I addressed it without a doubt\nI addressed it with our team I publicly declared that I didn't agree with his comments and I asked anybody that was interested if they want a clarification go to a hotel 'cause he's a big man now I'm not going to give the public a pound of flesh on this right that would make me small not strong and these are the kinds of things in my opinion\nWhen you have the locker room that we have that well helped galvanize caused a locker and took care of it and that's all I'm saying on it and eat though darn let's talk football not drama\nWhat do you what do you get mad at the media for why did you get bad at all done about three to talk about like that or like you are about the media\nIt never goes well when a coach makes it confrontational beach are tries to tell especially very aggressive very\nGood I guess you could say solid media like New York you know you're not going to ... I don't think you're going to win that battle unless you're winning games and I don't know last I checked they were ... one in four right now\nYeah you could talk like that to the media I'd like to see him talk like that too there are other coaches and see how that that will get\nThat has all come in when there was a melt down on the giants ... sideline to extending shepherd treat the hell out of a trash can and the water cooler but none of that game pointing out because of Dallas still how to to the right now for again\nThe lions punt ruled touched by Kevin king which actually hit a alliance Claire King place where the Packers ... said quote I'll just tell you this the ref told us the ball hit Detroit first but they still gave it to Detroit it is what it is maybe why we got off to a bad start but you have to place\nOr what but if the if the rest of the Detroit first and how could they possibly give it to them that I don't understand the replay\nOfficial overturned it so I wrote it up on replay though so because it changed the play changed the ruling on the field and I think his point was from a timing perspective if you really want to work out on this what you guys know I can watch that the official even after the replay but yeah you know it it hit the guy first and then all of a sudden you realize oh they're getting a ball first and goal to one\nSo yeah it was it was a disaster from that point forward\nBy the way it shut up to the rest of the Texans when today also the cowboys defensive completely forgot how to\nOr what to do that they're being paid to do shake my head well wait a minute that's that's from our uh our uh our technical director ... what it should be working on the show is sending out tweets I was just that space but I got\nA sorry about that a and Eric Holder oh\nWow wow oh wow you bought out\nBy aggregating cell phone buried hey don't don't do that today is not the day was yesterday the Dow I think that the cowboy got robbed and then I got to deal with Joe but yes yes well can I just like the the cherry on top of the sudden you know an ethical while your wife threatened only\nAnd that Eric rides a which will make Sean unhappy already how many times have the jags beat the titans recently Mm\nFive out of six to Tennessee the jags had their one chance last year either way it will be the patch and the AFC Intille Brady quits I doubt probably good for probably good for the local show but probably not so good for your health All right All right let's get your picks rowing say\nGot five of them so I'm only going to give you a couple of college you know there's not a great great matchups or in college football coming up so I go over a couple of the big ones which starts with Wisconsin going on the road to Michigan and I'm not by Michigan I mean\nThose sometimes they just look awful they can't even get out of their own ways uh hopefully all half of football uh and and all of a sudden you see that they're done like Seventy nothing now I'm not saying they can't win this game but I'm not going to go out and lay seven a nap gimme Wisconsin plus the seven and a half against Michigan\nAnd I'm going to take issue at all what the seven against Georgia\nGeorgia struggles in the first half on Saturday even though they pull the weight weight like forty one third team\nIf they do that to get on the road against LSU they will come from behind and when it give me pause to seven now are getting over to the NFL gave me as much as I can I'm selling my car's anybody want to buy a terrain or cruise or come by it\nA barely use just use it to go to church on Sundays gimme Kansas City plus the three and a half a gets delinquent matter of fact don't want to point the point of taking the points the chiefs will beat this over rated New England team which is everybody back on the bandwagon I ever to take the jets find is two and a half\nOr in their game against the cost was the culture the worst even football at all for Green Bay to bounce back outweigh the nine and a half again San Francisco who was to Arizona so there you have I fix do with them as you please remember they're strictly for entertainment purposes only\nSo that ... that\nYou're like you got it so you're taking el issue with the points but not necessarily taking them to be Georgia\nOh I was ... and now it's you win the game but I'm taking the points\nYou think she was going to knock off ... did I tell you stutter well I'm just I give you and I forgot I give you an opportunity to clarify and you can try to bow up but I don't

tied to the initial investment you've had enough to learn more visit PVA doubt or a public service message from paralyzed veterans of America\nHi I'm Janelle hail founder and CEO of the national breast cancer foundation early detection saved my life\nI mean every day I see I always city sockeye sports station and now all the University of Iowa sports we Gary are available via streaming at ... dot com\n[noise] plans for a celebration\nAnd in tragedy I'm an Carrick Fox News twenty people were killed Saturday in a limousine crash in the town of skull Harry New York west of Albany the limousine reportedly headed to a birthday party Chris Fiore with New York state police\nAnd Tom Coughlin in the brains in Jacksonville signed up for more torture who would say I would like to be waterboarded Tom Coughlin signed off on this that's that guy he's the big ... in Jacksonville he chose this path\nWhich is a dead end street for the jags they're wasting the prime years of these elite defensive players on Blake portals\nAnd again you can go out next week pass for five hundred yards no interceptions it three touch that it doesn't matter that I Know the real like bottles I Know the ... and Jacksonville did not have to give him a fifty four\nMillion dollar extension with that signing bonus and all that it's it's really a two year extension so this year next year for thirty six million dollars they didn't have to do it they did it and now you can watch that defense waste away\nBecause it's pretty difficult I think next to impossible to consistently when when you're trying to make up for three plus interceptions and a whole host of horrible decisions by your quarterback and there were off\nJacksonville had to get creative they had to bring in Bernie made off like financial people to find a way to get her cousins but it could have been done they had other options Alex Smith is not great but compared to Blake board will see is\nCompared to Blake borders Alex Smith would have been just what Jacksonville need high doesn't make the big mistake manage the game all the cliches you want to throw out things that like ... does not do the anti Blake ... any of those moves and there were others would have been better but\nThey chose the status quo and much like stagnant pond water Jacksonville off its continues to be the same you can't trust that the last word on this there are a small but\nVocal group of Blake board will power just\nThey're out there they're hidden like snakes and the grass is borders Apollo just\nNever his fall it's always someone else's fault of the blame game as well the office of minds banged up a lot about it and I bought it for that law by a you all for interceptions though were on pressure so don't play in the office of mine said why he's on his third different tackled shut up\nOn pressure and even when you are pressured\nThere's going to blow you away much says you can blow you away even when you're pressured as a quarterback in the NFL you're good quarterbacks do they don't always throw interceptions there's this thing called throwing the football away it's an amazing cause\nJacksonville is only chance he's for Blake Bordeaux stew out perform his ability I eat to Tibet on that if you're betting on that that's a losing proposition but then the yeah but ... well yeah but Joe Flaco did it for both yeah but Nick Boles did it last year yeah but he lived ...\nYet yeah but yeah but yeah but yeah but yeah but yeah but yeah but yeah but yeah but yeah but you have it yet it\nYet\nAre dozens for every Nick falls Joe Flaco rely manning that having a an out of body postseason there are dozens of other guys who never\nThat were documents otherworldly perform you plan on that happen and born roses liked it\nTurtle with his throwing motion and when you throw like a turtle\nThere is there's no no sense of urgency there's no speed to it and it leads the way high number of passes that end up getting deflected and when those passes end up getting deflected and they bounce off I don't know elements of buffets Wyman are defensive lineman they generally come down on the side of the defense\nFor interceptions you're lucky to hit the ground so does that keeps going around borders since twenty fourteen Suzie enter the NFL borders has the most interceptions the most picks sixes\nAny NFL and those numbers kept going up up up in a way a let's hear from Blake borders Blake you had a a whole medley of interceptions what do you have to say for yourself\nIf felt a lot you know a lot like some games we've had in the past you know just a move the ball there are some good things in bed turn over ... four packs do that what about the bubble up there hard hard to Wilmington of all over them ... yeah\n[laughter] oh yeah we know as you get a mirror up like you might break it oh here's one more are jailing Ramsey talked a lot of crap\nLotta smack talk I loved it retiree kill time we get pretty good game\nFor Kansas City ah what do you have to say ... you want to ah wanna walk that back you you go with that word yet on that\nIssue remains that means that remain cohesive uh you know I'll be you know a fan of ... when you go yeah uh\nI was really you know last week I was surprised that at ... at his word and then when I talked to him out of the game he was like you said you were great\nBut everybody knows where you kind of say if I had to take a shot back at it\nYeah that's that's not by one point that's not why Jackson the last game I enjoyed some quality trash talk it's pretty good are usually the best of our show on Fox and I I I Would like to address the\nSunday night game and the continued gutless coaching of a one Jason Garrett there in overtime or we will bring in Edmond Dallas steamboat Willie\nYou have a ... of the doubt battle\nOf Texas [noise]\nThe cowboys deciding overtime on a fourth downplay it\nOver time with I was a fourth one and they said you know what we're going to do a it's a fourth in maybe one and a half from the Houston forty two yard line so we're going to punt the ball away knowing that all Houston that has to do is go down and get a feel go we you'd\nRather have when you rather have your often\nGet a yard with the Z Kelly in the office of wine as opposed to putting the ball away and trusting your defense which not not that great\nYeah I I hear what you're saying and I know especially ... to talk about a little bit later a head coach of your favorite\nTeam they're showing some good ... limit all day ram it all night and getting in not last flooding the ball and not\nGiving up the chance so ah I I get where you're coming from ... more often than not yes I Would\nI Would tend to want the the game in my hands and had my players with it and try and hope the other team doesn't score because you know I mean the ... I Love the Houston often it's wasn't exactly light in the world on fire I'm I'm going to say was the worst call in the world but I I like I said I Would rather\nSee rather will go for it even there and Jerry Jones whose whose son\nI'm convinced is illegitimate son is Jason Garrett considering Jason gets run his coach of the cowboys even Jerry was asked about the point in overtime and he took by Jerry Jones standards a shot\nAt Jason gear uh Jerry Jones this is a quote you said again we were\nOut played they're not out of effort but we were we were being out played it's time for risk at that particular time\nJones said that's not second guessing and then he said but we're all extremely disappointed and quote a when you say it's time for risk you're calling out the head coach for not taking the risk my correct\nAnd I would agree with you yes is that only has what he's saying does that mean Garrett's fired on Monday ... he's out done [laughter] no not at all and we're not bring back Jimmy Johnson bring him back Jimmy Johnson is walking through that door no no Jim Gail you might be available if you want him which Chan Daley doing these days I ... I don't know fishing\nIs you know a lot of fishing I don't I don't think ... assistant coach and is that right well yeah sons and it's just to go who else can they bring up Barry Switzer was Barry up to his barriers you still alive yeah he does that's half the battle\nDave Camp at worst Dave Camp I'm ever him I of course I Do still alive I Believe you save ... billion back there is a yeah there was a coach though that is no longer alive so we can't use is yeah the hat yeah yeah land reason I don't know no no I was talking about I did not only has brought to coach the travel no\nHe didn't know head coach I don't think he was close to the rain has other raiders\nYeah he ... he was not a cowboy you know not interim even\nI don't think so okay look it up I I don't I don't think so and I are you are you at this point on it it would no don't say that [laughter]\n\nIt was a bit of a funny line but now that the question at this point though because the that you know that would have to decide you know\nMaybe I should go for it you know I mean why not a while I Will take your calls a lotta stuff why not a good interesting wild some bad some terrible stuff on an NFL Sunday if you

Fox News chocolate tropical storm Michael is moving into the Gulf of Mexico and likely will be a hurricane later today before making landfall Florida governor Rick Scott declaring an emergency Sunday for high risk area as\nI that that the NFL did not pick the rams or or the ... the Kansas City chiefs are going to be that great this year or else they would not have chosen that game to go to Mexico I promise you but anyway it's going to be in Mexico the rams and\nAre later this season but they're the only five no teams they're they're they're the only want their eerily similar like Kansas City now people send their defenses planned better\nThe ... borders is a bomb eight turn the ball over all those are those times\nBut between Kansas City who still bad defensively end the rams\nWho is the deepest you rather have you'd rather have the Ramsey for even as bad as the rams defenses\nRight as bad as the ramps events is why would you rather have the rams the fans because they have players that have been good that have been great\nIn the past the rams got off a wonderful start they gave up Thirteen points to the first two games at a shutout against Sam Bradford and the cardinals the raiders they shut out I think in the second half of readers didn't score that Monday Night game the past three weeks though the rams defenses allowed eighty five points\nTo the chargers Vikings and the sea hawks known a positive no\nIf you want a magic placebo to get things\nIn a positive direction the rams have a date in Denver with case keen them and the Broncos so that should improve the confidence [laughter] the ramps and then after that\nThey go to the bay area freak road games in a row uh and she Jay battered and the forty niners another who forty niners one stat sheet\nOr they won the stat sheet against the cardinals but they kept shooting themselves in the foot so they end up losing the game is some bizarre stats that came out of that but Sean McVeigh\nAnd as a road coach in the NFL ... stunningly good right I think they're branching out ten in one on the road\nBelieve that's correct under Sean McVeigh ten and one away from the Los Angeles memorial coliseum was ... as their their head coach so maybe they shouldn't want to get home field advantage in the NFC maybe they shouldn't want to go to Minnesota or Philadelphia wherever or whoever ends up being the\nTop of the New Orleans or the other top teams in the NFC I spend on a show on Fox to hear from some of the key participants this year from Sean McVeigh you what foreign on foreign down coach McVey yeah the smartest man in the world aren't you\nI think really when you look at it and they say they're talking about part and then you look at the the belief that they had and how much they wanted to do it and because of their belief it made me feel a confidante and it made us as the coaching staff feel confident to make that decision and ultimately it's a good decision because they made it right\nOr Jared golf I'm sure you disagree with your coach who did not want to go for it right you wanted a part in that situation is that correct\nOr with a lot of time to the side and he was kinda going back and forth who had I was off that were piling up just to talk to one of the officials about something and as I'm turning around officers running back home and Israel [laughter] so I go to Sean I'm you know I called the ...\nYou say he he was expecting a put Jerry ... most coaches I play forward point in that situation a peak tell your team's not very good you're the coach of the ... what do you have to save yourself coach Carroll\nI Hope you can tell that uh our team has grown the last three weeks is really an extraordinary a step forward yes and we're we're jak about if we go a long season ahead of us\nAnd uh now we come out of this game and go to the next one will be crucial just as it will be the next week but uh there's no doubt in who we are as a team and how we're trying to build ... ... ...\nSo he's excited 'cause they beat the cowboys and cardinals the last two weeks who are not near one of those teams is that good and now they play a good team and they lose us close last\nOh who's gonna win he's talking about raiders in sea hawks\nIn the bay area the greatness of the ... next week week six ... square the raiders hosting the Seattle Seahawks a lesson learned that's right that's in London that's not even in the bay area\nNew London you can go to that game Roberta we'd be tell I'll be there you'll be there your correspondent yeah yeah sure be nice\nAll right that's a that's that's what the ... if they win a games as I said earlier I think it was I said after the bears game he cares because of the year as a bad football team\nBut hey they they've got they've still got the visual game to play the forty niners and play them once they play them twice they could win both those games the niners are bad and they play a cardinals again so they could they've already got to get the five\nI don't know where else they're going to win I don't know where else do they get on a beat the chargers they put the charges in Seattle maybe they won that when they play at Detroit\nIt's

hundred sixty eight yard to the rams the Seahawks deep as give up four hundred sixty eight yards and the rams it to their top receivers were an injury a protocol concussion protocol and that's right

was just going to say this is what people fake people that watch the team believe this it clearly people in the locker room believers will just come on\nSaid what's the problem now secondly patch or\nCan we all agree I think we all can agree that ... is in over his head\nA this was a bizarre higher to start with Sherman who does not strike you as the kind of a coach who can deal with the corking is and the odd mannerisms of auto back them\nAnd sure enough this season has played out as anticipated the giants are one and for their circling the drain we bend Mac do you got sacrifice last season he was the scapegoat the players are not great patch termer\nIs not doing a wonderful job of coaching these players up getting the most out of these players were thirty percent in\nTo the regular season the giants play five games and they're not going anywhere different from last year they were bad last year they're bad this year and ... ... you look at what he did in Cleveland he was nine and twenty three\nWith the browns many years ago in his first opportunity it was supposed to be different I was gonna be different now Sherman had success in Philadelphia as a coordinator had success in Minnesota it was going to be ...\nReally I don't think it's any different uh I say different at all watching Sherman melt down here at the news conference\nYou could literally see him come apart at the seams and and he is he thinking is what he's doing a and I don't know that he's going to be able to tread water [noise] the giants are pretty buttoned up conservative organization\nAnd they don't typically just run through coaches a conga line of coaches and so that's in the positive for passionate rumor is that he'll get the hang around a little bit longer\nBut he's been unable to mask the shortcomings\nOn the Giants' roster and coach 'em up you know he's he hasn't coached them up the giants are one in four I could've coach the judge you could've coach the giants they'd be one and for\nUh I I really believe that only the pattern was made any difference in a positive way with this giant steam that final word he the giants are on pace to win three or four games\nAnd if that happens I if that happens then the giants\nEven though they're conservative in their buttoned up and all that they have to look at the coach and they have to say what are we gonna keep this guy we can watch this guy\nBarring some kind of radical transformation that is where this has had high it's like well they just don't want to just fire Sherman after one year but if they end up going three and Thirteen or foreign twelve\nOr do you don't use you figure that you buy manning will be gone after this year you could fire sure over and then get a quarterback and the coach can then pick the quarterback the new coach\nAs far as the short term you have that's that's a long game might the short game as well what happened hotel back I'm\nClearly has more influence he's got more power\nIn the locker room and pat Schroeder does right this is is a tinderbox and and for now these guys will say well it's it's on the back burner or we're not going to focus on this we're moving on we got games to play they're going to try to downplay\nThis particular story I that's that's how the giants are going to handle this\nIn a season will continue to circle the drain if you're looking at where where are the ...\nWhere are the wind is going to be for the giants well there are people be many of them right they they don't win four games of the giants go foreign twelve or if everything goes right\nAnd the giants can win five games wow five wins that's an amazing year\nFor the giants they've lost four out of five\nThey've got Philadelphia the eagles that's a winnable game right after when I'm getting because Philadelphia's on on her five on a team they're not the same magical feel it was Super Bowl team of last year the losing team the eagles after five games there aren't winnable games the problem is the giants are bad the\nThere are terrible team and at least I'll give them credit as we said here\nBecause of the drama their interest you can't be bad and boy you can be bad you can be boring if you're good you can be bad if you're interesting and that's what the giants they're bad but they're not born are usually bend Mather show on Fox will talk about that if you would like the number\nTo call in here it is eight seven seven Ninety nine on Fox eight seven seven nine nine six six three six nine I personally can't wait till that week ten giants and niners I Believe that's

night the Dallas Cowboys lost in overtime fight the game went over\nWas over documents considering that looked like Houston was driving down and they were going to go to win the game and all that stuff but the the Sean watching ends up throwing it in their section and the game goes over\nTime and then it over time the cowboys matriculate the ball down the field and they get to a poor down in one and Jason Garrett decides to point he was asked about that after the game and his response was it is a quote it wasn't\n... it was rather he was a law one yard\nYou a first a second and like a six round\nPick done right right All right thank you well we made the trade happy\nYou must have gone there you go better off without\nEdition by so trashed that's that's wrong the giant fan that's his analysis he's going back to school the whole school giants right there just Josh rice and he says things I learned after a week five of the NFL nobody wants to win the NFC ease the browns\nHave
