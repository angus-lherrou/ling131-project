my life in this game CJ\nAre no good was that don't they shut it might have been ready to ban that would have been a good a good day maybe a little\nLeery Walker but off the back of the day but yeah we really didn't react to that one very well yeah I hit back up the box or the first it was a Dutch store down the left field line second one so it's a writer what a big hit them and I am a big hit right back up the box\nSo you're a curiosity is down this plays out and you know certainly cubs fans gets a\nWell they got silence in a hurry still a capacity crowd on hand nobody leaving the ballpark that this was good for them a lot of sick days or tomorrow across the great city of Chicago um but for the moments chaos ensuing at Wrigley\nField at the same people who say oh do I stay up now or do I go to bed obviously now you stay up because the game could add\nBut it's the same people who go to a bar and after like eight drinks it's midnight they go\nOff I got to make a decision do I go home and go to bed I got to get up early or do I just keep drinking and hanging out now that I don't know what to do I got I got to make that decision stay air eight in you know you're done what do you want your committed you're committed at this point you're committed\nA show while the most nervous people in the world continue to be cubs fans is now the Rockies have the leading they're still battling in the top of the Thirteen\nThe most nervous person in the world of sports\nIs Yankee manager Aaron both because for the first\nTime all year he has had to make a decision for the Yankees I could have managed the Yankees all season long the guy had zero carbon footprint on the New York Yankees puts out the light up\nThe only controversy had was oh uh Gary Sanchez is in hustling let's put it on the deal for a month great that works out great he has had to make no decisions just put out a line up and he's been silent is that nothing to do\nNow finally he had to decide what to do for the wild card game who to start was going to be Severino was it could be Jay ... was going to be to knock out\nAnd he goes with Severino this was the safe call\nBecause at the end if the Yankees lose he could say well Severino is our best pitcher all season long I Know he was your best picture the first three months of the season he has not been that good the last three months he had a decent last two starts which are late season no pressure because the Yankees already had things clinched\nJay half was your best starter that to everybody in New York wants threats all the back page say it's a no brainer back page all the paper that's got to be J hats\nAnd now Aaron Boone stands up and says Louis Severino I Can't wait to see how this plays out tomorrow he is so nervous right now the sweat is pouring off like he's in a pool right now he's so this is the first thing I've ever had to do all season long managing the Yankees\nBy the hope was that the ... home runs would continue or in render all this loop but we'll see how the AIDS strategy of the bullpen work uh instead of going traditional starter\nA plays out on the other side but certainly for Aaron Boone the Severino pick a a little bit of loyalty to the overall success that he had for the year as opposed to just looking down the barrel and seeing what Jay happens done since arriving\nTo New York he's been nothing short a phenomenal or in each of these outing so\nHow do you like going back to the hot ... theory that we're talking about with the Dodgers says we have more curious pitching decisions all the way through

Sean game too I mean this is where the cubs need to score runs so the big question here is it now you have seen the cubs go from World series\nDidn't get quite as far and now they're out in the wild card round how much change do you expect to see on this cubs team in the offseason offensively they've not been able to score and certainly pitching would not the team it used to be but I think you're going to see some big time change\nIn Chicago for a different mix the guys 'cause it's not like the cubs are trending up and I know you can say well it's you know it's two games yeah but they had two games at home and they score to runs into games now there's going to be changed\nYou know you've got your nucleus ah that that remains on unfettered by I mean the bullpen a is certainly being questioned throughout the year and bad news usage of it ah from the starting rotation\nAn older Jon Lester what does he thirty five now are still still dealing in and gave them a good effort tonight but you look at the rest and they call ...\nPitched well for the most part for the year and a lot of talk today a after his appearance of that he'd been up and throwing several times over the course of the game so wondering uh Fifteen get already setting before you hit the\nSo you've got a that question in the back end of that rotation certainly going to be shuttled and a lot of the bullpen parts of that to look at the contractual status of a lot of the principles but I'd imagine you know you're you're also looking at a year where you miss Chris Brian for a good chunk of time Rizzo miss some time\nTo injury a short for probably says goodbye\nOr the ... they probably point goodbye to his couch I as you go a must be ... to get right we're talking about the two runs twenty joining sixteen strike out should I\nNot even with the ball and playing quitting striking out in his\nFive aside a without more going down as the final out\nBut sixteen strike out forty three at bat that I cannot

[noise] and when he was asked specifically\nWhy the Packers were having problems getting the football to their top play makers and creating big plays an offense Aaron Rogers said quote teach by the

because or a stockholder because Mike mccarthy has been the central guy behind the offensive game plan for for many many years\nIn Green Bay and Aaron Rodgers a pointing out it's by the plane so I got a couple of thoughts on this real quick I\nHey Mike McCarthy is on borrowed time\nIn Green Bay he is the beneficiary much like Mike Tomlin Pittsburgh that in those two towns\nPittsburgh doesn't fire coaches Green Bay doesn't fire coaches the it's a unique environment in Green Bay because it's a gene that it's a community on team it's not your normal set up their our stock holders there is a board

cheap that it's like you know we're not going to get anybody new we're gonna we're gonna be still we're stuck with those guys for next year the cubs are really stuck\nWith those two because no one's going to take them in the trade no one's going to take Jason hey we're no no one's going to take you darn machine a trace especially in services unhealthy they're stuck with that this is where the cubs have to say you know watch screw it we're going to spend as much money as humanly possible we're going to put\nOur payroll at three hundred million dollars to go get better guys it because they need it because they're pitching\nWhile it's it's\nIn name recognition than it is an actual\nTalent and Jon Lester is getting older and those guys are getting older adult camels in West you're thirty four ... they they are going to have some real this is going to be really challenging also not they can't get it done obviously because the brain trust with the cubs you know how good they are building a world champion when you know you had an hour and a hundred years wife\nSince that there'll be able to make make the best things that kind of put certain things you can't cut up and you can't cut up hundred and six million dollars to Jason Hayward who they wanted to get out of it a year ago right and here's your door is not a hundred and twenty million dollars they wish they could

offensively you know if you're wearing pretty well and runs this year but you had so many games where you just couldn't get the big ... ended up of zero one room\nYeah that's we we play that game a lot um believe me it was on on my mind for a large part of it we had some opportunities we just cannot cash in um [noise] I mean they pitch really well too um but we need to figure that out in the off season next spring training\n'em as my buddy tables with say we live too much chicken on the bone right there we've had plenty of opportunities\nUm and I I'm not here to denigrate anybody works put in he's in the barn everybody cares that just didn't play out this way offensively or we caught the ball we pitch really really well I'm like I said the esprit de corps I Can't ask for more so just so that we really up to focus on during the off season [noise] front row in the right\nTo go along those lines with the last two home games playoff games you know to run so are you shocked by that\n[noise] well I mean like if we just talked about it's it's happened to this up and um we've we've been in that we put ourselves in that position often um\nEven though the games against the pirates to get to this point we didn't score a whole lot then we'd probably came back to one two oh we've had a series this year where we've scored I'm well how many was always going to Pittsburgh\nOne one per game in a four game series and won two of them you know so this is we we've been fighting with this um [noise]\nAnd I I Want to believe and I do believe that you're going to see a lot of these guys rebound more off ... because they're very talented and they're young and they're not hurt to me it's like a an ages you normally and it's also an injury issue but we're not we're not injured and we're not all um so I really anticipated ...\nNo I bought ... happy spent on this I'm anticipating a bit about what she wants to be going to say I'm going to the angels everybody oh God yeah we did it here but I Want to go out in Anaheim look I got trout I'm going to have pool halls like adults on it I Want to go there and now it's all good\nWell you address the\nThe run outages I mean certainly have that and putting the spin on it and say look this is what I was afraid of and this is what we've seen over the course of the year and ... and he's good at going to talk about immediately to the future right it's the\nHappier cheery or side of the bill bell jak rotten to Cincinnati yeah we're on and I ... I mean it's the same guy that\nPhilosophy of I I Can't dwell on what just happened we've got to figure out what the roster looks like a going forward and we've gotten a few notes or in the Twitter verse related to cost and looking at Hayward and ... contract yes like the Dodgers as we've talked about over the course of the night you can get the\nFull podcast and I ... uh the Jason Smith show with my ... coming up in about twenty five minutes or so but the fact that the batteries yes the cubs print money they they always will spend money and it certainly doesn't restrict them on a larger scale still when you're out forty two to forty five billion dollars on two players who can't play\nAnd you don't know what garbage health is yeah that does come into come into play a bit in terms of roster spots and and how useful they are I mean you saw hey we're here an opportunity with the bases loaded\nUh one of many going down flailing sixteen strike out on the day get them out and get them over again I mean that's why when they successfully executed abroad and I almost fainted in my chair\nYeah yeah I mean that was really believes that little moment small twenty Eighteen base you don't see it though I don't want anyone ready guys it anymore I tell ya\nAh we may have the best way to the night here that way but it's a reflection of this is from our buddy a Frank UCLA Dodger Frank it's Coors Light versus Miller light in the LDS there are no winners here that is\nAbsolutely incorrect Coors Light is the clear favorite over Miller Lite so you would even drink Miller light I mean real that's mid west though like it's ... it's all about ya I Do not see the video era teams during my I I Know exactly and you\nGet back to the mid west Miller light skin to add\nA holdover Coors Light oh I hear I towards like going to win I think I mean here we are near mountain time right how do you think Bernie Brewer could come out of that\nIs right you know he looks like Miller Lite when he's got a beer like ready to\nNobody drinks Miller Lite doing Milwaukee know Coors Light is so much better than Miller allow my God Coors Light personal preference no no no not a sponsor why do you think they don't let the Greek freaking that restaurant I've because he was drinking corps I've tried to corps lights there's\nActually corps is a pretty good beer ready for no it's not corps is pretty good it's just you know it's a regular beer so that's filling ... light it's like you are and when you talk about that it's sterile and I like to pay for his latest\nYou get the blue mountains on the bottle you think this bottles really cold oh yeah you open\nThat marketing and lights the bad really sold the hell out of you uh I got ... mountains on my ... yeah you drink ... or ... you know if you don't want my brother in law\nThat's on top of the blue mountains you could put a picture of a skeleton on the front and haven't falling down and and evaporate disintegrate like the end of the Avengers and I drink boiler alert and I would still drink\n[laughter] course still like clear advantage I I don't even think I Would drink a Miller light is that what you think you know what I Would go up and I bet you I could put one in a glass or you wouldn't be able to help and I did I did have a a very brief thing for Miller genuine draft\nMaybe because of the commercials with the clear bottle and now it's got to pay them in your diet stuff I did like I did the yeah oh maybe it's a hell of a running back there and fantasy purpose yeah about a decade\nI've I've played M. J. D. and fantasy and drank MGD while upgraded my way of ... actually Jay\nBut no of course like clearly as the advantage over all of those\nAny alright it ha so I got to be light domestic beer draft there you go right white domestic beer drafts and how about a ... put up a fall overnight or as late as your number one pick\n... batch blue light is it's a good one not what I got out and bomb blasts a little bit of a sleeper regular back I asked my dad when he ... my dad moving out here to LA from Syracuse yeah I said what does that made you decide to move out well you know you out to\nYou out of your daughter yet though you know I'd probably get low bass out here I'm like oh don't do that so that that ... well that is really good about the blue dogs so there's your first two I you know and it ... Miller Lite nuts ... that's like a second round here\nThat's like that's like a deep and the second round well we'll have to build the slide show [laughter] for the Graham around is owed ... go in and out of that may go right ahead of a bill or light\nThat actually does have alcohol in it right now like point oh yeah yeah yeah it does have a tiny tiny bit in a lot for a coming up next we got more on the big wind up by the Rockies and why not pitching Clayton courage Sean game on is the right call for the Dodgers business Fox Sports radio\n[noise]\nThere's a lot of holes you have\nThis is something you gotta wonder is Clayton Kurdish are gonna be pissed about this he can opt out of his contract after this season is over and maybe he wants to go someplace else and if that does happen whether this is the Dodgers trying a\nSlightly push him out or this is something he realizes I Want to go do this because I'm not going to stay here from not Clinton Persia anymore\nLife without him will be just fine they got to the world series last year went over a hundred games and he missed a lot of time they won the west this year one over Ninety games and he was just okay he would like I said third best picture on the Dodgers if Clinton Kurdish all leaves things will be just fine for the Dodgers\nWell you know that you have a succession plan right you have a couple of guys at the top of the rotation\nThat low in a and it's not just courage shop plus for\nOh and then a lot of wishing an open ended the bullpen as you had in years past certainly there but when you get down to the economics at it is as long as from an ego management perspective quake Kirsch laws are with it\nThen it makes sense right he's got a better staff and you know the Dodgers have money and we'll spend money to keep that team pushing forward we've seen in time and again they're going to pay Machado a in the back in here in short order at which one would think and that\nThere's always going to be money for her shop plus from his perspective\nYou know what he's built here in LA and all the goodwill and everything that flows out of his relationship with the people of LA and with the Dodgers organization I don't think you can short changed that either\nIt's winter at how about a fresco Mike at swollen dome that Jason Smith show with my Carmen live from the Geico studio so get ready because this if we look back at when Clinton Kurdish all leaves the Dodgers this is the first of all we'll look at and say well maybe this is where it all began\nWe also could look back at this moment and said this could be the beginning of the new cubs curse don't at me or this could be the beginning of the new version of the cubs because John last year who started tonight for the cubs\nCut Adams and those are two and he was great tonight and he was great gave up one run in six innings uh they gave no support\nNine strike out of his he was right and then the the batters for the cubs I harp on it again sort of strike outs in forty three at bats today for the janitors\nThis comes to us courtesy of a Yahoo Sports baseball columnist Jeff passing Jon Lester said after the game tonight\nSome times of need to get your blank knocked in the dirt to appreciate it maybe we needed that top five answers on the more he didn't say ass so it's kind of on the other side of it and only a guy has it\nSometimes you need to get your blank knocked in the dirt to appreciate I think we can say joke maybe we needed that yes yes we can my Carmen ... very good um sometimes you to get your junk knocked in the dirt except he didn't say junk to appreciate it maybe we needed that\nAs many pointed out different ah accolades in performances speeches of years passed in Chicago at some point you don't get to rest on those anymore you got to go out and when\nAnd this is a team expected it got Ninety five wins but it was an inconsistent year as you heard Joe Madden ah leads you and talk about their authentic production that the overall runs kind of like watching you know NFL staff trade or as we get past the first quarter of the scenes look what these guys are averaging ... sure they had one great game\nAnd three lackluster performances but it all averages and you're ... you start averaging oh\nBased on one giant our pets have outburst or when your defense struggles watch like was the cubs they had some great nine run Thirteen run kind of out of here you're going to find more consistency and I think for last year what he's saying is you know sometimes you need to be humble get hungry again for spring training\nAnd and that's absolutely true\nAnd you know you you if you're the cubs you want to use this as a rallying point and say look it didn't happen for us it didn't get this far we have to use is not as a negative but as a springboard to say it happened to us now we can play well\nTony ... one Seventy hitter this year your game winning RBI for that does either

on that someone's going to pay the price for this great injustice that is cubs baseball in the year twenty Eighteen so who is it now the obvious one and we'll phrase it this way\nDoes Joel Madden keep his job as cubs manager\nThis a fire up all the fence again that could have gone either way again that could have could have gone to the cubs had runners on base you know they didn't get many hits they had opportunities to score runs they didn't so does Joe Biden\nKeep his job you're fired\nThe answer's no Germans out that was just last game as manager of the cubs he's done\nSeal later I ended a couple of reasons why number one was not a hundred percent each over eighty percent the chance that the cubs will say sigh and Nora a rebirth data Jay to Joe Biden the core of the cubs is not going anywhere\nCan pull out whoever your favorite magician is and they're not going to vanish Chris Bryant Anthony Rizzo the meat and potatoes have called baseball is going to be back in twenty Eighteen and the the old here's the old line said by many you can change the players are changes what manager right Joel Madden talk\nAnthony ... bat out of a tie game in the eighth inning\nThat alone someone as a fireball fans but the cubs scored two runs in twenty two innings the pressure baseball this we must win baseball you beat the brewers on Monday you don't have to play on Tuesday\nAnd you win on Tuesday you get to play the brewers again and the cubs over to on their home field with the final it\nBack with the the uh the more high priced players not that that matters into the equation but two runs in twenty two innings the cup office the last two games\nNine for Seventy one one twenty seven with two extra basis for strike outs\nThinking that the numbers are out there and I read this earlier the cubs played a hundred and sixty four games this year they scored one run or fewer forty times that is approximately twenty five percent of called baseball\nEnded with one Ron or know runs that's the cubs horrible horrible ...\nAnd so someone asked to pay the piper and that's going to be Joe ... now the other thing we mentioned this a couple of weeks ago there is believed to have been a disconnect there was a story planted that Joe Biden\nIs not resonating\nWith the players that his shtick he stick a lot as my grandfather's sit back in the day is not connecting\nThat they've tune him out now I Am of the belief that the manager does very little\nIn modern major league baseball that has been my position and I maintain that position I don't think I'm wrong and that that it's so much about analytics and setting everything up before the game that your main job as a manager is dealing with the media would show man has good with and\nUh personalities right in the personalities keeping the the ... away from the other shoe box or in the locker room that's the job and if Joe Madden\nIs having problems in that department then that is a reason to say why we like you\nAnd and the players all seem to like him but it's just not he's not connecting with them but more importantly their bats aren't connecting with the baseball players weren't cubs uniform\nA uniform not just show mad and get fired no the second point here Joel Madden resides right there is a mutual party and other ways they'll get together you abstain and you'll Matt this is how it should play out right because\nThat way Joe Madden can save face it makes sense right he you know he's he's a hero forever in Wrigley Field they'll never have to buy another meal\nOn on the north side of Chicago they love them forever for winning the world series\nBut the main reason that the cubs can do this year is because while they're often has touched the patient Joe Madden can walk out of Chicago and walk right in the Anaheim there's a safe landing spot for Joe mad\nSo it's like well the cubs agree\nThat it's just not working out but Madden goes into Anaheim and he he was a long time angel coach and scout many many years in the angels organizations still has a house\nWith just a stone's throw away from the big day so we can go back to Anaheim Stadium he can replace my exposure who's done and save that morbid franchise\nOr but either way either way or we know that the person who is definitely out even in addition to mad and is going to be truly Davis chili Davis has got one of the great names in baseball history the hitting coach for the Chicago Cubs\nHe is going to be sacrificed Joe Madden will likely be kicked out in a heartless cold blooded barbaric way but Chile Davis also ... and that is a sure thing is like Alabama beating a directional school in a non conference games by that says the same deal it's the same deal yo as they say\nAre these the ban ... show on Fox thing about this I gave you that that will bring in Edmond Dallas steamboat Willie\n...\nPub off fence so bad so horrible even if they won this game it doesn't take away from our horrific the pub office has been this year and this that popped up on I Believe it was the state run and there'll be network the cup I gave that said forty games this year the cubs scored one run or know runs\nThe team they are tied with the Baltimore Orioles how many\nGames to the Baltimore Orioles lose this yo know hundred something\nIt was like a hundred and said a hundred oh like a hundred and Fifteen I didn't even realize what was that many they lost a hundred and fifty that's the costs tied with the Orioles their office\nWow enemy the way that the cubs finished the season living in the playoffs they lose at home ...\nThen they lose at home in the wild card I mean this is a a this is the last man has done that's it you're right you're right he does have a soft landing landing spot there in Anaheim I'm I I could see that scenario exactly playing\nOut yeah a Mitt and the big beneficiary of all this uh the the brewers and Dodgers because if\nYou look at the the situation of the Rockies or gas going into Milwaukee so the brewers immediately should just pounds the cheese heads should just pounds all over the Rockies in that series\nYeah they were joining there there were they were ... they were just saying go on keep going keep going on in the world series the golly downriver\nRelax [laughter] there's a great there's a great Dodger story we have to get their way to do which is just marvelous it's awesome I like it or the the greatest F you are and they're spinning and it's not an F ... it was just marvelous\nAre clearly listening to the show last night Eddie but what about all the important people well I mean we pointed out I ... down on current Shaw and or the next day bam\nDean voted the motive Clinton Russia\nAnd really the Dodgers and he's the number three started the Dodgers thing right there you have more on that later but this is all this is all about the cubs and the\nRockies in the wild card game and you'll be happy to know that was supposed to moonlight on the other gig in Boston and I was ready to go at ten o'clock eastern time when that game was in like the top of the fifth oh they were carrying the game yeah they they carry the game so I was standing by and I never got on a so\nYou'll get paid for the s hours I Will build up a little east so but I'm\nI'm annoyed because I thought I was getting and I feel like I wasted a good amount of\nTime I understand it's like a you know a comedian on one of those late night shows in the ... some some you know superstar goes along and get\nBumped yeah yeah I got bumped bumped I got bumped bumped but he bumpy bump that's all right well more more stuff for us\nYes more more time for us on a much fresher now right I mean it sounds like it it's great I'm ready to go I I Love the demoralizing last you know the better stories losing ... what's your real quick and Joe ...\nLet's see what Joe ... I got a place for you to listen to the Joe ... and ... what is he going to say about the cub office I gave you all the numbers right you know all the stats and by the longest one twenty seven the last two games to last year may say it's twenty four strike outs you measure the cobs what do you have to say\nAnd I I'm not here to denigrate anybody hardware works put in more than just everybody cares they just didn't play out this way offensively we caught the ball we pitch really really well like I said the esprit de corps I Can't ask for more so it was just something we really have to focus on during the off season\nYes hitting a baseball [laughter] not acting like fecal matter in the playoffs I bought that hard it is a show a lot to discuss here we'll take your calls eight seven seven Ninety nine on Fox eight seven seven nine\nNine six six three six nine were also on Twitter at Bain Mallory heard Roberta or their coup a loop is in the building as well the entire\nSeries on alive and yeah you're on asked of of characters will get through all that\nAnd once you see it you cannot and see it once you see it you cannot unseen we'll get to that and we will do it next\nThing happens so fast in our work I don't know what what sort of keep up your here's what they're doing follow us on Twitter Twitter Fox Sports radio\nWhere people you wouldn't have no life is\nTo be on Twitter at Fox Sports radio\nNow they're here even if you're a big time basketball fan there might be a few facts about the game you don't know like then you know that the first hoops were actually peach baskets or that it warmed basketball is bouncy than a cold one or the players can run as much as four miles during a game we use another fact you might\nSean says\nOf his interaction with Chile Davis he said he asked how I knew it was him and I said well your wife said your name and that is a fairly unique game so [laughter]\n[noise] ...\nI've told the story a few times over the years but surely Davis actually save me from getting my ass kicked\nWhen I was a radio reporter when I first got started in the business ... years ago\nOr the then the recall the Southern California angels they they blew like a an ... thing was eleven game lead in August the Seattle Mariners came back one year way back in the day and the angels had this new dynasty they had this great line up all of that era of players and\nBut I was a radio stringer and I had to get audio all the angels were imploded and they were losing like eight out of nine or ... or they could not find their way it was it was ridiculous\nAnd they ate out of line if they win a couple then they lose you know nine out of ten of what it was ... and that's my memory anyway\nAnd uh there was a player who's a he passed away a couple of years ago Tony Phillips who was a hothead\nLead officer and a ... and he was the ... the only guy who was there was a Sunday afternoon they're putting like Milwaukee Milwaukee was still in the American weeks it was long time ago and Tony Phillips had like two of the three hits for the angels so I had to talk I 'cause I had to get sound from the the losing locker room\n'cause the better stories and lose the locker room so I approached Tony and uh I asked him and he did oblige my interview request\nAnd I then made the fatal flaw of asking him about the angels problems are and some NO NAME pitcher for the brewers that had pitch this marvelous game and Tony was very upset\nOr he was sitting down when I started interviewing him he stood up and I'm much bigger than ... all these guys I don't know at this time I'm really really big but I'm also very young\nAnd I'm I'm frightened to death that this multi million dollar baseball player is going to do something and I'm powerless right and so Tony Phillips stands up and starts\nYelling and getting in a fighting close right and he's like speeding I ... and I'm like oh I don't know what to\nDo away with what was his fighting pose as I look like clean legs is well it is up\nLet me let me show rubber [laughter] I'd be face to face and then he turned like this is not something like that seat when he did not use on the fence really helping about telling reporters report what am I doing is you're not ready to fight no no\nNo don't do it right leg art in to the point\n... by you I was doing was doing performance art ... job so I I was down to ... I did yeah we got it on your face someone in your legs are parallel it was it the the toll was pointed at me like a boxing post you know in the ring or a boxer\nSo anyway I'm like oh boy and I froze guys out crap you know I don't know\nAnd Chile Davis was at another locker and he came over\nAnd and he was a veteran player that any intervene and he saved me from a from ... you know Tony\nA man he recipes we should ask me kill the dead but Tony had some some issues with a certain uh you know ah substances he he was a big fan of Penn State's white out let's just say so if there were there were some ... but I don't know what you know let's just say that\nBefore they cleaned up Anaheim Tony might or might not have ended up in a CD a hotel right near the beginning with some things happen\nBut anyway uh it worked out so that's my\nThat's my long we can do that it does he video you've been like oh he uh that was not the only thing like that right that's not the only time he yelled at me or the famous when we used to place when I did the bending Dave show years ago it was a\nTony a he got upset because he he came back to the angels after going to like the White Sox us and we came back and they interviewed again any I don't know if your memory or not but it's such a yelling\nWhen he lost his wings and mother bleeping last at all I care about [laughter]\nThat would be like oh I think that's true it is all we care about [noise] but once you see it you cannot see it will get to that budget calls lined up we'll do that as well from the guy goes studios but right now any Garcia to fill you in what the latest Eddie\nVan we start with major league baseball post season action National League wildcard gain weight nearly five hours in Chicago Thirteen endings before the Rockies that's the cubs two to one they were tied in one of the thirteenth with backup catcher\nTrone Walters stepped up with two out delivered an R B I single to bring home the game winning run pitching though is the key for Colorado how thrilling started we'd sixty two thirds shutout innings the bullpen didn't allow just one run over six in the thirties and Scott over struck off the side and\nThe game I didn't even know the Tony Walters was a ... I had no idea I'm just said that he uh he he ... he was up by the way to get that to a game winning third strike or keep closing their strike a color was dances defeats the brewers and you're walking in the end of the U.S it's starting on Thursday for Chicago\nTo losses in a row in home one of the ... one of the wild card in their season is over America meanwhile card game comes up on Wednesday in New York eight o'clock use during the Yankees hosted the ... on the mound and Leo Luis sadder Reno\nAnd who you are only ...

have only thirty one so will give him a four year contract so crucial could get like two extra years of big money if\nHe ops out the divide is this\nDodger ownership the Guggenheim Partners from what we hear\nWhat Kurt schottische they they are doing everything they can to appease Clinton crush or they don't want him to opt out they'd prefer he opt in\nBut if he does opt out they want to keep he's

could end today object Callahan Fox News that according to a source who tells Fox News the bureau could wrap up its word by the close of business that's due to judge Kavanaugh's accuser\nThat universities where the beneficiary of what free labor they didn't have to pay the players are doing is paid the player and Adidas also paid the university that's a win win\nMost trades most transactions are quid pro quo which means you got to give something to get something the universities they just gave the directive like a third base coach this guy to do this and then they like the guy who wrote a check or how much how much is this guy going to cost how much do we have to pay his parents how much what is his uncle whoever\nI now secondly Jim ghetto knowing the the actually Adidas executive knowing that he would not be working with college basketball players are working in the the shoe businesslike we ever again where he is done based on day one is decided I'm going scorched earth ah every bridge I crossed I'm going to blow up\nEvery bridge I'm going to destroy that's what I'm gonna do and and what he has done is he is tossed out shutout Nike\nShut out on her arm and he is implied\nAnd use them as collateral damage essentially saying that everyone's doing that yes Adidas didn't do it\nAnd so did Nike and so none of them are in fact there was like an arms race between the shoe companies to try to get the players to go to universities so they were all bidding on players it was like a meat market for the top high school players the AAU players in America which is not that outrageous\nConsidering that this has been the belief that many people have had for a long time\nAnd now keep in mind that this is not an effective\nDefense in itself right the hate everyone's doing it defense does not usually weren't right you get pulled over for speeding and everyone's driving eighty five miles an hour you just happened to be cherry pick you still get the ticket even though you say everyone was speeding what the hell\nBut it is intriguing is that there were full scale beating wars for the top players and you know there there were being auctioned off for top level bothers you know the the whole student athlete term which is a pet peeve of mine a clearly an oxymoron and so the dirty laundry\nIs being aired in a Manhattan courtroom\nAnd you've got to think that this is just the tip of the spirits day one it's not just college basketball that's the reason this is the tip of the spear that this goes on there's a ripple effect and you got to think that\nThere's some college football coaches that that are kind of look into the other side a little bit looking at this story there like they they might be having panic attacks themselves thinking about am I going to get dragged into this ... is this going to spill over into football\nNow the the final final point the United states prosecutor is arguing that the\nPerson named Jim ghetto he said when you lie cheat and receive that is a crime that's where the U.S prosecutor said unfortunately that is not accurate lying cheating and deceiving or not by themselves crime\nThere not a either was wrong to do that is immoral to do that\nBut in business people lie all the time right and you know the cheat this even if that was the case you know say Ninety seven percent of the the business world would be locked up right if those three things were a crime they'd all be locked up and maybe they should all be locked\nBut this is an N. C. H. A. rules violation there are not laws imply because again I I Believe that if there is no victim there is no crime and therein lies the rub but in reality that that is where the\nThe FBI is trying to say here that there's a victim who's the victim right they're charging these people with the advantages a victimless crime and then we can all agree the shoe company is the beneficiary 'cause they get the young player to wear their brand\nIn college the school benefits because they get top shelf college basketball players they don't have to pay 'em the shoe company pays them the family benefits because they get paid as well so who are the bad people in this who are the people that are being wrong in this who are they\nCan you tell me maybe I'm not that bright 'cause I'm doing the overnight show so tell me who the real victim in in this because again you're talking about wire ... where's the fraud I the family who takes the money knows they're taking the money\nAnd according to the documentation the coaches are in their orchestrating these payments so they know what's going on and the shoe companies like they know they're part of this is what so where's the crime\nIn this\nThis is a really good defense I don't know how much she paid his lawyers and I'm assuming it's a lot of money some high price law for him\nBut I give them credit\nAnd you know it's it's usually a losing battle when you fight the federal government in court but if if you want to say hey this is some kind of tax violation that they didn't pay taxes on this that's a different conversation a ... and you can go down that road but on the wire fraud charge alone\nWhich is what this trial is about from what I understand I was gonna win I spend on a show on Fox we say hello to eight men Dallas\nGarcia

stores but this one in particular because I didn't see this one comment like that\nTo me that's a wonderful defense it's a really huge ... it's it's it makes all the sense in the world\nYeah it does like I Can't I Can't deny that I mean when when are we supposed to find out when this is going to be ...\nI saw the lower Manhattan federal court I don't know I'm assuming that this is going to take a little while and it's just\nThe first trial but if it works wouldn't you think everyone all the other people involved in this would use the same basic defense you of course I why not right it's like this is like a weather balloon to see a see what's going on\nBut yeah I Am that that is a store man I I saw it as a while I kept I was trying to find out more I was like I was trying to read some more stuff on it and it is intriguing and it's not getting a lot of play I didn't see that store and get a lot of play it 'cause it's not as a nobody people in the shoe business know who this guy is but
