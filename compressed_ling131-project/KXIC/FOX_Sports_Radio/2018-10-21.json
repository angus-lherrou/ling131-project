T. over under twenty two and a half point margin of victory between Tennessee in Los Angeles Brian\nGuys under my good did you think the titans are going to get role that badly\nI mean every other teen and all this year they didn't get involved by that average you may\nWant to you mentioned ... over I said that the charges rule the titans coming love list with the times was shut up but it raises\nI'll tell you don't don't underestimate the power of an ...\nAnd when you give up a lesbian sacks during one game I think the titans team they might not be very good but they're going to be highly focused and they're going to be ticked off and that might help them execute better today were they at least keep a closer than what is it twenty two and a half two and a half\nThree touchdowns you don't think they can keep it within three touches\nA man who got jetlag to Mario to worked in the mix this so far has but uh yeah I think eleven sacks was I went away from the like the NFL record it was crazy\nThey said that she was a graceful ... yeah they they're they get paychecks [noise]\nAll right we'll build a coal source of moving over to that one that's up in a few hours as I'm sure you've heard the bills that will be starting Derek ... if you'd be even though you know they just signed the guy off the street pretty much a week and a half ago\nAndrew work he's been a ... machine also throwing five interceptions in his last two games over under three and a half picks total and bills the Colts will go a\nTeam's football team yeah combined total Derek ... than the first quarter\n[laughter] now I said Derek interested in that Nathan Peter ... yeah I have lived\nThough I Love how the reports come out with the team is like Yelp don't start Pete urban don't even think about it right I'm going to take the under though that's a lot of picks today\nI mean even if it's two interceptions by both quarterbacks\nYou know that's what you'd have to to get to to get to the oh for sure one doesn't have to report any more than two I'm going to take the under your I think it's good I think Andrew Luck good have one and as long as a you know there are cameras into the throat three yeah I'm going to take the other like you're already I like\nAre you guys both are on opposite ends days yeah good split here and so I guess we'll do the final one here giants head to Atlanta to face the falcons Monday Night football and with a loss of New York could be facing the one in six on the season\nSo simple yes or no on this one guy's well oh Darryl backing junior be shown on the sidelines and yelling and an inanimate object black\nPerson count Jan or a net or whatever how about if he's just yelling with no one in front of them told everyone is going to be easy it's got to be at an object got to be not I don't know\nNo one the ...

C. S. in Milwaukee Cody village or hit a two run home run at the top of the second\nIs a pretty good game right now just like the eagles have to win today I think the Vikings need this game badly\nThey do they definitely need to win this game they should win it and I'll give Sam Donald a lot more props if he has a an equally good game today against Minnesota and Minnesota they don't have the defense they had last year\nBut that's still a good defense and much better than the colds there's no doubt about that so Sam Donaldson string together good back to back games and today against the Vikings I'll give them a lot of credit but it's not going to be easy today against them no but who do you\nI Do I like the Vikings I think the Vikings get it done today I mean it's kind of a dangerous game to play when we go back but\nThe way the Arizona Cardinals played on Thursday night oh and for the Vikings who yeah it was a ten point when but it wasn't impressed if it was an emphatic it wasn't anything like that there were still floppy you know I'm Still waiting for the Vikings team to put it together\nOr they look like the Thirteen and three Vikings from last year\nAnd they just haven't been able to do that yet so I Can't fully buy into them but I just think they're simply a better team than the jets at this point they've got it decimated secondary look for Adam the land to have a huge game today because you're going to have a fixed around rookie trying to guard him\nWith a what is it over there Perry Dickerson yeah when you get old Perry Dickerson matched up\nOn an Adam feeling that it's a big time mismatch so what do you live by liberals to take advantage of that\nYou could ... you know and you're right if I was going to win this game to just a bit of tea but\nProbably one of the better gays might be the best game of the day the saints at the ravens saints for one raving oh yeah two and a loss for the same today will be the first lawsuits opening day that forty eight forty look to Tampa Bay and I'm looking at the line right now it looks right now that both well mine is two and a half\nBaltimore given up two and a half to New Orleans today is a good game it really is and of course game is in Baltimore so we'll see what happens now ravens defense is tremendous shut up Tennessee last week Twenty one zip and uh the ravens have one of the NFL's best third downs defensive so this game matches one of the ... best passing a tax which Drew Brees it's one of the best past\nDefenses so we'll see what happens today\nYeah how 'bout that the ravens are the only team Drew Brees hasn't beaten in his Eighteen year career only team that's the last one is going to check off the list\nAnd I'll tell you this if you look at the St I Know the matchup is what you're saying Andy it's that ... against that ravens the fence that's going to be fantastic to watch for it but if you look at the opposite\nIf you look at the saints they've got the seventh lowest pressure rate the season and Joe Flaco is actually been very good when not pressured it's got eight touchdowns one pick in those situations so when he's got a clean pocket believe it or not Joe Flaco has been doing some damage to the season\nWell he's got the you know why he's got some young fast receivers which you had that in the past they've got a decent Ron game to right now so but but still it all I I think at the end of the day\nYou got a great defense which to me will always be a better off that and I think they're able to go the windows ... plus one be a real close game but I think the rabies with maybe one of those games at last team with the ... the game\nYeah it's a tough one for me to see Andy because I really the games that are tough to forecast are the ones that I can totally see going each way like the opposite happening I can see the saints even though they don't play great defense\nKeeping Drew Brees relatively clean today and they're often scoring enough points where the ravens just can't match points and I can see the opposite happening where the ravens play really good defense the saints can't get pressure on Joe Flaco\nAnd the raisins just keep rolling their in a bit of a groove right now I can see both things clearly happening and so it's a toss up for me man\nAnd went all y'all up you'd probably favor the home team\nYeah that's what I'm saying I mean when it comes right down to it I mean both was tremendous at home they really are and it could be very tough at home also\nTo beat so I I think if I were to uh make a pick up I had to make a pick up this game I looked at Baltimore and a close game probably by three or four points no more than that less than a touchdown I'd say\nYeah should be a good one man maybe you go teaser maybe throw this game into a teaser where you get extra points where do you think we should do that Andy from I Would say that given the success with teaser is this year\nYou will not have this game and those picks that I could promise [laughter]\nYou're right about that I Will not have it\nAll right Brian from uh we'll live from the Geico Fox Sports radio studios or by the way the lineup as

[laughter]\nRight now so I'm not you you bet the over the the rams shut 'em out fifty to nothing right\nMight just get out of control early and and also in it if the rams get a faster than they usually do so we'll see what happens and I think they want to prove to everybody I mean I'm thinking like the coaching staff will tell them this is a pre game hype\nYou know last week you sweat it at Denver you won by three let's show that way the best office and the league the whole rah rah CIA come out the ... mall these\nGuys well and and the other thing and to keep this in mind too because the chargers took the niners lightly and barely beat him the Packers didn't play well and I think to some degree they took him lightly even though it's a Monday Night stage\nSo that's bad for the forty niners today you've been shown McVeigh is able to say hey look guys we got to be on it we got to be focused we can't just go through the motions and expect to win so I think the niners keeping it close to the last few games hurts them in this fight against the rams because I don't believe the rams will take them lightly\nNo doubt about that Brian no different but we all live from the guy go thought sports radio studios and fathers seem to be the best supporters and Alex while this explains but first we go to a guy Kevin thanks for the latest\nHurt any we'll start with some news out of

father went on social media to defend his son and accused of giants owner John Mara oh the ... how do you keep this guy and your team honestly really\nWell I mean that's the whole thing with the giants right you pay someone they they they put the horse before the court right or the cart before the horse think about it like this you don't wait this year to see its own overcomes you and you're going to change is he gonna\nMaybe work himself more into the team fabric has he not going to say things that put the franchise in a bad light and then we'll pay him the contract to make sure that\nThis is the direction we want to go down no instead you're paying back um junior sixteen point four million dollars on the average to do exactly what he's doing right now I mean you did you think it was going to change now that he's been paid well\nWhat responsibility does he after the giants right he's going to speak his mind and you know throwing more gasoline on to the dumpster fire that is Eli Manning's NFL career at this point causing that problem and now the salt water and look somewhere you have to draw a line over back and junior saying he doesn't like water and potentially leading to ration issues\nI mean you know really and and you know again you know what I think John Marshall be criticized not for hypocrisy for running this franchise into the ground in recent years look at where this Giants' team is that\nYou know what's their future I mean they had an Asian quarterback they have no one really that we can count on to to be good in the future we don't know what ... is they got to work on the offensive line still I mean that's the whole mess in the defense I don't think that personnel really fits in with James ... wants to get done so they got to make some more changes there I I\nYou know Alex this ankle injury what's called little Mac do you think it goes as far to negate Rob ... ski probably being out do you think that it negates the advantage for the bears defensively with him being a little bit ...\nWhile you know looking back it's going to make his seventieth street or are we going to play in the Seventy a straight game you actually didn't start one game when he first arrived in Chicago and that's unfortunate for him because he had that starting street going but we have to see you know that's the thing we just don't know how how you know\nHow much is going to be able to do on that and we do know robber and kept the most likely out of course this has to him in the pocket book as well sixty two thousand five hundred dollars flies out\nThe window because that's the amount of money that he makes every game that he is active it also is it makes it more difficult for him to collect on an incentive package it could be collecting three point three million dollars purportedly his back locked up in practice on friday they decided not to have and take the trip\nTo Chicago so it's been interesting interesting season as well Tom Brady his use of the spine outright not having all those weapons\nFirst four days is really an adult when finally get everyone back and then boom gr and kept it goes down at least for a week now get ESPN is reporting that he should be back ... should be back for the Monday Night game against buffalo got to see on ... you know and this barest team it was so disappointing last week but there were shenanigans yet dare I say\nStand against pulled by the Miami Dolphins yeah being forthcoming with is Ryan tannahill shoulder injury ... goes your game planning for a different quarterback it is it is an adjustment for this team and the dolphins being investigated for shenanigans on the injury report\nRight speak English and ended up like borders the quarterbacks three touchdowns turnovers to gain spin is this time in Jacksonville running out\nYes I mean if he if this is the way the season is going to go I mean look you still there are baby ... there are people in that organization that banging the drum for like ... and he's the guy who's extremely popular among his teammates they they really it really is they believe that he's a winner he works hard you know he's just not a dynamic player and and the problem they're having is\nThird and long and this was a fear of the jaguars organization going into the season that there would be stuck in third in long situations potentially and they would struggle to convert I I don't think the ... is is disappointing as the defense I mean they gave up forty points last week\nTo Dallas to Dallas okay I mean Kobe easily it's still catching passes against them because they can't cover guys in the ... and that comes off the game they play to get Kansas City where the chiefs also put a forty point I mean this is not the drivers are spending so much money on the defensive side of the football have so much blue chip talent\nThey have to figure something out right there big game against she used to and I'm telling you the Indianapolis Colts did that division a disservice they could have crippled the Houston Texans chances for competing in this division by just going for the tie\nYou know and overtime you know don't go for it on fourth and for\nPlay for the tie you're going to save your you'll stay buoyant as far as the playoff race but at that point the Texans would have been over three and one\nAnd they and they would have pretty much been over instead by having the chance to win that game by stopping the colds and then go and you compare it to feel go they've won three straight there now sitting on top of the division with jet Tennessee in Jacksonville and the culture sitting down at the bottom dum dum dum dum dum", "show_name": "FOX Sports Radio", "year": "2018", "city": "Iowa City", "day": "21"}
