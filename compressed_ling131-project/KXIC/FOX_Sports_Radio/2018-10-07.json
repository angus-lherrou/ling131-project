three Brian now it looks like you're on a little\nBit of history give me two or three you you say I got two out of the one that I wouldn't want to in one two out of the ... same thing\nIs it's not a legal difference there was a ... real yeah hey man I say I don't\nKnow what I meant what did I miss I was hoping for three you know the\nOnly one you miss towards our Rosen throwing over two hundred two hundred point five passing yards he actually had one eighty on the day so\nI'm clear to me at all or the other one I thought was funny or you know the uh the giants and the saints were playing each other and we had you know combined touchdown passes by both quarterbacks only one was thrown in that game it was not nearly a shootout that we did we thought it might be so\nFit any take the over on that one yeah I took the over\nYeah we have to say for yourself from and\nI have to go to the bathroom [laughter] and I had that might throws by the way Andy I miss that that I had\nThe over in the St giants game and they just could not get on track ban and finally ... scored at the end when they're basically running the clock out and it gave me a glimmer of hope and Eli Manning against the prevent defense he was like\nYeah well I don't I just hold the ball you along and take it back and build a bomb that\nAppears no for taking the over that's what ...\nThat was the land the whole the whole time that was ruining the game let's move on plays on getting All right yeah so you guys were talking about it a little\nBit earlier high over under fifty eight for the falcons at Steelers later today\nI actually think it's an e for that over on her I think it's an easy over so I made my own over under for this guy well over under sixty five and a half in falcons in Steelers and if you remember the bangles and the falcons last week it was a Seventy three total for that so that's that's how I kinda got it so Brian\nSixty five and a half over under falcons Steelers\nAnd adjusted lined by you I I have to take the under just based on the odd your point Ryan it could it could go over I wouldn't be shocked but the odds favor the under so I'll take that\nYou know it's funny you mentioned that I I look at I look at the total right now with this came about sixty three I gotta go wonder because I Love my ... against the wall but now I gotta start winning here but there's like a fool John going on\nAll right All right we'll switch over here are you guys were also talking about this jailing Ramsey entire retail they've been doing a little trash talking back and forth leading up to their or\nJags at Kansas City on Sunday shaman Ramsey doesn't really believe tiring so wide receiver Ramsey doesn't isn't really a over or a hill wasn't really over ... overly impressed with Ramsey\nThat being said over under fifty and a half receiving yards retiree kill on the day against the jags\nAndy [noise] say under under on those yeah I'll take\nThe over real every kill him yeah you got the explosive play making ability over there that's not a\nCrazy total at all I think we're selling them too short to say yeah he's not capable of course he's capable of you\nKnow alright yeah I think it could go either way on that one so things will be out and then finally I after a shootout with the Vikings in LA during last week's TANF game the rams pretty much look unstoppable at least to me\nLA travels to Seattle this weekend and the sea hawks defense is not really what it once was so over under thirty and a half points for gender rams against Seattle\nBrian good line by Iran to push it to [noise]\n\nThey don't want to know just random badly I I'm gonna I'll take the over\n... ... you've got Sean McVeigh is going to exploit matchups I'll take\nThe over into the school

a member of the McGregor team meanwhile a member of his team jumped corner in the spring [noise]\nYou have to say go after the corners and a guy like Stefan does has to have a big day today I guess maybe a guy like jailing meals I mean you got to attack the corners on the Philadelphia Eagles is the fact they can can can ... get that could have success suggests that today that the ... the basic key I think that this game\nOh yeah absolutely can no doubt and it was a joke for her cousin to get criticized after the performance against the rams it's insane to me you know it's like people will criticized Tom Brady\nFor losing to the eagles and the super bowl they just see the patriots the sense you know what I mean like if you look at current cousins last week against the rams he had a great game over three hundred and fifty yards passing three touchdown pass I think it was over four hundred actually had a great game you know\nAnd you're going to put that on Kirk or criticize him before the defense that the fence was atrocious against the rams so I just hate when\nA lot of people overlook obvious flaws an obvious deficiencies to just go straight to the quarterback and be Lance guys not get it done you hear that a lot with Matthew Stafford in the ... and the ... the lions you know\nHe has it been walking on water but there are a lot more things to blame than just Matthew Stafford so I think that Kurt cousins and the same division is in that same ballpark right now where you overlook other deficiencies and go straight to him it's crazy\nWhen I was on one step further maybe we could see we're very well could see a shootout in this game 'cause there's a lot of these on both sides I could see a school or maybe in the high sixties combined on this game\nHigh sixties today yeah yeah yeah [noise] wow he is an issue out hug you could very well be I I think they could put up about thirty and maybe or something like maybe thirty four thirty one something like that a game like that thirty five\nWow I I don't see it that high I don't I see it somewhere in the twenties but I haven't seen the eagles off fence really get on track yet\nAnd yet the eagles play tough defense at home they really do they're really good defensively so um I don't see it being that high scoring but it's one of these games not great records one two and one versus too into it it's a huge game for both\nThey got out showing Jeffrey back on the eagles have our Sean desk and to help that\nThey had over a hundred yards receiving last week so\nI mean he's going to help attack the Vikings defense you know as for the eagles so I think that's a bit it's a big deal but uh\nYou know I I just I I it's hard for me to picture a team that was so dominant last year but they were only as you mentioned dominant down the stretch\nAnd as one of those days you get a role and you catch that role I think the ravens did that in the super bowl year they roll towards the end they rolled run into the super bowl that's what happens you know and yeah it's a situation where a team that starts off poorly\nThat's a bigger I guess the biggest taboo for fans maybe even media of a team goes like one in three like they freaked out on the patriots early on but as you say if they go to in to down the stretch in December is that going to be as bad as they go to into in September there's just the way it is\nYou're right you're right yeah yeah but hey listen sometimes teams freak out just like fans do you do sometimes teams they start pressing\nAnd they get in their own way so\nWe'll see if the the Vikings can avoid pressing to a fault you know I think there are times where there's a sense of urgency and your laser focused and you're locked in and it helps\nAnd there are other times you just try to do too much like bell check always breaches do your job it's like you're trying to do three jobs at one time it just\nIt doesn't work like that so I'm really curious who gets on track tonight\nOr today is it going to be that Vikings defense or will it be that eagles off and and that's going to be a that's going to be a big factor and who wins today and good\nGames for twenty five eastern time
