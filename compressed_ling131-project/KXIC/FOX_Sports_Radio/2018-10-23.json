Cooper gets turned into a first round pick the cowboys give up for him so the raiders congratulations you've fleece the cowboys I don't know how\nBut I I ... you give away ... but then you get a first round pick for a guy who was a Jack and there's going to be a free agent in a year so the big day for the writers I give them a lot of credit because they they got it made a good deal\nAnd I can I throw in a a quick thing here though I've seen on Twitter and Facebook and all sorts of media all day people trying to draw the comparison to what the patriots gave up\nFor Josh Gordon I'm already Cooper you may not white his output you may look at the disparity between how many fewer than thirty games there three thirty receiving your games he has versus a hundred yard games it's about a three to one ratio on the outside\nHe hasn't been suspended for here is that an eye [laughter] okay while you may like Josh Gordon talent and mentally one slip up but he never sees the field again\nThis is the thing about the Dallas Cowboys\nIs that well obviously should they get a first round pick no this is the Jerry Jones special or this is like if I went to the clearest been at a supermarket I pick something out I'm not going to the register saying no I Want to pay double you don't pay you give up a first round pick for I'm Ari Cooper he's just not good enough\nBut the cowboys did it a bigger thing is why because the cowboys have been so mismanaged the last couple of years this is all they have is to be able to go bargain basement hunting\nThey got themselves in such salary cap hell they have to take chances and every NFL Draft why did it take guys like while colleges somebody with a character concerns or someone who's with an injury history but\nHas first round talent because they can't pay for anybody else they have no choice but to make these moves they have no choice but to make a trade for a more Cooper 'cause there's nowhere else they can get guys like this so this is how they've been mismanaged back to being the Dallas Cowboys\nThey were like twelve years ago\nAnd this is not going to be something that is going to be looked back out and say well here's a turning point for the Dallas Cowboys I'm already Cooper is just the guy he's been just a guy if you need him I get it but to give up a first round pick\nThat's just ludicrous especially a guy who in the year is walking away when the cowboys conceivably could continue to suck and suddenly that first round pick looks really good for the raiders\nThe cowboys completely mismanaged everything and it's not just this trait it's because of everything else that came up to the trade is why they had to make this ...\nWhat's the danger of thinking you're better than you are right you you make this move because you're a three and four and you say you know what in the east we've got a shot\nIs this guy is making that much better mhm\nThat's that's the big question if you if you're going all in\nAnd he's the different maker to make you a potentially a wildcard gene perhaps go and steal individual beliefs still try to figure itself out\nAnd you still have Washington that we don't know how much we liked them so I guess that's what your point workers Cooper is only got one more year at his deal mhm like that's the big part of it is that there is no longevity year and the price\nFor wide receivers is going to ask an article that the guy you want to bet on Twitter at about ...

double digits Lakers his first now not at at one twenty eight and headed to oh she as staples center to monitor Rosen was\nThey win a damn thing so it doesn't matter if you spend money poorly and other positions which they have the all kinds of wine is still a turnstile oftentimes\nThey haven't shows like one Barclay out to pick up a blitz yet so there is you lie manning getting back into by his running back and the opposing Russia so you got all these other component parts of your roster where you've you've really made some\nTactical errors in terms of I\nBill things so you like manning wasn't great I mean three Ninety nine they gotta be eye popping in the box score you miss some throws miss some opportunities but you know there's there's so many things wrong with the giants right now that it's really easy to just throw it out a dark board and it's something\nAbout that but that's but that's the point is it's not about older because then if you want to you could throw the off the field stuff on it go boy now is he really worth it but I mean but let's not even right after that part of it this is just\nThe importance of a wide receiver and being smart in spending money because you have so much to fix on this team but here's outback um junior that now you have committed a ton of that money to\nThat you need to be able to attract free agents you to be able to have enough money to continue to build the team did you have so many holes in this roster your entire offensive line your defense everywhere but you come in and all this money to outback of junior there's only so much I Know the salary cap goes up every year but you can win the lotto money to him\nAnd now you're no closer to fixing the problems is Ross dress then you were when you gave it to him\nThe giants are an absolute dumpster fire\nI mean they're they're a dumpster fire and\nAs Jake laser said hey listen you they're going to need two or three years to get out from under there at right now so now if I ask you was giving back um junior that kind of money the best thing they could do or should they a franchise them in a franchise and again\nAnd we're going to I'm going to pay you know I'm always going to charge your franchise you off I'll get great production out of you you got to stay healthy and it's awesome\nBut they decided no we want to pay you want to keep your long term he's a wide receiver\nA franchise anybody that shutdown quarterback you is that the price of the quarterback is escalating far faster than the other position so if I've got a quarterback that I Believe in and I want around full time that's the guy I invest my money in but as we've seen the giants the big contracts with other guys to try to\nFill holes and even coming off last year there were so many injuries off that team I think to some degree it was believing that getting them healthy was going to be enough to be competitive again and in this NFC West that's been\nMediocre at best right your leader in the clubhouse is Washington at foreign to but how good are they\nRight stole a lot of I mean you got to win over the cowboys a little bit of controversy everybody up in arms and the cowboys immediately going make a trait but we can look at the the giants and I think\nTo some degree there was the belief that you had enough around and coupled with a couple of pieces of put a little spat on it that you can put you lie manning behind that team and get it rolling\nFox Sports radio the Jason Smith show with my bags\nFred my carbonate seven seven Ninety nine on Fox Twitter at how about a fresco Mike had swollen dome I mean that that's the the reality with the New York giants which is why paying money for a wide receiver it's just it's not worth it\nIt's not it's not going to help you it's not going to take you to the promised land no one builds their team around wide receivers wide receivers are positions that need to be liquid that you need to build debts\nAnd you build around a quarterback that can make the right calls that's how you should build this team and the giants have failed to realize how to build this team what they should have done is in star instead of giving money to oh back to them\nAnd drafting say Kwan Barclay what do we do watch the fastest way to building a good team let's go out and get a good offensive line let's make the right off the blind decisions and less draft a quarterback\nBut instead they didn't do that so let's go top heavy with a couple of big names and there are no closer to being good than they were before then they have on the plus side\nYou're going to get a quarterback on a nice rookie deal going forward\n[noise] this is true yeah you're ... yeah with\nWith your star receiver and running back already in place yeah yeah so in theory it did in feeling theory you could work there shouldn't the reverse right normally you want the quarterback and then you build around in here now you're going to jam the quarter back into that situation you can control the locker room cancer you're young guy fresh out of college\nBut Jason's red showing my Carmen quick update from staple center the Lakers trying to hold on against

gravity president John F. Kennedy announces a U.S spy planes have discovered Soviet missile bases in Cuba Kennedy announced that he was\nOrdering a naval quarantine of Cuba to prevent Soviet ships for transporting any more offensive weapons to the island was known as the Cuban missile crisis essentially ended on October twenty eight when the Soviets announced they would dismantle and remove all weapons in Cuba and this week in twenty twelve Lance Armstrong is formerly strips\nAnd lovable sorted out the gate with ten points the first quarter he carried\nThe Lakers early and things weren't as\nRocky as you'd expect with Lorenzo and LeBron Lorenzo did knock down a couple of freeze he was three out of seven if he can do that and the Bronx and find them for open shots like that he can make those they can work better together so now the Lakers have found something out that maybe they wouldn't have found out\nHad Lorenzo and brand names are not been suspended ... they would have kept going the way that will ... going to come off the bench be part of the second unit and that'll work but now they're ... wait a minute\nWho's ma and it started up here this is my workforce will suddenly laws on LeBron playing together okay this this this is my work a little bit here so the Lakers may have found stuffed tonight they would not have found otherwise\nYeah I mean the ... like you shouldn't run into that just by reviewing the tape from last season right 'cause how many times was the only guy that you can count on to make a shot and it was a nice distraction you know from the distraction of\nLove our bombs on what's going on and he was lawns and was heard it was still well what's with lawns in his knee and all that discussion meanwhile coups Miller went out ... rookie wall but yet himself a fantastic here and showed he can make shots here with LeBron James we see with Lorenzo at least for one night\nAnd it's a small sample size\nBut I catch and shoot\nWasn't atrocious actually knock down a couple of shots because you know that that's just collapsing on the broad loves is going to have a lot overlooks last year it was open looks before he got hurt because he couldn't shoot and people were daring him to shoot\nIf he's added any element of an outside shot becomes that much more dangerous 'cause you gotta get a lot of opportunities with ... LeBron James and how much\nDefenses have to focus on what he's doing whether he's stepping back are getting ready to\nPut his head down and go ... drive into the lane and such so ah interesting night obviously not a lot of defense but highly entertaining for those at staples center to watch this one for us here and the guy goes studios to see even though they go down on three\nYou know the the wheels are churning for the Lakers and there eventually going to move one or more of these parts and go find a legitimate spot a shooter but for the moment\nThey got some more aptitude from from players and and they're learning some new things about the second year pros\nDoing around how about a fresco Mike its role in Douma Jason Smith show with my band is Fred my car but we got more liberal and the Lakers on the way coming up in one minute the biggest story and football tonight is about math but first step cars with what's trending\nD.C alright well after trailing the spurs by double digits the Lakers rallied and LeBron James at the game time shot descended to oh team down by one in ... when he hit the\nWrong hands on the plane back onto that shot is also one\nOver time San Antonio wins that\nSpurs radio and the ... the Lakers dot the season on three San Antonio and proved to to and wanted to start the season also an overtime game in Portland the wizards meet the blazers one twenty five one twenty four Markey Morris led Washington ... L O T needed in Oakland warriors\nDrill the sons one twenty three one oh three Monday Night football action falcons held off the giants twenty three twenty Atlanta is three and four\nGiant started the

the raiders continue to clear their house trading\nReceiver I'm Ari Cooper the cowboys Dallas giving up a first round taken twenty nine teen agers also placed in Martian lands on I are with the grind

quarterback Josh Alan already ruled out for a week eight next Monday Night because of his elbow injury so Derrick Anderson gets to start for the second\nStraight week how happy your bills fan and people who are streaming defenses against that way that's Monday Night football next Monday Night out and to make up some stories read your rack racking up the eight hundred dollars worth of ground me a highly rated game for about a quarter [laughter] that I knew that\nWere alive for the guy goes studios were Fifteen minutes can save you Fifteen Percent or more in car insurance more info visit Geico dot com so the big play in tonight's Monday Night football game has to do with a to point conversion that didn't have an impact on the end of the game\nWith the giants trailing by two touchdowns late in the fourth quarter say corn Barclay goes in from a couple of yards out twenty to twelve extra point pending\nInstead of kicking the extra point the giants go for two they don't get it passed the oh back um junior in the front part of the end zone out L just drops it\nSo now the giants are down eight if they were going to tie this game they would need a touchdown and a to point conversion and everybody wondered why would you do this\nEverybody has the same defense of who is defending patch or for this decision\nThe math the math works out the math works out anywhere from a fifty five sixty percent chance if you can convert to win the game versus a zero percent chance to win if you kick to extra points and go to overtime\nEverybody says the same thing the math works the math works\nI get that part of it but here's what people are leaving out\nNumber one all the all the the the popular defenses of this on Twitter number one Doug Peterson did a couple of weeks ago okay just because Doug Peterson won the super bowl doesn't mean it's right that is like when you when you're when your mom touches you were you jumping off the roof yeah Billy did\nIt oh oh well okay and ... and you jumping really jumping up and lead Billy did it oh so Billy oh that that it's fine that\nJust because Doug Peterson did it doesn't mean it's a rite application and football yes the math works that you should be able to convert however there is more at stake than just math\nThere is more at stake than just well anywhere from fifty to sixty percent of the time it works would however the variable goes for this\nThat's not good enough because there's too many variables if you want to keep going math than just the masses you should do this the giants are a bad football team\nRight that does that take into account how many bad football teams get to point conversion does the math work for that no the mess just works overall but you've got to say hey how many teams that are are not talented what what's their record for two point conversion\nBut that's where the math comes into play here okay it than that and that you're eliminating one of the variables if this works in your your favor and ... back in June we're actually catches the ball because now you got your two and assuming you the best that\nThere's a lot of there's a lot of variables that way and there's too many variables that here's one you're\nKnocking on off the back in because\nIf you're on the road and you're a bad team and\nEverything that ... can go wrong has all year let's not play for overtime which is essentially what Schumer and company are doing here right because you get the two point conversion here\nYou've closed it to six and if you're able to get a stop to get the ball back scored a touchdown now you're kicking PHD and you win the game and you're going to overturn\nI'm not playing for over playing for overtime has kicked the extra points scored a touchdown and go for two to try to win the game you know that would that's Len do that with the ...\nFor over ... your your answers you're playing to win because if you you're going to need to score second touchdown unless you can somehow managed the clock may look we see a lot of coaches mismanaged the clock\nThere was no way you were getting that extra possession in there that people are going to argue I could have gone to feel goes I Know that there's a turnover you're not getting to know what the idea being that if you if you or the two\nAnd you're down just six touchdown Cosby eighty you're done you're not leaving it to the fifty fifty proposition that is over time which is probably skewed when you were at one in five team\nOn the road there's add those ... back and it's probably a lesser than fifty percent chance of going in and we didn't get overtime so you're trying to eliminate that and take that off the board\nI get I get the math I get to understand I don't know what I that's what Chris was talking about you don't like it but if you're trying to convert\nIt's a fifty fifty it's a little bit over fifty percent chance you get a to point that's not high enough that's not high enough for me when your goal is to try to win the game if you go for two trying to go for two twice it's one over two times won over to that one quarter that's twenty five percent chance no that's right that's\nInaccurate wash their dirty they're independent place that I find that very one over two and one over no but it right but it's half perhaps that's not one half times because they're not related to independent place\nRight it but if these are not proficient wondering OK okay sorry so if if you're not talking about getting both if you're trying to get the first one and that's a fifty percent play a tiny bit over fifty percent\nWhat's the game that you really get is it is it worth it because what you need on a fifty percent play a tiny bit over fifty percent is you're still down ...\nYou still need to get the ball back and score a touch nothing the falcons do\nIs change that often they do the same thing on often they're trying to get first downs to kill the clock and they are going to put the ball away to you if you stop them because all they have to do is stop you from getting in the end zone they let you do anything else but get in the end zone now if you get into kicked the extra point yeah in theory then you win but nothing changes for that\nYou don't get that much of an advantage if you miss it now suddenly you have to get a touchdown and you have to convert a fifty fifty play\nWith ten seconds left me hers hit a jumper to take the lead LeBron misses the fade away at the buzzer and the Lakers come out of it with the laws too soon borough already\nThe number two treading topic on Twitter is Kobe right [laughter] people\nSaying the same thing they'd Kobe and the Lakers that Kobe ever started when three with Kobe I missed all the shots Coby Coby Coby Coby what did we tell you what's going to be something LeBron James was not ready for he's not ready for many Lakers fans to hate him\nThere are many Coby fans who still are waiting to embrace LeBron James and have him at arm's length\nIf LeBron when's the championship you of course everybody's going to love him but because this is what people are like there are many Lakers fans who would be just as happy to see LeBron fall on his face because they can say see we knew it he's not Coby he's not shack he's not magic he's not ... not will and they would say that\nLeBron's not ready for a portion of the fan base to really not like him\nAnd that's what's happening right now he's not ready for that but that's what's going on because you're already seeing Kobe not LeBron is trending not know Toby is trying to because the Kobe automated now maybe Kobe's got a bunch of burner accounts and therefore I fried rice and this is what's happening but that wouldn't happen\nBut their trust me there's a big part a Laker fans who would love to see LeBron fails so they can say see he's not really one of us and that\nTweet and that line of argument in the social media severe got to run right before you hit the three quarter to force overtime and then once things crumbled uh towards the end of O T where they blew the six point lead with ... minutes winding up this for ESPN stature didn't bother to account\nYou miss two free throws a twelve seconds left that overtime Lakers up one and the bottle Fifteen seconds of a fourth quarter overtime but brought us now ten of Twenty one from the free throw wives and one score games that started last season\nAlready eight percent worst feel free throw percentage\nOf any player with at least ten in those situations where you go over the past ... hours [laughter]\nBut that's I mean look nobody would have been facing murals\nIn LA if\nLeBron was loved by everybody but he's not he's got to win every body over and I mean it that's just human nature people so yeah I'm happy just as happy with him failing as I Am seeing him when now Luke Walton new straight out of the playbook up I got to do something to deflect all this bad attention from abroad so here's Luke Walton following the game\nTalking about the officiating and how upset he is at it\nI just can't anymore it's suddenly stone points in the paint the fifth me something again they shoot us in the free going thirty eight for those of what was the play watch the play where I got a technical Sal watch what happened to the brawn James is on it's the same thing\nThat James Harden and Chris ... shot thirty freak those on the night before federal abroad pulls up on a screen somebody trying to fight over same same thing they shop for those on the same thing we are going Seventy points that night in the pain was tell just hurt plays this game you play\nForty minutes tonight all he does is attacked around zero freak those tonight zero I Know they're young\nI get that but if we're going to play a certain way let's not reward people for flopping thirty feet from the whole on plays that have nothing to do with that possession they're just plop and just to ... see they get up alcohol and then not reward players that are physically go into the basket and getting hit\n[noise] take data that I'd be banking on that table about thirty average I I get the points in the paint everybody in the end\nLuke Walton is trying to deflect from the fact that they blew a six point lead with fifty five seconds\nLeBron tried to call time out they didn't have one LeBron miss two free throws LeBron Mr shot this is all to try to say OK I Want people now I'll take the heat for LeBron now because this where oh and three and LeBron made did not make plays and he's going to get killed

R. M. almost six in his postseason career\nAnd who knows what you're going to get in game one and David prize is the enigma for the red Sox just because he won a playoff game does that mean now this becomes the new normal\nFor David Price he's three and nine within the area of over five in his postseason Nathan of all these been the top picture the red Sox have had this year it has been really good in\nThe playoffs so ... and the other thing here to the rivers the Dodgers have\nIf they can win a game and Boston which is a big if\nIt's a big gift or one of these first two but they ... they have the advantage in at Chavez Ravine 'cause the red Sox are either going to have to take one of the top ... players or one of their top defensive players out of the line up\nWith no designated hitter now there's talk of moving Mulkey bats who has played second base in his past that they could put him at second base in LA but that is risky because the Dodgers have this guy named Manny Machado who could take out his ankle or his knee at second base and then move the best\nWe've done [noise] for the post season so you\nReally want to go down there with an inexperienced second baseman but someone is going to be chained to the bench who would otherwise be playing in a normal American League setting\nFor the red Sox and it could be that they play Jackie Bradley junior and center and they put Jeannie Martinez and been intending in the outfield and ... goes to second but then you're playing an unproven second baseman and I would think that you would try to hit every ball to ... to make sure that he is battle tested\nIn that situation now to the party and shot on this the wild card\nIf you will for lack of a better term\nFor the Dodgers happens to be many ... taught me when I was a kid I used to watch White Sox games on television you pick the click\nIs is Manny ...\nThis is his final few games is a Dodger he will not be back in Los Angeles that is by mutual decision he will go somewhere else\nOr will we wish him the best you can go on and play in New York or wherever in Philadelphia where every ends up but he's only got a few games left as a Dodger but he's going to go out in style as the most valuable player of the twenty Eighteen\nWorld Series a and there's bad blood this is going to be the storyline that the mainstream baseball media follows is Machado because when he was in Baltimore\nHe got into it with Dusten input draw he actually his slide led to the demise of dust and put joy or there was being ball action between Baltimore and Boston Machado\nWas there so the red Sox have some low achieving for many\nFrom the past and there is legit that this is legit beat this is not you know how much of it is going to be contrived by the media there's something there that's a real\nBut the main reason to pick Machado is passed results now passed results do not guarantee future out gums but mainly Machado has hit over three hundred with a Nineteen eighty eight O P s in his career against for sale he's batted three forty two against Rick poor cello\nIs career he's batted almost three hundred against David Price Machado has raped\nAgainst the top pitchers that the red Sox are going to send out there in his Baltimore tenure so if he can play at that level\nThe world series this was an easy pick if he goes full Frankenstein at Fenway a place he is generally played pretty well that's a good spot\nBut outside of\nCamden Yards made him a shot I looked up he has as many home runs at Fenway Park as he does it any other ballpark other than Camden Yards he has destroyed the red socks over the years and in in particular at Fenway he's got as many home runs\nIn Boston as he does at Dodger Stadium and he was with the Dodgers after the trade that line the rest of the year\nAnd he is not going to hustle so don't expect him to also\nIt doesn't matter the Phillies are going to pay them the Yankees oh Pam somebody like Atlanta will step up and pay him he will break the piggy bank it's going to happen and he'll be rewarded for his lack of ...\n[noise] now in the opposite side of the table the guy that should give\nNight tremors through the Dodgers pitching staff is JD Martinez this is the guy who is going to destroy the Dodgers in this series Martinez has this just\nDemolished Clinton curve Shaw when he was with the Diamondbacks briefly and elsewhere Martinez is hit almost five hundred against Clinton gr shower with a bunch of home runs and he's done well against review he's done well against rich hill\nOr in his career so he's the guy that is the centerpiece of that Red Sox and you've been the centerpiece all year but he has had great success\nI guess many of the Dodgers pitching so there's the ... that's it I explained it all there's no question you have no questions asked everything was laid out seven game world series much shadows your MVP much discussed of many\nAnd the Dodgers will and the national disgrace that has been Thirty years without winning the world series\nAnd they they will get that done been way too long this year but ... ... for he's ready to go I'm ready to go up and what does that sure you've been

the giants and the Atlanta Falcons now a lot of people\nLot of gamblers were very upset with the outcome of the game because the one thing that you assume was going to happen\nIn Monday Night football with these two people the bad defensive teams you assume this was going to be a shootout and that this game was going to go back and forth and that this total would end up somewhere in the fifty range by the time the game ended that this would just be a attract me\nIn Atlanta and that not only did that not happen between these two teams the game went\nWay under way under the total total was fifty two and a half and they were lucky then there was a touchdown with five seconds to go in the game that got the forty three points\nSo it was it was not even really close to being an over at any point for the giants did get the back door cover with the late touched down there if you're a gambling men you know what I'm Talking about there they were\nAt the beginning of the week when we did bending the Benny versus the penny there were like a five and a half to five point favorite the game ended up at land a favor the falcons rather favorite by five I\nThink it was four and a half it closed at four and a half and that touchdown made it a three point final Atlanta got the win but only a three point spread over the giants but the the guys getting just killed\nIs a Mr funny to Mr done patch termer funny though Don\nWho made several questionable\nDecision that every coach likes to say we have this chart where there's a chart in front of us that tells us exactly what to do in game

when they have no patience and they give up on players after a couple of years pellets jak then goes in and take slows players and is able to get great production out of them and they've already got two or three years experience in the NFL\nAnd it's it's a genius strategy that the patriots have\nLike they interview everybody pitches the interviewer ready for the draft and then when these guys

and\nThe consensus seems to be by many people watching the Monday Night game the patch rumor is either someone that failed basic math or just doesn't give a damn or all of that because the giants were down eleven points\nAnd they they came back they were actually down by fourteen at one point in the fourth quarter\nThey went for two\nAnd it was one of the more controversial decisions because they were trying to cut the score from twenty to twelve to twenty to fourteen and this upset\nThe broadcasting crude jokes Tessa tour\nWho's a walking talking cliche of or a parody of what a sports caster is football out drama yeah well then we have Jason waiting who is of course trying to just get the the idioms down pat you know\nAll that so they were they were aghast at patch sure we're going for two\nAnd are they what are you doing here and all that stuff I didn't have as big a problem with that my big issue with passion rumor\nIs how bad the giants are and they're not getting any better they might as well kept ... you can tell when a team as well coached not that the giants were gonna you know be the end all be all and all that stuff I'm not saying that what you can tell when the team ... is is poked well in the players kind of get it\nAnd that's not the case with the New York football giants they are a hot mess they might as well kept bend Mac do around they are handicap because of their head coach or their quarterback rather allies are manning but the giants now if they're played seven games\nAnd they are one in six is the giants record somehow they beat the Houston Texans which is more about the Texans than it does anybody else or but is on real man that the the how bad\nThis this Giants' team is and I who they're going to be like the red they play the Redskins this coming week the Redskins are better than they are\nThey got the by we maybe they can beat the forty niners but that game is in Santa Clara\nAnd you figure coming off the by there'll be a little bit of a hangover after by week and so the niners globally the niners em but that\nThat that that could be the only that in the cold ski and they got two more games that you say they could win\nBut then you know the wild card you get teams like Chicago and what not and he was here from the head coach at least for now of the giants this guy's a good soundbite he's funny though he's done he's all that patch trimmer on his controversial coaching does it\nGot to get a mess right sneak it from the one I don't I again I just saw a much much pile there so I don't know why it didn't work but from the one yard line there we've got to get it if we did\nYeah I Believe he's referring to the two quarterbacks need the snakes that allowed the clock to run down so by the time the giants finally scored a touchdown there was five seconds to go because they kept running quarterback snakes to me that's a much more agree just action\nThan any you know go on for too 'cause I I kind of like the two point thing I'll tell you why\nWhy you go for two down twenty to twelve\n'cause if you get it then that touchdown wins the game but even if you don't get it it's still one score game you've got to convert a to point diversion in that equation one time but it gives you two chances to get a to point conversion so I like that I liked it\nI let's hear from Huckleberry Hound the quarterback of the giants here who will give his side of the decision on what was called at the end of the game\nWe've been pretty good with the snakes all year in that scenario just you know ... and and just you know get that one yard with a sneak in and I'll see if we didn't have success with\nThe leader of men right there you\nLie [noise] not a hall of fame corner garbage out all of them quarterback\nShould also point out

contender in the NFL that has defensive shortcomings which is the entire NFL just about should consider\nIn a flyer on Patrick Peterson that is the way to do it absolutely\nNow meanwhile there was a NBA game on Monday Night involving the worst team in basketball the Los Angeles Lakers were laughing stock what's wrong with you a clip of the NBA or they are they there are the worst team in basketball\nOr they might not win again they have a chance to have the most imperfect she's involved on their own three right now there is no signs they're about to win a game they gave up a game winning shot last night to Patty Mills\nAnd San Antonio scored a hundred and forty three points to beat the bronze and keep in mind that Tim Duncan Tony Parker Manu ... we were all held scoreless and somehow some way the San Antonio spurs still won that game\nI and and I love this because there are already starting to become a part of the scenes in LeBron land Luke Walton\nWho you might think I'm kidding and exaggerating when I say Luke Walton those jobs on the line I ain't kidding\nI I'm not ... going to blame somebody else he put this record with team together and he's going to find someone else to blame is the fall guy he will not take any responsibility that's how the brain operates it doesn't take any of the blame is everybody else so Luke Walton\nAfter a shootout of an NBA game

freak those tonight\nZero I Know they're young\nI get that but if we're going to play a certain way let's not reward people for flopping thirty feet from the whole on plays that have nothing to do with that possession they're just plop and just to see if they get up alcohol and then not reward players that are physically go into the basket and getting hit is not right\n[noise] I I completely agree with it in my lifetime [noise] there are two franchises that just don't get any\nCalls the Boston Celtics and the Los Angeles Lakers I completely agree that the official should be denounced there's a grand conspiracy the league office\nTo hold the Lakers back because there's one thing that the NBA ... is the Lakers with LeBron James to not be relevant I completely agree with ... the officials get their talking points before the game and they all say the same thing try to stick it to number twenty three in the purple and gold\nAnd it's working perfectly the officials evil plan and that sounded like a broken man to me\nIt's the third game of the year third game of the year and Luke Walton I'm Glad you're on our side than I Am I'm In looks about to lose his job here and and he he is having such a his effect over the fish in\nAnd how dare them how dare them\n[laughter]\nIsn't that the losers will matter as like the top of the losers lament your your your bank the table\nIf you have the facts you pound the facts if you don't have the facts you blame the official [laughter] the Lakers are immediately doing that and about what Brian James you Brian James had to say LeBron chimed in on the Lakers off to the oh in three start\nAnd he said it's not puff\nOf course the reason what branch said it's not ... because he got a deal over at Warner Brothers to remake friday the thirteenth so he's not worried about basketball that's just part time job his career at Warner Brothers is taking off so he's got that ... the brunch says I Know what I got myself into\nA as a shot is and that's a shot at the entire franchise he knows what he got himself into he says it's a process I get it and it will be fine\nWhat is your definition of fine what is your definition of fine\n[laughter] now last time the Lakers last which is why they lost every game he compared the Lakers too ah instant oatmeal he made an analogy of instant oatmeal uh LeBron also said I didn't come here thinking we were going to be blazing storms\nRight out of the gate is that an ... of the Portland TrailBlazers\nHe said it's a process\nI understand that too like I think the Lakers are doing great I think they've already ... as far as I'm concerned these are the real Lakers I I think they've peaked I in fact they might have peaked too soon here with his own three wreck\nAbsolute\nShe the bond that I heard somebody earlier was complaining and say well a little brown doesn't like the fact the Laker fans or they're trying to compare him to Kobe Bryant doesn't care about okay\nThat's that's that's talk radio nonsense cause LeBron has been embraced by the Hollywood phony ... they love the Lakers the Hollywood crowd they can't get enough they want\nMore and more and more and more and more and more and more so it doesn't matter if a bunch of Kobe Bryant fan boys are bent out of shape and they're pissed off and they're burning with rage over LeBron James it doesn't matter because LeBron James knows he's got\nEvery fake Hollywood executive in his back pocket\nMake no mistake right every one of those studio adults that go to these Laker games they love the ...\nAnd they they smooth smooth smooth smooth with his kiss they want to give them a bubble bath and they want to suck his toes is what they want to do\nOkay so he didn't care I hear your fans you know the guy in in the three hundred section who's upset that LeBron's not Kobe Bryant and miss to foul shots and what would have been the game when he shot at the end of the game\nBut probably doesn't care about that that's not a dilemma for him because you know what he goes back to his mansion and he's like what what's my new project over at the Warner Brothers lot what do I have to worry about over there\nAre so I've been out of the show on Fox will press on your on the Lakers so much fan what's that I'm Glad you're talking about the lake or something\nLike oh I Do I'm having a lot of fun I I they keep going like this I Will talk about them all year every game I ... when they start winning you want yeah wow that's under five hundred I Will there ever be above five hundred will they ever get up above five hundred I don't know but\nNot a guarantee\nBlame the box blame the boss\nGet to that and we'll do it next [noise]\nSeries goes off\n\nYour social media home they always say\nFollow us on Twitter during the October mad that this is an easy anymore when that\nSports radio\nNow they're here even if you're a big time basketball fan there might be a few facts about the game you don't
