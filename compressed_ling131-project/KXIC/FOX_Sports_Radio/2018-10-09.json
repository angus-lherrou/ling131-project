or more in car insurance more info visit Geico dot com as we celebrate Drew Brees tonight setting the record for most passing yards at an NFL career breaking Peyton Manning's record\nA tweet that got a lot of attention tonight was from one of his former teammates Sean ... friend of the show\nThree time all pro three time pro bowler with the chargers and the bills Marilyn was\nDrew Brees his teammate his rookie year when Drew Brees suffered the arithmetic shoulder injury going after a fumble\nAnd said I was ten feet away when Drew Brees got hurt on that field and I'll never forget that moment what it sounded like because after the year was over the chargers moved on they had Philip Rivers breeze was lucky that the same took a chance for them because now he's turned into the hall of fame quarterback that he was joining us now on the hotline taken a few minutes\nAway from being out is Sean ... wipes out I Know you're out things so much to spend a couple of minutes with a fear I said you tweeted out earlier tonight you were ten feet away one breeze got hurt his rookie year you heard the pop of his shoulder tickets to what you saw everything from that play [noise]\nYeah it was a it was terrible a few obviously there on the field and so she says I was actually sent\nOff to the office of stop bench and he was scrambling out I Can't remember all recall if it was a far more though it got the ball got loose a what drew you know try to do with a ball and every child is um and to defend his jumped on his back ... you know kind of dislocation is different side of his shoulder and\nWhat I tell you it sounds like a tree branch hopping\nA and I heard this allows frame it was horrifying\nUm Iran even closer to up their orders hotlines because like I didn't know what happened and I just realized it was it was that was real well ah\nThat big Israeli happen so he came on the sidelines of trying to walk them over because you are with dislocated out of the socket you could put his arm now are so I walked over you know when when it stuck outside the join you can't\nReally put John down so they came over they literally yank his arm back into place his shoulder I'm above the dislocation and I do love the screen\nIs a horrible time and at that point I just never thought\nThat he would let it all play a game but even doing what he's doing now which is uh\nWhat's that due to a sideline showing like you guys standing there that close I mean you're thinking about your own careers and and see and that kind of major [noise]\nWell I mean so visually you don't really\nThink about it too much because you can't even believe that that just happened to Drew Brees exotic guy just walk off the street or got to try to make the team or your third string quarterback has drew agreed on that really brought it to look for him and obviously this start it and take the table or what\nA draw for free so to see that happen to be that close to it it was just a\nHorrible horrible memory to have at that time\nYou know a lot of people makes makes us of course about his work ethic and what are you been able to do I know you only had done what year are the ... what what did you see from that season as far as how we prepare and get ready and playing the games\nJournal I never seen anyone or just mourners zone like drew was a while they were going to wait for all these walking trail wrong it was always like he was on this mission\nNo matter what it was in the building of course you talk to guys it was\nReally a kind of just all around the person that player that all got along with everyone but he would just always in his own um yeah I just recall him going to the gym it off at ... at first as defense would come after and it was like oh you walk down to the gym and to the film Romeo must yet that gender\nTo lead that film or all of their lead the weight room and go straight to the general it get going right away you would just always going to focus on whatever what happened to that that moment\nUm I've never seen nothing like that you know throughout my whole career\nSo one of those circumstances we were talking a lot about locker rooms and leadership or whatever are clearly with Drew Brees there there's no question of how things were supposed to operate\nYet no doubt about it he just um it was almost as mentality was to whatever the next thing the next thing they can go right to from point a to point B L like\nFrom point a to point B and and go past that no it was go to the next and go to the next and go to the next thing and the operator like this on a consistent basis which is why are you know he's a want you to lead every body the way he is right now\nSo lastly before we let you go what would you ever watch that all season was like after a brief got hurt and the uncertainty around the team and he was going to go or what his comeback would kind of be like\nWell I actually spent a lot of off the train and with them I'm In San Diego a with a jerk and\nAre down there so you know we had I made it work at there was this incredible to see where it is progression was from the year he got hurt or the following year when he came back again\nWas on another level you just knew what he was spending so much time with this big and work and that uh the range of emotions back and forth showed that he was working\nA just a a habit of confidence alone to be able to throw the ball down the field and you just saw the progression every day and I would just you know on it to be able to witness that him ... back to the top

interview talk to us and gave us all kinds of stories practicing his call for when Drew Brees broke the record he said I practice it for about ten hours this week and it was ten wasted hours because it just kinda happened and I said what I said\nBut he also said to us that you know Drew Brees over the course of his great great as he is there are fourteen players that breeze through a pass to that did not catch one of his passes and I am one of those guys and I got to relive that this week when they wrote a column about in the story about a year in New Orleans\nSo I said to him well do you have to tell us the story now Drew Brees through a pass through your an office of lime you didn't catch it tell us the story here is ... story\nI'll tell you about it 'cause I'm going to blame somebody for now we're talking with a high hey go kill\nSome Americans so I I was the jumbotron in New Orleans for really my first five seasons and uh it was a pretty common occurrence I probably cook about five hundred reps over five years of tight end\nAnd some people here kind of got used to report you know to go and it was kind of a running joke I'm I I'm I'm not like a very athletic I have a terrible body unlike the ... the guy you expect to see going out for a pass in the NFL so uh there was a big buildup\nRecall player playing the Pittsburgh Steelers on Halloween Night Sunday Night Football in two thousand nine and they knew that tore Palmolive was going to cover the\nJumbo cut in and they also knew Detroit power would say there's not a chance in hell they're going to throw that\nGuy's a ball and\nEverything worked exactly like that what didn't work out well\nWas I had to block Lamar Woodley and then released into the route and as I released from our ground my Jersey for me around and I fell and so I really never was standing or throw it down to ... how many people that were convinced drew overthrew may\nWell let me just tell you if you think drew overthrows an office environment I Would lean toward blaming the author of why not in that\nCase it was my phone so it went over my head there's an awful picture that exist that I Am completely horizontal\nA there is no nothing but air underneath me and the pass was overthrown and so every single year when they install go on to this day at the stakes are so they introduce a fiery to St\nPop [laughter] the name of the way the play doesn't exist anymore but we go ahead and go through it every single year or so that the murder so yeah that was my that was my worst moment of my entire career\nOh I'm looking at the picture right now it's a great here in the Arizona but over\nHere it's pretty bad as I Know I think you called it an air there's that and\nIt was in less than that Sunday Night Football crime\nTime against the Pittsburgh Steelers [laughter]\nI don't like it was just like little insignificant like no bill Sunday in the book five hundred this was like\nOne of the biggest games here and uh I I got more than a few text at night if I recall correctly\nPhenomenal story from is actually a play that doesn't exist anymore and we got tax refund because frost for you had him on the chargers pre show right the not

in the panhandle\nThat's Florida's governor Rick Scott who was declared a state of emergency and nearly three dozen Florida counties Alabama's governor Kay Ivey issuing a similar declaration for her entire state but when that storm will land not entirely clear yet\nAt that time with the Minnesota Vikings which turned out to be a blessing in disguise Drew Brees I Am convinced as much as I'm sitting in front of his microphone had Drew Brees landed with Miami\nHe would not have come anywhere close to becoming the all time leading pastor in NFL history it would've been a very brief run they vote between the dolphins and Drew Brees had the smart money in fact says that it would have been a disaster\nWould've been a toxic situation or in in Miami and\nIt didn't happen right 'cause his Nick Saban who's the smartest guy in the room and knows everything except when NFL games more than he loses a Nick Saban shows Dante colpepper now the second thing here for all the success that Nick Saban all the success that he is head\nAt Alabama none of it happen in the NFL right he's still haunted\nBy his failures with the pro level under five hundred\nAs an NFL coach he famously lied to to the media when asked if\nHe was looking to to leave the Miami Dolphins and there were\nReports of the Alabama boosters plane at the airport in Miami and Nick Saban a famously said I Will continue on is the dolphin coach he lied right to their face could not admitted just like he couldn't admit he blew it on Drew Brees even with the obvious\nCat out of the bag instead of just saying hey you know I got it wrong\nGot her on a we had two injured quarterbacks I picked the injured\nQuarterback I thought would be better uh instead he threw the medical staff under the bus as the fall guy in Miami passing\nThe buck and blaming them for incompetence rather than owning that there are many longtime Miami officials who think different are they believe\nThat it was actually Nick Saban who blew it he had the final say and as I point to keep in mind that there aren't they call pepper at that time we're going back a number of years here he was coming off a serious knee injury so they had two options they had the option\nHey door a door a injured quarterback door be uh injured quarterback\nAnd they chose the injured quarterback that was physically more imposing in Dante colpepper 'cause they thought he would be able to come back and handle life in the NFL how did that work out don't ask or not they called her lasted four games with Miami\nFor he had to touchdown passes in a dolphin uniform he never again after he left the dolphins he never through more than five touchdowns in one season\nAnd Drew Brees now has four hundred Nineteen passing touchdowns just as a member of the saints he's got four hundred Nineteen passing touch that now the last point\nI have enjoyed watching jury split quarterback I have a place with a lot of enthusiasm uh I I get or you can tell you he's enjoying it I get enjoyment watching ... he's a hardcore guy when it comes to playing quarterback and these same schemes\n... it's been the videogame office especially when they play in the dome and the temple the rhythm of the officers there it's fun to watch and rarely\nRarely to the states especially at home ever get bogged down at a stretch a couple of years ago they had had a rough patch but Drew Brees is likely not going to ever win the super bowl sensory contender in the NFC but the rams are better now there is a better than\nThe saints in New Orleans are the chances are very low they're actually going to win another Super Bowl so he will end up being part of one Super Bowl winning team and he was on a bunch of good teams with the St a bunch of teams that one a lot of regular season games\nBut there was always somebody better I that's the that's the legacy of ... he will end up when he's done the all time leading pastor in the NFL which he is right now and have a bunch of other records but bridesmaids status supply\nIt's the Drew Brees even individual you get some of the years here and he put up great numbers but he said well yeah but Peyton Manning was better this year yeah but Tom Brady was better this year or Aaron Rodgers or you go back Brett Farr some some of the players a decade plus ago and so he's he's always been like the number two and number three guy\nIn a year but rarely the number one guy in the\nIn the NFL is event Mather show on Fox is we take your phone calls and you can be part of the festivities eight seven seven Ninety nine on Fox

not in every other week player you know those of us that said he only shows up every other game we could not have been more wrong\nWe could not have been more wrong about Adrian Peterson my God was

these games was worth a damn\nWell yeah the the early you know I'm OK the asteroids makes history okay that's newsworthy I get it and but uh just no good games\nNot one yeah\nLet's necessarily that she Adrian Peterson after the game said he dislocated his shoulder\nYes I did apparently a Jake Bruton a refuge that or had a different I\nBelieve that say career ending injury I think there should be a career ending injury\nThen yeah you could see that sure yeah that's it put them on the ... put them on the show offered we saw probably saw was was good though before he got hurt you know because you got to be ... I thought he was going to be knocked out earlier in the game and the guy to come out at the legs in a few of them upside down I thought that was it for him there but they didn't care about it [laughter]\nYeah so if his shoulders or does that mean he can't whip any kids is that it I mean he's got together you know the other shoulder All right well yeah the whip yeah\nSo you can ... that's not a strong shoulder though he's got to make sure these focus is on a strong ...\nWell you could you work you work up the other one though you know what I'm saying\nYeah get that uh I got you get

man is this guy solid\nThe Redskins really did a good job there scouting department picking this guy that is a reliable source\nOf all things for the Redskins ... now what was forget forget about would be the performance of Alex Smith\nNow the numbers do not look Harold the numbers do not wreak\nBut this is one of those things if you watch the game you know the Al Smith\nWhen the Redskins needed to match below below the Redskins off its got bogged down and was unable\nTo matriculate the ball in the end zone Smith finished with two hundred Seventy five yards on thirty nine passage dams that's not good didn't have a touchdown pass it one interception\nAnd uh we did have a four yard touchdown run but he was bad really bad and his numbers at half time so I was ... when the game was somewhat in the balance it was a Thirteen point game at halftime\nAnd Alex Smith had a hundred and thirty one yards passing at halftime a note touchdowns no interceptions he was just kind of there\nIs he wasn't doing anything is this kind of like filling a slot like a like a left guard\nWould do hit a quarterback reading of Seventy one in the first half hour Smith and it it it it it should be worse I feel like it should be watching the game you felt like it should be worse\nAnd he has these hiccups now John ... after the game trying to stand by his quarterback Jake route and rather not John John doesn't care Jay the coach of the Redskins cures he says that he blamed himself the Redskins coach he said he needs to get better at\nComing up with plays that Alex Smith is comfortable and making Alex Smith more comfortable\nSo how do you make Alex Smith ...\nGive him what a three touchdown lead is usually pretty comfortable and he's got a three touchdown lead [noise]\nWhat else can you do\nI what I'm trying to think how could you make Alex Smith\nCome from other good and I did like what he said Jake rude and as you left the day is his last word at his post game news coverage was that was

they won finally made especially in the world series and actually the Mets are they were able to beat the match and this brewers team they will get\nThe problem is the Dodgers and I I don't know how you get around this are just better the Dodgers are better team and the ... that the better team doesn't always win that's true\nBut unlike the Rockies who got into the fetal position and started sucking the thumb in the corner of the clubhouse after they'd be because they uh they shot there you know are are against the copies in the wild card game\nThat's not going to happen you know if it does clearly the ... going to win it this is not a white flag situation for the Dodgers\nAnd they have a cornucopia always a beating the brewers LA could overpower Milwaukee with things that the lineup has been weaponized from top to bottom they've gotta starting staff filled with Brazil because Milwaukee is depending\nAnd this is the forward the brewers everyone's like you got to have a great bullpen but the the Milwaukee bullpen was been very effective\nThis season you keep bringing those guys in the ... factor goes up because Everytime you bring a pitcher in there's a chance to that day that particular pictures just not going to have at the moment is going to be too big and he's going to\nVomit all over the man this is the flaw with the Milwaukee Brewers they're overly dependent on that\nYou've got to have a little bit of balance you can't always rely on that you've got a ride or the starting pitching to appoint the brewers don't have\nGreat starting pitching they have guys that are going to go for five innings and so you're going to go into the bullpen and it might work out early in the series from Milwaukee it could work out that those guys are effective early but it's a serious goes on\nAnd the Dodger lineup seized those relief pitchers the last couple of games of that series the competitive advantage goes to the Dodgers because they've seen all those bruise really pictures and they they have an idea what's coming at them and should be able to uh to take advantage of that situation\nIn the more pictures you used a more opportunities you have for a guy to blow it to not be able to handle the situation now for whatever it's worth it it's not worth much\nOf the regular season the Dodgers didn't when the seasons serious and the brewers they put well in Milwaukee and that's all the way back in July I don't think that's relevant today because it was back\nIn July and then we'll we'll see but we we know that Joe Buck who will be a trending topic Joe Buck will be a training topic on Twitter because\nBrewer fans aren't going to like him Dodger fans aren't going to like him that's the beauty of Joe Buck embrace is this the great thing about Joe Buck on on Fox Sports and Fox Sports one is he knows this and he loves so it's Joe Buck John ... in the booth the Fox box that rocks and Ken Rosenthal and Tom ...\nAdding flavor for the national league championship\nSeries the Los Angeles Dodgers we'll win and the Dodgers even winning six games Los Angeles wins insects harmed in the world series yet again\nHey\nMan Dallas the boat\nJudas Garcia right over their head\nThen I Am not a nearly the baseball or inside of the ...\nBut I I agree with you on this one I think the Dodgers are going to advance to the world series you're smart ... and then who's the Astros in the world no no no no I'm On\nSo difficult to repeat Eddie the Astros but it all they're going to run into the the Boston Red Sox and you know let me tell you something about me you've been with me a long time to get it for many years he were to the old timers ... is our number is going to come up before you know but we've been here a long time\nAnd or whatever it can happen in sports to make me uncomfortable is going to happen what is the most uncomfortable thing for me a Red Sox Dodgers bing bing bing bing bing bing bing bing meant yes\nSo we ... that it's like it's destined to happen right\nYou mean it's you know you make a strong case with this argument that\nThis would make my life living hell I oh I Love it so I Am a occasional talk show host in Boston at the red Sox station in fact that he after the game tonight on Tuesday night\nI Will be hosting the post game Red Sox talk show after the game with the yeah so I'm In an awkward situation that the red Sox end up in the world series against the Dodgers this would be very uncomfortable for me Eddie\nWell it's interesting you say that because I I I Know how you operate as you said I've been with you for a while I'm I I could\nSee spending this as a ... is is uh when when you have no way of losing because uh the red Sox when you're going to go on the boss the radio station they're going to sing the praises of gifts they took us ... and do all that if the Dodgers way they're going to come here and do the same thing so what is\nTrue to a point but you know why\nAre you are you saying that to be down your your heart bleeds blue and\nThey have to go on another radio station and sing the praises of us to be your team we could actually be crying on the inside too tough you'd be like the clown smiling on the outside of the crying on the inside a little\nDifficult and you know not going to lie to you and so that's that's ... that's the the the Armageddon situation for me is Red Sox Dodgers and the world series\nBut on a positive note I Would have access to all of the games I could like fly to Boston see all although although the rest of well yeah but the red Sox would said I'd have to make two trips because I'd have to go the first two and then the last two that would be expensive\nSo maybe they'll they'll pay my way I'm sure they'll take care of that yes that would be awesome if they did that would be very nice\nSOL they will will see in Roberta your production on the ...\nAh Dodgers in six I agree with you ... maybe maybe last year he said three Dodgers three they don't even need the fourth game you want to say that David David Freese in rye imaginary did more than\n... able to do that I'll just do not wrong so hopefully a Dodger fan again I Am standing out to be honest with you I had no idea David Freese is on the ... pirates ... he's been playing good with the dog he's all over the police been all over baseball or he's like he's rivaling man\nHe's a ... was he he did time with the cheat and currently oh yeah yeah yeah and now he's the fifth most all the time in postseason RBI to believe something like that he's my favorite

ballpark when he was supposed to be in the ballpark I find that hard to believe\nBut he did not show up until late\nThe Yankees are circling the wagons Aaron Boone said he had no issue was separate those warm up time the Yankee pitching coach also backed up stood by his\nPicture there said there's nothing in the central is nothing to see I'm paraphrasing some of this\nUh but they were all circling the wagons about ... and I love when ... was asked after the game about why he showed up ten minutes late and sit on the broadcast\nA run darling made a big deal about this Severino that said who is he he said when asked about Ron Dahl these comments and then he said he is not the pitching coach he's not here all the time whatever he said this is from several Reno he is not always in our bullpen how does he know when I came out\nI came out for the game like I usually do\nIt again the Yankee personnel is all backing us up Larry Rothschild the longtime\nPitching coach he was right there is it usually a separate basically they\nClaim he he warms up in the bowels of Yankee Stadium and then goes out to often which is a plausible plausible explanation here's where it gets a little murky\nA former Yankee a former Yankee catcher John ... who is part of the state run Yankee broadcast team in the post game show for the Yankees uh he he indicated and it's certainly intimated that that this is not normal\nOr he said there is no way there's a quote from John ... on the Yankee broadcasts you said there's no way that you can go on a big leap bullpen about eight minutes before the scheduled first pitch and expect to be ready\nI he indicated but yeah the Yankees are all sorts of ways now part of the conspiracy ... there's two parts to it\nOh one is that Severino showed up late or he wasn't aware of what time the game was that so that's the other angle to it ah and then there's also the the layer of why several Reno was left in the game that this is what you really have to go deep state Severino came out he was not good the first three innings\nAnd he then came back out in the fourth inning and Aaron Boone left him out there to get shelled by the red Sox so some are wondering if this was some kind of mess I I don't I Can't believe I cannot believe\nAlthough I really want to believe\nThat Aaron Boone chose to sacrifice a playoff game which now put the Yankees on the brink of elimination but the conspiracy theory part of it is that the one of the recently left ... out there is this punishment because he was not prepared for this particular study toss them back out there in the fourth inning\nAnd then the red Sox kept going\nRun after run after run after run after run after\nI was a Congo line around the bases the\nGame was over after he was over after the fourth any when the Yankees are this is supposedly amazing bullpen and all that useless\nSo but now they're showing it I didn't run down and say some things over the weekend the something that bothers some people are well yeah well one dogs the Mets broadcasters to the Yankee people don't like him because he's an enemy an enemy of the state let's go to New York and we say hello to real talk\nBoom

twenty or ... they were ... by six forty for baseball Barbie twenty two games about five hundred\nAgainst the rest of baseball there were two games under five hundred so I guess everyone outside of the twins tigers White Sox royals who weren't even trying to win plausibly this year meanings had a losing record so they made the playoffs because they happen to be in the right the vision\nBut let's not get carried away like this is somehow a a a good team and and we should praise the Astros were beating the Cleveland Indians they should've scored more points they should've scored and buy more runs in the series is what they should have done\nMe the Indian line up with Francisco indoor and Edwin and cannot see own and Jose remembers that in one forty four in the series and so the Indians

I ... I guess you think the red Sox are in trouble I think the red Sox are going to close it out in the next game\nSo you think they win tonight goes five\nBoroughs going five so you've got Sebastian them
