I don't know what I meant that trade fire was then it does it matter if a quarterback turns out to be good nobody cared you could give up three old drafts and it does it matter nobody's saying that

before Matt Maggie comes on board or that they bring tribute skiing so\nYou know you can they equated a little bit and we we did it months and months ago I was glad to see it start picking up steam got better season began up but we equated it to what they were doing with what the rams did\nOffensively upbringing in weapons or to find the offensive line building a defense just before ... a little Mac comes on board and then giving your guy an offensive coach to go right right Jeff Fisher to Shaun ... bay John Fox\nTwo matinee and here we go and so it took a couple of games you get paid a lot

to be traded he'll report to the Steelers during the week seven eight timeframe misty lives on a bike\nWeek seven so the levy on bell saga is ending and I guarantee you it's one of two reasons why he's reporting okay whatsoever one instead of waiting until we all live in the drop dead time number one\nHe knows he knows\nThat he's not going to get a big contract long term that he thinks he's going to get the off season and his age and then he know that if anybody's going to give me big money it's gonna be the Steelers because they made me that offer before I got to go back and show myself to be indispensable\nAnd they'll give me that contract because he was all about um getting money somewhere somewhere somewhere why change your tuna report now after you just watch Thomas\nBreak is like there's no way you report he also knows he's damaging his image because of the way he is holding out he's not just holding out saying I got to look out for myself he's putting out pictures of himself on jet skis he's trolling the Steelers after games he looks bad\nSo there's these are the two reasons why other than that he's out of money\nAnd what you should always be but those are the two big reasons and I guarantee you he knows his agent knows listen\nLady on the money might not be there\nAs you think it's going to be after the season you have hurt yourself with your PR people just

let's let's really look at at at the the outcome of this missed call by the officials\nThis was not a fourth downplay this was not a play in which the game tilted in one way or the other forever because of it there were two minutes left in the game and the cheese were midfield set a thirty seven it would have been thirty twelve yeah who might have to get twelve\nYou're out at a minimum it puts them at that point blank field goal oh no I'm not I'm not saying\nThis didn't give them a big advantage but did it give the game to the chiefs no yes\nWe're still too much time left it would've been in the game it would've been different the cheese could've still one they might have lost but I'd like to think the patch homes that are pretty decent chance converting twelve yards on third down and then most and then for down as well considering second in thirty he got back to the majority of two straight titled why like\nThat in theory but in practice let's go after the official [laughter]\nThe official was the the pheasant me that we ... definitely making just stop obviously they were gassed in being gash throughout the entire fourth quarter a hundred and fifty three passing

I don't know what that crowd so and yeah I I it was unbelievable it was really something that and for the brewers to put an exclamation point on the season here\nAnd now you have two teams that are pretty dangerous I mean we're seeing it it it's like this in both ways in in both of you know and the A. L. sometimes a team gets\nIt as a wild card to go okay this is the team that we should dominate them and we we should come away with a victory kind of how the Dodgers feel playing the Braves the Dodgers have all the experience they have all the hitters the Braves rented for the first time they're happy to be there and they have a clear advantage in a series over the Atlanta Braves\nBut all of these teams now in the wild card games A's Yankees but specifically the Rockies and the cubs these are teams the Rockies or the cubs that nobody wants to play\nBecause the Rockies combat you wouldn't waves and they hit the baseball and the cubs clearly it's mainly the same cubs team that won the world series and\nYou're always afraid that hey they're going to know when to turn it on a one of these teams is going home and that's a huge thing for the rest of the you know the national league as wide open there is no team that you can say boy\nIf anybody I Would put my money on the Dodgers coming out of the national league right now because that's what they are going to face they're going to face the Braves and then the Rockies or the cubs are getting knocked out and then\nMaybe the cubs or Rockies get knocked out against the brewers if not it's the brewers and clearly the Dodger will have an advantage over the brewers coming in the first time the brewers have been in since twenty eleven\nIt's really I Know it's been a tough season but it's the Dodgers is the Dodgers with the biggest advantage over anybody in the in al right\nNow they've finished seven and three and their final ten\nNinety two wins after what was a very odd inconsistent injury plagued season with a lot of questions to the bullpen health ... we've talked about it a lot here on the show throughout the summer uh and as we get into\nThe playoffs even today give it up to home runs when he comes into to finish things off\nA lot of questions in handling and we talked about it a little earlier tonight even just should you go on to play Colorado how\nInteresting things get a and difficult for Dave Roberts in terms of managerial decisions about the the bullpen management so when we look at this series coming up the the Dodgers obviously made a couple of big acquisitions everybody immediately looking to\nFind a shake out a couple of extra dimes to pay off many Machado and keep them around for a long time but\nYou you had a great effort from Walker ... dealer today you know what's funny is you look at these NFL teams oh Ninety plus when it comes to play the wild card game with Ninety six we now\nKnow or Ninety five when I mean that's just insane that that that's the level of domination and also speaks to how bad some of the games are naturally\nBut right now we're celebrating great so when we look at the Dodgers you know Clinton her show now you're in your number two at least for the way this kind of works out in terms of your scheduling right 'cause you you get Mueller today and then you get to go into your series going oh yeah well you watch that guy dominate\nHere's Clayton on and now he gets to go and get started on the big note on Thursday a couple of days off also key as opposed to having to hop skip and jump across a time zones in terms of the playoffs\nAnd you mentioned Walker bealer we've been playing his soundbite post game all night where a legendary doing an interview saying we need the fans to do this the whole bleeping playoffs because he was very happy the fans came was very loud they're forty seven thousand stadiums that showed up\nFor a one o'clock start on the on the west coast you know I think Monday work I wouldn't say I was missing it\nI gotta say traffic was lighter than normal getting to work because those forty seven thousand people out of place to be instead of being on the freeway or what\nMay be trying to out Shaun Walker bealer cursing was ... here he is with am five Seventy is on David that say doing the ... police thing following the victory over the Rockies [noise]\nI see your film baby and then as watching Carl called around no matter who going\nWe're going and we're going to say I can't [noise] and be fine we're going to the Senate both us I think\nVery funny and the and the funding [noise]\nI think he said it all guys don't watch too\nTold me was winning [laughter]\nOh man he's got his shirt off it got to go far\n[noise] well if you if you say and now he's torturing me with girls it's not like what it sounded the torturing me with beer like suddenly previous bringing it when it come on and ladies come on in a in the middle there when it went silent we just started dancing\nSo that just that it's videos average I mean it's awesome he was ... will find it reached read it hey nobody nobody is excited to win the ... the ... the ... his jacked up about it it's all about all the help we noses winning and west titles\nWeather is good or bad or under achieving that's only knows this winter and you know what the best part about today's when was the guy was that the rest of the way every Dodger games on TV that is a fair point good job I made a point that\nOne out of but bond fund game at the the ... yard today I mean see in the crowd show up as they did because early on the images were not encouraging but forty seven thousand strong forty four million for the regular season to add one\nBrown's got screwed yesterday raiders when does it matter but you add Patrick homes to that list we all saw what he did the first three weeks but when you do something special on a nationally televised game on Monday Night when the whole world is watching you pull a game out where it looks like you played poorly but really you still through for three hundred yards\nThis guy now has become everybody's got to see what he's done because clearly there are two great teams in the NFL there's the rams and there's the cheese and the rams are knocking on the door of becoming the next great star team in the NFL but I got to see what they do they're right on that cost because of what they've done so far\nBut Patrick more homes is right there too and they play each other coming up in a few weeks in Mexico city\nI tell you what this is going to be fought in the next few weeks out of watching the sheep steam uh and that will start getting a few home games mixed mixed into all of this fun and exciting you got the jaguars this coming week\nUh that's in Kansas City and then on the road at New England and then they get the bangles and the bangles coming off a huge\nFinished with aging green and the touchdown pass from Andy Dalton\nOr to snatch a victory in the final moments so and then they get a rematch with the Broncos at home so a lot of big big games to come for Patrick ... homes or in this and none of the none of these teams had the defensive personnel saved Jacksonville\nAnd tell you that one although in Cincinnati they're getting vaunted perfect ... anything can happen when he's on\nAll all your I mean anything he could he could start tackling coaches you I have a camera no but that but that's really the other team defensively that I'd want to see the chiefs try to get past but\nReally the jaguars I mean look you're not playing the jets every waking hour on a five hundred yards of ... oh by the way it's just not going to ... you can't against the chiefs effects though or next week to week I mean you get a hamstring injury that's something that saw Raul yelled and yelled and yell never going to be right all season long he'll be in and out of the line up that's just how it goes but to ... I don't know why but here's the\nThing and not to get make this all about your jets a why the hell are you playing for that this week if he if he was if he at all\nBecause right he was still a question mark was coming into dogma Rhone hates the jets he went for two\nOn the final say none of them but resented acts for his friends passed because when he was going to get the jets jobs went to Todd Bowles or by the way they'd like to do that over again he was pissed you didn't get the job the New York media let\nLoose a bunch of stuff that quote supposedly happened when he was in Buffalo and he's never forgotten that so he stuck it to the jets I Wish he would have owned it instead of saying oh I look at my chart and saying when it's Nineteen we go for two and we are guys heard of the extra point team come on this twenty five seconds left and again just to own it if you're going to be that guy just owned it\nWhat about the quit on Syracuse part we're not going to get to that right

basketball wrestling or other Hawkeye\nSports tuned to AM eight hundred KFC I see in Iowa City\nDomains your struggles post quake jak Callahan Fox News to large aftershocks rattling the area that was devastated by friday's major earthquake in Indonesia terror exploding into anger in ... new cars aid supplies are only now just trickling in eight hundred forty four people so far known did\nOr and Vance Joseph the bronco coach I'm sure you're going to tell us that you're going to bench case Keenan now that this is enough you've already play now for weeks and he's not getting much better so you're going to bed she was that correct coaches the Broncos ranch Joes\nI Love is great you know cases agree to a guy early on writers were given his problems there it was about a little bit but cases decorate the winter you know whether we were in good shape for the last place we believe in case and um\nHe showed he can win games late for us\n[laughter] okay\n... what kinda bizarro world is Vance Joseph living maybe is having the time of his life uh I like how about I like his talent isn't that great I get the whole\nThe grid you like in baseball you like to have a couple of guys who team the dirt dogs right to just get dirty and all that stuff and if football you off your office of climate have great\nChase keen them though that's not a selling point that's come play for the Broncos are quarterback has great it's hey come play for Kansas City or quarterback and throw the ball Seventy miles down the field or he's got to Brazil\nAll right so and it was when you break it down eight thousand different ways and spend it all over the place but more homes got off to a real shaky start heading into halftime I'm actually at sixty five yards passing his quarterback rating was under sixty in the first half\nHe was confused a Denver's defense which did not play well in the fourth quarter certainly had him twisted around in the first half by the time it in and he was the hero and all that a hundred and Ninety two yards passing outside the pocket\nAs the Broncos defense wants more homes got outside the where he was able to uh be creative there and make this is the most I guess is that they put on TV it was the most in a decade career\nHans no one's talking about him he had a big day no last word on case keen eye\nVance Joseph use the word grits use the word grits to describe case skiing him I Would use the word band aid and not just banned it I Would go generic\nBrand band aid you can get the name brand name brand costs more than the generic by now the generic brand supposed to be just as good as the name brand but we know it's usually not that's usually not as good point you save a little bit of money on that in case you know making a lot of money on the short term deal\nFor Denver but he is a place all\nHey he is a place well let's hear from case Keenan bell case kingdom you did not get the job done in the fourth call is it moving in the last one of your ah what do you have to say for your Broncos often\nNot winning but a man we're you know we're finding our duty as a young kid your character it kind of worried about actually use for their mission quit at all and that last\nTrip [laughter] how about a few more wins how 'bout that great [laughter] yeah we got a lot of spunk we don't have a lot of wings when we got a lot as well less bunk is what we've got the correct yeah that's great\nThey were really trying hard oh let me tell us Broncos are really trying hard\nThis is John John Elway\nCase scheme is only supposed to be a temp you don't want to hire a temp for a long term it's like a banned drug you put a bandage on you've got to change the bandage or else it gets really nasty it smells disgusting the wound and\nYou gotta keep it fresh you got to keep it fresh and so the the Broncos have to find a quarterback which is very scary because John Elway he does not exactly have the might is touch we have done many a mile a mile or monologue how he has nice Adam touch which\nIs the opposite of the madam or\nThe or the ... just everything this guy does as far as quarterbacks does not turn to go uh everything he touches as far as quarterbacks turns to ruin a just a disaster which they allowed to a man that Dallas steamboat Willie\nAlso\nLike to point out now on a normal night if the baseball games had been elimination games we would have\nDone a whole ... monologue just goofing on the Rockies and celebrating the Dodgers when the the brewers wind but are you in Roberta of a of a big hug before the show started right now to talk about our personal lives like that but let's just\nSay daddy or the Dodgers all they do is when the national ... year after year after year\nSix years that are oh that's pretty impressive yeah\nHow many how many years has been since the the ... the old the ... the Pittsburgh Pirates\nFans have one factor back division taught early nineties early nineties yeah All right while ago or for about a time yeah very bonds liable to right that's correct\nRoberta Roberta throwing out random then [laughter] I go to a random names if you want to see why Mueller baby sit and Rene you'll Bream

by the way Jose Chico leaned she was not bad for the buck or how about we got into the one playoff game in\n... I like him because he jumped over a job or as you over on the right to own as he did a child and I thought that was very impressed\nYou tell me he got into trouble later in life after his point is well\nI'm a hunter I Do recall that now okay\nBut I think you're confusing him with another player from the Dominican but that's a bad job but you\nAre who else er and events like how they already said that you say that when I wasn't listening now I was listening now Jeff is with no repeats of JFK how 'bout that he was on that theme was he\nWas he was on a team\nIs the whole mountain bike or do you want to continue this yes I'm very confined to keep up with All right let's go with Don swat\nJust lots of good although he was with me like a backup he wasn't the stardust as I said yeah he was the second catcher\nHas kind of wait to go back a cat shots\nDeepest what's that yeah that's kind of empty value agree that I go there and how about this the guy that went on to manage the buck goes I remember him though for throwing a base do you remember\nDo I remember yes he didn't throw the base he took it into the dugout oh that's right he took it in the eyes that's my base my base my boy in

it\nOr the Dodgers have an army of analytical nerds is gossip I Would say it's all about matchups stupid that's what it's all about it's about the the algorithms of the game that determines who's on the line up each day which in feel there's a position here there and everywhere what\nOutfielders a line you know how they align the few that are which pitchers are brought in out of the bullpen a you know it's all based on the the match ups the what the the supercomputers spits out so it's a real body\nRobotic style of manage doesn't mean you don't have to massage he goes oh locker room and keep everyone happy and you know pat I'm On the back and say that a boy rah rah and all that\nIt doesn't mean but it does mean that ... most of what you do is already automate it it's almost like an assembly line at this particular point managing the Dodgers they've got it down to a science and there's very little room if any room for a feel of the game\nOr not they Roberts also can be credited if you want to play the positive classes have fool you say well he was in charge when the Dodgers came back from the best of course we all know when the Dodgers were sixteen and twenty four\nAnd they actually were sixteen and twenty six one point it was a mallard monologue inspirational motivational ... when the Dodgers were in Miami that was what jumps started the Dodgers and they ended up winning ... games [noise] whereas my bubbly bad where's my champagne I gave that now with my life was me\nI woke those guys up they weren't a slumber the Dodgers that curse they thought they won the world series even though they didn't lose the world so they went out scored in the world series usually you to lose a World Series you get out scored they were not out scored in the world series\nThey weren't a lasting here as for the whispers about you know day Robert speaking out maybe my social which is what angry bill was thrown out of his mother [noise] throw that out there now let me go back to my previous point if the Dodgers front office which they're going to keep\nDetermines everything based on the analytics and the algorithms if you will\nAnd my social is against though that why would you then hire my social it makes no sense it is the most logical uneducated thing you can toss out now doesn't mean social is not going to get a job as a broadcaster for the angels are for the Dodgers I could see that happening\nUm but Andrew Freedman who is still in charge of all these other hotshot executives or he he doesn't have any old school ties to the Dodgers you know again none\nSo now on a positive note for the Dodgers you don't need these super high powered computer with all the algorithms to know\nIn the playoffs year you ride the horse the horse is not Clinton her shawl

talking about the other horse\n... week not talking about that oh you had a great moment after the game\nFor that audio later but no Walker view there was the guy the final twelve starts of this season Walker abused by one point five five\nAnd the the league bad at one fifty eight against Walker ... over his final twelve starts that is shut down close the door domination situation\nIt's also good opportunity for many Machado wants to get paid a ton of money is going to get paid a ton of money I feel like every home run Machado hits in Dodger blue in the post season is an extra million dollars\nAnd extra million dollars from a child so if you want an extra ten million hit ten home runs in the playoffs you'll get an extra ten million dollars every home runs worth a million dollars every base it's worth like a hundred thousand dollars\nAnd so do ... do you want my child as a Dodger was not as good as he was with yours his batting average\nWas down forty one a percentage points is\nA is obey a piece on base percentage was down also\nAcross the board slugging percentage O P s all the numbers were down\nFrom Baltimore mainly Machado to dodge remaining Machado across the board\nAnd they brought him in and it took to jumpstart the offense and part of that was for the playoffs you got an opportunity a here's de Roberts posed game celebrate tore mood day Roberts the

one of the hollow earth guys sent me a bunch of propaganda about how the earth is actually hall and there's like little little people living in the middle of the earth it [noise]\nLike a really yeah\nWhy don't you a bunch of stuff on that huh yeah I don't know he collected it from the Internet or what everybody says oh well yeah wild but I listen to the\nKyrie Irving I think we have the

very upset at US Steel bleak for predicting the Dodgers are going to win the world series like the he is somehow\nGiving this jinx to the Dodgers that they cannot win the world series because he predicted they're going to win the world series like it is astonishing to me that people believe that that is like a real thing that he is now given a mortal blow you asked your week to the Dodgers like what is he supposed to do\nYou oh you can't saving come on\n...\nThat's the kiss of death because you know after a game with a couple of beers having\nA good time winning a division championship

years is the angels manager of the focus turns to keeping my trout and many believe that the angels need to show substantial improvement in the next two seasons in order to have a chance to keep them now there's things that trout is the er the memorial type that won't leave then what do you think\nWill never leave you'll stay in his parents' house forever and ever and ever and stuff but the\nThe angels in my trout is the perfect relationship right Hey Mike trout can play\nWith the angels living Laguna Beach look out of the Pacific ocean during the season\nNobody bothers him he's off the grid there are many players in professional sports the demand the spotlight they need the attention might trout is not one of those players he would prefer to stay in the shadows right and so the angels are perfect and be already Marino is crazy enough as it owner\nWhere he could toss out four hundred four hundred and fifty five hundred million dollars\nTo lock up my trout through a lifetime contract\nAnd Trump doesn't have to play for the Yankees or the red Sox I Know it would like to play for the Phillies because that was the team that he followed when he was younger but he would prefer to go to home plate if he could rather than worrying about eating at home and he would like to wear a lamp shade\nSo no one looks at it this way he likes he likes to be away from the spotlight playing in Anaheim allows that the angels despise the media is so much the few reporters actually go to their games they moved the press box\nNear the pearly gates down near the foul poll about ten years ago they don't want people to cover their games in the media so my trust in hog heaven with the angels max\nAnd speaking of expiring contracts the NFL has the option to end their exclusive Sunday take an agreement with direct TV after the twenty ninth tenth season [noise] so what do you think the chances are that happens\nA very low a very well also the opposite I'm gonna go plus Nineteen hundred which is about a five percent chance\nThat they do is our number one this is one of the signature products if not the signature product to the direct TV brand is what separates them from all of their competitors in the in that particular realm of a television and so if you're the satellite guys you will pay a premium\nTo keep that exclusively on direct TV and number two I Would expect the NFL with what they're going to do the movies you test the waters you see how much time\nWarner and the other you know the the big cable companies over there called now I Will pay directv are ... and and get into a bidding war but ultimately I Believe that the move for the NFL is to stay with direct TV and these are interesting times as many people cutting the core getting rid of television\nAnd not paying for it so these are some some dangerous times and the TV industry but I Believe ultimately the NFL who keep\nTogether with direct TV for another contract next I Hope you're wrong\nAfter last

Bradford in Arizona will eventually release Bradford at the end of the year and they're still gonna have to pay another five million against the cap next year\nAnd then Bradford well you're always going to he's going to hypnotize another delusional general manager\nTo give him an opportunity next season he's only thirty sand Bradford can play another five years at least and and make more money

pace to be sacked eighty two times the record\nFor ... is David Carr who has ... back when the Texas where an expansion team he was sacked Seventy six times his rookie year\nSo the record is Seventy six and Josh Allen who didn't even begin the year as the starting quarterback for the Buffalo Bills is on pace to be\nThe starting quarterback or or just do the quarterback that has the record for the most action NFL history and here's another\nFun fact you want some more Josh Allen propaganda Josh Allen\nIs the thirty second ranked quarterback in the NFL his quarterback rankings thirty is she's got sixty three point eight quarterback rating involved now what does that mean there are only two qualified quarterbacks who have a lower quarterback rating the Josh Alan and\nGuess what both of them have been banished to rod Taylor and sand Bradford so that means by default Josh Allen is the worst quarterback in the NFL still starting for an NFL club\nSo it's our annual Asians Josh island and he is just behind or just ahead I should say it but I look at it a case keen them who is next all at the bottom three among the starting quarterback in the NFL or Sam Darnell\nShout out to the jets case
