L. D. S. we had the Rockies and the brewers and the brewers when on a walk off in the tent sinning Dodgers shut out the brave six nothing will have more ... game coming up next our but just really quick\nA lot of attention the last couple of nights on both penny Hi teams that are going to the bullpen to start games\nAnd finish games\nMany teams are doing this because they don't have the starting pitching that other teams do some out of necessity some because they like the matchups better and that's what the brewers did tonight was pitcher bullpen game and it worked out for them Jennings two runs it worked out great\nBut to push our conversation from last night with the bullpen gave the A's tried to use and that was a success for them because they went five innings and gave up two runs for re pitchers five innings do runs you'll take that for many starting pitcher the AIDS didn't have any good starting pitchers last so they went to open game but really in the playoffs every game is a bullpen game\nBecause starters come out so early now that every night you're going to the bullpen way earlier than expected if you get like the Yankees got four innings outta Louis several Reno last night and they took him out he didn't give up or run give up one hit what they had to take 'em out of luck with\nYour runners on him because he was in trouble yeah job yet\nIt was only a two run lead and they had to figure out what's the best way to ... maneuver and manipulate the rest of this game and it was let's go to the bullpen it's not like the regular season you're starting pitchers aren't going to get well they give up three in the first\nI'm an end to get in trouble in the third I'm going to leave him in and hope they settled down no you're out of the game you're relying on your bullpen every single night which is why you see things like hey Andrew Miller is coming in the game in the fifth inning for the Indians well that was a watershed moment three years ago well you know what now what happens all the time\nJosh waiter comes into games doesn't matter ninth inning eighth inning seventh inning to every game is a bull pen game because they're used in a large fashion every single night\nAnd now they'll go to Joey shut shut genes too for a game to go back to a traditional started Fifteen game winner three five your right\nAnd you're playing with our money 'cause you got the first one\n[laughter] so you moved for now and it's it's a trend that we'll see continue derided by many mocked by others color me intrigued because I'm always curious to see where the economics and the metrics that everything clash and cause a little bit of chaos and certainly I Can't wait to hear the unions thoughts\nOn this [laughter] boy continue and we go into the office\nYeah huge in June and it gets more people pitch and what do you care middle reliever they're going to get paid what does it matter what unions can be upset all they want to if you're you're\nMarginalizing the importance of starting pitcher but there's no law that says they got a pitch five and I don't really baseball it's either you got to start to get you can do whatever you want to do that is true\nBecause most starting pitchers don't go five anymore at\nAll [laughter] Twitter at Alabama friends got my got swollen DOMA Jason's red show with a big friend my Carmen we got more on the Dodgers

I Can't believe you fell for that old trick and I would say doctor\nHebert I'm very sorry if there was an old ... trick I think we would have heard of it was very well versed in well read these are the old old neutral Brady alright number\nSeventy one different receivers number five hundred tonight you saw how easy it was nine for not on the opening drive a journey to question their multiple receivers mean Edelman\nDropped a couple early in this game that took away from that perfect quarterback rating for Tom Brady but certainly spreading the ball robbing you have a guy like Sony Michel hanging out in the backfield\nReally changed the ... election as often as much as I Want to gush\nAbout Gordon and the return of Edelman whatever the fact that you actually have a running back yeah love James White but he's more receiver than anything sure you got a guy between the tackles that could rip off Fifteen yard runs\nAnd boss through the tackles and get to be outside that's changing how defenses have to look at things and that they haven't had a guy like that\nIn a long while I mean look Arab want I guess when he was at his best well beyond that what what are we going back to\nTen years before since you had a running back really of that ilk who also catches the ball out of the backfield\nMakes this often that much more difficult to defend right you've got Horton running on one side taken the top off Ron ... sprinting through the center of the field like he's a kid in a spring daisy patch it 'cause I mean how many\nSpring day how many times did you see him really where there's nobody governor because the line backers that keep an eye on them so there he goes in and that's part of that is Josh door and you got to pick your boy\nYou're right but you know but the the thing is to go a step further with is is that\nYou can say is Tom Brady still the same quarterback without Julian Edelman endowed Josh Gordon because look at the games he has had up until this week he's had some good games but has he been this explosive no this is the first three hundred yard game\nHe did throat to pick spot his three touchdown night tonight he threw three touchdowns last week but this is a big night this is ten in complete passes this is his best passer rating in weeks and it's a night where he gets back a guy who has been very good for the past\nYear and now a new dynamics threat in Josh Gordon can you say Tom Brady was still the same guy I Wonder if without these got what kind of season he might have been on an on an arc for if he didn't get Edelman back now and Josh Gordon\nWhere we can do that with any quarterback that has a bunch of shrubs roaming around but he never had to worry about that but we know what ... might as well you always had an adult man or a welder or one of those guys that what you're saying you had you had in Hamburg well yeah but you but you always had a guy that was a safety valve that would catch a balls and keep\nChange moving that guy was missing for the first four weeks of the season now he's back at Josh Gordon for whatever years for however many weeks that task you still getting it out yeah I I like to camp\nFox Sports

[noise]\nI'm doing when the hangover effect for the Broncos the public loves the Broncos they love the Broncos to bounce back the jets have been a hot mess I'm going to take the jets though\nI I'm going to take that this is a fleeting situation for Denver they they gave that game away against Kansas City in the fourth quarter like a bronco team hasn't done in years short week quick turn around to New Jersey so I guess Vance Joseph and his team with all that great will be on the line\nThis week now secondly Sam Darnell I'm not going to sit here in defense and he has passed for less than two hundred yards the last couple of weeks he has a quarterback rating of sixty three point eight since the first game of the year\nAgainst the lions he did though it is only a home game have three hundred thirty yards against the Miami Dolphins so I Am going to ride the home cooking strategy here\nAnd I realized the Broncos are better defense than the Miami Dolphins [noise] but all things added up to me this this line seems fishy that the the Broncos shouldn't be favored in this game the fact that they're not favored\nI might be over thinking it but I'll take the jets year anyway jet Seventeen Broncos Thirteen [noise]\nAnd he agrees that the only the Jefferson\nDepressing time for coup loop our next up Atlanta one in three taking on any Garcia's pet's Mart stay\nIt's on Fox part of the Fox sports radio alumni association Chris Myers he pays his dues with Daryl moose Johnson the Steelers or I mentioned one two and one Pittsburgh opened a four point favorite their favorite by three and a half\nThe money is pretty even here I'm taking the falcons plus the three and a half in till the Steelers show the ability to stop on someone anyone there's no way on God's green earth that I can trust them land sucks also on the fence\nSo this oughta be attract me there should be attract me high powered off which means high powered off into Lana\nAverage four hundred and ten yards per game\nThe falcons do the Steelers are giving up four hundred twenty yards per game\nOnly Tampa in Kansas City\nAre worse than the NFL so the way I see this game breaking down Matt Ryan and company a hard look loses and all that good enough to score a bunch and lose you got to be looking your chops at this Pittsburgh defense they cannot stop anyone so this game is going to be the old back and forth\nShootout situation you take the points\nIn fact I'll tell you landed a win falcons forty four Steelers forty one [noise]\nThe funny thing [noise]\nPenny picks the falcons All right let's get to the lake games the alright is the yoke Glenn writers that while Roberta woke up the Oakland Raiders one in three at the LA charges go into the charges open up a five point favorite that line currently at five and a half the numbers we have here\nI'm taking the charge them and take the chargers in this game I realize this is like a nice home game for the raiders because of the the crowd is going to be insane is going to be a silver and black attack ... going to be there so if you want to meet Roberto sending messages you can have a beer with burn up here in LA\nUh but ... it's going to be a sea of silver and black and Carson, California unfortunately those lunatics aren't going to play in the game the raiders have been given a gift against the browns last week that will not happen two weeks

and one Philadelphia comes in too into the eagles favored by three they open there's one point favorite the money is slightly in favor of the Vikings with the road team as much as I trashed the eagles this week\nOf course I'm going to pick the eagles are\nThere you go to Mike Zimmer he's my logic until Mike Zimmer can show me that he's got a vaccine\nTo cure the Vikings the effects that splintered I just can't bet on I Can't the Vikings have burst apart at the fundamentals of football on the defensive side they were school by Jared ... fortunately the eagles are not as good as the rams are often so that's a positive\nFor the Vikings and this was a a ... situation but [noise] I just don't feel comfortable with Minnesota as defense in Philadelphia even when they're often too quick question should be able to matriculate the ball down the field eagles thirty one\nVikings twenty three [noise]\nSend the penny also picks the eagles but that could you tell me the point spread that

can come up with to tell you the rams are gonna not dominate this game but I have a theory divisional games you get a touchdown or more you take the points\nEveryone's predicting a blow out this and that but since twenty twelve Russell Wilson the Seahawks since he was drafted to see actually only lost two games by more than ... points so it'll\nBe in that area and will be close\nI'll take the the
