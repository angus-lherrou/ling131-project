the series games to one Red Sox outside the Astros eighty two in the American league championship series Boston alley that series games won the big story tonight those\nThing at at at the outset right it's a one off kind of odd occurrence and then yell at but wait there's more\nNow but now it's a thing because as Jeff passing of Yahoo Sports is able to on earth\nThere are numerous teams who have complained to major league baseball and even warned the red socks that the Astros do this the A's in a series in August talk to major league baseball felt the Astros were stealing their signs the same way\nAnd the Indians warned the red Sox about it the Astros are doing this the Dodgers\nFeel that the actors were stealing signs in the world series last year illegally not legally not on the field this is using nefarious methods I measure good lord I with the camera phone to take video and stealing sides so now you have four teams that are involved in\nHey we think they're doing this and now a major league baseball is investigating\nSo we're at Spygate has fully come to major league baseball\nThere's so many parallels to the situation with the patriots including the fact that now at least the red Sox are the victims of not the er and not be aggressors all my life or do we what are the ones that were getting put upon the whole time there were no tapes they were all destroyed Oakland me\nWell and that's why the Astros said well you we we thought you were taping us fighter\nSo let's play this out because they're much given this story teases now all these teams that have been talking to a major league baseball about it\nAnd there's many similarities and I look I've said earlier there's no way that the Astros or patriots are stealing signals unless it's a huge benefit for them because yeah you can have Bill Belichick say yeah I don't know that we got anything we need it up yeah you wouldn't be doing it every week that way well in the end it's\nGot to come down to is there enough of a deterrent right in this process one of the things that are done is go back to when the cardinals hacked the Astros scouting system to draft picks and two million dollars I'd say given the\nThe weight and the dollars and cents at stake for extra playoff appearances and everything else I'd say that's not not enough of a deterrent to keep other teams from potentially trying to do the same thing really that's it\nPicks how high now that that's fine\nBecause you would you trade that to win the world series who or what do you so let's play this out remember what the patriots reputation was and still is coming off of Spygate they won three superbowls\nHow much of that did they win because they were getting the videotape and they were getting the plays of the other teams because they went through his family they did not win Super Bowl championships because of it this is a very big deal\nBill if it is found that the Astros were doing this for a long period of time and it seems like you have these complaints from different teams and major league baseball that they are\nThis is one of the biggest black guys baseball could get coming since we went through the steroid era of look at all these players who are doing things illegally because baseball\nIs different from so many other sports and that its rules are sacrosanct they are the rules are the rules and they are sacred cows nobody\nHas more unwritten rules then major league baseball there's some things you do some things you don't do and if you don't abide by these unwritten rules or what is fair play than we are going to absolutely murder you for it\nOr players in other sports taken ... of course they are of course they are just take them in football team in basketball everything all golfers are taking of course if they can be eating but we Karen baseball because baseball was about records in home runs and if the national pastime and it was a very big deal\nHere is we're Spygate the patriots were getting video and it was a big deal\nAnd the patriots were certainly the scourge of the NFL for awhile and Roger Goodell covering it up really was the worst part of an ally destroy the evidence myself well this is a very big deal yeah but you know it's really embarrassing for the NFL so I'm destroying it so we didn't really get the full\nOutpouring of this story like we should have because Roger Goodell decided yeah I'm sitting on this to help the national football league\n[noise] we're going to get the evidence on this is John Paul morose he told us a little while ago on the show there are so many cameras taping everything and major league baseball they're going to be looking for all of this now so if if this guy this comic lock ones doing it there's evidence of it if it's in the playoffs now you go back to\nA season a series in August against the ... are they still going to have their video ... I mean maybe maybe not so that's going to be tough to go back and see but this will be such a big stain the cause\nCheating in baseball we just care about it more than we do cheating in other sports if the jets cheated too when I Would go oh I could see why they hate us and we will and that though exciting any other sport the same way people would feel the weight but baseball is different\nCheating in baseball is this is the worst thing and I'm moving a look at what happened to Alex Rodriguez took the guy forever to get back and baseball's good graces and fans good racially still not all the way there\nMark Maguire still not all the way that Raphael ... has not been heard from Sammy Sosa is not that none of these guys because cheating in baseball is the worst thing you can do and you are not coming back from that and how baseball comes back from this is going to be a really big deal\nAbout baseball it's always been interesting to watch the folks that profited quite a bit\nFrom it became the the one jumping the pulpit and start wagging their fingers most vehemently a as that went through but but certainly\nAs you go through all the scandals in like pd in the NFL you you have a few few players busted and we watch superhuman feats time and time again we watch the NBA and the athleticism on display and it's not just throwing out\nYou know allegations that any individuals it's just the reality of won't bigger faster stronger enables you to play back to back nights and some of the right that we see with such regularity mean Elvis toward all a discussion in the in the national football league just gone down the line\nBut you'll you'll get major league baseball for this now you you go through the security ... and earlier or in your past\nAnd report was the number of security from major league baseball sent for that game in anticipation of what what do we get a fine right and more people checking the where the camera wells are every any area of the dugout held is going to be ...\nYou got to put it in a bucket wow you got to put it in a bucket or you go anywhere near the judge at all I see where I thought you'd go on the other way I was like why do you think there might be in a while there could be a wow All right\nI mean that I'm actually an angle to this that takes it at a whole other level Mr Jean or investigative cry that may have occurred on your property really when a anytime from yesterday back to two thousand and five you videoed whoa whoa whoa\nGive daddy you're just ... wow you really got that title is pretty good I got a couple of months and okay way to go ... is a slight over baby our that is that time [noise] uh eight seven seven Ninety nine on Fox winter at how about a ... might\nHave swollen dome Jason Smith show with my Carmine yes spiking major league baseball I feel old\nBecause now I'm at the point where it's by going to come back around a generation later enough time for me to talk about it on the radio coming up next we got more from the night in major league baseball Dodger brewer still tied at one apiece and the and the\nTwo thousand eight dean do thousand Nineteen NBA champion or inaction tonight and it's not the warriors [noise]\n[noise]\nWhatever tequila your favorite towns are\nGoing to\nThree on the way\nThat like the way we're dominating this year's coverage are un [noise] this is Fox Sports radio\nEven if you're a big time basketball fan there might be a few facts about the game you don't know why did you know the first who for actually peach baskets or they don't want basketball is bounce you're then the cold one or the players can run as much as four miles during a game\nWell here's another factor you might not know that's actually really helpful if you need to buy a car\nTrue car also helps people get used cars that's right true isn't just for buying new cars with their certified dealer network and nationwide inventory of nearly one million used cars you'll enjoy real pricing on actual inventory and simpler buying experience whether you buy new\nOr used and withdrew car you can see what others paid so they know if they're getting a good deal before by\nThere also more likely to enjoy it faster buying experience by\nConnecting with true car certified dealers when you're ready to buy a new or used car check out your car and enjoy a more confident car buying experience some features not available in all states\nJulie Leslie seal oath to Howard group Africa when my fourth and are here for a director of operation it was overwhelming running ... yellow with scientists in the job on Lincoln hit live in ... that that what really connected with\nMe when I'm passionate about something logical this operation we started to get the next town Atlanta process plan databases match development when he became a geek at ...

C. and see the D and this relievers coming in here in this relievers coming in here and this is how we're playing the series they seem like the team that's in control good news is for the Dodgers that look if anybody's game right now it's one more than they win this game suddenly her she was going to put 'em up three to tomorrow\nBut it's certainly this entire series up until now has been the brewer seem like they're the team that have been in the lead in control much more than the Dodgers act\nLike you've been there and that's what the brewers are Craig council but whatever you know you knew or didn't about his brewers team coming into the series\nYou're going to the bowl panning approach more or less you have ... starts goes out all these guys you pitched multiple games in this series effective distilled there the Dodgers hitters with runners and scoring position just atrocious and I'm now watch this Machado replay\nOn this ... probably about ten times he changes his gate and and a lot of jokes on Twitter in Haiti hustle down the line though\nHe ... well it doesn't look he's gotta do to get them to hustle hey go spike the first baseman if you run down the line maybe that's old men that would be a big payoff that could be a whole tactic\nAnd a boy and his legs waiting there no I [laughter] you know who the most unhappy person the world is right now Rob Manfred because he's going to actually have to do something after that but he's got two things to worry about how you got you got the ALCOA as I said a cameras and ... and and find the guy on the line\nOh the

now come to bad in the bottom of the eleventh amount all anybody who's doing your scene hits from Ken Rosenthal and Tom ... splits screams of all you are in many Machado is Manny Machado Mandy\nMandy ... lives yesterday and here's the other thing I just from the game low or beyond Machado for the moment ah Ballenger who's been miserable at the plate and chronicled it quite a bit last night I was actually made a couple of nights defensive plays contributed\nAny got to be said three shifts that put runners at first and third in the ninth inning but the Dodgers couldn't catch yet at\nThe sliding catches what everybody's going to talk a lot I mean it was very nice Juan finished to it like he he gave it some style like he was on the tarp filling it rained early\nHe did slide a lot I mean that was that was a slight Jason Bateman at the game yeah this is the point where Fox Sports one is saying let's take a look and see some of the famous level who are still here because it's ten thirty and everybody's got to leave this is a very big very beginning right here ten thirty is a big found that people want to go home\nOh by the way the schemes now like six hours that showed village or at the plate to lead off the bottom of the eleventh\nYou know so here's the thing\nMitt Rob efforts gonna have to come down with something let's let's let's let's take over Rob Manfred today tomorrow night is going to come into the office and he's going to get hit with Spygate Astros and it's going to get hit with many Machado\nThe first thing is going to buy an asterisk by [laughter] that that that a little evidence by Jay but that that a little after ... after\nThe first thing you've got to deal with his Machado\n'cause this is a play that could see a suspension that could see something\nAnd he's got to make that decision whether or not you suspend him for game five so that's Rob Manfred stay with the ... it could be or talking to a lot of teams were looking at this we're going to have something soon please don't call me I I really don't like dealing and doing anything so please stop with that\nNow if I had the bed and say what's gonna happen I say Betty Machado get suspended\nFor game for tomorrow I agree with you in that\nYou're going to look at this replay and say he did this on purpose and I know you can't do this and a quarter law\nWhere you can't say well ah someone's history like if someone stole\nLike if I may say something funny about okay well because someone wanted to ask if you were going to get rid of ice with a cat or a mailbox let let's say someone steals a bunch of mailboxes right but they you know or they're accused of stealing a bunch of mailboxes\nAnd there's evidence or whatever it is and maybe they get caught and they've been apprehended about stealing mailboxes a couple of times\nIf they steal a mailbox for a felony that stuff in it and they go on trial for it\nThe other stealing\nInstances are not admitted it not admissible the oh hey that that's right I've learned that um law and order your history is not a subject that won by me right Jack McCoy so\nBut in the court of major league baseball which you can say okay here's many Machado the last couple of nights he's out a couple of illegal slides he got into it with the with the home plate umpire and now he's spike the player on the other team tried to tripping and could have hurt him\nYeah that's got to be a game suspension that that's got to be ... I don't know that they'll have him\nFor tomorrow because this is he's been out of control for the last twenty four hours I don't know why he's been hitting well the team as well get it's a tight series right now it's two one in there in the eleventh ... it's not like they're getting swept down three zip but he has been out of control for the past twenty four hours and this is why major league baseball's going to suspend\nThem again Ballenger or the or the nod for his defense employee probably swung to the bone and dirt\nAh and the put out at first base the sixteenth strike out for the Dodgers Machado you got to send a message right this is no joke possible Achilles\nInjury and and the video obviously shows him changing his gate to make sure any times it in sync up his his stride to catch a ... foot on first base now you could argue that he really Cadillac 'cause he caught the ball and all he made sure\nYeah I got you see the put out and pose three two and then ... there and then the gets bike so certainly for major league baseball they'd been got quiet haven't had to rule on many things so busy day at the office videotape and phone messages and\nPictures coming into the office but for Machado I think you've got to have a big argument or even given the gravity of the game just forget about outcome of this one for the for the moment that you're you're talking about the game five of a championship series that you have to make that decision\nNot one that Rob Manfred ... went oh no no he would rather you talk to them about the fact that it took\nYou know like I said I compare him a lot to the Seattle Seahawks when they started their\nNot many dynasty run it's because they had so much talent that they were fortunate enough to have under contract at the same time and that's where the Celtics are right now in a lot of young talent all under contract but eventually someone's going to want to go someplace else and go play and be part of a bigger things someplace that's going to happen\nWhether it's Kyrie Irving leaving or he wants to stay whether it is Morris wants to go somewhere whatever it is you're going to see that happening\nBut right now this is their moment in time and they are good that they're going to roll through the eastern conference they're going to roll through the play offs Toronto in Philadelphia are both good teams Toronto's wildcard 'cause we don't know if\n... whether it's going to be a guy who shows up and plays great or if he's going to be someone who is just biding their time until they become a free agent and does it go outside because it's wintertime and doesn't like the cold and it's going to be awful there's nobody they can really have to worry about competing with the east and they'll beat the wars in the west\nBecause they're deeper they'll win the NBA final Celtics or your chance luggage you\nPut your name on it you're on opening night or certainly watching the game and you see Ninety minutes from nine different players Hayward and I are giving you don't have to really tax them too early in the season right because you have such depth\nAnd make sure that they're healthy and ready when it comes time for winning die down down the playoffs once we get to April and go through the ...\n... some NBA playoffs yeah that's right we're already talking about you know almost a full calendar year from now when we ... are next chance but\nYou you look at the the rest of the league and you've had some shoveling\nThe Lakers are as much as they they look like the land of misfit toys at the time that you started calling things together and the punch line road so when you bring in some of the characters that are here I mean they're out of central casting some degree at everybody loves a little bit of land Stevenson added to the mix\nBut you've got the debt in terms of the west where you wouldn't be shocked\nIf they're able to roll for right we had what three through nine separated by just a couple of games last year used and got worse and the warriors\nQuestions of their debt now eventually boogie cousins comes in either that great\nOr written some apart and then we add problem mhm either way it's going to watch but for the Lakers you you've got ... done but for the Celtics in the east is going to be very hard for other teams to imagine particularly when you see how much growth you've gotten from Tatum\nMeanwhile what's going on right now Dodgers and the brewers tied at one piece of the bottom of the twelfth ending manning Machado\nGetting all the headlines for spiking slash tripping audio ... on his way down to first base the last inning when he was battling in the tent spinning\nYou're gonna watch just replay it's famous we talked about it a lot so far throughout the last hour of the show running down to first base inside part he changes his gate and his running patterns so we can hit the bag with his right foot and try to trip or do you are with his left\nI think\nRob Manfred will suspend him for game five many people on Twitter saying member they didn't suspend hughley grill last year when he made a racist gesture in the dugout offer the world series and the Dodgers and the Astros and yet they suspended him for five games the first five games this season\nThere's a difference though between these two things the gesture which you know ... you can't do that and it doesn't obviously was bad\nThat's an off the field thing and that's something that happened in the dugout after after a play this was something that was on the field that could have resulted in injury for a player that's why I think immediately this needs a little bit more immediate attention because if he did this in this game to say okay we're suspending your next year\nFrom it well you may not be on that team that's kind of a weird things I Would I Would say that man for wind up suspending Machado Oregon nobody talked\nAbout it last night with Michael era when you got a guy like Bob has perfect coming across informed shoveling guys\nAre who've already been held up in a play or and you'll get reputation you look at history and you wonder what gets done with it here you're

trouble for having a camera guy recording in a spot where he was not supposed to be even though in previous years he was allowed to be there they changed the rules and so the\nPatriots got caught recording during a game from a spot they weren't supposed to be\nAnd do you remember the coach of the jets was Eric man Jeannie now why does that matter Eric man Jeannie was a disciple of Bill Belichick he was an assistant of Bill Belichick main Jeannie had knowledge of the patriots and the what they were doing recording\nAnd what not and he had a feeling that they were going to be doing that against the jets so he tipped off the jets brash and they caught this guy for the patriots in the case of the red Sox the reason I'm using the word deja vu\nA with the red Sox and Astros this has the makings of an inside job\nAlex Cora is a disciple of who he is a disciple of a J change that he was an\nAstros assistant was the right hand man so it's being spawn\nAs you know the Cleveland Indians BAs were the ones that were the originator of this that they started my theory is that it was actually Alex Cora\nWho tipped off the red Sox brass at the Astros were up to no good and he was the one that explain here's the person who look out for this his palace industry injuries what it is now secondly\nSince the security at Fenway caught this dirt bag and he didn't kick him out but they caught him and his photographs going around we have seen a change\nIn the American league championship series I if you just look at circumstantial evidence you say wow this is amazing the Astros were really no good without this right 'cause this was in game one now the Astros pulverized the red Sox in game one of the American league championship series\nBut since this guy was caught\nRed handed right cheating with the cell phone camera in a place he wasn't supposed to be the time he wasn't supposed to be there the red Sox have pulverized Houston pitching they've scored Fifteen runs the past two games beyond hit a ball astro pitching staff is\nSuddenly very humid very very human the astro pitching staff is that just a coincidence or is there more to this story\n... inquiring minds went all the Astros appear to be shell shocked but certainly not so invincible without inside information now since Houston got caught\nThey're trying to spend this ... this is another wonderful technical to this story\nThe Astros are claiming that what happened here was and this is wonderful spin\nBut it's lazy spin the Astros are spending their stories saying well what actually happened here is that they were just trying to ensure that the red Sox were not the ones cheating they were just making sure the red Sox more cheating now where we heard this excuse before that would be former St Louis cheating cardinal scouting director\nOr are there was a critical ray what's his name he's the one that committed corporate espionage his defense as I recall was it the red birds were spying over checking into the Astros database to make sure the Astros one stealing the cardinals data\nI did the judge believe him\nYes what are the guys in prison he's been in ... he pled guilty to five counts of unauthorized access to protected computer for twenty Thirteen to twenty fourteen at least and he was promoted during that to the St Louis director of baseball development\nHe was sentenced to four years in prison for that and the and the Astros have the chutzpah to use that as their excuse the same thing the other guy got sent to jail for\nWhat the hell is that it was the laziness is what it is ... last point you know there has been a cloud\nThat we agree on this every man woman and child around Houston baseball either shadow them I have been one who's brave enough to pointed out I've been taking some blowback for that or I'd like to hear that that gas back in the morning on Houston radio who was having support how dare you say you're treating well\nHello how are you more on your ... Peterson use thin\n[laughter]\nThis is shadowing you write the ashes and what makes it even more wonderful and\nPoetic justice is the Astros have been selling this false narrative that we do things the right way we win the right with the white ... the wonderful right way and it's bogus [noise] alright\nReports of pitchers talk during the ball to increase spending rates stealing signs from you ... the Dodgers in game seven of the world series and noble baseball do anything that's the ... baseball typically does know the cardinals had a guy go to jail for for years they got a slap on the wrist from the commissioner's office\nLike Rob Manfred is gutless when it comes to punishing teams with this kind of stuff let's see if he gets a pair of balls and actually does something and puts it into an I I Would like to recommend to begin the healing process from this horrible injustice the Astros have been part of I Believe at first what baseball should do is they should have the Astros vacate\nTwenty Seventeen World Series championship they didn't deserve it\nThey didn't ask or the Dodgers clearly cheating using rhythmic clapping and trash cans to\nCheat how low can you go to trash cans and rhythmic clapping and so began with that\nAsked us to vacate the twenty Seventeen World Series I Would also banned them for post season play for Thirty years I Would do that I Would take my every draft pick for the next forty years and I would force them to play in the little league field while we're at ... ... no not not a stream enough right exactly\nFatal dark\nRight they're done it's over turnout\nA lot of parties over go back to suck it asked those you can't cheat anymore with your trash cans and your rhythmic clapping\n[laughter]\nThe guys right there with the Astros owner or to put you choose to be better now they're showing Fox will take your calls eight seven seven Ninety nine on Fox eight seven seven nine nine six six three six nine were also on Twitter at Ben ... that's at ... or you can be part\nOf the the festival here of late night radio and Eddie is currently on a plane\nAnd so I I think well Ralph tapes them up as you're not going to Ralph tape some updates and we don't even call them updates but we'll have the uh the greatest hits Ralphie sweeping right now he's not actually here but\nWe'll have that mixed in for your dancing and dining pleasure so we get to all that in addition to that a little let's call this artistic drama artistic drama will get to that as well and it would be really nice if the Dodgers scored run right now will do that and we'll do it next\n[noise] all of your favorite towns are [laughter]\nTo\nThree on the way [noise]\nLike the one we're dominating this year's coverage are un [noise] this is ...\nAnd you had to have at least five targets like that and this guy Tyrone Williams is the only one I never even heard of him but I guess he's been good in those situations quarter the numbers he's been very the Dodgers beat the brewers with more on that men well in guard Dina yeah we'll get him to the front of the line on Fox Sports radio oh Marilyn\nIn like Scott\nJob good on your faith in the earlier you were doing good we will see you guys in the world series and the nights every choice\nQuit child Machado comes through your comes through only\nComes through all the guys were under fire I think are funny and you are ready to break out can bond is also going to have some prominent at bat oh man I'm feeling it I'll Wait for a while because rats are still terrible\nI don't understand how we consume sliding glass rotting rotting food is rat rather\nThan even matter right now not even King James matters right now sadly God chose\nThe baby and a band aid you are the best in the house and stop with the ranch please man\nYou're [laughter] crying out loud raider fan all righty rich that is true I think oh no are there you go that's sounds like you're cooped up with the er the M.

Saudi Arabia and [noise] ... and Saudi crown prince Mohammed bin Salman smiling as they met for talks the crown prince say\nMany Machado and we'll hear from day Roberts yeah let's go see it from a child of first on the play that happened this was back in the in the evening the the famous Machado Aguilar play\nHorse that incident at first baseman attempting what did you tell him what happened on that\nNow we're family you know having everything\nIn the Rio Grande got we we go way back up and running again we're all trying to be here we are trying to win whatever you can\nThey hugged it out of the\nUh put the brewers do not agree with that Christian yell at each\nWas asked about the Machado play and he said of the incident with ... he said quote it's a dirty play by dirty player\nThat's the quote quote from Christian yellowish dirty play by a dirty player and that seems to be the Senate or getting some of the quotes that are coming in from the brewers clubhouse and that seems to be the consensus Craig council a began his us that we do we have counts are let's listen to counsel because I Believe he had\nA a a ... somebody was trying to defend the Machado play by saying that he was a he was being aggressive and that's\nWhat happened but I Believe council pushed back on it let's go to the audio tape\nYou know I don't know I guess they got tangled up at first\nI don't think he's playing all that hard [laughter]\n[noise] [noise]\nSee that that I Will agree like I I\nWould like to rent later about some other things made me much out there that are that are separate from this particular play a but here's my my ten cents on the plane I this is\nFull outrage is what it is by the Milwaukee Brewers because of the trade that line the team that was desperate to get many Machado other than the Dodgers was the Milwaukee Brewers so it's\nNice to Craig council says he doesn't play hard and it's very nice of these other brewer players to call out Machado and he's a he\nEven in Christian yellow says he's a dirty player and all that stuff which I don't think it's necessarily a bad thing uh but you know maybe now in this you know softened up society we're in it is a bad thing but\nWe all these guys are the brewers they were this close to having Machado in their locker room as a team made and we're not supposed to believe that he is public enemy number one cause he's wearing different laundry and I hate to say this but I I guess somebody has to say it a memo to have sous Aguilar at first base\nIf you don't want to get spike don't allow Machado the opportunity to spike you\nStop being a slug and get your foot off the bag okay that's when you're the first baseman you if you leave your foot on the bag you leave the opportunity for that to happen\nMachado cannot do that if I get lost not lazy and Aguilar was lazy on that play and he didn't get his foot off the bat you gotta have cat like reflexes he did not have cat like reflects his bad job by you\nAnd this reaction of people\nIs absurd now yeah I I feel that the whole slide rule silly I think that um well I think Machado plus I Know I don't think much out of place art do I think this is a war crime Machado did against the brewers absolutely not I think this reaction is over the top nonsense is what it is it's absolutely ridiculous\nAs it is absurd\n... what are we talking about here is baseball it's kinda like that old thing I I guess the world is changing as we have to adapt\nUs like when I used to watch NFL Films years ago and they would celebrate the hardest hit human torpedoes safety is that would come off and just deliver\nBone chilling here now people run to their smartphones oh my God I've been triggered I Need my blackie because I saw a hit in the NFL and in baseball the equivalent of that anything with physical contact as ...\nBaseball again they used to talk about how players would do anything to gain an edge and they were you'll bend the rules and you hear some of these these stories from the olden days of baseball on guys if you didn't get your foot out a way you can get spy and it was celebrated\nRight that was the only part of machismo that was in baseball and now now we have a bunch of I\nI Can't but we have a bunch of people right now it's the worst implication that annoys me it's absurd\nAnd if you're one of these people with his photo outrage just like the brewer players and Craig council about many channels they would love to have ... right now if they could have many Machado they would take him on their team they wanted him they tried to get him\nCouldn't get it couldn't do it weren't good enough didn't have enough players to get him\nTo be the better our show on Fox again that took five and a half hours ahead Fifteen total it's five and\nA half hours that's different day Roberts who's in the awkward position of having to tap dance around all of this Year's Day Robert's on the Machado play we are just give you my version of events here is the Dodgers skipper\nI think it was one of those things wear a hat is a foot on first base and [noise] a whole lot of room on the back I didn't see the replay so he stepped on his foot ... and I think that's what a man he was talking about but we all worked out\n[laughter] [laughter] what did you go to group therapy will actually have to say\nSo we we have this weird\nThing going like many which I'm going to read about this later some others but like many Machado is\nIs lazy\nRight so on one hand he's admitted he's lazy but now he's dirty so he's like dirty lazy\nLike aren't those two things opposite I mean what\nDoes your [laughter] your lazy how can you be dirty I if your dirty\nHow can you be lazy or you're trying to figure out [noise] you know what I'm saying I maybe I'm wrong is I I don't know maybe I'm I'm incorrect I think I'm a ... the the negative stories are he's agree I don't think he plays hard I I agree with that I and I I can rip Machado for that but\nThis particular play if Aguilar gets his foot off the bag quickly you know he's a big fat told he can't get his foot off the bag if he could then many Machado cannot do that but it's ever gonna blame Machado but again it's a play baseball in the past\nWould be celebrate ideas on a flight to Europe I Would guess at this hour he's probably somewhere over the Atlantic\nAnd ah yeah\nBeen on a plane right now for a seven hours I think at this point\n[noise] better him than me so I have a better him that and we have Ralph on tape a year and\nRalph when he came in and it's great when he came into tape his his work he brought a baggy with him and his baggy said Ralph's on it\nGreat what an eagle mania what kind of egomaniac comes in here with a I mean that's like a little Brian James do fact move he comes in here with a bag with his name on\nSome believe\nYou see that Roberta when he was in the early ... yeah ... yeah\nIt's like crazy I Can't believe it out of control I like many Machado Ben\nOriginally paid two point five million dollars for this this costing eyesore which is a blight on their stadium and the owner paid two point five million for it\nAnd then my other favorite part of the story is that the Marlins announced they're moving\nThe arch does sculpture because they can't get rid of it they can't destroy because the art in public places board of Miami Dade County who knew that was the thing\nThey had to approve this they approved the school should be relocated outside the stadium so they can still have to have it outside the stadium so people can urinate on and I guess but but the Marlins announced that in place of the sculpture\n[laughter] this is great they're going to put a standing room only section\nNow what is the only team in baseball other than like the Oakland Athletics and the Tampa Bay rays that does not need a standing room only section and their stadium\nThere's no one going to Marlins games this no one's going to us and how much is this going to cost the it costs two point five million to put the the structure was commission for two point five million\nI've got to think it's going to take at least the million dollars to a movie which means that is going to come off the Marlins payroll they're going to have to take that off the months to but Derek Jeter is making his mark the team blows either the players suck but at least they're going to have a standing room only area in the outfield\nFor the Seventeen people that watch Marlins' baseball the way to go good jobs each way to go get that right salad [laughter] she didn't she didn't want him to go take a\nBow he's like oh yeah we we listen to our fans we live of course when the fans said don't trade Christian yell edge and as John Carlos saying that you know wasn't listening men but if the Marlins fan wants an art structure relocated cheaters all years but I just don't ask\nThem all if you don't get good players 'cause they can't do that\nDick\nPress on his knee depending on a show on Fox later this hour we're going to have ... to the third degree boss you get to the land of and Chapman and ... will go there as watching people lined up I see these guys they want to yap about many Machado and other things will get to all that we will do it here momentarily from the Fox\nSports radio studios made possible by our friends that guy go but right now over there he is a unless he's not actually hear [noise] racket Rob who somehow it's going to guess the accurate score the Dodgers game I don't know how he did the [noise] the Dodgers\nWere to one winter is Thirteen have and you know ... can you\nPlay the one where he said the brewers won two to one can cause if we can go with Ralph\nAnd you play that one yeah okay let's see if it that the one over here and see how that's\nWhat a night for Christian yellow pages he led the brewers two or three one series lead over the dog\nShe uh she went right now like Ralph comes in and they like just different versions but yeah it's a real pain in the asked why not play the right one again go at play the right one again ... go ahead what a night for the Dodgers crime ha ha\n\nAnd five Seventy LA sports and the Dodgers radio network what's it called as LA escapes game for with the two one when series is tied at two games apiece in game five Thirteen and a half hours away could be Clinton crushed shots
