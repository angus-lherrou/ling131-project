Laker exhibition opener nine points in Fifteen minutes tonight in San Diego\nIn Asia I bought the way you know the reason we're getting close to having more overtime or close to having our ... not over ties but having teams end up in a tie ten minute older times well though are finishing in a tie up is because we moved the time from Fifteen minutes to ten minutes if it went back to Fifteen minutes\nI think I said that there's just no way I wanted to get my point across that right wow a good point I knew that you're correct hate you [laughter]\nYeah it's a it's something that is for those of us do regularly play mat and we're very equipped for this Arnie because you usually get a quarter of the\nTime and overtime and mad but I'll be honest with you that is ... ... you don't think about it when you hear the rule change as by the way things to say I agree and we remind you that is that what brought you buy guy go what does it mean when Geico says just Fifteen minutes could save me Fifteen Percent or more on car insurance made you probably should have gone to a guy called ... Fifteen minutes\nUh it's it's amazing how quickly ten minutes can go in an NFL game we ever or you don't throw in complete passes wondering what stays in bounds\nI mean you're lucky team could hypothetically milk it take a field goal San Francisco today without Jimmy ... had a ten minute drive ... see there you go so it just it shows you how when you see that Fifteen to ten oh come on it's not that big of a deal\nBut it ramps up the urgency and you're taking you only give him a couple of time out so yeah you ... you're right you're right it's it's a major factor that I think when it was announced fans didn't ... how big of a difference it was going to\nMake no I didn't even realize that I just said well maybe they didn't want to you know they said it was safer for the players I Believe that garbage but now we have to go back to the Fifteen minutes now I Believe\nA here's a couple of other quick tweets before we play the play of the game and and it's funny because maybe the best game of the day we really haven't spent too much time talking about but Mike seems to disagree with Frank right when he tweets out us and says how the coal fired their coach yet I give him three weeks what a dope\nBoy it's going to be crazy to think if the coach ended up missing the playoffs by I don't know maybe\nI don't know how it ties with factory maybe like what half a game or something that you know they would have taken the\nCall I got to say you know as much as I looked at a guy's going to be cuts you can go for um the cost your team a tie it to get a loss I don't even know the percentages on that but you know it it it's got to be a major problem like it said if it comes to it at the end of the year\nAnd then Kevin asks a great question kind of dug tailing if you will off what Aaron Rodgers set a little bit earlier at fat guy six one nine rights\nIs Jimmy grant over ... let me try this again can we use the second take bubble in three two one is Jimmy Graham over rated or under used by both the sea hawks and the Packers\nI'd rather use more I mean I don't think he is overrated I loved him um but I think he's being under use\n[noise] he was on the day for Green Bay he was targeted six times three catches for Twenty one yard that's not edited out yeah\nI mean I I'll never forget that surprised trade whenever he was dealt from New Orleans to Seattle and I think what what Seattle give up their center in that deal and it kind of shows you we all thought at the time that Seattle head just absolutely added to an explosive ...\nAnd it and it never really materialized for me to get a pretty good game against Minnesota last week at six catches for Ninety five yards but only what to touch down so far one touched down so far this season uh he's battle with you I I don't know I'm not going to say if you're making excuses for Jimmy grand but I think that's a fascinating\nConversation about why in the world\nEconomy ... and he's not even close to being ... like I'm not so many times it should be targeting him you know defense is just have to be scheming and Joe teaming up for somebody like this and they don't have to do that right now\nOh my gosh I didn't realize how poor his season was last year\nI mean he he didn't have over a hundred yards receiving in one game last year not one still at ten touchdowns but you're right or any and that's the problem not a a player problem\nHe's a Travis Kelsey slash ... kind of a difference maker\nWhom we haven't seen that for since what maybe two thousand in Thirteen I mean it's been a while and we haven't given credit to our play of the day may the game of the day with one of the most incredible finishes we'll have this year\n\nThat caught winding down but it should be\nWith five seconds to go\nDown the line and jump on top in celebration of Joe mixing good\nThat the Atlanta broadcasts I've just had a cat she wow mommy Dave lap and was fired up was any I still don't know what happened on that plate you guys know what happened on that play bass in one satellite so we got really excited\nThey'll do better and I gave them credit for though they've got lucky with a couple of wins how about Texas debate Oklahoma\nCalled just like a ... knocking off Oklahoma what are ... are yeah do you mean incessantly [noise]\nWell that's where I'm picking up picking Maryland don't want the Seventeen and that don't need to Seventy to not\nI'll take the seventies and that was before the board a Michigan very lucky to come from I to be doing what's enough to be Seventy nothing and you don't put some voices aboard Michigan certainly not going to cover the game I think Marilyn ... Maryland over Michigan about Seventy to that point\nTwo games in the NFL I'm all over the Kansas City chiefs at Denver outweighed the three and a half\nAn hour at Denver they play no the first to get the Broncos Toronto yeah okay and then later on in the week I have Denver [noise] plus one\nAgainst the jets so I'm I'm against Denver ended\nUp taking that for this I think that there was no no no I'm following you completely on this one absolutely\nRight now not a major league baseball [noise]\nI'm all over the cubs any play in game\nOf all over my Dodgers in the play in game\nBut when the whole thing the world series it's going to be not the Boston Red Sox what a hundred and eight was this year but\nThe Los Angeles Dodgers why so\nThere you have my fix do with them as a police but remember they're strictly for the payment purposes only\nYou know a couple of hours ago and that slap slap slap said thank\nYou thank you a couple of hours ago I was going to throw a pretty hot take at ya but uh now I'm afraid to say it\nWhat about our time's lives yeah since I have I have are Dodgers has had like three minutes to fill here yeah I truly think whoever wins that you know west decisive game tomorrow I think they're going to the world series\nKnow up to the right what about the red Sox who had a hundred eight wins this year by the way\nWell that's in the American I Know that one way that but I think the red Sox are going to I mean I'm I'm afraid to say this but I mean it is is like two in the morning I don't think Boston fans still awake where they can get out to me I think the ales loaded I I think they're going to have a tough time getting out of the division around\nSo much easier time against gays who are ... five hundred against winning teams I think they're like thirty two and forty against these are winning records\nAnd the aides in the playoffs or to begin with anyway so\nFingers crossed for overall and I just comment that door this time Dwayne Murphy isn't coming to save the day for the Oakland days on the subway and does not coming through that door we could do this all night live I Will go out of time in corny last for Glenn Hubbard first time in major league\nBaseball history that will be to one game type breaks in the same season so you'll get the cubs and the brewers tomorrow and won Easter ah eastern or Easter\nAnd the Rockies and the Dodgers at Fort eastern\nA couple of quick stat notes from today enough that we haven't talked about it too much Nick Chubb became to oil Brown's player to rush for multiple forty yard touchdown did a game since Jim Brown in Nineteen wow the three he also\nBecame the first player to rush for over a hundred yards into scores in a game in\nThree Russia's or fewer there had been according to ESPN statue didn't though there'd been twelve hundred ... instances in NFL history where a player had a hundred rushing yards in two touchdowns\nShove it becomes the first player to do it and three Russia's or fewer wow it's we're on that game the raiders had a four hundred yard pastor a hundred yard Russia and two hundred yard ...\nFevers the only other time in raider history that all those marks had been reached was in Nineteen sixty four against the Broncos it was a wild game between the rate I don't know if it was a good game or not\nBut it was definitely a wild game between the

confirmed my new trade deal is done a dairy agreement the same as the Trans Pacific partnership trade agreement rejected by the president is in the new agreement along with exemptions on tariffs on two point six million cars steel and aluminum terrorists are not part of the new agreement\nThe Steelers are afraid and it appears they are they're not going to fire Tomlin then there is other collateral damage\nThere are jobs that are hanging in the balance now Keith Butler easily defensive coordinator and if you look at how bad the defenses been you say well there's an obvious when you get rid of the difference to coordinate her a rainy Victor the offensive coordinators also a possibility\nHe got into it with Antonio bread at this point even this special teams coach they could get I don't even know Danny Smith I guess that's what it said they say they get rid of that guy uh twenty five percent and these issues have yet to be addressed at the same\nRepulsive tackling for this this thing about the second half of this game that the Steelers were trailing in the game and they played it close to the vest\nOn defense and they chose not to be the aggressor not to the blitz and force the issue they allow the ravens the score on drives there Dr twelve plays eleven plays and fourteen plays in the second half these long methodical drives eating up the clock\nInventor office Berger who came out looking like he was going to throw for five hundred yards himself\nAfter he had two hundred twenty yards at half time they had one touched that was average and almost eight yard to play in the second half nothing nothing zip poll in the second half the ravens bottled up better off his burger he only had fifty yards passing in the second half the Steelers\nPassing off its with Antonio Brown and all the weapons ju ju Smith Schuster average to point seven yards per per play in the second half\nGarbage cabbage cabbage cabbage cabbage cabbage cabbage cabbage our last word\nHere are being there continue to be a medley of mistakes the Steelers they did cut back they didn't have as many penalties in this game as they've had in other games they turned the ball over though a couple of times it's near impossible for them to play a clean game\nThey haven't done it if they've yet to show they can do it if served up\nA lot of slap a lot a slob\nAnd Tom and has been quote one of his quotes which he took from other people it's not his originally but he has said this over the years he says excuses or the tools of the top but at the famous quote which Tomlin repurposed\nAs his own uh and yet there are people not necessarily tons of but the people around the Steelers that are using the excuse of levy on pill that he's not there and that's that's why they have have is you know in a positive note there is a light at the end of the tongue\nThe division is wide open Cincinnati Baltimore in Cleveland are not\nGreat teams unfortunately the light at the end of the tunnel could also be a train which is coming down and it's going to run over what's left of the Pittsburgh Steelers at this point there are for the\nI ... and you are with your record says you are in the Steelers have won when twenty five percent into the season and they've got two games left now should they fire somebody sure if I was only team when I fire somebody absolute where fire right now\nBut the Steelers here's the move here you got to make sure I noticed the Steelers play hosted the falcons who are miserable themselves this year it Lana scores a bunch of points they don't win bunch games\nYou got the falcons in Pittsburgh and then at Cincinnati and the Steelers have thereby week after that if there are no signs of life if the polls is faint on the Steelers and we head into that October fourteenth late night hours\nThen heads are going to roll someone is going to lose their gig there in Pittsburgh and a myth that Joe Flaco who has been stealing money for years is not stealing money right now on the other side for the ravens\nHe is on pace for five thousand yards passing\nAnd three touchdowns in eight interceptions if he continues along the way that he's going which by all likelihood he will not I mean the odds of this continuing the supernova but if you want to play the glass as half full card\nAnd say well the ravens are three and one and they have the browns up next so that should be formed one right there should be sitting in foreign one\nAfter next week even though that came as in Cleveland are usually been our show on Fox we see a low to Edmund Dallas\nGarcia\nAs well as the Steelers fan obviously I'm not a not pleased at all with the way the seasons gone or they look lost uh neither one of the coordinators seems to have an answer for\nWhat they're doing a you know back in the in the past the Steelers were known for running these exotic blitz is and to try and get pressure confuse players they're TJ water to the left side and he went up against a you know the right taco for Baltimore kicked his ass all night and they just kept doing it over and over again uh except for one other time I can remember they tried to put some of the middle\nBut it's a there's nothing and I know the secondaries terrible so\nAh but that would seem to me that you would want to do some different things with your blood to drag it perjury because you can't cover any one so\nI don't know it looks bad I don't disagree with you I Know the Steelers and ... ... is to not fire they had coach I understand they've only had three uh coaches in my lifetime\nA ... year yes fifth yeah yeah yeah I Do I Do think my comment is on the hot seat I really do or even in Pittsburgh where they don't make these types of coaching change is normally I I Do think he's a lousy I really do\nNo chance they fire him during the year they fire and the fire him at the end of the you're not going to fire him during the year though\nI ... I Would lean towards that but I could see it being fired at the end of year for sure I bet you a hundred bucks at the end of the year\nNo say in between ... I mean if if he doesn't mind yeah yeah\nI Would say eighty percent chance he finishes the season\nUh Ninety Ninety eight percent chance of the time it doesn't get fired during the year\nBy on the team he's already out Dunn fired gonzo pink slip get outta here [laughter] he gets paid anyway it's not like real firing a real firings and you don't get paid he's going to get paid and he's got a guaranteed contract for ... who knows how many more years he'll still get paid\nTo get money you get a nice little golden parachute don't get a job somewhere Tom we'll get a job immediately you would assume right I Know they like to hire young cheap coaches assistant coaches and hope they hit the lottery with assistant coaches really common will good job somewhere\nElse you know it's kind of interesting about him is that he was hired as a defensive coordinator from Tampa or no he was Minnesota actually for a year he was with Tampa before that\nAnd he's never really run the defense his whole time there he's always had to declare bowl hall of famer I get that they didn't change the defense when he came in but he's never as a defensive guy he's never really been hands on with that defense that I ever heard so that's it's interesting\nYou mentioned Tampa that's where he could end up Tampa Bay right that time we were who's ... who else could wash Houston Houston is going to get rid of O'Brian at some point and a Tampa who who are the jobs will be open up in the NFL Seattle Tom on the Seattle Seahawks job you know who said be open you know he was ...\nOn the raiders yeah what

experience what do you buy new or use and were true car users can see what others paid so they know if they're getting a good deal before by\nWhat would you be saying if it would have lost the browns that's a ... oh you did lose their brands you you did lose the game he had a Bill Gates you became you lost the game you stand on that third that that was the that was in the first I by the way\nIt was just I don't know if you didn't see the later rounds game there was a spot now they go to they go to review on what would've been a first now if it's a first down for the Cleveland Browns\nGames over for all that's it that's actually that said they run the clock out browns when they get into victory formation see you later goodbye and instead they go to the replay and they almost never changed the spot on a replay\nAnd it's certainly there has to be overwhelming evidence to change a spot there was not overwhelming evidence to change the spot but for reasons beyond\nThe greatness of the raiders well maybe from beyond the grave or al Davis might have or from the other side might have benefits\nThat feels good to be on the other side of band yeah say sure his ones yeah\nOkay sure I had the medic Mike says after seeing the referees decision to take away the first at it from the browns it is clearly NFL is not ready for Cleveland to be a winner\nSemitic Mike's hot take hot take

thought jokes were better this week 'cause we actually got to the jokes instead of just having we'd man laugh after every joke we actually got through a bunch of jokes so I think he was offended by

have\nBlinked at all because that's the way competitions work and he would have sabotage didn't walk then Kelly pride and not given him an opportunity to transfer and go elsewhere so I actually think\nThat couldn't have been much more honest then he actually was that I didn't get a larger sense one of the questions that many people are going to have is is this good for college football\nTo get the rest of what ... said pod cast by searching out kicked the coverage that is always you can hear I'll get coverage with clay Travis weekdays at six am eastern three unfit back right here on Fox Sports radio fan mail or show\nErik read was already going to have\nA near impossible mountain to climb to get to the peak to prove collusion not only did Eric read you have an opportunity with Caroline and what your dog the forty niners had offered to read a contract recently in Seattle last month they had an offer in return them now\nThan powder nights at two AM eastern eleven pm Pacific Fox Sports radio\nWhat's the deal with the Dan Patrick's show more positive\nTrends silver we just had him on yeah he dropped you can lose it in September but you can't win it and I checked you cannot win the Superbowl in September is only played in January or February try to argue with his argument I'm not arguing with it you know women's games in the NFL\nWhen they're through to Dan Patrick's [noise]\nWe have not I am eastern six percent I mean help bring chaos icy Iowa City sockeye sports station and Mel all the University of Iowa sports we Gary are available via streaming cats like ... dot com\nLast minute and the deal is done I'm an Carrick Fox News Canada's prime minister called a cabinet meeting laid on Sunday and shortly after the U.S and Canada confirmed a new trade agreement was in place the United states and Mexico Canada agreement us NCA replaces the Nineteen Ninety four NAFTA packed\nFor real Thomas you also have to factor in that in the big picture he's damaged goods\nRight now he's still going to get paid he's going to get paid a decent amount of money within reason see that's the bigger part of this because how much is a free safety worth compared to other positions he is way down\nWay down on the totem pole of sours role Thomas who has been ... about getting a new contract as I Am I don't want to play the last year my deal\nIt's a contract that he agreed to each signed a four year contract\nForty million dollars he got almost ten million dollars in sunny most he never expected to have to play the final year the contract\nUnderstandable most contracts in the NFL you know how this works most contracts in the NFL do not see the final year this is\nThe exception to the rule the Seahawks we're paying Thomas this year\nUh eight and a half million dollars he was the third highest paid free safety in the NFL right so he he didn't want to honor his contract he chose to finally do it he wants to make some around Fifteen million dollars a year so do we all want to make fifty million dollars a year\nOr ... that is the word is unrealistic eat is unrealistic he is overpriced his value the highest paid safety in the NFL Islam Marcus joiner\nOf the rams he's number one on the list his salary is eleven point two million dollars the only other safety in the ten million dollar range is Harrison Smith the Vikings\nAt ten point to me so Thomas is in line and you add on the signing bonus that he got the uh the value of the contract even with eight point five this year the signing bonus included it's like ten million\nSo for all Thomas is going to get a contract or they don't pay him in the neighborhood of ten to twelve million dollars as a free agent that's a pretty good\nNeighborhood to be in it's not bad Jerry Jones and the cowboys will be tempted other teams will be interested in a short term deal may be a long term deal for real Thomas now the last thing\nAnd while the Seahawks were\nThe losers in this because they didn't trade Earl Thomas ... before they had the the window clothes on trading him to get draft picks in return they were vindicated in one area\nWhat would that be a that would be that Seattle was right even though it looks bad now they didn't trade him one of the reasons the Seahawks did not give real Thomas a new contract there were two reasons he was over pricey overpriced is worth and there were legitimate concerns that he would stay healthy\nAnd those proved to be a hundred percent accurate right are you going to get a long term contracting free agency and all that but this is the third year in a row\nThat real Thomas has gone down with an injury he's missed games three years in a row because of different injuries the leg injuries happened a couple of times so the Seahawks didn't think they could rely on him didn't want to pay him the money that he thought he was worth it prove that they were correct\nAnd you know this idea that people trying to compare this situation\nAnd ... on bells contract I've seen\nA couple of former NFL players ranting and raving innovation July housing and preaching how let me on bill cannot play you see what happens here this is a\n... living on bell has a contract that would have paid him the most money of any player at his position this year last year levy on bell was the highest paid player at his position\nOr last season when he played for the Steelers he's leaving that money on the table leaving guaranteed money on the table\nAnd if you're afraid of getting hurt don't play football there are other things you can do you can get a real job if your mindset is I Can't play on a one year contract\nEven if it's guaranteed money because I might get hurt then you're in the wrong business there are plenty of other businesses there's plenty of other things you can do if you're that paranoid about being injured playing professional football you should not be playing professional football is not the job for you\nGo get another job there are plenty of jobs out there but if you're that scared being hurt and you feel like you need a multi year guaranteed contracts this just not for you I Will say hello to Edmund Dallas steamboat Willie\nRights over there yeah I I I feel the same way you do a about this and you know I I look we don't want to see I don't think we want to see\nA anybody get hurt for the season I Know Taylor I refer to the Bengals yeah he got out of the ... yeah I mean I just as bad for him as I as I Do about or Thomas I don't feel any any more simply because of the situation as you said well he's still getting paid even though you know he's getting he's injuries looking to get his paycheck this year\nOr he was getting well compensated I get he wanted a bigger contract but as you said we\nDon't all get what we want a in this world so I think we know that better than most of the yeah yeah yeah very much so very much so\nYeah the time really wow yeah so you just you know suck it up is that it if you if he's tired of playing football you can go to something else I'm sure all Thomas has other skills he can add to the world and you paid I'm sure you can do something that will pay an eight point five million dollars a ten million dollars a year right there's a lot of jobs that pay that much\nNo probably not no probably not no I think\nIt's great getting part downtown [laughter] yeah exactly I Would take your calls we got to baseball games today\nMildly excited Molly said before I get to that though I wanted to mention Josh Rosen or this game was in my rotation the cool thing about late ... NFL the late television when does not allow the games so the cardinals see a game Josh Rosen's debut and\nHe uh he did not look very good to me although I Love the spin I Love the spin 'cause you you can't just say just Rosen had kind of a substandard yet you can't say that Rosen completed fifty five percent of his past is now a top line quarterback completes around Seventy percent\nThat the elite quarterbacks in the NFL complete about Seventy percent of their pets assuming they're not thinking in ... there is the exception to the rule that's the same Bradford effect where San Bradford we'll check down in complete when he plays just basic uh passes\nBecause he wants to enhance his completion percentage but if you're running a real NFL often and you complete fifty five percent you're passes that is embarrassingly low so they're not trying to spin and they're saying well if you adjust it and you add on the drop passes and the throwaways Josh Rosen actually\nCompleted Seventy two percent of his past\nOf course ... tell me again we're receivers have not drop the past ... and a quarter back there's not throw the ball boy isn't that part of the the Seventy percent or a baseline for quarterbacks am I wrong in that I'm a I'm wrong in that like you're supposed to complete Seventy percent he passes even when there are dropped passes and even when you have to throw the ball away\nI think he looked at it\nBut the cardinals who said it was a competitive game I Will take your calls it needs to be bent Mather show on Fox eight seven seven Ninety nine on Fox eight seven seven nine nine six six three six an hour also on Twitter at ... at at Ben Miller will\nCall this one statistically misleading statistically misleading we'll get to that and we will do it next\nTo me

people to call the game\nBecause there's no work but you know these are network broadcast year they have to play it down the middle they want to play it down them even though none of them actually play down the middle but they want to leave at least give the perception that they're playing it down the middle\nThat that was horrible and I mean come on they didn't have a problem with who you would you like to name names you who you combine you're clearly colony among other would I\nI don't even know the guy who who called Houston game that was dating\nMarrow deed is the ... that was uh

your team without a gift you'd still be when you got a gift congratulations\n... unique gifts in NFL yeah okay let's see if you got to I mean I agree with critically yeah what what was it that you\nKnow see the difference is that was actually a Texas got that even the even the raiders from the NFL fisheries and so there is that the the coach of the cold so you know what I don't like ties so I'd rather lose untie that you know what I Would rather\nLose the game been tied the game those were the only option we was not on the table\nAnd the coach Frank right of the coal said you know what\nI'm going to lose this game I'd rather lose it and then I I don't know talk about this later to his credit Frank Reich had the ... to spin this into a positive and some dopey people bought it in Indianapolis which shows you how stupid some coal fans are bowl address that later I think you could get out here do where you\nAre so the amount of showing five statistically misleading we're going to get to that and also\nIn addition to that we will have mallard or the third degree will get all that right now though any Garcia is you're from the get go studios with the latest Eddie\nWell then

I ... and it's kind of consider question in there yes yes I Do think that day she wouldn't win a grievance if I if it gets filed okay I\nKnow he he doesn't have a leg to stand on that doesn't mean that he's not getting a raw deal but he cannot win I'll tell you what a blue jays are manipulating service time which is not against the rules blue Jay fans don't like to hear that it is an old fashioned what's called a loophole in the collective\nBargaining agreements several teams are taking advantage of it is not the spirit\nOf the rule of buddies by the letter of the rule and vitamin grows not in the poor us I don't have a lot of sympathy for Vlad Guerrero junior is father had a lot of money the blue jays gave him a for a million dollar signing bonus so he's not hurting financially\nAnd Toronto is holding out because they know as soon as this guy turns out to be a free agent he's going to leave Canada and go play somewhere for the high profile team if he's as good as advertised but no he's not going to win next\nOr that's also last week I get paid just ... he got a jacket for retaliation throwing at the head of a raise player and he got adjusted to innings before a bonus it was about to kick in but my question for you as he and I was just spend it for a few games next\nYou can do you think the Yankees you given that bonus anyway\nI Hope not and the reason I Hope not\nIs it's a much better story if the Yankees do not pay the bonus out the legend of the story is worth of five hundred thousand dollar bonus so bad he has made a bunch of money in his career he can afford it\nBut to say that you gave up five hundred thousand to stand up for your teammates the guys made two hundred and fifty million dollars in his career is essentially chump change so\nThe Yankees will likely given the money but I Hope they don't\nBecause the better stories if they do next known odds makers that over the weekend that Alabama will be double digit favorites against any

year there were those unit three they will they will go and they were really good and I'm not trying to fool fool ... and what they did the Vikings they are who we thought they were so let's just dial it down a little bit\nTo get around the what the couples that are tested by searching odd couple that is always you can listen to the odd couple with Chris Broussard Enron park your weekday that seven pm eastern more beyond Pacific right here on Fox Sports radio [noise]\nYou're listening to the godly show\nNow in Bryant's depends he's already ... watched just John what's in the winter than any genetic Clinton's defense they just because they're making a move\nAnd it feels permanent doesn't mean it is permanent 'cause quarterbacks are always the play away especially in college where you don't have the protection you have in the NFL so I I think it's very interesting but I Do completely understand the mentality of you know what I Want to go to play in college guys\nAsk me all the time where should I go where should I go go somewhere to fly a high percentage of guys that do play aren't happy\nMan I'll get to bone up man we don't roll it up there I imagine the percentage of guys that are happy that do play up Ninety five percent so I get to go somewhere you're going to play I just there is a downside to it and one of the downsides to it is you become a man without a\nJog godly show that's insane at three PM Eastern Pacific Fox Sports radio\nShe says when Mike harming Jerry Jones wants you to know that things are absolutely fine with the cowboys he's comparing them to another office in the NFL ... wish to accept against the ramps we focus too much\nI could picture people listen to the show laughing as soon as Jerry Jones we stack up with the rams man when\nMike harm it we ... our coverage with clay trapped in\nMiami schedule I Know a lot of people dismiss them when they went out and they lost thirty three Seventeen to LSU and we want it did not look very good but there's a decent chance Miami's eleven in one and when their division in the ACC and it's playing against cleansing in the ACC title game with a potential chance to make the college football playoff\nI'll kick their coverage with the ... six am eastern three I'm back on Fox Sports\nI mean every day I see I always say these news sports station available on your Google Home a smart speaker just say okay Google Play eight hundred and ... heart radio [noise]\nWe have a trade deal I'm an carrots Fox News the United states and Canada confirming a new modernized trade agreement designed to replace the Nineteen Ninety four NAFTA packed\nThe new deal will be called the United states Mexico Canada agreement us MCA the agreement reportedly preserving a NAFTA dispute resolution process something the U.S wanted removed the agreement exams tariffs on two point six million cars and include the dairy deal essentially the same as one rejected by President Trump\nHe was indecisive and then after the game it seems like all of a sudden they know exactly what he was going to do it's disingenuous is what it is right now why is it disingenuous but cheap things on the on the level you have you go back to that play the faithful play\nShe was flip flopping at the time he was making the decision and what's my evidence that there was flip flopping the coach of the cold is Frank right was so confident that he was going to go for it\nThen why did he wasted time out to draw the Texans off sides right if you're going to go for just go for it why would you do the hard count tried to drop them off says it makes no sense because that meant even if the calls that can burn it the fourth downplay\nThey did not have that time out and that that puts their chances of winning even further down on the the odds of probability of winning and you know the coach at through this three outcomes to any gay right you have the the when the tie and the loss though when was next to impossible\nAfter the the sack of Andrew Luck the loss was\n... almost a hundred percent avoidable costs could've avoided the last the punt\nAssuming it's not return for a touchdown you avoid the last instead the calls have been the game to the Texas here you got to help you enjoy doing good luck down the line enjoy the one I and and Frank\nReich I understand it the the cheese ... part of it and then people are trying to make this elaborate BS band about how you came from Philadelphia and that's what Doug Peterson did Doug Peterson went forward he was an aggressive culture the eagles won the super bowl and that's a testimony to how you're supposed to go forward and that's why he was hired\nShut up here in eighty it All right you are an idiot time and place there is a time and place for everything right and again being aggressive is not a bad thing but\nWhen the outcome is either a tie or loss and you choose the last you're not being aggressive you're being a moron you're being an idiot Doug Peterson in Philadelphia had a great deal of success with the eagles last year\nMemo to Frank right you're not talk to the eagles Frank alright your income poop\nOne to one one while not great he's better than one in three which is where the costs are right now to into is not an option now the party shot here asked for the\nColds players we heard from Andrew Luck there were other players who publicly indoors Frank writes decision to go for it that doesn't mean it was the right decision it doesn't mean it was the smart decision again nobody wants to tie but in the big picture of uh divisional game that is the preferred outcome\nAs opposed to the other outcome and had the court's been closer down the field and if they weren't feels goal range and at that point if the let's say the taxes were ahead in the game and that would have been an understandable call a tie against the division rival is better than they lost on a\nPositive note Indianapolis they're not going to be anywhere near the playoffs and now they can settle for mediocrity\nSettling they be mediocre that's where they got to be and I also wanted to address Brian Billy cause I've heard this go around a lot there was a a fourth down decision in the Tennessee Titans game against\nPhiladelphia and Mike ... decided to go for it and Brian ... who\nAt one point I mean what are we doing here Brian I mean I I like Brian passed we we used to have 'em on when I did the ... the show the blitz which are long ago forgotten\nOn the weekends but Brian bill like I said that the titans goal for the winning at work so variables a genius the coal try the same and it doesn't work So Frank Reich is the village idiot\nThat's life in the NFL my reaction Brian ... could not be any more wrong it makes me wonder if even watch football on Sunday right it makes me wonder if Brian barely without fishing while these games are going on on Sunday\nNight and then he's way I it'd be very clear here because\nI I've heard other people point out very well one for now it was the right call there and worked out you're just a second guessing or not\nIf you look at the game situation the Tennessee Titans were on the eagles thirty two yard line he would have been a forty nine yard field goal attempt if if they chose to go for it on fourth into forced into as opposed to a forty nine yard field goal Tim\nFrank right and the calls were on their own forty three yard line when they went for it in a tie game it gets the eagles and titans Philadelphia if you look at the the outcome of that it is not the same situation I Am I'm getting all worked\nUp here and I don't really care about any of these teams but it annoys me when people try to compare and there's no comparison apples\nAnd oranges I always say hello to Edmund Dallas steamboat Willie Mays\nJar\nHere so the titans win by three they were down by three when Frank when Mike rebel went\nFor it in the overtime there with Marcus Mario then got converted the the first out but it's a totally different situation forty nine years ago\nI'm not so sure about becoming off like the way for three times on fourth down on that Dr you're talking about the last word down but the first for us down was fourth in Fifteen on his own thirty one\nWhere you have to go for it when you're down by a few go at it you get overtime because you lose if you if you give the ball to the team so those are understandable okay you're right you're right okay now do you agree with me I\nWant to come back to my side I'd make us yes when you're down in overtime if you give the ball the team\nEvent then right that was driven a bigger city and then what Frank right the rebels and you know up for that too We're not going to make it let's punt the ball away\n[laughter] that would have been out there but oh I was watching the cold now might or might have possibly had a little who\nAsked you on the coasts in that game I possibly you know maybe some wildflowers how was insane man and then there's people those same that's not the same thing I Will take some calls eight seven seven Ninety nine on Fox if you'd like to be part eight seven seven nine nine six six three six nine\nAnd are you there yeah no I've gotten 'em out\nPeople very happy the we'd main free edition of the show people have been very very positive about that bad enjoy it while it lasts a he'll be back I have a question do you want for being done he's over leader Yasser ...\nHow do I feel about the national is not a pigeon assures at all I thought it was the guts to call you know you don't\nGot you only get hurt you know you save save him for spring training you want ... or a hundred percent integrate ...\nBy the national dog shows you\nWere based boys and there is no punishment see the the the commissioner of baseball Rob Manfred is spineless I Want to find the Philadelphia Phillies last week ten million dollars for what they did it gets the Rockies not even competing in Colorado in the series but as many people have pointed out\nAs someone that follows the Dodgers and the fact that the Dodgers decided TK Hernandez you picture the game in Philadelphia I don't have much of a leg to stand on\nIn that in that department but yeah there has been you're talking about are trying to push for this has to be a thing where people made a big deal about it if you were a team that wasn't in contention and you've got a chance to be the spoiler man you wore that as a badge of honor well that was a big deal right to spoil\nSomeone's party where the\nA day to die and tried to play spoiler but they just suck\nWell at least the giants the pitcher Madison Bumgarner game on friday night and they didn't shut him down for the season 'cause we want to save them for the cactus league at least they pitched it\nBut when they just suck so what do you really there were four games there were four games in baseball on Sunday we say aren't just play the role of a spoiler and if one of these bottom feeder teams in baseball had they been victorious if they won the game or then we don't have\nTo playing games the when the division title me think about those those four games the Dodgers were they weren't fifty\nFifteen and nothing nothing in the second ...\nYeah it was insane what was going on the flipping over I was watching the football but it flipped over the brewers played the tigers they want to live in the nothing so twenty six to nothing and those two\nThere's more no we're not done the Rockies\nRatings five innings gives a firearm\nAnd who would all have already around who are in that game\nEh forget you remind me one that can can you remind me when I Do want to get myself on that you're yeah you don't want to know about it or not is\nThe the final like the outcome of the game is what matters is that the the outcome is what matters yes\nI wasn't program I was younger I'm Talking about your star pitcher choking ... how do you feel either you or how many how you're really great\nI feel that's an defending National League championship team that has added many Machado who's these new contract and he will he will be the MVP of the postseason Mandy Moore I don't really wants to get that that money\nA Walker Beulah the new start the new age to the Dodgers as it is certainly this year there's so many so many positive\nFor the Dodgers and you're trying to be negative because you're angry bill that's what\nYour legs or the night to we don't have time for a number two you know we've\nGot signed for the money don't have time for number two number two number your manager you know your\nManager has to win the world series the keepers job you know he does have satellite\nKicking Hernandez is going to ruin him okay if he doesn't want the world series is going on\nI'll bet you a million dollar whom I bet you're a hundred dollars that he continues on is the Dodgers manage all of the center or who's oh I Know what you're going to say my sources that we're just going to say\nNo no you're right\nYou are so far off she might hit and right and not know it is not Mike soda as part of Dodger lore unfortunately the people who run the\nDodgers now have no sense of that time in Dodger history there outsiders there people from Tampa Bay and Oakland they don't care about that kind of nonsense\nAnd David Roberts is a good soldier he will do what he is told as far as analytics my social does not believe in analytics so there is zero chance but my sense was going to the Dodger manager I Will tell you though so she's got a very good chance of being a Dodger broadcaster\nI can see him on television commenting\nWait a minute ... leaves I could see so she's getting some of the broadcast work but are you all take going\nWe will get now a few minutes away from the inside the advice line on screen radio and I love this payback\nPayback and then a denial of the payback while you're giving back to pay back\nWhile you ... you have so much disdain so much lower thing of another NFL team but you won't admit it you're you're committing an act of retaliation but you will not admit the act of retaliation is taking place I Would give my evidence we

Carrick Fox News the United states Mexico Canada agreement us MCA replaces the Nineteen Ninety four NAFTA packed\nI keep his job and he did actually address Gina's Winston in the second half no one was watching the second half\nThe rating for the second half of that game was zero point zero point zero point zero point zero point zero but no one even the people in the soldier field that stayed were only there to drink beer they were not there to watch the game they had even turn their backs but here's Dirk cutter on gene is Winston coming in and the second half\nTowards the end of that if I told the coaches that do we're going to switch to switch to a gym as a I talked to Jamieson there's both a in a locker room at halftime you know a chance to the gym and some some real football and we put ... in a terrible situation today\nAnd I told him that I told him that right off the bat and\nAnd we put them in a bad situation and\nI mean I knew dreamers would go in and give us that we can and and he did\nYes everything he had Jamieson wants to put up a Seventy four quarterback reading in the second half of that game very impressive the two hundred are buttons on the touched down there for Mr Winston who's back as the starting quarterback in Tampa Bay are so we've established that cutters on the hot seat\nTable was bad in every area and well he certainly has hanging on by a thread the more realistic move here for the buccaneers would be to dump their defensive coordinator Mike Smith\nThat that's the guy you you Mike Smith tossed him to the side you've got to buy a week\nYou you make Smith your fall guy human sacrifice for the third rate defensive performance by Tampa Bay the Chicago Bears could have scores that said Seventy plus points if that had been their motivation if that had been their\nGoal they would have scored Seventy plus points so you look at what Tampa Bay is done in the office all those points that the officers put up but Tampa Bay here we are they paused they've got the by week coming up\nThe Tampa Bay buccaneers defense has given up forty points Twenty one points thirty points in forty eight points in four weeks those are the point titles they've allowed the good game was Twenty one but that was only against Philadelphia and that was Nick Boles the backup quarterback\nIt was just horrific\nIs what it is so I'm going to get rid of somebody if you're not going to get rid of cutter you get rid of Mike Smith me defensive coordinator right now every team in the NFL is mopping the floor with the buccaneers the effects is what they're doing that all the final word he's the buccaneers will now go back to the gym is one soon as I say\nAnd we await the other shoe to drop he can be bullied are rated\nAfter the by week against Atlanta that game was at a the falcons home stadium there\nThe Mercedes Benz with whatever's super them wherever they call that now the new stadium in Atlanta so\nWinston is back after the ...\nAnd he's going to be the quarterback outside of injured reserve it's famous ... Winston and his opportunity and it doesn't really matter at this point because you got this the schedule after the by week Atlanta Cleveland Cincinnati in Carolina so bunch of divisional games mixed in\nThe buccaneers are going to be circling the drain those two wins at the start of the year we're nice\nBack to reality bill for Tampa Bay we are back the Edmund Dallas\nTwo days [noise] Garcia [noise]\nQuickly the fits magic disappeared\nIt's tragic fits go horrible yeah a lot of people are asking for more Steeler talk because they like they actually want me to talk more about the ravens because they like it's so uncomfortable for you to talk about the Steelers eddy\nThey want me to get back to that you saw them with the people wanted it doesn't bother me one bit your opinion of the Pittsburgh Steelers performance city against the\nUh the the vision opponent there the regional rivalry with both of your thoughts as\nA first of all I ... this is happening every game so far this year the off too horrific starts they can't start a game not for word damn not I don't know what the gun and\nThey actually offensively were much better in the first half as opposed to the\nOut but I Would that still fell behind fourteen to nothing though I'm Talking about you know on the scoreboard getting harder to recruit fair to the\nFifty yards they had passing the second half\nThat was actually good well that's not single hell of a lot I mean they they did come back to tied the game you thought was getting at that point it's going to be a battlefield goals which isn't good because\nBaltimore's got the best kicker in the league but I was there was a obviously very disappointing uh you know I Know the difference is bad but you would hope that as they've done over the last few years most of the time out score of the teams\nClearly they misled the bill more than we all want to admit a Steeler fans but it's obviously the how many tackles ... ... ... ... there's no doubt he would help to often they score no point to the second half that they they can't win scoring ... points and a half the fence\nOkay but then the defense allowed and when we talk about the drives the the ravens had these long methodical drives ten plus plays the three drives and the second half and the Steelers deepest just allowed that to happen how's living on bill ... help that\nDoesn't help that but he helps the audience obviously that like I said they haven't had a good defense for a while it's been out scoring opponents and then getting teams it predictable passing situations and then having those blitz is and getting facts get to get to the court\nAbout ready to see a lot of blitz and you see a lot of listening for the you know I just I sat down in the first hour they were doing the same thing every time and it wasn't working and they just kept doing the same ...\nThe word is underwhelming is that the proper word I think underwhelming will be the\n... would you like to change I Know I like good advice I can push back against that much okay good yeah I mean if you're living on ...\n[noise] he wants to back I have to know you wanted a major injury I don't want it back really but they totally missed it I mean so desperate times call for desperate measures that in your this\nDisorder is ... ... if he does come back which isn't going to win so once a week a loving yeah he's got a deadline these days even going to really another month is he going to play hard it's going to\nJames Harrison yes I Know you should just come back\nPractice and and and after what happened or what yeah after what happened to Thomas I'm sure he's even more motivated not to come back or even play hard so I I mean ... ... the way things are going right now it's not going to matter if he comes back in place\nSo is this not non playoff team that you read and I say they don't you think that's the obvious call I mean but only after when these next two if they if I thought they they they won this game last night that they would be ... but the\nThing about it there one in four one foreign one at the by doesn't someone get fired not maybe not Tom I don't think Tom and gets fired but so one of the coordinators gets whacked\nYou flip a coin on which one they both neither one of them look very good I guess you'd have to go with with butler but if it's a recording\nYeah 'cause they just changed the often supported me I think that's going to help I don't know but it or you know the peace some people say oh try where you were not happy were not happy well trust me they're not happy in Pittsburgh right now that's obvious but what about them raiders huh a staff\nAre given a gift [noise]\nIf John grew doing that if John gluten at any balls you'd say I don't want that when I Want to win straight up I don't want to be given a windy ones bears square big Ben bears NFL Replay official gets a game ball from John grew he\nDoes so that would be that would be something to go along with ...\nYeah yeah it was said heard grants and every player gets a gay boy yes in one of the New York\nWhoever the replay official was where to go it's ridiculous you know deep down yeah this is what a deep dark place the raiders or in Roberta that you are enjoying a wing on a gift on a gift from the replay I don't know what you're talking about men they overturned the call and it was the right call
