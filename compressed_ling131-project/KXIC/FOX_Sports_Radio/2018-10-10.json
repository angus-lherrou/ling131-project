{"month": "10", "state": "IA", "station": "KXIC", "content": "On the series won the series now you could say this was full of twists and turns Red Sox win game one Yankees take game to put the pressure on the red Sox Red Sox scored sixteen runs that was it okay or game for when\nPeers makes us play maybe it's a game ending played a series any place a turning point\nMan he's going to get a bunch of autograph so when the world series it twenty five bucks a pop for the rest of his life but even that I didn't want to drive for his name was only five for the ... ... and that's it stretch the stretch it will be the stretch that said that will be if they win the world series it will be known as the stretch and they'll sign those pictures for the rest of his\nBody that'll be the Halloween costume what are you doing up here like I may just right and\nWhat the hell's that guy on the ... ... years if you want to look at what the turning point of this series\nWas it really was game on Chris Sale is on the\nMound and it's a game where if you're the Yankees are we're not expecting to win but we're hopeful that we can keep the game clothes gets sail out of the game and we can maybe win against the red Sox really bad bullpen\nSales pitch as well but they get them out of the game and the red Sox take a big lead\nBut the Yankees claw back and that six and seven inning\nWhen the Yankees loaded the bases six sitting there load the bases with two outs and for some reason laboratories is swinging wildly pitches after the last two Red Sox pitchers walk the last two Yankee batters he gave up that back to the red Sox in the sixth inning\nAnd then the seventh inning the Yankees have bases loaded and nobody out and they turned it into all of one Ron oh by the way Stan struck out the editing too so you have those chaotic as I said to a theme building here it's not a stand thing it's just that was the turning point\nWhere the Yankees had a chance to topple the red Sox in a Christian Bale game\nAnd seize control warning game one in Fenway and now we're gonna kick your ass that's what they could have done but those two innings bases loaded back to back and you get one run out of it the ... the second time we have nobody out that was that allowed the red Sox to regal off the hook\nSale wins the red Sox game one they lose game to no big deal you own a Yankee Stadium blow 'em out in game three they have enough to win a game for that was the game that could have gone either with a series could've gone either way at that point and the Yankees couldn't when the red Sox escape that was the turning\nPulling as we talked about what John John Palmer owes you a little bit earlier that the fact that over the course of twenty Eighteen we've made a lot of jokes a and a lot of derisive commentary about three outcome major league baseball world\nAnd as you point out in that game one situation it's situational hitting\nGet them on get 'em over get them it didn't take what where where the ball instead of trying to drive it and and take each pitch out of the park\nAbout you know base hit still count it they're still part of a baseball teams that are a fishing in doing it but you saw always swinging for the beginning getting under balls pop out lazy fly balls you saw that time and again instead of trying to just work\nAt batch work counts you you saw in in that game yet uncharacteristically you've got to walk shot a sale and\nEach of the next three relievers walked batters start giving you opportunities with Reuters on move 'em over make things happen instead you you're not you're getting one Ron and ending innings because you're trying to look for that big hit those came over the course of the season again\nPlayoff baseball bit differently each one of those runs you're able to eke out is the difference will get the red Sox tonight thrill lead you get the solo homerun that makes it for nothing that's what makes it stand up\nAfter the furious comeback in the ninth inning but you you look at the the Yankees that was the story of their series but encapsulated perfectly in that six seven vetting of game on\nI mean that that was that was it that was a game where the Yankees could have taken control you did and that really was it because they were playing catch up from that moment and\nYou had the opportunity to crawl back in Rikers was terrible\nTwo innings vibrant runs you'd really into all the games that are okay it's out the window for us but what about you know hey we have a window open it just gave me a crack that you could maybe eke out two wrongs there and suddenly it's a five four game instead five three and you're still pushing\nAnd I said not to make it a stand thing because we are going to get to him coming but you realize the two biggest at bats are the series were Stanton batting with nobody out in the bases loaded in game one of the seventh inning and he struck out they try and then he's batting with two on nobody out in the ninth inning after kimbrell is wild any strikes out\nYeah he was that was I mean it's not just the at bat tonight if the other one\nAs well where it's boy those are the two times the Yankees could have really gone from\nWe're losing two were winning or you know keeping that first inning not that he needed to hit a home run but let's say ... it's a single the Yankees gotta run its five three they still have first and second or first and third and they're off to the races that anything because everybody's kind of nervous right keep the pressure on time couldn't put the ...\nWe talked about before the series and there was a great opportunity you got into the bullpen right fail only went fine so you had the opportunity to get up at Penn and didn't\nDo the damage likewise throughout the rest of the series certainly games three and four laid down no ... you had three walks zero home runs what you've counted on all year long Twitter at how about a ...

player to shoot me about one guy they bought stand for three and a lot of money yeah Yankees team was so bad for you to share a\nJohnny Damon Jackie Metsu we a rod I mean these are the guys they bought a jeep Burnett these these they bought a lot of places and then just by what All right they were shouting Larry ... and what buying players does is it buys you contention\nIt won't buy you a championship that's the biggest misconception people as you can buy a championship no you can buy contention you can buy a team is going to win a lot of games maybe make the play offs but every five or seven game series is its own thing and if your guy doesn't hit for four or five games which clearly can happen 'cause that's how baseball goes\nYou can't say that's going to win a championship and ... now the Yankees are thinking I guarantee every Yankee fan is gone now or even sent thirty million dollars a year for the next ten years oh my God this is the world's weekly at church dry every audio theory follows happy given all that money and now it's hey\nWe're given sent thirty million dollars to the next ten years old my God this is gonna be awful because he's already written his

never really failed as much as the Mitchell Report and the situation with the these disappointed Yankee fans\nBut he finally one and a two thousand and all was forgiven hey look Arab won the world series and he played really well during the playoffs right stands gotta hope that happens for him or it's going to be drink Carlos debt and everybody's getting the next word is going to be a curse word out of everybody's mouth 'cause that's where he is right or wrong that's where he is right now that's where the big\nContract leans in it you know your one man there's not a team make you look at his series that he just had right we mentioned or of Eighteen for the series or of the strike out came in that opener\nJust you strike out is vital\nOwe Thirteen it back in the series so he did put the ball and play which is something well out of out of the ordinary for him but putting into why making out but the couple of the bats that really defined the series\nIt if you're looking squarely at him so for those that don't want to go dig deeper and go after and boom you're going to look at the guy with the high price tag in multiple Thomas that's usually the guy who's going to get the most of the origin\nUnless you're a little bit of a drink Carl established here about a month or two of him talking post game follow the Yankees defeat\nGoes where we want to vote\n[laughter] we'll bring out

in the next few days were lots of the guy goes studios were Fifteen minutes can save you Fifteen Percent or more car insurance got a guy go dot com right now find out just how much you can say so\nAlready blame is starting to come out somewhat\nFor who the Yankees really find that fault for this series last year the Boston Red so good you got a point some blame somewhere or we said it was going to be John Carlos than yup Aaron ... oh no backing them down and now angel ... yeah I figured angel Hernandez just because it's name gets people\nClenching up a little bit he's a ban on prior he always winds up getting involved in controversy he's got a you've got an attitude of everybody is here to see me umpire the game and he's had his entire career think about how many of the guys that we knew\nAre still are part most of those guys are gone yeah snow angel Hernandez world it's like wow he's the one guy their ass man stand he empire last night first base and had three of his calls overturned at the Knight nobody was happy with him nobody being the Yankees ... hiring behind the plate as he sees the bath you said\nWho was losing pitcher tonight for the Yankees quote\nHe's absolutely terrible he was terrible behind the plate today he was terrible at first base it's amazing how he's getting jobs and firing\nIn these playoff game record cello who's running for the red Sox I say well cc throw the ball over the plate and maybe angel Hernandez would call strikes for you now see says about you did say no we didn't lose because of this but\nHow he gets assignments he's terrible and this is where I agree with him on\nThey didn't lose the series because of angel Hernandez lost the game last night sixteen to one they lost tonight oh Ben attendee will tell you how did I strike out in the eighth inning with bases loaded that was a horrible cause the bad pitch it was a bad pitch and yet that could have been in that that that's one of the game and the Yankees have no chance on it\nBut the bottom line is I don't see how he continues to get postseason assignments you can't just fired the guy because you have bad on piracy NFL as bad referees you have bad on piracy but\nYou can have guys like this getting assignments like he does because he has all this controversy surrounding him because he does make mistakes he's got an incredibly\nElitist attitude that he is not shy with imparting on the other players he's a bad headlines for major league baseball\nHow he deserves and continues to get these assignments is beyond me if he gets another one\nThe ... he's suing the beef or discrimination because you always not getting the assignments he's been a battle buyer for years he's been the worst umpire for you you look and see what never a dull Hernandez is running and I go and it happens about six times a year ago he just really screw something up or through somebody out of the game for a reason that that it didn't really matter\nThis guy should not be working in the postseason I Would do with the major league baseball oh her net is going to bond\nThe plate I'm suing you for the world series that's what I Would do if I were the Dodgers brewers Red Sox restaurants\nYou normally you make in media the sizzle reel of good things\nThings you want to point out whether it's you know you're applying for a job in in you know eat different sports media or what have you or your your building some kind of profile your judge graphics designer whenever she doesn't really ... and all the calls he messed up\nAnd and you're limited by time\nAs to how many of them you can incorporate he's like oh here's where one for the last month\nAnd then you add another one it uses the super cut for the full season because it keeps going that's your argument in counter to anything that he's bringing against you is that time and again\nTo be more of a manager tonight he needed to look and say well with five right handed batters coming up ... loaded the base in the first inning and he had better teddy in the third I got to make sure I'm ready to go get him if he starts giving up its end he did it didn't have anybody up in the ...\nI mean that's ... you can't be a major league baseball manager and not bad it's that way\nBut here's something that Aaron Boone set following the game tonight that really just makes me scratching my head and go ... is he really understand what it means to be a manager go ahead\nYou know we've been through a lot this year [noise] um\nBut the one thing I'm most proud of what these guys is is they always compete\nAnd you know the\nArea that I think is a great example of that I mean if you fall behind owing to dance that guy layoffs and tough pitches battle battle and just miss winning the game\nUm it was a great at that\nUm but just proud of the way they competed\nI'm just really sucks came up short\nOur number one he's talking about Garry Sanchez that that in the ninth inning when she came back from oh to to sacrifice fly but you heard him in the beginning there and say we've been through a lot this year the Yankees have been through a lot what have they been through they won a hundred games they're run differential was plus a hundred and eighty two\nThey let the league and home run wild and let a new regulars they set a record for home runs in the season the only controversy they had was the one game that Gary Sanchez didn't run stuff out or try as hard as you could against Tampa Bay and what did they do they put 'em on the deal for two and a half weeks\nThey didn't go through anything you say you went through stuff this year you went through this\nYear I guess the ... the only thing you can say is you miss judge for a while so you would have had more home runs yeah but you know what a hundred and all those home runs you beat up on the the sad sack sent the bottom of your division and obviously everybody beat up on the central at least the bottom half of the central right the royals and\nWhite Sox gave up a lot of victories or to those teams along the way and but we all know the troubles at the Baltimore Orioles but\nCertainly a and I'm not really seeing anything in terms of troubles here you didn't really have other than judges injury and Sanchez being limited to eighty nine games and having some struggles at the plate\nFor a while you still wasn't Eighteen home run guy on the year but otherwise you you didn't really lose your\nRotation right those guys don't pitch they weren't good in a lot of cases but they still took the mound every fifth day so it's not like you were losing guys left and right and having to shut\nUp and deal I mean yeah we we went to high today role with a lot of home runs a lot of\nGuys just quietly slowly circling the bases you went through nothing and you hear him talk and not that it's that big a deal not that it's the one thing but you hear him talk after the game you heard of say a a statement from him right there and you hear Alex Cora talk\nAnd clearly corps the guy who sounds more managerial and he and he always had not just because they want but more short himself more understanding of the strategy more realizing what to say what not he just comes across as warm ... an hour and Bush still comes across the guy oh hey you know I Want a contest to be the Yankee manager and\nSo I'm a dress code on now don't draw while like you're talking any you know drunk [laughter] wow [laughter]\nYou gotta Franklin jealousy thing going on here look look how do you think David Fisk still got to be coach all I'm not a lot of it that's that's that's Aaron Boone while he just seemed like he he was grasping he sounded like a player and this is the guy who was on TV for a long time you sounded like a player that you're you're the manager now you have to do things and make\nDecisions and if you think you didn't go you went through stuff this year well next year when things are going to go your way because that's not how it\nWorks in sport well you also have a fall off season now in New York watching as the red Sox advance [noise]\nAnd we're all a mess higher Joe Jr already their new GM\nWar I'm looking at how cake

I went to high school in ... in Miami and all that so he could have could have really done well playing for a school which is in the area and then he had to go off the Michigan\nShe again\nTo go play college football he ended up playing at Central Michigan\nWell one of the reasons that he did not end up going to Florida International he was expelled and I'll listen to these details carefully he was expelled because of an altercation with a security guard\n... interesting\nInterest it sounds like deja vu to me and I'm not talking about the the the ballet there that's a that sounds really a brown appears to have a very short fuse\nAnd that could be why he's so good but he came unglued if you believe these lawsuits which often or a version of the truth\nBut not the whole truth remember the key thing if you've ever studied the law when it comes to lawsuits there's the version of the the litigating party the one that are pressing the lawsuit usually can hyped up there's that version there's Antonio Brown's version\nWhich is to everything and then there's the truth right so somewhere in the middle there's three sides of the story there's the side of the people suing there's a side of the people saying I didn't do it and then the truth is somewhere in the middle that's usually how that happens now the party shot on his Antonio Brown has plenty of cash this is not anything to worry about he can write a check and\nAnd you can make this all go away can have it vanish\nRight but you wonder how many other of these situations have popped up other other skirmishes that have gone so far unreported and we know that he is a target as a person of interest because of how much money has right now he's got a bull's eye on his back each year\nAnd this is this that I like to bring this up with their losses\nEvery year there were approximately eighty thousand people that take the bar exam to become lawyers\nAnd out of those eighty thousand roughly sixty thousand of them passed the bar and become lawyers so that means every year we get sixty thousand more lawyers in just in the United states sixty thousand more lawyers\nAre now not all of them practice law some people just pass the bar exam they take the bar exam just to say we did it you know then they don't actually plan to open a practice\nBut a lot of them do and there's not enough cases out there so when you get somebody like Antonio Brown has got a lot of money that is seen as an ATM machine it's just like forty may weather looks at the\nPublic when he wants to fight may pack yeah again he's like I Need some cash let me go to my ATM machine I'm going to have another ... a sham fight and I'll get people to pay for\nAnd people will pay for it so anyway I ... the one lawsuit it's got some legs you the the one with the the person that was the the tainted through another ten at the the landlord\nThat's got some Jews too because there's physical evidence there is a contract that you could say was violated the other one smells like a rich I\nAte it sounds like the grand puzzle hey I this was traumatic for me and I'm going to try to get some money 'cause a lot of two year olds have problems sleeping how do you know the two year old has problems sleeping because of this and not because of something else but how do you know how you are more important how can you prove that\nYou're going to bring in a bunch of psychologists and all that and go through the whole thing\nWe say hello to Edmund Dallas\nEunice Antonio Brown fan Garcia\nI'm a big fan of his uh on the field work not so much of his office here or have you ever throw\nAnything off a building\nOr I've thrown something onto a building but never never hurting off of a building now\nWell over\n...\nOn on air it it would you like to have it come to Jesus moment like we were in high school were idiots we jump off of the roof into the\nPool and maybe there could have been something thrown into the who may be but now\nWhen I was a kid or David Letterman used to have this Oh yes and he would throws random stuff off the top of a building our school it was last night it was you always wonder like what you're going to look like when it hits the ground\nAnd ... and ... it often would would disappoint but sometimes it wouldn't you throw like a terrible lord of the U.S you know seven story building just to see what happened it was off\nSo I might or might not have thrown some water balloons and things like that just to see what happened off the side of it [laughter] but but never never more than like two or three stores I never went more than\nThat 'cause I didn't have access to anything you know I had access I probably would have done it but yeah\nThey're talking about this kid having you know emotional distress yet one do you what like how old were you when you recall like your first memory\nAsking a question we've have talked to was I I I think the first thing I vaguely remember I was like five years old\nYeah me too yeah the running to harden yeah everything else you know my parents could have beat my ass every day and I'm sure they did and they probably did I deserved\nIt yes but the yeah the the first member happens about five years old is yeah\nSo you're saying the two year old probably not going to get a lot of emotional stress out of the new psychology is that everything that\nHappens you get to see it out of you late already really so they they say that\nI've read that on the Internet\nThrough this guy's going to lose a job you know and when he and his thirties would be like a dam Ottoman\nYes Rio ... thrown the autumn Antonio Rob\nWasn't talking about thirty so this guy will be thirty two Antonio around sixty two and he'll be suing Antonio Brown because it's something that happened to his two years old he'll soon again\nLike I my life is I'm a failure because if you are how dare you Antonio Brown ... that's right\nOh yeah yeah yeah that's been our show on Fox it's great part I'm telling you\nTo the phones we go and let's go to Seattle we have this kind of wild Brent in Seattle hallowed brands\nFilling in for soft him on the other thing\nI I don't want to hold on to say\nOnly once have I done the buildings just off the mile mile or more a one time it was ...\nDown there all along co going up and\nDown I think someone would probably\nBe him yeah how about the manager and extension when nine one one eighty nine games for the first half the rays had a great second half the service cashed extensions\nThought [noise] I Know I mean [noise]\nI mean it was part I didn't ... I mean I I we don't talk about the Tampa Bay rays we don't but but thank you hope everything's going well for you and heard from in a while you're later so thank\nTo update you with the way that he will of course the big story comes from baseball where it was game for the American league division series\nThey must win game for the Yankees at home to take it on their bitter rivals the red Sox were looking to advance to the American league championship series Boston at a fourth one leading the night to any of the things that are interesting New York sports wise than at runners at first and second with ... out to play\nFor aside house races up runners offers the second one too swung on tap found her slowly here has\nSeries against the Yankees however [noise] hair on my challenge this call\nWBAI Red Sox radio network with the caller yes it was reviewed the call was upheld the out was recorded and the red Sox game the four three victory report cello earns doing Chris Kimball the said and sees he's about to last Boston was a series three games to one and they will host Houston and the American league championship series\nStarting on Saturday a couple of those from the NFL Jacksonville Jaguars aren't bridge already backed Charles do a one year deal and wash the Redskins veteran running back Adrian Peterson suffered it just showed her one night but we'll play and the team's next gaming it's Carolina this report raunchy my true car online car shopping can be confusing not anymore with troop arise from drew current now you can do the exact price you pay for your next car\nSo it was a true ... more confidence car buying experience that you said earlier that you like to put your\nLawyer hat on and maybe you can kind of a decide for this to give us your thoughts did you see\nAnd this is all stemming from of course Reggie Bush having his Heisman Trophy strip way back when for violating rules now if you recall I Know you do because you're here in Southern California USC assistant taught in the mirror ... ended up being fired over that\nAnd he was hit with a show cause penalty that banned him from coaching for a year and McNair claim that that ended his major college go to Chris so he filed a lawsuit\nI can see it's got to lay it all these years later they're finally getting around the ruling on busy superior court judge here in Los Angeles up held the show cause a ruling that says that it violates California law\nThe result is that California schools\nThat play a major college football now have concerns they may not be able to be a part of the NC double a because they no longer meet the requirements of membership the NCW released a statement saying it disagreed with the court's ruling and we'll explore all avenues for relief to attribute to board member schools in California\nCan continue to abide by the same rules as the rest of it and see them all his membership\nOr this or is this the only thing they can do I guess they'll they'll can the appeal even more can they go all the way up\nI guess I guess you could always you ... have lost their first appeal buddy I mean I find it hard to believe that a U.S to UCLA Stanford and cow we're going to be kicked out of the pack twelve because of this ruling by a LA superior court judge I mean it looks like but I'm way around it is\nYou know I'm not the biggest fan of the NCAA as you know now I'm not I'm not either so I I I kinda like this because it upsets them I liked it this upsets them\nUh and they're essentially the judge this how I interpret the judge essentially said you have a cartel and uh you you can't just block someone from working in that cartel right there that they have control over everything and my reading this right I think I'm reading this right\nUh yeah it's actually a if this if if another institution wants to hire this person that's their business you can't ban him from a profession yeah it's like if\nYou get fired from domino's because your bed at making peace was but you want to go work at Pizza Hut you can go work at Pizza Hut correct but in this case you can't if you get fired from USC they're saying you can't work at any other school at all for a ... yeah\nHave you seen in those terms you probably like I got a point there\nDo you think do we think he cheated probably so right I mean you ... the Reggie Bush deal and all that\nWell I always thought it was a raw deal for us see because it's okay to coach found out about it but he was involved in it he just didn't buy disclosed their all revolves around but I mean does not seem like in the grand scheme of what goes on in college sports to be a speeding ticket\nTalked about Jim ghetto the other a trial which is going on which the NCAA says they're closely monitoring in a federal courtroom in Manhattan I've been keeping an eye on that also he seems like he's got a pretty good case the guy that was the Adidas executive who essentially said everyone\nIs is doing it and he didn't violate the law because everyone knew it was going on\nSo if the if he wins wow he's got a chance you got a pretty good chance\nAnd it's all about integrity any standard and integrity college athletics clearly a very important not them out of the show on Fox with company from the guy go Fox Sports radio studios were Fifteen minutes could save you Fifteen Percent or more\nOn your car insurance just visit Geico dot com\n[noise] who is that surely any free\nQuote so this is one hits close to home one of the signature moves of the NFL offseason the Los Angeles ... made a trade with Kansas City to get Marcus Peters now the ...\nUsing this was universally celebrated is not because markets Peters was he noted hot head it's not because of that this was universally celebrated because markets Peters had the reputation\nOf being one of the premier defensive backs and the national football the he was young at the time you're still young\nAnd the assumption was my God what a great thing this is how you're getting a player who's not even really in the prime of his football career and you're getting him just for some draft picks what could possibly be wrong with that well here we are five weeks into the NFL season\nThere are and I went this right here on them I Want to get it wrong there are a hundred and eleven quarterbacks that had been raided by pro football focus\nThe nerds and the geeks over pro football folks they keep track of the stuff out of the one hundred and eleven quarterbacks that have played enough to qualify where do you think Marcus Peters is\nYou got your answer All right\nAh no he's not last no no it's not a hundred and eleven or no is the first but I wouldn't be doing this store if he was first I mean for you but maybe I Would but it's now he's not number one markets Peters out of a hundred and eleven qualified quarterback so National Football league is ranked a hundred and six\nThere are only there are only five\nDefensive backs in the entire NFL that have been worse at their job than mark is Peter's\nAway from it\nSo if you're the Broncos who ever markets Peters is matched up against on a chilly Denver evening or afternoon rather just throw the ball markets Peters was what I'm saying I was just about to say you listening van still yeah well see the problem is the Broncos could do that in in ... can't get the ball to receive a see that's the problem\nIs number two in the last\nSeven passes\nMop off duty for the falcons\nAnd none of them have been intercepted so breezes number one shop number two and we're number one\nWas that [laughter] how about that is one thing that gets grill and we bring in\nThe coup do the [noise] benefit letting the or the bucks dropped nearly fifty on them to start to season and then almost losing the browns the next week after that the concern for the things was approaching panic levels however there now foreign one and just routed the Redskins and an all around great showing the better the since the rams biggest concerning NFC uh\nNo I Will give that a thumbs down these saint's or not\nI'm gonna shock you with my aunt\nThe answer is a team the rams have already beat\nThat's the answer I I'll tell you what hey\nEven though the rams took apart the Minnesota defense and\nIt was a demoralizing performance were Minnesota the calcium I have more faith in Mike Zimmer\nTo fix the Viking divas river it doesn't matter how you are now it matters how you are at the end of the year the Vikings have enough officers with her cousin [noise]\nThey have the nuts and bolts of a good defense they can fine tune it you look at that division Green Bay is not very good Chicago I don't buy\nA Detroit come on that's a division that the Vikings we could come back up that can win that division getting the plus you're gonna have to play well on the road and be New Orleans traditionally\nHas not been relevant on the road so we're assuming the rams are gonna have home field advantage Drew Brees\nHas essentially been like a baseball player that plays his home games in Colorado\nVery good at home not so good on the road in fact the numbers back that up Drew Brees in his career he's eighty and forty eight at home\nHe's only five games above five hundred on the road and he's touched down percentage goes down by almost thirty percent on the road so I'll take the Vikings rebounding as opposed to the same max\nThat as being reported that went levy on bell returns to the Steelers and a couple of weeks that they could go with a running back by committee approach a number of the players on the Steelers seem to think that it was a good idea do you\nKnow it's a terrible like I said I necessary I Do the reason the students are having problems this year is not because they don't have Libyan bell or James Connors actually statistically been fine the defense in Pittsburgh the ... the Steelers don't need to also this is a very important they don't need to worry about let me on bell next season [noise]\nHe's gone he's going to leave\nThis is the final year however many games he plays so why you're saving you write what what are you saving him for he's already miss\nHowever many games or by the time it gets back over seven weeks of the season when you're trying to keep 'em fresh so he goes in science who the Texans are the browns or somebody next year what's up with that\nAnd number two and maybe I'm I'm incorrect on this but I Believe that it's a random thing when you're the running back and you get better the more cherries you get and so both guys would be hurt by that is a terrible idea to split cares next\nThat we're discussing Patrick my home to the weekend Tom Brady pointed out how the NFL game is very different today than it was back when he was the second year player on the rise saying that pro football now is sort of a glorified college ball [noise] and he didn't bring it was actually taking a shot at and homes\nNuts he what he's doing is taking a shot at Roger Goodell is what he's still he's taking a shot at Dell the commission right the NFL has evolved into a heavy heavy handed past\nFirst passed second task third they've essentially neutered\nDefensive backs in line backers and see Tom Brady when he got in the NFL in the early to thousands he remembers with the NFL used to be like he's crossed over he's he started and Twenty one when he ... which took over as the quarterback in New England he's witnessed the transition\nAnd so he's taking potshots\n... when he first became a thing in the NFL drew a when when you place but so I looked it up there were twenty four the number twenty four [noise] there were seven quarterback for that twenty four and more passing touchdown [noise]\nNow I think the numbers like fourteen real

Callahan Fox News lunchtime today or shortly afterwards hurricane Michael expected to make landfall as a category for hurricane near Panama City Florida\nWashington was so pathetic on defense you wonder if they were on the take\nHey you want like Drew Brees it was his night on Monday but did they pull Utah Jazz we said this right after the game they were playing and a half speed there were three incomplete passes Drew Brees had three incomplete passes\nIn in that game now\nI Would argue that have very strong well put together effective air conditioning system at the dome in the by you would have caused more problems than any defensive player for the Redskins\nThat if they had just cranked up the air conditioning at the dome in ... that would have caused more heartache\nFor perjury if there'd been a breeze ironically enough coming from the air conditioning would've missed a month or so is that [noise]\nBut anyway I I get it it was going to be an uphill battle anyway for the Redskins but Michael Thomas de coy that makes the Facebook even worse that makes it ... or the or the rescuers look even worse than it saves look good to hear\nMy God my last point now\nThis this back and forth which was Josh Norman in Michael Thomas ... the Redskins defenders decided that they were going to pile on Michael Thomas ... on social media and after the game\nAnd when they had a chance to gang tackle anyone wearing a saint uniform this past week they were like a Buddhist monk they took a vow of silence they didn't want to do it and it looked like Jay grew in had passed out tranquilizers\nTo the defense the way they are and also Alex Smith and the ... ... it was either that or or like you know next month is what can go next month's Thanksgiving\nGeo next month is Thanksgiving and and when you eat those leftover turkey sandwiches and all that you get that trip the fan and then you get all sleeping in ... it's like the Redskins ate too much turkey and head trip the fan and he couldn't play\nBut the Josh Norman see the other thing which is great Josh Norman talked about a cloud chasing are you talking about cloud chasing\nWhen I think of ...

I always city by heart radio\nStation Alexa plane Hubbard chaos I see what I heard radio towers from a category for impacts fungi\nCallahan Fox News\nYou're talking about major destruction of property\nOr again Michael region category for status overnight with wins that one hundred thirty miles an hour and a Thirteen foot storm surge forecast\nThere is a line that has been drawn and that is the line that's the cutoff prior to that\nAnd after that\nTotally different quarterback the first twenty four games the first twenty four games of Prescott in Dallas he had thirty nine touchdowns in eight interceptions had a quarterback reading of over a hundred\nHis first stretch against his first twenty four games he was an elite quarterback was wonderful right is great\nAnd then something changed\nLike a snap a finger a couple of fingers their week nine of the twenty Seventeen season\nJak Prescott that glass slipper cracked and broke a broken into a million different pieces over the past Thirteen games since week nine of twenty Seventeen season that Prescott has eleven touchdowns Thirteen interceptions\nAny quarterback rating of Seventy six point eight\nIs this quarterback really eat is a horror show watching this guy attempt to matriculate the ball down the field\nBut Jerry Jones continues to be in love with listened to Jerry Jones talk about that press got it's kind of like you want your mom or dad to talk about you listen to Jerry\nHere and he mentioned that Jerry Jones talking about that Prescott where he is an jak\nWho grew up some things that clip of some of the other day [noise] uh\nUh I'm firmly in a corner that\nWe've got quarterback that we can build where have you come back Scott like almost like about it\nYou just don't look at the numbers just try to avoid numbers you can avoid that he's gone almost a full\nSeason with ... more interceptions than touchdowns any quarterback reading of Seventy six point eight and Jerry Jones said make no doubt about it I always got to say that\nRight he's got to say that that's part of the job rise but Gerry typically goes off the script he's been known to go off script from time to time\nOver the years with the cowboys how 'bout them cowboys right and here's Jerry I think he's doing a comparison maybe not even ... Tony Romo his name came up let's listen I'm not heard this let's listen to Jerry Jones here and he talked about his past with Tony Romo we'll see how that ties into that Prescott\nI cough close the times are bad or have been on for the call ... ... who could warning or can we fight on Sunday because we'll go to Ron I'm so ... it's going to go get a cough which which one is for school if\nThey're going to always be a lot of ... and ... it's called the vet gets the motorcycle head coach of quarterback\nThat the problem Jerry is that Tony Romo was good jak Prescott was good for twenty four games and has been bad for Thirteen Years\nAnd I don't recall and we can go to the numbers if you want to go to the numbers when you go to the numbers I don't ever recall a Thirteen games stretch in Tony Romo his career where he put up eleven touchdowns and Thirteen interceptions\nWe walk in and maybe it happened maybe somewhere along the way maybe somewhere along the way that happened I don't recall it happening\nI only had ever happened was that bad for an extended we can go to the database and look it up and we have we have access to that but I don't recall it happening and Tony Romo\nIn the history of the NFL if you if you look at his numbers he had a higher pass or reading Steve Young Peyton Manning go down the list Kurt Warner hall of famer hall of famer hall of famer Joe Montana\nSo it's I'm pretty confident in Rome or did not have a stretch of Thirteen games as bad as the Prescott high has had recently\nAre not just to continue on the numbers don't tell the whole store they told most of the story they don't tell the whole story professional sports or about adjustments right anything in life is about adjustments if you're not doing something\nWell you need to do it better you need to figure out how to do it better whether you're in an NFL player or you're you're you're a construction worker and you're you're you're making better whatever you're doing picking up trash if you're not good at it you have to get better at\nDefenses figured out the weak points intact Prescott and he has been unable to correct the issue is not for lack of effort\nBut this is the new norm one or two games you say I that's an outline that's a that's a hiccup but Thirteen straight games playing like a bomb that's more than a hiccup\nThat's a slow motion train wreck is what that is washing Prescott play quarterback [noise]\n\nHe's twenty eighth and completion percentage which isn't the end all be all but considering his nickname three D. debt jak dink dunk jak right the three of these\nUh that's alarming because the cowboys don't throw the ball down the field very much in the press got twenty fourth in the NFL in passing yards he's tied for twenty fourth\nIn touchdowns it's not good\nAnd you heard final point you're Jerry Jones there he's got he's got the ultimate quagmire because he likes the guy he wants to stand biased quarterback\nBut slowly we're moving towards a moment of truth for the cowboys and there's this debate some believe that Jerry Jones is going to say who cares this is my guy I'm going to give them a hundred million dollar contract\nThere's some of the media to believe that that he's going to get a hundred million dollars in debt Prescott my theory is outside of that Prescott having a reversal of fortune the cowboy bras is going to have an intervention with Jerry Jones and they're going to say Jerry you can't do\nYou like him but you can't do it he's playing like Thai rod Taylor or to rod Taylor did back in Buffalo you can't give that guy and extension you get rid of that Alex Smith\nCJ best third I didn't even know where that is more reliable than ...\nSo my my plan on this is outside again of Prescott having a major reversal of fortune which is highly unlikely the cowboys will say who's got next let's start window shopping\nAnd who can they get likely a veteran who would they go out and get who they turned I got a couple of names even ions remember I told you first this is after the season so we got a long way to go\nFill up rivers about that the chargers on a terrible team but\nThey likely are going to fall by the side of the road before the season ends and the chance that they drafted quarterback and Philippe rivers and go over to the cowboys and finished his career in a high profile situation and try to get some more toothpaste outta too how about this one\nDerek car that\nCars not exactly right in the world on fire John ... not happy with the new grilled later the raiders could say goodbye here's another option for Dallas Jamie miss Winston\nSee that [noise]\nSay Tampa Bay is often skits muddle up now that when students back it'd be taking over as the starter against the land of this weekend things don't go well\nSee once that ending up in Dallas and then everyone's favorite stop getting you know everyone's favorite stop you if there's two guys that come up here if you need a ban dated the quarterback position they're two names one of them is ... ... that's the and then writing fitzpatrick and there you go\nThat's the list those are the options\nIn the wild card will be someone like Andrew Luck but that's a wildcard we say hello to Edmund Dallas steamboat\nSARS the uh\nYou started off talking about a Troy Aikman where his comments on radio yes that was ... I assume you mean because he's a former cowboy you can't criticize current cowboys\nPart of the fraternal fraternal order of former players really yes okay you're not supposed to do it that's why most athletes are terrible on radio and television\nBecause they didn't want to criticize like a dam pleased back on the ... will be network for example he never wants to criticize any baseball players because he worked for the state run in Moby network and all that\nHe's part of the fraternity so he just went up\nBut I mean I could see if it was Tony Romo and there were two guys that he played with in you know on the team or are in the league but Troy Aikman has been out of the league for quite some time I didn't have any uh you know suing the NFL ... that are still planes\nThat works for the NFL you have to be approved when you work at Fox new NFL games the NFL doesn't want your calling games you think if like CBS hired counting cabinet the NFL would approve of that\nProbably not write\nYour Colin Kaepernick it's a pretty different situation than ... a business somebody like that but the\nPoint is the same if you upset the powers that be at the NFL you're out of work\nHabits to destroy your going to upset the people in the NFL if he's critical of jak Prescott ...\nHe could upset someone who's very powerful blamed Jerry Jones will come on you don't need Jerry Jones had any power\nNo I think Jerry Jones as well as plenty of power but I I think that you know he's not going to get upset of Troy Aikman does his job that's his job I\nTotally disagree there's an expectation among people that in the NFL if you're a broadcaster calling games you will not go over the\nBut the most Troy Aikman is not going to be invited to the Dallas Cowboys events because he's critical of jak Prescott\n... it's not Nineteen Ninety two seats are these ... band together to solve nowadays man\nI agree with you I I couldn't believe poor cello came out after sixty five pitches pitches yeah sixty five pitches and they took him out of the game sixty five pitches\nLet's go to Tom who's in Vermont and he is next on Fox Sports radio hello Tom\nAre you doing [noise]\nSo I'm well how can we help you what's going on\nOh well first of all I'd like to say are you guys are a breath of fresh air because our local radio station recently switched from ESPN to you guys and uh it's it's been a pleasant\nWell thank you I appreciate what kind of got you fat or you're able to sample our product to come into our store\nAnd where do you think close if you think then our fun loving ... I don't know about that but I ... the whole uh Fox Sports in general\nI'm a well originally I was going to talk about uh you know sportscasters I'm Talking negatively about players but uh you know

players the vast well already Ninety nine percent or cheerleaders and that's how the ...\nWell I tell you what I'm a patriot as Homer and when I whenever I hear Jim Nance and uh is is is old partner Phil Simms they used to be highly\nThey seemed to me bias against the patriots but a ... you know looked at it as it may but uh yeah kimbrell gave me a heart attack last night um and you know I I Wish
