{"month": "10", "state": "IA", "station": "KXIC", "content": "Giants eagles game that was one of the articles in the New York daily news or another that has been hosted by pat Leonard pull the plug the season's over giants fan and don't and I asked a hostage eagles fan to get a head start on life ...\nSo let's hear from Modell back um junior who tonight or had three things happened to him he was fine to before the game for his comments during ESPN interview that aired on Sunday and what she questioned the heart of the team\nWouldn't say it wasn't Eli Manning's father he couldn't get passes down field\nHe left the field before half time with two seconds left on the clock and the giants off and on the field ... says go get an I. V. wink wink [laughter] and he had bought at a fan on the sidelines during the giants touchdown drive\nAnd electrical fan and he was talking smack at it as well\nDon Quixote is alive and well and living you know do Beck and junior set\nSo let's hear from hotel following the game what he had to say after the giants defeat thirty for Thirteen [laughter]\nEven though I deal with that [laughter] a donkey already and I go to I don't think so anymore ah here's though Dell after the loss of the eagles cross\nI lose\nTurn around\nAnd they keep they keep the [noise] what's going on on the keeping keep going up and there's no way to pull yourself up with the words and keep working out and keep working on it [laughter]\n\nI was pregnant so I was trying to give you an RV because he does have some bridges really like five ten minutes [noise] um [noise] musical exercises going there and get a naive able to come\nA truly don't\n... through the roof of the ... [noise]\n... if there was a man when I was inside the\nSafety over there if I ran across the food is cutting me off ... burger vampire excuses\nHim I said there's oh back um junior saying I Need an IV looks like he was moving okay [noise] off the field before half time as a professional\nAthlete late June machines just not going to show any ill I mean it will it humid there he's like a boxer mhm sunny and say\nLook back um junior didn't cost them to win tonight he\nIs always going to be a lightning rod for criticism and now this is going to be like as you've been reading a little bit of what the back page the New York post New York daily news have out there it's going to be ten days of ... antics what does it mean ten more days of who knows what else is going to do in the next ten days\nAnd how do we get a new quarterback and get rid of Eli Manning and can we get Oregon games on in New York City so we can at least the Herbert everybody\nStay up late now I didn't care about west coast games all these years I was going to have to stay up\nI thought you were a giants fan yeah I don't watch the games anymore I just watch her play on Saturday Night for Oregon because that's going to be our guide\nWell the other thing you miss was rather than keep working harder that'll be out a T shirt tomorrow just keep working harder 'cause you know back and junior said that repeatedly\nI don't know if any other questions came out about his quarterback but certainly the other story that should dominate New York headlines is the clip we played the bachelor like that's\nBigger than a jelly winners that but that's that's my point about the over arching point we've had about oh del throughout the show tonight is that he's going to get that kind of attention he's the he's the lightning rod low hanging fruit right by but he also goes out\nThat he's a star he's a superstar Eli Manning is not a superstar he doesn't go through everybody's got an opinion because oh back um junior is polarizing\nAnd he has to realize that the best thing you can do for the giants is to just not make headlines let the giants figure they're crap out because they've got a lot of crap to figure out and don't be the guy that's always saying okay where am I now I got to stop doing this and go do this before we figure stuff out here but he's not that guy the giants paid him\nThey're going to get good performance on the field they are going to get stuff on the field distracts the giants and and becomes a load of crap\nThey are going to get stuff off the field that's the same thing\nSo the giants do what they did when they sign or do back um junior\nThis is what they signed up for it so now you have no choice but to move on knowing fully well knowing full well\nThat this is how it's going to go no matter what you do with this team even if you are winning you're going to deal with some kind of old held back um junior controversy that is either reporting on unimportant but it doesn't matter whether it's oh del everything's important\nThat you're gonna have to deal with on a regular basis as long as you have in\nThe beauty of it is the these are cosmetic you know as we talked about over the course of the night yeah you you said all the right things there at the ivy\nBy it or don't that seems to be the excuse that we'll see each and every time we'll see if they go for the hat trick the leaves early and another game but you know if they're not going to call out\nYou lie managed to form it's what's so here's the Yemeni broke out all of a scheme that they ran out

Jason lock and for all right Jay tonight I'm going to start with the with the dealers choice [noise] what do you want to hit with first oh hitting the electrical fan out walking off before halftime he lie manning or the giants all kinds of one\n[noise] boy was behind your number for a [laughter] I I\nGuess all the above ... and they're all tied together obviously to one degree or another\nBut this really hasn't been a functional office they had a few plays they strung together a week ago against Carolina that provided some points one of them in a survey gimmicky\nDo\nReally had their best down feel for the entire season unfortunately he was thrown in not catching it they're not a good football team they're not close to being a good football team\nAnd they they may have you know for themselves as to what they thought they were\nAnd it'd be this year but they didn't fall a lot of people around the league and and it starts with the quarterback that let's be real they they pay him big time money\nTo be a big time player and he hasn't been for a long time and we can point to being on a dress here and there and yadda yadda yadda but they they tried to prop him up as much as they could this off season with a running back and left tack on a fortified offensive line\nAnd a commitment to run into football and ... still not very good\nSo what do you go back to that devaluation was it just ... so much we're building statues to him or was it blind loyalty and we got to give you one more rounded see if we can resurrect him ... humorous to a degree I I\nKnow this is an ownership decision um they hired guys who they knew through the process\nWe're willing to go along with with what\nOwnership felt like was the plan of of due process and that did it have to do with football to some degree sure did it have to do with business and sort of where they were as a as as an organization more than anything else yeah they they were not\nComing in this to tear it down and rebuild and do what probably um again to a lot of football people was painfully obvious\nThey wanted to keep it together put a band aid on it we're paying Eli a lot of money yeah we sat him for one week last year for Gino Smith but\nWe made a mistake and when the fans and the media reacted to how we treated Eli we ... we were treated and rallied around him and said our apologies and now you know we got to try to win something next couple of years with this guy\nAnd we want to put some fan is in the seats and we want to contend and compete or at least give the appearance of such\nAnd not start over with the young quarterback and um people who went through that process uh they felt like that was the only really way that that ownership was going and if you didn't want to go that way then there's probably wasn't the job for you\nThe other thing the giants you're gonna have to deal with following this game is over do back in June and you're in the big thing is before half time he walks off early while the giants all fence is still on the field this on the heels of him being fined by the team for his comments an interview a few days ago how do you think the giants deal with this latest chapter in back in ...\nI mean I don't know like\nThey can't get them to catch his marine passes I mean we can talk about it he left\nThe field early two weeks ago they said you know if they told the sideline reporter um he went to an ivy who knows um they\nThey don't have a functional off fence and it's not because of voter back I mean we you know we we he's not the only guy on that team was attacked and in that I'm an object\nOn the sideline [laughter] you know like what\nAre we going to start keeping tabs that like they just watch the game just I mean he's not under intense duress every single for oh I mean there are baseline sort of\nSlants and screens and and you know little we'll routes that\nYou're expected to be able to complete most of the time the rest are not that that stuff's just ... it's a it's an adventure as to whether he's going to hit the guy in stride go look at some of the screen tonight and what it took proto back them just to catch the ball like [laughter]\nI I mean ... whatever like the guys on that team no where the problems lie in that office and between the lines on Sundays\nPeople are worried about oh del they're worried about\nFox Sports radio Jason Smith show with Mike Armageddon even the guy goes studios I'm a hotline when a CBS Sports NFL insider\nExcuse me Jason lock in for a hundred and somebody just locking Bora or as we wind down ... leaders Thursday Night Football game start looking ahead to the weekend we've got to taste the over under sitting at sixty\nFor Kansas City in New England Nobel jak already in postseason mode of saying it feels like we're playing Kansas City\n[laughter] yeah I mean look this may not be the last time we see these two teams face to face each other it kind of reminds me of Jacksonville Kansas City the week for the team that when this one in this circumstance may not be the team that\nWins the same game come January if they do meet again\nAnd going up to ... in a week where you know they they still don't have air berry and now they're down enough of linemen and they're not going to have just in Houston and let's face it the last two weeks it's it's it's still been great for the chiefs but\nIt hasn't been easy street it it's it's been tougher to move the ball teams have taken some things away they've adjusted to that office um I think this is kind of to me lines up where this winning streak goes to die\nDoesn't mean that if they host you know the the patriots in January ... arrowhead that that it's the same outcome but\nI don't love this situation for the chief as things are shaping up right now with the injuries and and you know do they do to devote team score over thirty I mean that that's possible\nUm but I think if if Tom Brady is April ... able to score early in the chiefs have to play from behind a little bit um you know I I don't know I I don't know that that you know they're going to put up thirty five\nEvery single week and I don't love New England defense but this is a big game dollar check stress you them it's a big game and it it tends to bring up the best and the way\nYou can follow him on Twitter add Jason lock in for that had Jason lock in for CBS NFL insider

for\nNothing wrong with the effort to fight they fought hard always even\nAt times you know there there are good front for and we knew going into it that you know you always have to bet that's where that's where their defense is the strongest and at times they did do a good job again so\nI'm sure the cameras could've caught me upset a bunch of times so\nI I don't know what you're referring to but um\nYeah there were many moments just cannot I was upset [noise]\nI'm not concerned about eleven [noise]\nLike I said none of us did anything good enough to win tonight\nWhile they did a good job of staying on the field there weren't a whole lot of big plays a aside from the one we're an again Carson once as a good job off schedule it hit the ball\nA converted on third downs right who were the mine for sixteen on third down so when you're when you're that good on third down and you can stay on the field then you get yourself a chance [noise]\nThey were ... they were cloud known do so and that's why we we did get a couple of big plays away from him\nAnd he did get a starches I realize some of it was at the end but you've got a couple of touches while we were able to do was get the ball Barclay throughout the game was productive\nI just sold a team I told you guys we didn't do anything well enough more to come in the Marlins and work\nOn fixing it I just said I'm not worried about their effort I'm I'm worried that didn't have asked me about effort and then I said\nI wasn't concerned about their effort right they were going in one concerned about their effort I'm concerned about how we executed and how we didn't get in the end zone and how we let them in the end zone again tonight we didn't do anything well enough to when we lost\nWe lost last week to right\nAnd you know it doesn't really matter when you lose you lose ...\nI thought you said I'm All right spider I told you I said that and I pointed to you and you said that and I said that yeah a little testy\nWell it'll set I don't question my teams fight he was ready to throw down there were reporters here let me get mad at you instead of actually answering the questions with any level of honesty DUI manning dismissive\nYeah I'm not worried about him and and I know it you know some people want to defend patch armor and say well this you know in private it's different now I don't know very publicly he said we didn't do anything right\nI'm not worried about what the rest of the team does he lies terrible and they're like can they trust what he says you have to get buy in from players you get your hair that they hear that and they go I I Can't put any stock in what coach says and they tune out and that's the worst thing you get players tuned out you'll need a new job\nThere we go there and you're already made it look to divide was already we're already recognized this was\nBuild it up and we talked to Jason luck and for you and I have talked about this quite a bit I was going back to the pre season build a budget component barge see if you can't get one last run out of ... maybe the eagles have a suitable hang over Dallas had no discernible wide receiver help and then you look at Washington\nThey bring it out like Smith you got a lot of questions you're trying to turn back time with Adrian Peterson you got wide receivers\nThat you don't necessarily trust so in theory if things break right and why he's competing in the defense is marginally\nMarginally what they were put up as advertised that you might be able to win this division instead you're floundering yeah one in five and you're trying to tell a years all the parts where we failed except for that guy is good bart Simpson as the quarterback or that seems to be terrible I mean like I had I Me\nMeanwhile why did oh back um junior had bought an electrical fan this is after he walked off the field before halftime because you know it's all about oh dealt a let's hear him explain why he's gone from a kicking that to to lexical fan\nYeah I was just trying to get myself going for like some of those players right after I was getting myself goal was to some of my best hope so I was just trying to get myself out up if I did that and it it helped me you know there was a lot of things going on that that had me fired open to bring out the energy out on my way around it but but to give us a role\nAnd worked watch out electrical fan he's coming your way again forget about the net\nIt worked it worked for he's going to pounded that against us sometime soon what's he escalates you the next I [noise]\nOh what other

I mean that was a it was a I'm sure eagles fans are hoping that this is now their team getting back on track Carson went to a pretty good although we got lucky I think on a couple of those\nPasses as well or any anything you'd take much out of this if you're an eagles fan are you I mean you like to win obviously but ah not still not ready to say that\nBecause you see them and try you know if the eagles win a game where the other team tries\nInputs effort and then I'll say there's they've got something but the giants they weren't there they checked out before the game started I Wish they would've announced they didn't want to play on Thursday as I Would have bet on the eagles it would've been better for me if that that have been the case but I was his name theme that lost back to back to the titans and the Vikings\nAnd they put a giant team we just didn't they were disinterested they weren't into and and the thing is you're putting you watch the game and I watched it yes oh so you did you say you watched parts and we want to say you watch the whole game\nI watched parts of it it was on it was on ...\nNelson Aguilar a he had eight fifty a yard reception which the way I Would describe but he was like he was feeling a kickoff there was no one\nAround him I just feel it and just hurt and he was like wait a minute I can keep going and going and going on but it was it was like you would see on a Saturday morning at a pee wee football\nThat's that's not that's not a wrong yeah wrong\nIt was a it was stunning funny though dark yeah\nSo he sent his team or he's not worried about the team's effort there ...\nYeah well he said that gives you as a coach you always have to say the efforts there right 'cause that's the agreement what we're not talented enough with the efforts there right every coach ... Ninety nine percent of coaches in my life and I've interviewed a lot of them unfortunately but I just listening to me to interview him just listening and talk they all say oh no no the efforts there at all it's just not it's\nNot a lot yeah because if you got out the execution the effort just yeah\n'cause that's the cardinal sin you'd agree write any of you know sure as a coach that's a fireball fish if your team plays like a bunch of dogs you fire the coach right they can your coach is supposed to motivate and give pep talks and and get the energy out of the players is that's not happening you to file because Bush of her such as a coach Jenny\n... you you can but his press conferences or I waited a month that he they played sixteen yeah he's in a day because he he gets these high had it you can tell you he wants to say more than he actually says to the media like he wanted to explore that salad yeah he's had these little mini things but the lava his building up if you have to go over

were in New York you take all the giants and if you spend all this one was all do it all the hostile\nGoing the other way I'm going to take the browns in this game over the charges couple of reasons why historically\nCase you can blindfold yourself it's just a solid bat to go against the west coast team playing the early game in the eastern time zone traditionally that has been a profitable outcome good bad or ugly no matter how the ... the team is\nThat the charges are also at a disadvantage here because the brands defense\nIs no joke now they're not play off the play offs but they do leave the NFL with Fifteen takeaways through five weeks more than they've had each of the past two seasons they are opportunistic the fans and that is a problem because Philip Rivers is known for touring the ball over so Baker Mayfield so far\nBut I Love Cleveland up front we didn't get the line of scrimmage and if they do that if they man and all the charges office of wind the way I Believe they will up front they will enforce Philip Rivers into making poor decisions and that will lead to turn it over so I have a small lean on the brownies Cleveland [noise]\nTwenty seven the chargers

I said now\nThere's value here with the Redskins so I Am going to take the Washington Redskins the Panthers half\nTo jumpstart their deep passed and we talked about this the other day there is no de passing game what is the weakness of the Redskins well everything was the weakest of the Redskins Monday Night but especially in the past the game based on how the Redskins play against the said this is a good opportunity that Caroline if they're going to dominate [noise]\nNot that he's you expect\nOne of the repercussions of that game generally teams as we talked about don't have back to back stink bombs\nLike that Alex Schmidt than friends short week you get embarrassed never Carolina needed a sixty plus your vehicle to beat the giants\nAt the buzzer so they have their own issues I like

final shot you're not guaranteed the final shot in basketball but in baseball you are guaranteed the final but as the home team you get the last chance you have the final opportunity\nYou that's that's huge when the margins are thin\nAnd the post season is a big deal and the other thing to point out is used in play in a light weight Indian squad\nIn the opening round\nAnd the Astros have been a popular picked by a lot of people because they want and people who live in one last year I keep wanting we're not talking about the twenty seven Yankees here and when you go behind the curtain\nAnd you see what's really going on here you realize this asteroid teams\nVulnerable right there in fact the Astros this year against teams that had a winning record you know the good teams\nThe Astros were three games over five hundred this year against teams that had a winning record three and a five Nineteen winning percentage the Boston Red Sox were eight games over five hundred against teams that had a winning right they were better the red Sox against the other good teams then the Astros were\nBut wait there's more how about close game ... playoff games usually close\nRegular season I

baseball the Houston Astros fan base does anyone\nDisagree with a minute no one disagrees I don't disagree now what's my evidence or let's go back that's go back to the the archives here in twenty Thirteen the Astros were twenty sevens in attendance in baseball five years ago twenty seventh through the\nActual bodies in the stands much lower no party was going to the games they were on a watch about nobody was going these were intimate gatherings Astros games further more oh this is where it gets really good outside of friends and family\nYou needed an invitation to watch astro games on TV\n[laughter]\nI was trying to remember exactly what the number was so I had to go back to my uh my research and I'd look it up\nThe Astros in twenty Thirteen play the game that according to the Nielsen TV ratings had less than a thousand people in the Houston area watching\nLet me repeat that\nThey've a professional baseball uses a sudden astro fans in twenty third team where where they were watching the Astros baseball they add a game a quarter of the ratings that had less than a thousand people less than a thousand people watch you take that for\nData bam bam bam bam bam bam\nNow do you know eight though yeah that's right the population and used just to put in perspective\nIt and I'm not piling on him I Hope I'm not ... it's not like me to know all you're doing good thank you are the census population the last census estimated the population in the Houston market is to point three million less than a thousand we're watching a game in\nTwenty Thirteen now they're all astrophysics they all go way back they love the city of Houston right they they ... about your phone is dry bunch of phony\nBut yeah sure you all were hanging out down on the Gulf of Mexico while the Astros were playing five years ago now you're like I Love the Astros I go way back me and be geo and\nBags or to help out a hard sell art how it was my homeboy\nYeah exactly and they also on like this was their

hello to Edmund Dallas the\nJudas Garcia\nWell I Would just like our friends in Houston to know that I have picked the Astros to win the world series over the Dodgers\nYeah but you know baseball guy\nAnd I encourage you said before then malware that only stupid fans support losing teams that if you go out and pay hard earned money when the team is in trying to win then you're an idiot you should wait until they put out a good product\nBefore you go spend your money on that product\nIt less than a thousand people watching the game on TV where they good back then\nA TV ratings do not go down that much money if you have real fans they don't go that people still watch\nI'm just saying I I've heard you say I have said I I I guess your if you are and and you continue to pay for oh terrible product you are sending a message the organization that losing is acceptable so\nCould you could be argued that the astro fans were merely telling the organization that this is not acceptable we don't support this and you know you put a good product on the field will return that's an incorrect position on that why why why are you guys again\nI've said you're going to games fine but the people watching games on TV that doesn't go down you if you like the team doesn't cost any money you watch the game on TV you pay if you pay for TV okay but she has any right to do that when your time let me do the math\nKnow I don't I don't blame them Harris crazy from ... to protect that weird stuff it was like yeah what are you where are you doing\nFlats how that's how they pay the bills bill
