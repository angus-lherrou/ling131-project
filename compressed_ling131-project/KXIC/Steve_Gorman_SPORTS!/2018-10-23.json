from the bedroom would [noise] I Would cut out the house [noise]\n\nYesterday this week had one game left giant plus five\nA plus five I didn't care now we did give it out here a plus for so we were hoping all the straight out of Vegas listeners would benefit for sure\nBut personally we had the wind booked at that point so a lot of people got mad at my tweet\n'cause they're like we lost ... list and let me tell you got lucky let me tell you something and I promise you this you know you become jaded as a batter when no matter how lucky you are when is you feel like you've been on the wrong side of\nSo much that you ... that you're never going to catch up and you don't feel bad for anyone you're completely like I finally got one of these ... are you sure falls\nRight through I just said Justin Tucker miss an extra point after making hundred twenty consecutive once they owed me this one\nThis another example why people need to listen to straight out of Vegas even if you don't place a bet just know what the vet is so that you can know at that very moment who just had their entire night ruined I mean just just for that alone just see you know that somebody got screwed on a to point conversion by the giants that's how it's done\nAnd also know that we could care less you lost deal with it you know we'll dance on graves on this show that's the beauty of it because once you start you know and here's the thing and it's the same thing in poker\nIs if you have the best of it\nYou're going to get bad beats more than if you don't because think about let's say you went fifty five percent of the time said you're going to be on the right side of the number with two minutes left much more than the queen flipper and us the late ... early you more because you're winning with two minutes left\nRight so conceptually if you'd legitimately have over the long run it's assigned you're on the right side because you can't if you're losing a game by twenty you can't have a back beat at the end right and if you're losing the game even by three it's a lot harder to have\nA bad be that if you're winning ATS against the spread by three because it's that late score the other way so in general guys like us fads and and I would say are super contest as a good example of this\nWhen we lose we lose close ones\nAnd when we when half of them are close and half of them are ... now it's not like we never get blown out but if you look at the distribution of results we're totally out of it\nRarely relative to the times you have an easy win unless we bet on the forty niners but that happens again [laughter] about straight out of Vegas last thing about this game\nThis is one of my pet peeves I'm going to say a quick\nAll of the oh I have a minor in math from some crappy liberal arts school but no one's ever heard of\nBut cost you thirty thousand a year because you are so stupid to pay it or your mommy did whatever combination of events that lead to these analytics people on line [noise] they're not they're not verified that's fine if you're not verify and that's fine but if you're acting like your some expert\nProbably at some point someone should have thought you were worth being verified you're talking about how dumb\nYou know or the giants coaches or this coaches say how much money are you making right compare to Schumer and ... and maybe even if they're not even saying the wrong the wrong a fair amount in fact as you thought they were wrong yesterday\nYeah sure Schumer was absolutely correct to go for two down eight and\n... but everyone's like how crazy it was is and not everyone but a lot of people and to me\nHere's the ... the one if the guy's making millions and you're not kind of question why and it's not just everyone is an idiot like that billionaire pain that millionaire isn't necessarily always an idiot let's start their right but number two if you're a batter\nAnd some coaches or a fish in at the end\nAnd some are inefficient\nThat's an edge we set it yesterday with the chargers I don't want to bet the chargers in close games why because the coaches inefficient at the end which means I'll take for let's say instead of taking a plus money on the money on or vice versa I might want to\nTake the money line in some spots all 'cause I don't want to be on the chargers having to win a close game if everyone was optimal\nThen how would you take advantage she'd be sitting still when your mom's basement still with your sweat pants on and you'll be not insane yep everyone agrees with me like what did you just gained from that\nAnd this happened on the coin flip it used to be a lot of teams in the NFL took the bowl when they when the coin of now everyone in the league has figured it out it's slightly better to differ and that's what every NFL team\nDoes and how did you take advantage of it back when some teams didn't do a fantastic\nWell the best bet was betting who is going to hunt first and even better who's going to receive the opening kick off and I bet that more than once\nSo how many all joking aside we don't talk numbers too much\nBut is it fair to say you've made enough to buy a nice new car off of those type of ... probably Ninety thousand or so you've made Ninety thousand in your life cause some NFL guys coaches did it wrong when it came to differing or not now no one does it wrong so now it's worth all that money dried up no more new car or but everyone screaming hey\nI Hope that everyone starts to be off the most so I no longer have value maybe it's because they're not really betting any money that matters and maybe that's why they're screaming so much yeah I think that the best of the day when we come back\nSpeaking of professionals it's the pros versus calling coward

you think this Minnesota defensive player being backs a big\nDeal yeah he's ... he's worth at least a half a point his name is Griffin and he has been out for the past month and everyone's been asking what's wrong with that Minnesota deep and this is part of it\nAre interesting and plus I think since it was more than just football that had Griffin how\nIt felt like it kind of discombobulated the Vikings a little bit that here's a guy we care about he's our teammate and he's got some real problems if he's a well enough to get back to football that means he's he's while or generally so and that's a good thing I think psychologically for the Vikings\nAgree and the by signs already blinking on that Minnesota D the played great against the jets last week\n... straight out of Vegas shifting to the NBA fads LeBron he's the king or when I signed my Fox contract they said you got mentioned LeBron I Can't tell you exactly the fraction of days\nBut it's contractual it's high [laughter] not really but almost\nBut I think it's a heck of a story Owens three\nI saw some it was some small online website I don't even remember which one of a book maker had that right now Luke Walton is the favorite to be fired first I Would love to but I think it was passed one Seventy five let me late to fifty on the no plays right magic has a plan magic not Latin\nOr him start the season well unless you want him as the coach he would have fired him the day he came in magic would have if you want it to\nA Magic Johnson you know in the finals I've been in [laughter]\nI mean you say he's afraid [laughter]\nDo you do you know how many finals says that and so that's absurd but what do we take away from the on three\nWell I think that we knew it would take some time for the Lakers to jail together but I think the bigger picture is maybe it's not so important to the Lakers how they do this year it's all part of the bigger plan\nAnd we talked about that right before the first game a week ago which is the Lakers win Toto season wins eighty two games was forty eight we liked the over if we felt like LeBron was going to play like last year which he played every game and he played more minutes per game than any other planned the NBA\nAt his relatively\nAdvanced age let's give them a ton of credit the question is what do you make a statement this year and do do the same thing with the Lakers or what he set out for you or\nNext year the year after because his goal was to win a title but not necessarily this year now a listener might say RJ he wants to win every year yeah but would you go from let's say five percent chance this year or two or four percent\nIn order to go from eight thirty to forty and two or three years and I know you can't estimated exactly like that but I think that's the logic and\nTwo thousand twelve six plus years ago on that day July twenty four two thousand twelve course all was an underdog in the game meaning you had to bet if you buy the hundred you one more than a hundred\nFor the next six plus years one hundred and Ninety nine straight games Kirk shah was the favor\nVegas said ... has a better chance of winning than the opponent six straight years hundred Ninety nine today ... game one World Series is an underdog for the first time in that two hundred game in over six years\nWhile I was a while say if you look at the series also Red Sox money so this is betting who's gonna win the world series\nThey are up to the minus one sixty five what does that mean it's a money line that one sixty five to win one hundred\nThe dog is plus one forty five hundred when did you want forty five the difference is that dastardly bookie he's taking his big they call that the straddle so minus one sixty five plus one forty five\nNow says we've talked about this home field in baseball isn't quite as much in a seven game series is the NBA so these teams were even Red Sox would be about minus one forty in the series correct worth about forty cents home field so it open about one forty ... markets sad\nOr at least the odds makers said Vegas said hey\nThese are even teams give the red Sox home field the batteries have come in and said no no no Red Sox are batter and they've been fed up to one sixty five last thing on this game\nLot of people here in Vegas are talking about this being the biggest that World Series ever\nMay happen may not but we're in that conversation makes sense Red Sox huge franchise Dodgers huge franchise and one tip on the picking of the world series I don't have a pick tonight\nI'm going to look to fade the Dodgers when their favorite on the weekend why I like to bet underdogs on faith in the favor so I'd like to but under dogs in general in baseball\nBut also\nThere's a lot of geographic proximity from LA to Vegas all you got to do is drive that highway and pass the mad Greek and such and see the line outside to get my ... flavor to shake away too much information\n[laughter]\nBut because of that what happens the universe of batters here in Vegas\nHas a biased towards the Dodgers on the weekend more than during the week so now you've got the Dodgers in the world series\nYou got the Dodgers favored cars or at home and you got all the LA people in Vegas I think that adds another ten cents or so to the Dodgers pure values I'll be looking to bet the red Sox as a dog over this weekend I'm not saying I'm going to do it for sure but that's my ... what do you think about\nThat yeah I Love it I used to drive depression the border town California Nevada to bet against USC and UCLA when they had an independent book five years ago\nYou are the dirtiest planning the gay\nGuys you will have an early best bet company or momentarily but I Do want to let you know we are brought to you by Geico

you're to one and one and one of those pushes was or the push was this week have in mind is three if you bet with fads you push if you didn't yeah last says early best bet\nLet's go to London Philadelphia Eagles minus three I like this game I bet this game against Jacksonville it's about the eagles being under valued all about their poor quarterback play in September ... was poor they had to rush went back\nSo they really had four games where they had bad offensive stat now this ego often it's going to take off in my opinion going forward contrast that with Jacksonville here's a team with good stats but I expect those steps to crumble with all the locker room problems that they currently have a team does not want board all quarterbacking them that the eagles minus three\nBorders might be better quarterback but the locker room doesn't want him right now you add that into the stress of this trip I agree with you fast says eagles my street says says the lines gonna move book

I I just I don't know if it's related to the sports because in the NBA ... if you had\nAll these different teams winning championships I don't know if it will be as popular I think maybe because there's more dominated by individuals\nAnd NBA but All right is championship parity bad or good for baseball will continue the conversation with hall of famer David Winfield that's next is the couple of Fox Sports radio\nThat twenty eight teams were theories that\nChanging marching in the Boston Red Sox fan out\nOff Angeles Dodgers on new champion coming soon we're haul over at\nFox Sports

analytics take over the game and you know the way they're doing with the pitchers and teams now are just waiting for the fences home runs and things like that where do I thoughts on that\nWell there's some good at a lot of bad idol or balance I Can't tell you when it comes down to the baseball people are are making decisions anymore\nOr managers rarely even make decisions uh it's somewhat in the
