I had when Jimmy gee went down for the forty niners I had a six point downgrade now it's only a four point out right that there is better than I thought\nAnd wow how is how is bastard\nCan gotten better in your mind because I thought he was about as bad as a quarterback could be last year and he played a lot of games or the six games I think he started last year what do you see with your eyes that's changed with battered quarterback forty niners\nFirst off it's a mindset you know the guy that's ahead of you he's out he's not coming back ... looking over your shoulder\nEach your job right now yeah but was not the case with battered when they hadn't traded for Jimmy gee yeah\nYeah but they know they're looking at other parents for sure he's not that competed yet but he knows he had a pretty good pretty solar career over at Iowa he knows he's got potential and with a guy like Shanahan who's one of the top mines in football or Jay this guys on the up and up he may not have the cast of characters that McVeigh has doesn't have a Donald pursue\nBut he's got a darn good team and he's got a great innovative office of mine\nAll right John as you know something we got a minute I think we touch on one Lakers topic and then at the bottom of the hour we're doing the hallway MBA preview what's your take your in LA what's your take on this ... at the site men around ...\n... it's an organization that has missed the playoffs for five consecutive years it's the worst they've ever been in the history of the organization so LeBron brings them hope I'm just curious\nHow much we're overlooking age the fact that he's in the western conference now and all the other factors that come along with that and when we're just assuming that the Lakers are all of a sudden the title contender just because LeBron's name is on the marquee\nWill listen what was there they one thirty five games right we should ... like I'll get will go over thirty seven and a half or assume he might be more where did you say I Am I going to pass a ... yeah I mean here's what I'm going to say Joan is is right at some point\nLeBron is going to get old at some point Brady is going to get all I Do think we need a paradigm shift a fundamental shift\nWhen it comes of age with the athletes the focus on there how like Brady does like LeBron does and I think the SPN had an article there's been a few of them LeBron spans like a million dollars a year on his body he's got\nCry a metric chambers being flown wherever he is I mean doesn't mean that he's gonna be immortal but it means what you you know thirty five\nBack in the day is maybe forty ... you know maybe there is a three four years\nExtension of the crimes of these guys were the you know prime minus ten percent and I would make the fall in case the clothes are early look at the MBA here quit touching the Lakers\nYou could make the case law Braun play his best season last year I'm not saying he clearly did I'm saying you can debate it's debatable the two thousand Seventeen Eighteen\nAt his advanced age and Joan is his mind\nI mean you know I'm not saying you're being critical of the gang but it is it's Vance age\nWould anyone strongly debate against that this was his best year his most recent year for the little brio now I Know so you're right but it's not going to be a wall John is right it maybe does drop five seven percent but if it's from his pinnacle LeBron is still I Would say that\nIf we had an objective measure of greatness and I don't trust the MVP voting or any of that\nI Would be willing to bet LeBron's the best player in the NBA this year yes or no would you bet that John I Would bet that yeah you bet yes yes oh but he is the best player in the league yeah so you're right there's some questions with the age but right now we agree he's the favored\nLeBron to be the best player in the NBA bottom of the hour we're going to be talking all MBA up next\nPros versus the world including calling power that's RJ bell I'm Jonas ... the pre game show you always wanted right here on Fox Sports radio [noise]\nI Love your favorite towels or he [laughter]\n\nOn the way\nThat like the way we're dominating this year's coverage are you in [noise] this is Fox Sports radio\n[noise] I Can't believe\nThat we're playing for for basketball with the barbershop quartet as the\nBall ball a little bad\nUm\nNo I

Washington at home yes they're foreign to hold on a second oh\nI remember right all the pros and the pros do know all the pros Ron Utah in ... Washington game I remember that right in dominated the games it's honestly I had Utah I watched it was like I knew right wrong time or whatever\nAnd and what was the what was the margin when he wants to seven or we just get a wave off a fourteen point margin an a plus or minus for game for ... and now in ... in that game\nAnd say we're looking at Washington very differently right Auburn looks horrible now\nOne closed last doesn't look so good quote unquote for Washington [noise] then you add in this week against Oregon [noise] I mean well I'm not saying one bag game but I think we got a call that Utah Washington a bag game for Utah\nOkay at home bad game All right so the thing and when the clear coin flip by Nineteen yard touchdown pass with a couple of minutes left gave the cougars and winner of the Utah like putting forward this week I'm going to give me a little preview I really really really like Utah who is a six and a half point favorite over the pack\nWell south I Would say coming into the ... the leader and us the best way [noise]\nI don't understand what you said at the end just say one more time Utah six and a half point favorite over us see what the clear favorite in the ... coming in the in the south\nI bet you said what are you really really light Utah ... okay [laughter] it's like a little knife you told mine is six and a half\nYou like yeah we're not making that official yet and we'll be talking about that probably later in the week and just to recap Utah underwriting by the a P Brad powers is all the college knowledge has a number of fourteen years and ... he is wrong and just one minute it is going to be [noise]\nI I Would say the fastest pace MBA preview from Vegas perspective first season you've ever heard\nThat's coming up next year on

to say Fifteen\nPercent or more on car insurance with guy go go to guy go dot com or called eight hundred nine four seven auto the only hard part figuring out which way is easier coming up\nIn about twelve minutes from now here on Fox Sports radio is best bets time we will give you an opportunity to make some cash\nOn a Tuesday night here on straight out of Vegas but right now we're going to get into the NBA Vegas style this season starts tonight we've got the Celtics hosting the Philadelphia Seventy Sixers and the warriors hosting the Oklahoma City thunder minus Russell Westbrook\nBut here's the thing John is if you don't call me personally the voice of Vegas at least once a day I don't feel right it's just something that missing\nYeah that's ... by the way he is the voice of Las Vegas he is the only voice of Las Vegas he\nIs already only one that's what'd you say the boy\nI'll take that I take that\nAh you know again maybe I'm just ... you know and and if so I I can accept that but I Do like it\nSo ah we've got to we've got a little Vegas style NBA preview are now our okay we'll go to that\nList and guys I'll let joined us off the hook we're going to look at the top six teams and we literally are going to go from one to six and you might think\nWhy I wanted to say because you know who's number one Golden State right and it is interesting you know in the ESPN article and this was\nThey they wrote something about the ah\nOdds and it was so convoluted I had a ... like four times to understand it better vast majority of people miss understood it's very dangerous with sports betting 'cause there's money involved then when you have in let's just be Canada I'm going to be honest you I Try not to be critical\nOf people except you know I mean listen men gym horrible don't get along he smells but I Try to be objective otherwise\nBut you know where the SPN does uh some of the writers especially with the gambling stuff it's like they don't know what they're talking about and it's almost like when you have a translation\nWhere you can uh like it's the right word just the right translation\nIt just like the verb in the noun is inverted it's in the wrong spot in sick when you hear someone speak with English as a second language that kind of getting it across the EU but often times it doesn't sound right and it can be confusing\nThat's what happens when you have a\nEspecially in a national platform people writing about it who just don't understand sports betting hopefully 'cause I'm a fan ESPN in many ways hopefully they'll take it seriously enough to you know get some guys in there and know what they're talking about\nBut Golden State number one\nThey're the only team ever only franchise ever to be a minus money favor when you go back to Michael Jordan you go back to Jordan versus the bulls and our joining the booze versus the field\nIt was even money in Michael's heyday right now Golden State is mine is two hundred or so to win the title so relative to competition Golden State is better than any team and NBA history says what's your take on them this year\nI think they're right where they were last year I've got them equivalent in my power ratings I think that the minus two hundred RJ it absolutely justified and think about the big four last year a lot of those guys got injured or as the year progressed and they're all healthy to start the year All right so [noise] All right\nThank arts and yeah on the warriors here's the thing with the warriors last year Golden State then value the regular season very much season when total was sixty seven and a half\nThe warriors only win fifty eight games and that one this year you seen that adjustment clearly even though fetch just got done than warriors are flat season when fall down six from last year\nThat's ... ... straight out of Vegas were counting up the top six NBA team's number two right now based on title ... Boston Celtics\nBoston Celtics are five to one to win the title supposed to win fifty nine seasons when games I've upgraded Boston three points from last year or Jay okay so why are being comes back Gordon Hayward comes back and that youth that Tatum is going to be much much better player a lot of the young players that can improve as well\nI so young players got a lot of experience young players get better and\nI to me the question with the Celtics does integration\nIs everyone going to be comfortable in a new role in the role that last you know where a Tatum is getting the ball in the conference championship at the end of the game or if he gets the ball Irving isn't someone else isn't is or you know is there enough basketball's go around\nIt's certainly a concern you had some great players like rose year who so lots of playing time how we respond getting\nYou know if you want to say must win but but but the the pressure's off it feels like off a yes or yesterday's game\nWith the Dodgers and I just think in baseball that pressure is not a good thing but the fans or the batter specifically are like well we you know Dodgers aren't going to lose another one so I Would I Would lean not ally but a lean on Milwaukee and I like dogs and baseball to start with Lena Milwaukee on tonight's baseball game\nGuys we're coming to your life and the guy go Fox Sports radio studios were Fifteen minutes could save you Fifteen Percent or more on car insurance Steve ... our NFL expert has this uncanny ability to predict line movements in the NFL this time it's the Tampa Bay buccaneers a three point favorite at home and gets the browns\nSo this is an early best bet every Tuesday tradition now straight out to Vegas six fifty ... or so or if you're going to give us again you like that you expect to move now\nYou're what three in one on the ... green one on the moves of I remember that right to an one and two one two and one and two in one okay so last week you got to pick wrong you got to move right you had the bass line but it didn't matter with Tennessee who do you got this week NFL in which ways aligned movement\nAmong Tampa Bay minus three against Cleveland I bet minus three I think this wind will go up RJ so why did you bad Tampa all about energy level you nailed this last week remember you went ahead and said boy the Cleveland Browns team five close games three over times I'm worried about this team and how they're going to hold up and they played very\nPoorly against the chargers I think they're going to have trouble on the road here against Tampa because had better by two weeks ago so ever there's a team that's going to be energized and have more energy and the Cleveland it will be Tampa Bay\nAnd we've talked about at Cleveland has had up until this last game\nA historic number of close games and that's physically difficult that three overtime games the brown and it's emotionally difficult they hit a wall now the question is they take a breath and recover\nOr does the downward slide continue when it comes to coaching when you've got questionable coaching like I truly believe the browns have I tend to think slides continue\nAnd by the way guys says historically right about Seventy percent of the time on line moves so if you do like Tampa that it now you expected to go up three and a half\nOr more tamper minus three best that early on Tuesdays the fact that\nWe have another early best bet here this time it's in college football courtesy of Ken Thompson go can go\nWell I'm going to go to Utah use I heard a Brad saying that we like to see him I was at the game last year at the coliseum Utah us see in the third row right behind the Utah badge and Utah's afford down inside the to your line they go for it they get it easily they gave Seventy or during the play they can they go for two to win it they decided to do that that's what am style\nThey end up thrown in the corner the ends on foreign instead of just running the same play they would easily gotten the two\nWhen they lost that game on the way back to my car I was walking with Kyle ... brother coach of Utah's brother and my daughter cue are we go to a game every year we talked about that place you said that's my brother style he will do that ten out of ten trust me he'll have this game circled for next year okay so your\nTheory is it's an it's an aggressive style but because it failed last time there was a\nSpecial revenge well this would make sense no when you lose the game they men do your the better team on ... those those are the best was saying because of the way you talk lost the game that you feel like that ... mind right away All right so we're saying Brad you think Utah\nIs underrated compared to the a P ... ranked in the a P\nYou have you told what fourteen fourteen I so we got an ... or an underrated team and\nKen Thompson is telling us we got extra motivation you combine those two it offers value so Utah is favored by six\nSix and a half three six six and a half hour I cycle stadium under a touchdown you're fine\n[noise] I got back from Ken Thompson ...\nComing back tomorrow six pm eastern time three o'clock Pacific recapping the

Mac instead of the bears getting him and then you got a defensive ... plays a pass Russia cause problems on the other quarter back\nThen you're talking about you know what I mean I'm going to be with you make are now I Would be with that I'm not against Les beyond bell but I think defensively you you're going to have a hard time if you can't get a stop it's like the NBA you notice Chris the teams that are able when it's when you were able to get a stop light and the game you got to be able to get a stop\nAnd look I they need help in the backfield offensively and defensively they need help so I'm with you whatever they improve my point is just their overall they're not getting him to help\nHe needs and this is a guy who maybe plays the quarterback position better than we've ever seen it played and it's a shame that they won't build around him\nWell let me ask you this some people do you do you consider and I'm just talking about throwing the football I'm Talking about accomplishments or being a accomplished whatever because people will mostly said a Tom Brady is probably the most economists no not to go I save the gun on Sunday night almost will get Lonny intangible mouth when

other team defensive signals man here you go let's just true cause outcome everybody else gets held to the fire about cheating except Tom Brady and the patriots I don't get it\nI don't get it tell me why you don't just count them for the cheating aspect why don't you take us for most\nOf it he didn't she I mean he he he did they did she\nI mean there's no end than\nThey did she but\nThe bulk of his career as six ... have not been due to cheating\nAnd the other one is\nThe a Tom Brady at the end of the game just look at the super bowl last year\nTom Brady coughed up to football he law that perfect I'm just saying he's the grill Montana never lost the super bowl never will cough up the ball Joe Montana you're ready to do in the super bowl of Lebanon touchdowns ... ... ... oh not been
