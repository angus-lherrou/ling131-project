washed LeBron James teams for Fifteen Years and every year since ... posts rookie season they find a way to be one of the best off and says in basketball why because well Brian James is an office on to himself\nThe office of end is not going to determine if the Lakers win forty three games versus fifty three games what's going to determine it is the defensive at most important stat for the Lakers this year is going to be defensive right\nAll right so I tend to agree with him and I think the Lakers [noise] how do I want to say this I think there are free rolling meaning in in in\nIn Vegas that's a term used by how would you define free rolling\nFree role as an opportunity to make a bad and you either have a fair bet or you have a great bat if a certain circumstance hits\nYeah I Would say more specifically a free row is worst case you break even and there was an upside I sort of someone says hey\nThat this game if you're when I'll pay a if you don't win if you lose you don't have to pay me that sounds crazy but often times there'll be sports books or casino games that allow you to play blackjack for free a couple of my hand if you when you keep your money some of the ... online sports books have\nA free bats as part of their sign up bonuses here's the free roll\nThe Lakers have great young players\nAnd who's to say who's gonna really emerged this year every young player that doesn't start out as a top ten player in the league which is super rare they have that season that they emerge there's a real chance the Lakers have one or even two guys could do that if it happens\nThe Lakers are so set up to be competitive and if it doesn't happen they can make that trade for a ... if they want before the trade deadline\nSo my sense is the Lakers embracing the youth and giving them a chance to flourish and emerge with LeBron tutoring them in a way enabling them\nEmpowering them but I also do I do agree with Nick that I think the offense is the easy part not only cause LeBron so good because of the talent\nI think the driver of their success than the regular season for the Lakers is about defense so quite sharp I think from Nick says what's your take on the Lakers this year\nI think that the market is older valuing their chances to win a championship they're twelve to one but I think they're seizing Windsor too low currently at forty eight wins I think the Lakers could win fifty\nOkay so it's over under forty eight and you think perhaps they could win either that they won they are going to win over forty eight when [laughter] they they might might might be able to fit the odds that doesn't sound like something I went to bat so let me ask you a question so their their title watch or what twelve to one okay\nAnd what does that stack rank golden state's number one et cetera et cetera sack ranked number four ... says it\nWears the sack ranked number four where's this stack rank force okay\nSo you got to question okay now here's the next one is\nWhere does this stack rank with their wind totals there when total is tied for seven okay\nSo this is a great lesson here we finally got to thank you fed we finally got to it the lesson here is is in the title batting market there's a ton of recreational money being bad and they love a broad they love the Lakers\nIn the wind total market there's more professional money being bad\nAnd the professionals have more skepticism they're not bought into the brand and the legend as much with LeBron all that said one of the best professionals there is fantastic thinks that forty eight over or under season wins regular season\nIs too low and you think they might even be able to win fifty\n[noise] when we come back\nWe've got the trend of the week you will not want to bet these games without

league baseball the brewers announcement pitcher geo Gonzalez\nWill get the starting to and one of the adults yes tomorrow against the Dodgers we Molly gets started Saturday in game too that these guys\nBanks Dana straight out of Vegas comes do you live here from the guy told Fox Sports radio studios where it's easy to say Fifteen Percent or more on car insurance with guy go\nGo to guy go dot com or call eight hundred nine four seven auto the only our part figuring out which way is easier I'm Jonas knocks the voice of view the fan and he is the voice of Vegas RJ bell\nAnd I'll tell you a little secret when I was deciding to take this gig or not one of the drivers was a chance to talk to guys every week like Greg Cosell every Thursday he joined the bottom of the hour straight out of Vegas NFL analysts and senior producer\nFor NFL Films for thirty nine years how you doing Greg\nOr Jay how are you my pleasure giants first time since two thousand Fifteen they scored thirty plus on the film did they do anything significant things better or was it just the randomness of the NFL\n[noise] well I think when you hit a some some big ... and the passing game you tend to have a chance to score and more they obviously hit the touchdown too oh do back on for thirty three yards it was as good a throw as he lives probably made this season [noise]\nUh ... you know other than that I you know I think they had some shorter fields because they had two interceptions so uh you know there's some randomness to it I don't think that automatically going to put up thirty every week or the player who intrigues me the most on the giants as we look forward to tonight's game is\nIs Barkley said on Barclay 'cause he's a very interesting player RJ which really\nGoes back to his days at Penn State I Would describe it as\nHe's kind of a reactionary runner he runs away from opposing color rather than a roadmap point of attack runner and what I mean by that is\nHe doesn't necessarily hit designed a spot in in the in the run so what happens is he has a lot it runs that illusion shortage last week he had two runs for fifty yards or twenty or thirty order as other Thirteen runs were from minus two very hard to sustain out things that way\nWhen it comes to west coast teams traveling east with a ten am start here in town there's always a debate how important is it how much should we account for it when you watch the film and you see it seemed like Arizona\nAnd they are going back and planet ten am Pacific body clock time how much of a factor does it show on the phone\nI don't think it shows at all I can tell that whatsoever [noise] uh so I you know to be honest with the Archie I think that's a an after the fact to kind of thing once you have access to the results we decide that that's the reason why and there may be a reason but I you can see that on film it just ...\nYeah you you can't see that at all you know you don't know why team you know think about sports I mean we all follow sports the way it works for most people when they watch sports is\nIf their team loses they end up saying things like well they didn't come to play or they weren't ready or the coaches had a big game plan they know none of that but they say those kinds of things because that's a very easy to say once you have access to the result\nNo I agree I think it's human nature to try to find right rationale in in the randomness I Know I'll give you a\nGreat example when your team loses okay anybody team loses what are they often say about the coach you didn't make good half time adjustments right don't you hear that all the time yes\nOkay well when their team wins do you ever hear them say the coach made really good halftime adjustments\n[laughter] no one ever not no not no one\nNo one ever said that but it's so easy to say that the coach made bad halftime adjustments when a team loses\nSo same question and if the answer is no can be that simple when it comes to playing in London are there are certain types of teams that do better like in general with London what do you think we should be considering [noise]\nSee I I Can't answer that I'm being honest with you because I when I when I look at the games\nI don't think about where the games are being played I I I'm a I'm a tactics guy you know I so I don't you know I I haven't done a study of what happens when teams play in London you know half the time I ... I I like this week I look at the beginning of this week and said oh there's a London game this week\nI I didn't even know that 'til I looked at the schedule for this week\nYeah and the theory is is if there were an obvious fact whereas all the defensive struggle or whatever you would see it on film the fact you haven't seen it probably tells the well it's not their\nDefense could struggle but do we ought to medically then make the correlation that that's because they're playing in London a lot of defensive struggle at any given week yeah I I don't know if it's if the location of the game is the reason for that\nWe're talking with Greg Cosell executive producer an analyst for NFL Matchup on ESPN let's talk a little bit about the red skins\nObviously disappointing on Monday Night now you're starting to here we are at least the talk about oh Alex Smith doesn't have Andy Reid anymore and he doesn't look the same when you look at Alex Smith in this Washington off then what are you saying\nWell gee I don't think there's a mystery about Alex Smith and what he is as a quarterback I think there's limitations to him as a pastor\nI think he needs they really will scheme to well designed a fence which by the way I think Jay grown and can do but I also think you need weapons and right now they're struggling a bit with weapons on the outside in Washington because of injury or so and and they're ... they're running game is week to week some weeks at work some weeks it doesn't\nSo Alex Smith then becomes what he essentially is he's he's probably ought to put it this way the best thing about Alex Smith throughout much of his career\nTravis chalk each ... each hockey couple of things Alabama clearly best team in the country maybe the best team in ten years but actually they lost during the last three against the spread ride you've got a sharp way to get a bam or they might even be better and clay\nYeah bet bam on the first half you'd be six in oh against the number ... their opponents forty six in the first half alone\nGuy speaking of best bets that we do throughout the week here on Fox Sports radio at this time Ken Thompson is here with his best better the week\nUh joined us always tough to go against an undefeated team and that is West Virginia but we'll Greer gunslinger kind of like an image to young bred for already six interceptions going to go on the road very tough environment Ames, Iowa Iowa State\nMac gamble one of the best young coaches and the game they will be ready young quarterback brought her to use a ... threat look for I Would say to win this game at nighttime be about forty five degrees game time but I think I Would say takes care of business there were six and a half point dog they win the game outright\nOh he's saying level of difficulty\nI Love fading undefeated teams and I love playing on when was teams because at zero it's like around your neck one way or the other because the public is so enthralled with zero when it's in the last column and they're so\nAh [laughter] they they feel so negatively when a team has zero in ... obviously zero wins isn't a good thing but when you were four or five\nGames in a season sometimes it's just a lot of bad luck that's when you can get the real value biggest game tonight and remember\nLast segment of the show six or seven eastern we always do two things we give you a least won best bet today you got to the fourth team or how could lose wink wink and Ken Thompson is very best bad of the week\nAnd now we also make a second promise the big games of tonight we're going to break that we've already broken down Thursday Night Football\nIn a more extended way ... give us your thirty second handicap on Thursday night recapping\n[noise] well I think that the value is all about the New York giants as we mentioned plus three and sometimes our J just gotta let it go in the line value drops down to the giants plus one\nSo I think I think the real story here is as of yesterday ... had the giant plus three you bet that when you took off the rubber band on that one but to now it's down to one one and a half\nYelling that way we caught a pizza bat you still have about maybe put a pizza bet on it the right side but not good enough for a full bat 'cause you could have had three yesterday correct I Do have a proposition ... OK quickly this is a prop ... bone is\nNew York giants number too wide receiver sterling shepherd over five and a half receptions\nThey're tied on for the giants increments out that means more top targets for shepherd also when you think giants who do you think back I'm Barkley those two players getting overvalued under the radar this has to play the bike over five and a half on shepherd receptions\nHigh so shepherds he catches six or more than ... wins is that like a minus one ten kind of bond as one Fifteen one Fifteen a little bit more than the average Jews six or more receptions first shepherd correct okay finally hey there's another game on quickly Brad Texas Tech TCU\nYeah Texas Tech TCU we're going to go over the total uh fifty eight and a half and I think it's just an overreaction both teams have banged up quarterback play I'm telling you right now it doesn't matter who's playing behind center at Texas Tech off and I don't care if it's Patrick my home's cram herrell or this freshman for them\nYou will get production out of that and also the issue is one of the faster paced teams in the country over fifty and a half TCU tax tax\nAnd I was just a leaner like they lean lean over that's not quite like let me tell you guys that was a lot of\nAnd one segment and you know something tomorrow there will be even more we call every Friday pic pollute\nThe odd

a gym but I Will say I would question what's going on there to to hunt for questioning the laws they don't look good\nBut they lost to a dysfunctional a sad sack giants team I'm Sorry the eagles if they got any kind of moxie or anything going for them they got to put their foot on the giants neck and snap it that I don't want to be on the eagles\nI agree but my point is New York\nNeeds it even more I think you seem to be feeling like looked at the giants it don't matter they're done they got no chance anyway so Philadelphia's got something to play for they can go to the Superbowl so for them yeah you can't afford to lose this game I get it really needs it you're right the giants are mess they need to win but my point is\nFor the giants season it could be over six weeks and if they lose tonight I don't think that's going to be the case for Philadelphia I mean the giants that they just talked\nAbout all the locker rooms galvanized O'Dowd back um juniors comments got us going we got riled up you saw how well we play\nEven though we lost the camera line that we should have won that game we are back baby he lived through for three hundred something yard that's the easy lie that we thought we'd see we're ready and there's a new season\nAnd then you come out and get beat at home\nBy struggling Philadelphia team it will be her\nAge seven seven Ninety nine on Fox who you got to know who needs is gay more\nChris Broussard New York football giants or Rob Parker's Philadelphia Eagles I just think the eagles can't afford that down the road if they lose this game to the giants they'll look back when they don't win the division or don't make the playoffs and this will be a game\nThat that that they let get away with the team in trouble and that's why I think the eagles need it they can't afford to lose to this bad giants team that's into turmoil they need it\nThere's no doubt that now I'm not saying they don't need it they need it I just like\nYou always throughout the phone number after I Do uh my\nDid you like that I give a might drop while I don't have anything to say I just figure it out at all by phone numbers and old people law [laughter]\nNow look I'm not doubting I mean I I totally agree with\nYou the eagles need this and if we we're basing this on expectations for team right 'cause the eagles got a chance I don't think they'll win the super bowl again but you know they got a chance to go again\nRight the giants don't so I get it from that standpoint there's really something at stake for Philadelphia and ... only die hard giants fans\nReally still believe that they gonna do something this year but I just think looking at it equally if the giants lose after all they've been through and then after their attempts at a positive spin\nThen I just think they've got ten more weeks of worthless football to play and I don't think that'll be the case for the Philadelphia Eagles but tell us what you think eight seven seven Ninety nine on Fox
