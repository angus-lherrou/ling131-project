the most overrated team in college football what did you get wrong ...\nI I got three things wrong all on the off the side of the ball when it concerns Notre Dame number one obviously quarterback situation for Notre Dame they switch it up to an bucket quarterback less and less first three games on a random much a quarterback when Bush had to total touchdowns\nFor interceptions last two games with in book at quarterback for the Irish nine total touchdowns zero interceptions major upgraded a quarterback\nSo right now do you consider Notre Dame even overrated at all\nNo I'm a people as a number six I got a seven or eight and my power renting not overrated\nOkay now calling coward my favorite radio guy let's get this straight are not afraid no sacred cows my favorite radio guy he had to take on Notre Dame that was just plain wrong [noise]\nOakland [noise] mainstream media\nThis Notre Dame team is different this is the best Notre Dame team I'm being honest year that I've seen since the Lou Holtz zero\nThey are big and I mean like Alabama bake Georgia big Oklahoma big up front defensively [noise] um they gotta NFL players they got Sunday guys offensively they roll Stanford Stanford the good the Stanford the top seven eight team in the country\nOr they have now put a new quarterback eating in book and he's he is a big time player so they have solved what was their issue\nThrowing the ball down the field this is the best Notre Dame team my eyes telling me they've had been over a decade defensively up front they maybe aren't as good as Clemson up front defensively [noise]\nBut they're every bit as good as the Georgia's and the Oklahoma is on the Alabama's up front and they got the quarterback so I've always liked Brian Kelly little hot head\nWill temperamental not easy to quarterback for but um I've been critical of Notre Dame in the past this they are the real deal this seemed to me it looks like they can match up with anybody they may not beat Alabama but that can match up in the trenches with Alabama\nNow what Vegas does exceptionally well is we objectively with the numbers that such things so Brad this is one of those fantasy\nOdds making deals but Notre Dame two thousand twelve undefeated going in the national championship game versus this year's Notre Dame team neutral field which is a lot\nYeah the two thousand twelve teams about a three point favorite I think everyone the laughing impression was that Notre Dame team getting crushed by Alabama but the reality was that he met a lot of great ones including by Seventeen on the road in Norman, Oklahoma\nOkay so listen he says they're better than that twelve team three point favorite that's kind of a small man yeah well we wouldn't even mentioned it\nBut this one he said oh maybe there will be banned but they're going to play to spin now right now I asked you I asked ... asked our favorite book maker Matty hole you all came within a half a point what would the line be Notre Dame bam a neutral field this year\nAlabama would be a Seventeen point favorite right now or Notre Dame\nOoh I Wonder I'm gonna actually call call in and say hey you said it's going to be closed Jimmy ... I'll give you a four and let's see if he wants to make one of those that are better than I Am a\nPredicting no\nThat that that is a it's a little bit dirty pool is that uh that no I Know it's all about the cat okay well I guess fair enough I heard the songs that we ensure segment yes yeah I hear that tight rope is my favorite I Want to walk the tight rope at one point but unfortunately later on August ... oh you well yeah of course a guy's um there was a heavy discussion in the NFL\nA hot topic in the NFL Frank Reich the Indianapolis Colts head coach decided in overtime to go forward on fourth down in his own territory giving the ball back to Houston who completed a pass kicked a field goal and won the game\nOf controversy nobody can figure it out where do you stand on it\nI tell you as the more I think about the math of this just straight wins and losses I think it was almost about break even meaning what you've gained and what you lost from the coast perspective than most I could think it'd be a major negative for the Colts what do you think\nYeah I agree the situation for them for you got about a fifty fifty chance to make it if you miss it the other team gets the bone you're forty three if you're making your at midfield\nYeah that's where I dispute with you a little I think if you do make it your average gains more than seven yards it just takes one guy on your back in there on the you know the forty two of the other team you know they kind of try to tackle ... feel free strides in the right to forty to pass interference\nPenalties real chance you could get a twenty year again that's true\nYeah so let's call it break even but even the image negative okay for the call here's my point calling made a really good point about this today and he said well listen the team wants to create a culture of aggressiveness\nAnd I think if you look at writes pedigree the egos Philly Special lot of aggressiveness and that Superbowl couple drop passes and weren't telling a very different story but he was coaching staff also Brad you came up with something I hadn't thought of and it's about the fans\nYeah well the the fans obviously they want that to their coach to go for it in that regard that they want to see or when they want to\n... yeah so so it's not only the idea of creating a culture of winning and you know actually fast you were the one on the fans side there is the idea of the fans are going to get excited but I think there's one more thing John is that no one's talking about\nNBA tank and\nI think about it everyone seems to think oh yeah

first two weeks the year\nOutstanding at home no doubt about it\nThey're like thirty three if you actually look against the spread Denver first two weeks a year with one or two sixty seven percent against the spread\nWeek three and four and we're in a week for forty two percent so that idea that you have the altitude and the altitude is something the out of shape early season players struggle with\nIts true except to get these players get in shape mighty fat so I Would laugh is you've got a situation where case keen on the uh QB our last year was number three now number twenty six this

according to Adam chef there are still going to listen to trade off for ...\nI Would I Want I think that makes sense really I Do\nKnow why because if they weren't going to keep because they weren't saying now he wants to play and they weren't willing to pay him then why if I if if I'm the Steelers\nThen you might as well trained them you didn't want to pay him the guy did nothing but produced while he was there\nFour hundred touches over the last what two years I only God's word no last year last year for you know going and and he's done nothing because what produce so if you're not going to pay him than I Do make a deal let them go somewhere else was someone's willing to do with just the same way\nThat the ... that that the raiders just didn't want to pay him no matter how good he was they didn't want to pay 'em and you know what the bears that will pay him and look what a bears or right now and I'm sure\nThat they won't pay him I'm not saying he's going to play a long time with the Steelers but\nIt'll be interesting I again looking at his comments where he saying he hopes to finish his career in Pittsburgh and wants to talk with his teammates before he gets back so you know he gets moves over any any hard feelings\nOr I I wouldn't be surprised if they work this out but hey you know you got to listen and the river for say there'll be lucky to get like a third round pig and they're asking for a second round\nOf course let's let's jumping we got one let's get a quick call here okay how about John and Detroit you're on the odd couple and Fox Sports radio what's up

but you know all the talk of\nBag union yadda yadda yadda yadda yadda ... has a plan if I'm the players one of them will have to come out and say we're going to be sort of by the national football players association and start over point one being on the table guaranteed contracts\nTo a revamping a player discipline\nAnd how life care lifetime healthcare right yes said yeah absolutely because it has to be\nThose guaranteed contracts and lifetime healthcare are what they really those are the two main things as far as I'm concerned and then getting rid of this franchise tech 'cause this thing is crazy especially for running backs when they can tag you for the prime of your career year after year after year let's\nGet the Tony Gonzales fourteen time pro bowl tied in now NFL analysts for Fox you can follow him at Tony Gonzales eighty eight on Twitter Toni welcome to the couple of how you doing man\nOut or are you guys men doing great were\nGreat so what do you what do you make of this lady beyond bell news that he's coming back in weeks seven smart move dumb move [laughter]\nWell I think after what happened with Earl Thomas I'm sure you guys are talking about it that that's the worst thing that could happen for a girl that I mean that's why he was so frustrated\nFlipping off the sidelines because his his worst nightmare just came through I mean he was like hey I'm going to be the nice guy I'm going to come back or I'm going to try and do it the right way and and hopefully they'll pay me they didn't pay and then he gets hurt and now who knows what's happened we don't know the severity of the injury hopefully he'll be back\nBut certainly there is no came out there it's going to sign up for a long term deal and I got to come into another one year proven type deal that history that you really healthy\nAnd this is what it is and it's on both during this is why he hasn't come there and I applaud levy on for doing this or it's something I've been franchise before back in the day and I came in my general manager called breeder sat at the time said are held out I'm just all a camp I came in I did the right thing I didn't get hurt\nOr and then they find me a long term deal but before that I said well I Want to be paid like a tight in I mean I Want to be paid like a wide receiver and putting them wide receiver numbers if I Know you're going to be paid like a part in\nIt because that's how they ... they fought in the NFL and he said if you don't if you don't sign this deal\nFine with me I'm going to franchise you again next year and a franchise you again after that it doesn't matter and this is why that franchise tiger hurt you scratch ticket right it's got to go it's the stupidest role in all of business I don't care about football it's just a dumb rules\nMight and play I just I still can't believe that the union would agree to that and and and allow them to do what they've done but uh there we go so Chris are totally agrees with me so I just want\nYou to know I I didn't I didn't hear him say let's do that then he\nSaid he upheld and he's got Lourdes what Doug levy on bills doing he understands it would've been able to come back and we know that but I but I don't understand totally Molly issue is if you're going to do to hold out\nWhy you why you're cutting a short coming back before the ten weeks when you have to come back to get credit for the seas and that's the only part I don't understand as if he didn't understand what he was doing what he decided to hold out in the first place that's what I don't understand\nThat I don't understand that either a ... that's where you got to ask him because I Would I go on to the right to take weeks to play I don't know if that maybe\nMaybe ... ... what if we have a chance to go to the playoffs you know or if I Am there I I I got to work with you guys these guys in the paper looking at me sideways not all the ... but some of the guys on the team because you're not going to satisfy everybody a and and it's like hey I Am here at least I'm showing a little bit of of of good faith\nAnd hopefully we can make it for here let's go when the school was from games I guess that's the only thing I can think of\nTony I think he recognized there'd been reports the Steelers could transition tagging at next season and he said in this story that came out today\nOr ESPN dot com that the Steelers told him they would transition tag him next summer and so the more he sat out the lower you know that transition tag is based off of\nThe money you made in the previous year so that money that transition number would get lower and lower and lower every time every week he sat out so\nPersonally I think he came back because he saw he was losing money and potentially going to lose even more money in the future well then let me ask you this because we are talking about you mentioned it how bad the franchise tag is\nAh what do you think you would take ... to the players have the resolve and is it even realistic in a sport like football where the average gallon a place for three years for guys to sit out and maybe lose a season or most of a season to get a new CPA\nI either realistic I I don't know because I'll tell you what there is this shift going on\nWith the mentality of the NFL football player I think they're taking back their power they're realizing the power that they have and you're seeing something that I never saw when I was younger you're seeing guys resigned to three years in that case of Julio Jones or yeah he was resigning ahead of his schedule contract\nOr any saying well if you don't pay me like like I think I should be paid like one of the best receivers in the league I Know I when I find that contract last time I know I got three years left on my deal but I just want to show up and that's fine that's all there is to it whereas before players were afraid to do that", "show_name": "Steve Gorman SPORTS!", "year": "2018", "city": "Iowa
