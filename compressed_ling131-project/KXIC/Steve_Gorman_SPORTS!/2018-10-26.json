I think the odds are that are getting very slim that they would with three times and the best we can make the following statement the Lakers one year from today will be better than they would have been if they sign poll George\nSo that to me is that next level type you know Vegas thinking quite frankly that I feel like magic is doing he knew he had a few shots three of them in this case and he also knew\nThat he had enough equity in LA not to sweat coming into season without signing a big free agent because I think we can all agree that was the narrative is oh the Lakers miss old Paul George didn't even give him an interview\nI don't think magic cares 'cause this is what we know about magic\nOn Magic Johnson you know may finals I've been in [noise] [laughter]\nWell he's been in denial right and he's feel pretty comfortable and I think personally it's a heck of a Vegas strategic tight play little downside lotta upside says what do you think\nI agree and we're seeing the brown is the facilitator he has over nine assists this year per game that's the most in his career so far\nNo doubt about it when we come back we do it every Friday the wise is wise guy wisdom\nOn each and every NFL game that's RJ bell I'm Jonah knocks and this is the pre game show you always wanted right here on Fox Sports radio\nAround the\nTime to Dodger fan the Dodgers look out of short your\nTeam is down to games do you go to blame this one on Alex way Robert ... micro managing biased curse open when it comes to the world series\nOn Fox Sports radio\nOn this episode of the world shorter sitcom by Cassie\nIs inside accounts like what's inside my no\n... and ... and you can raise a chicken too large mashed potatoes and or biscuit for an ID not and I\nWhat really matters and it's pretty incredible what chicken you can teach\nYou about life [noise] anyway they're\nTo Howard group that was my point then are you for a job they posted a link in the ... best found ... really knew we had a higher and\nHigher people you won't find anywhere else with Lincoln jobs we look beyond job titles to match candidates with the right skills and experience\nYour role I thought we were looking for ... operation but we were really looking for an Oscar\nStart hiring with linked him go to Lincoln dot com slash Fox and get fifty dollars off your first stop her from the conditions apply\nIf you suffer from E.

Sports radio studios where it's easy to say Fifteen Percent or more on car insurance with guy go go to guy could comical eight hundred nine four seven auto the only hard parts figuring out which way is easier\nComing up in ten minutes from now you're on Fox Sports radio we will have best bets here on straight out of Vegas I Am just knocks the voice of the fan and he is the voice of Las Vegas RJ bell\nYeah we're on to have exclusively calling cowards pick number six we have actually pick six and seven today and let me tell you call in that I did not agree on everything today\nAnd a special surprise from coal and gas [laughter]\nNo [noise]\nPick number six [noise]\nAll right here we go to our picks this is the one\nThat I was going to put in place in fact there's one every week that doesn't make the cuts but I'm close\nRavens minus two at the Panthers a Carolina played a great fourth quarter but let's not forget they struggled for three I think Baltimore still one of the top five teams in the league and I think they can win by a field goal on the road that game should've gone to overtime last week against the St\nCarolina sneaking good at home but I take I wouldn't take ravens mind as to if this was in the ... what would the wise guy say\nCalling you got a lot of ... this is a horrible handicap my gosh now think about this if this line if it's ... in Baltimore you do the six point flip we always talk about it\nThe ravens would be eight and a half can you imagine the ravens eight and a half over the Panthers a good call yeah\nI get your instincts which is Carolina is a little overrated by the public but the marketplace is saying oh look how much better the ravens are bought Caroline at home they won eight straight and they're twenty six and six straight up\nAt home ravens on the road six and eleven there last Seventeen and oh by the way if you look and Caroline at home\nIn those three games this year the three no they rush for nearly five hundred yards this is a really good home team there just has to win against the below average row team love the Panthers hate the ravens\nA and it's just I just want to throw this out there because Bakersfield interesting the browns are getting eight eight and a half whatever it is a I Would I didn't I never considered for blazing five but I Do think it's funny RJ bell founder of ... dot com and they get funding for the listeners I wouldn't say that what it tells me as a couple of weeks ago\nThe browns for a one point dog to the chargers\nAnd then Vegas watch that and then watch them struggle for three quarters against Tampa\nAnd in Vegas is out on the ground that's what this line helping these teams played overtime a month ago and I think Vegas gotta look at Baker Mayfield against the pass rushed instead we're out because I see brown plus eight eight and a half I wouldn't take Cleveland here but I'm really interested in what the white guys in Vegas thanks\nMelissa nine times out of ten taking over touchdowns going to be the right side yeah we disagree here and I'll give you two quick reasons this is real simple\nThe browns were plus five turnovers against the Steelers in week one yes last three decades in the NFL teams that are plus five or a hundred and fifty eight six and one\nRight so the one is Cleveland so thick a hundred and fifty eight and six if you're plus five but Cleveland couldn't win that means the seal is really dominated the game and then would you say it better than anyone calling Mike Tomlin it's about a motion Steelers want revenge for the tie and\nThey're off of by so I think we gotta motivated Pittsburgh team that's clearly better\nYeah you know that's right I've been saying about Baker he got he got four turnovers against Tampa and they had a hundred and twenty yards through three quarters I and I people banging on a\nStamp Donald got nothing to work with playing great defenses and its own for a lotta touchdowns I I don't see it with Baker I don't see him as the number one pick and I just don't see it as often as too much dysfunction\n[noise]\nStraight are very similar Jay Powell find stuff there you can hear me grade from my wise guys says leading the way with that\nAll five of his buddies and five released Saturday morning you can get it on my Twitter at our Jay in Vegas if you are a long time listener you know what this means [noise]\nMe this crossfire time grow on pro violence\nAmong Green Bay Packers plus nine and a half at the rams the key is the scheduling here Green Bay is coming off of buying a came just at the right time Rogers was all banged up his wide receivers were banged up we're going to get a fresher better Green Bay team and they're looking ahead Green Bay to the schedule next week at New England they need this game contrast that\nLet's slow that down because this is a concept you brought up on our podcast that really I never thought of thirty plus years doing this you think okay\nPackers have a tough game here biggest underdog as we've said now a few times this week of Aaron Rodgers career nine and a half point a dog against the rams now that sounds like okay maybe they might think to themselves boys can be hard to win this one\nIs a looked ahead to next week and had a fairly reasonable game and easy game who knows if they are kind of looking ahead from the hard to win game was there\nGoing to New England the Packers are next week the U.S they're going to be over a touchdown dog likely in that game and if they lose both\nEight games in the season at that point Green Bay will be below five hundred so if you feel like you've got to win one or two in both are tough you're going to try your hardest in the first one and likely the second one especially if you don't win and to me that's an interesting concept I haven't heard discussed before\nYes so Green Bay ultra motivated now the rams during the sneaky bad scheduling situation they play three straight road game hey it looks good they're coming home right\nHowever that takes so much energy out of you and there's so many things that you can't do when you're in on the road when he finally come home he kind of exhale and you've got to do some things because these guys have lived outside distracted weak in LA\nNow this could be ... in his own personal home life [laughter] he was gone for a couple of weeks there'd be lifetime movies chocolates rose petals we're not going to judge we're just going to stay but all that said I agree with you Packers plus nine and a half says that's the best that we've gotten into\nRJ bell you are the voice of Vegas but you have a best bet and the NFC South\nYeah this is one way or it's an eye popping line we mentioned during the wisest wise guy wisdom is that\nThe forty niners with their record uh one is sixteen being a road favorite favorite by one over Arizona that's only happened one other time in the last Thirty years that one is sixteen has been a road favor so why\nCause Arizona just a few weeks ago one in San Francisco in San Fran\nSo you're thinking wow they can beat him there that can beat him at home\nBut if you look at that game it was another one of these five turnover games and we talked about five turnovers and that's something the Arizona was plus five in they win almost every game they won that one\nThe forty niners though had double the yard itch of Arizona so the scoreboard said Arizona but the truth was it was all about turnovers and turnovers are big element of luck now we wouldn't expect\nThere to be a ton of turnovers in this game so forty niners are clearly the better team rode favor by one my best bet is weak Joan is quickly you're too into what's your best\nBet you know I'm like uh the kid on the high died at summer camps just not ready to take the leap yet some of the\nAmerican Dream I tend to listen and listen to it too was unlikely for you so I I don't know we got thirty seconds MBA tonight you've got a bonus pick\nYet and be able to take the New York Knicks plus twelve hosting Golden State the game goes in just a little over half an hour and it's all about Steve Kerr and Golden State being overconfident when they're big favorites on the road when their favorite by more than ten points\nThirteen and one for against the spread end Golden State just got a big blow out when bad spot for them to sleep walk tonight against New York\nAnd the next had a tough loss should be motivated to think about that trend one more time when Kerr is favored by double digits was going to say no the road Thirteen and twenty four against the spread fast says go with the next great we guys\nThe odd couple next year on Fox Sports radio we are straight out of Vegas back on Monday for a full recap of the NFL and college football six pm

layer\nBeing in a a big market how much that all comes into play thing 'cause Coby\nWe can certainly argue on the merits of basketball Duncan was better but most people put Kobe ahead of him no ... no doubt LA obviously or an exciting style of play and you know but anyway we go to the staples center last night\nTo see not the Lakers home opener but their second home game again they certainly needed and uh they put it on a heck of a performance and beat the Denver Nuggets Denver had been on beating that ... gone for no\nHad beaten the Golden State warriors so you you joked I think you were joking that the Lakers hadn't won the game yet know Phoenix\nBecause they were playing does the Washington in general that ... that game doesn't count [laughter] although there is but last night they want\nTo get a vote that that was a task that was a measuring stick and they came up big\nThat game will mirror the other for the other three not the one that they wanted Phoenix yes around seven eight minutes they and and this was the plane went down no they were down yeah but they were down eight ...\nComes out I'm watching the game on spectrum light here out in Los Angeles and an ounce of gold this will be a quick blow for liberal and he'll be ... right\nAnd then they go they start playing well a ...\nTo ... back to back big three layers has been good right yup makes those wars on the drive and led absolutely\nAnd all of a sudden it's taught at a at a at a is tied up high and and\nThen the bronze break becomes instead of a blow\nBecomes a three minute break up because of the unions playing well so it was a big moment they ... they want a big game the only thing I'm going to say is just\nEverybody should just come down with a declaration like when they lose nobody's like saying oh that they can't win anything oh it's just gang three I mean what do you want to say but when they won last you know you were saying it was a must win game for no I was a must win\nA must win when you got Seventy eight\nGame no but I just think not not game for just thought that they could lose to the sun and they beat up to sun like they should have that's the game I was told right right and they beat him up good but I'm saying\nGet off this now the Lakers are back if I saw a Lakers are back it any more time we'll look at my watch what would they go with the Lakers are back ...\nExcited they're playing well\nAfter losing their first three\nThey win two games won over a team and was looking like all wanted a better teams in the ... you need to know just going to win every game Chris come out no but I'm\nJust saying like I'm just saying you weren't going the opposite way when they were on three you call the fourth game in an ab ... game season\nMust they do they\nMust when they needed to win that ain't going to win but there's no way that will go out to be a game left that there is a must win\nBecause if they would have lost that they probably would have lost the Denver to if they were the last of the sun they would have been down now feel strange\nLogic when it comes to LeBron and the Lakers I been it's been thirty two years man by lots of me\nI'll tell you but anyway Kobe Bryant was there and Coby was smiling and very comfortable\nAnd Coby he's been asked time and time again about how we feel about LeBron James being a Laker and he's just been completely supportive and you know what Rob there was a time when we first started saying is that I kind of odd yeah right he really doesn't want LeBron to succeed but you know what I'm starting to believe that he does\nI really think cold I'm gonna sit assume it's what's best for the Lakers I think he's old ... ... I think he's so comfortable in his own skin this has been one of the most impressive\nRetirement that I can remember in pro sports I usually when the guy retires a lotta times there are so hungry for\nThe attention that they just rush on the television and you can see they're desperate just to be in the spotlight I don't see that with Kobe Bryant he's obviously been great and his other endeavors you got the heads fun he's\nGot the uh you won the Oscar for his show on ESPN but details on ESPN and plus\nLike I said he just seems so comfortable\nIn his own skin\nThat I really believe in I think he's comfortable with what he's achieved I Want five championships I was a scoring champion I was in an VP\nNo no I mean Kobe I'm sure things you might be the best wherever but it doesn't really bother him\nThat he's not mentioned as the number one player in the world\nYeah all I I just think that it's human nature this is his place he was here for Twenty years\nWas he his place that was it was a magic no no no and it was shot but he was here for\nTwenty years he was drafted by a ... the uh Charlotte\nWhat what he said either by ... by the never played it on draft night it was quite a bit but he was drafted by on it\nOkay and all them says he spent his entire career here and those are the guys you talk about uh yeah they were here to what Twenty years I Wonder if we was
