the fan and he is the voice of Las Vegas RJ bell\nYeah in calling an eye for eight nine years now I have been grading with my wise guys\nHis picks sometimes we agree sometimes we disagree but with the stardust ran out of Vegas calling agreed to give his pick number six and every Friday six thirty eastern you hear it here first let's listen to it [laughter]\nNo no [laughter]\nPick number six [noise]\nHere's a bonus pick a Redskins got humiliated on a standalone Monday Night game they come back focused Carolina is sneaky good at home and can really be on even on the road I'm going to roll the dice take the Redskins who looked awful against the saints minus one or the wise guys think\nSo first off your instincts are really good idea if you're getting in front of the one they're motivated to come back and number two people don't want any piece right after she stayed but wrong in this broad agreement on the skin about matchups\nWashing is the number thirty against Bush number

going to be Caroline is best known and we're actually points Panthers more bad\nSo for don't want to agreement on my blazing five disagreement on the bonus pick ah RJ bell a brigade dot com exclusive provider of odds for the Associated Press have a great weekend our job but I can [noise]\nAnd that was this week's edition of colon cowards pick number six coming up ten minutes from now you're on Fox Sports radio it's money making time our best bets here on straight out to Vegas but not everything RJ\nHas to be such a combative debate you know what I mean you guys will debate from Tyler is more fun of course it is yeah of course it is but you know sometimes there's a little bit of harmony that comes into a disagreement and sometimes there's an agreement on some games\nAnd we start this week with the Tennessee Titans who find themselves two and a half point underdogs to the visiting Baltimore Ravens\nIf as both you and I liked the titans here\nWhy don't you make your case yeah and I did actually give this out on Tuesday straight out of Vegas as an early ... plus three still like the titans plus two and a half to remember\nWhat we do on Tuesdays given early bet you expect aligned to move so if you had better Tuesday plus three now not plus three listen on Tuesdays\nAnd probably my number one handicap is the Baltimore scheduling spot third straight road game for Baltimore that's really bad in fact if you went back to Nineteen eighty and all you did was betting against teams that were playing their third straight road game you cast fifty seven and a half percent of your tickets are day\nYeah we just talked about dean peas titans DC was with the ravens last year that's an advantage also though I think there's more fatigue with the ravens\n... on the road because they're just not a very good wrote team last for years they've only won about a third of the road games the ravens and you're saying why not just well they're favored they're supposed to win now they only went about a third of their own games which means that the tightened need to be a below average team for it to make sense to be\nA home under talk well we know the titans aren't below average and also when a team is off OTC like the ravens are and they play on the road next\nRight to think about that long game it's intense at the end now you got to go on the road last sixty times that's happened in the NFL\nThey've only won Nineteen twenty seven percent of the time they only covered thirty eight percent of the time\nShe got a bad road team and the ravens that tired off the tea and we got history telling us both the ravens don't win a lot on the road and no one in the NFL wins a lot when they're off O T followed by a road game ... to you and I the RJ approval titans plus two and a half\nGuys next up here we go to the NFC South where the disappointing Atlanta Falcons are currently a three point favorite over the visiting Tampa Bay buccaneers\nYou know we made an article we're going to save that one that's going to be my best theloop tease that spat on the falcons Brad let's talk a little bit of college you and says both agree on this big college get\nYeah and it's Washington at Oregon the ducks the three and a half\nPoint hall monitor dog and fast I like Oregon and the spot I think it's a good five you're talking situation like ducks off a by Washington back to back road games now a couple of weeks ago you were on the Oregon Ducks didn't get it whether it's a bad for you but I think that creates some value here on Oregon\nYeah because of Oregon had beaten Stanford and they had a Ninety nine percent chance to do so this line probably\n[laughter] [laughter] I don't know how many times you know that then move on\nWell listen I I wanted to be more like the fan so I decided to lose too in a row but I'm back okay I Am back and I like the chargers a pick them at the Cleveland Browns let's just be honest about the Cleveland Browns the vibe around the brown says that Baker Mayfield surreal Cleveland is back\nMe feels completing under sixty percent of its passage he's got his many interceptions is touchdowns but because it's so much better than it's been there it seems better than it really is I think the chargers go in I think they get a little bit of revenge for their Christmas Eve a beating a couple of years ago which gave that you're a browser only one of the season I like the chargers in a pick um\n[noise] I agree with one point you made which is I Do think charges or extra motivated\nBecause of that embarrassing loss of the browns a couple of years ago colon actually had the browns on his blazing five I gave him agreement\nI think the bronze the little sharper but I don't love it personally by the way you can hear all of my analysis of Collins picks it gets released tomorrow I tweeted out at our Jay in Vegas and Brad we've got\nYour very best that the whole week you've been given us the college knowledge this is the picky like the most\nYeah and I'm going a little off the radar here when I take two plus two and a half or Georgia Tech that do what's college basketball no darn soon and about a month or so but I tell\nYou but I always say this you must love this game 'cause it'd be no other reason about it\nAnd to me it's all about Duke and how they defend against the option number ... to ... the auction\nThe option often for Georgia Tech okay do cat an extra time to prepare for it last week Duke blast nine times they've faced option teams ain't wanting us to number do already played an option team this year and I bought this Georgia Tech\nPublic loves often no better off in college football last two weeks sixty plus points each game that create some value here on do take two plus two and a half\nOkay two plus two and a half college expert Brad powers\nNext up is RJ bell RJ best better the weekend so people can make a little bit of coin and pay their rent\nAnd remember I think anyone listening probably knows this but it bears repeating\nThe very best that in the world for as you may be sixty percent a couple of times a year you feel confident\nBut a typical back you make is gonna win fifty five percent of the time that's enough for you to have a mansion and a yacht correct correct so it doesn't matter if it's coming from RJ bell whoever's coming from be careful\nBut I Love the falcons we talked about the line move if you're that this last week the falcons were favored by six and a half now only favored by three at home against Tampa Bay wait a minute\nAt home against Tampa Bay the falcons are three\nWell what's home field advantage three so the betting market's telling me the falcons and the Tampa Bay bucks or even teams\nI might have believed that one fifth magic was in the house he's on the bench Winston I have no idea is is this first game talk about Ross talked about disconnect from the team\nI think humor with fitzpatrick I like it minus three the falcons I consider Winston at least in the first game to be a downgrade others might say flat\nBut certainly not an upgrade this has apes your value play\nThat the betting market the sharpest of the sharks have been betting against the falcons week after week true absolutely and they've been winning three you know and now they're finally it's like you're going in for that last\nDepp but they've pushed it too far there is no case it can be made the falcons aren't even team by the way last three home games\nThe falcons of scored a hundred and four points\nSo the falcons are going to get their point Tampa has the worst defense perhaps one of the worst in the NFL sort of the falcons are going to get their point you're saying when there's going to put up thirty no no no that's by the week RJ bell falcons
