ahead and went through a twenty seven when\nI say I can't play used it I Can't play the dolphins for two reasons one they've got injuries too but the kind of injuries that affect team's results but the marketplace Vegas the batters don't necessarily value enough yes\nThe dolphins have to ... that's been old news but now they're top too wide receivers are out but these are big name guys to the marketplace isn't reacting\nAs much as they would just say if the giants wide receivers were out\nSome injuries can be overvalued sometimes the quarterback will be out the market goes wild really shouldn't be that big of a deal is he's got a bigger name sometimes though when you have non quarterbacks that aren't big names out especially cluster injuries multiple injuries\nAnd the same position group so if your first and second wide receiver out now your third becomes your first your fourth becomes your second and who becomes your fourth [laughter]\nRight your third and fourth afford guy might be off the practice squad that's not a good thing market I don't you don't hear much of that that's why it's undervalued factor negative for the dolphins keeping me off the dolphins also\nThe dolphins have been in a very positive situational spot the last two games and now they're in a horrible spot\nYes they got two Midwestern teams Detroit in Chicago coming to their home eighty two degrees and great spot what that hot weather bug now think about the dolphins to play in that weather now they've got to play we'll back and play on a Thursday here on the road\nSo that hot weather especially in the bears game that was probably the deciding factor for the dolphins dolphins were dominating that game the first three quarters I mean you have to have a better game says I had the dolphins you had the bears you remember that I Do look at me confused while you\nWin some money many of them against me lately RJ I Can't keep a straight\nIt's like looking at a ... you're asked your grandfather like do you want sushi looks at whether you would sushi [laughter] he's looking kind of you know very concise should remember the one I wanted\nTo write you a thing but I guess I get that one should really stick out well I've been lucky lately but not now when I was in so think about a godsend magic situation when the Celtics used to have like a great home court you know even better than they do the ... floor I we talked about that yesterday\nIf the Celtics are especially good at home you're going to think yeah but they've got an advantage an extra advantage and once they're away from home you got to say may not transitions even bigger\nEvery NFL team has an advantage of home Miami when it's eighty plus degrees there in the light uniforms other teams in the dark uniforms combat fourth quarter the bears wilted\nAnd as you go from having a real advantage to straight games the dolphins did at home to the biggest disadvantage you can have which has been on the road on Thursday when you only have half\nThe time to prepare which means that travel time\nCuts into it more and it's just such a big effect and we've seen historically it's so hard for teams even cover on the road on Thursday so I Can't that Houston cause of Watson\nThe injuries and they're going to be less aggressive you would expect if they get any kind of lead camp but can't that Miami cause of the injuries are wide receiver and also I think there are a little overrated 'cause they just came off to advantageous situations\nWhen we come back\nWe're going to listen to calling cow herds tape\nOn

stocks the voice of you the fan and he is the voice of Vegas RJ bell\nWe pride ourselves most action packed our of the day is what we try foreign straight out of Vegas we only have one gas the week at this point you know I Am forty eight years old I got married when I was thirty eight\nAnd I told my wife I got a list and think of all the girls I dated how special to you have to be the I'm going to marry you well that's the way I think a great goes out and we only have one guest how good is the NFL Films almost forty years how you doing gray\nHey are you headed your wife respond to that by the way uh you know she said yeah she's my wife what do you think\nBoy I don't know if that's you know out of the rule book for doing that\nBut hey it's good for you [laughter] know revving a few rows of my day [laughter] I imagine if he didn't get married until you're thirty eight you're probably [laughter] it's true [laughter]\nDefense you know friend of the show Mike I'm barred he has a stat\nThe last three games they've only given up the Vikings defense five third down conversion yep how much better do they look on tape\nWell first of all they were historically good last year as a third down defense last year they gave up only twenty five percent conversion rate on third down which was historic this year they're below that RJ they're only giving up uh just over twenty three percent on third down and one thing I've noticed on tape that they're doing more of\nThere's more blitz and there's more than what we call cover one meaning man coverage with just a single high safety so they've become a little more aggressive in their approach\nThis was not the Mike Zimmer approach a number of years ago but I think he's recognized in this league that you have to play more men coverage and ... and if you really want to be effective\nAnd a what a game pick them hosting the same as well\nAs a really good one I'm I'm really looking forward to that one\nNo I agree with you Brown's you know we love databases here in Vegas 'cause at least then we can trust our instinct we don't have a database on for overtime\nIn seven games I Know debate we were debating before the show when you watch the tape on teams that are in these extreme spot\nDo you see the fatigue and the browns obviously played fairly well last week they came back late do you see this Brown's team as a tire team\nThat's always tough for me to see on tapes to be honest with you so I don't know the answer to that I think they're on an improved team\nI think unfortunately right now due to injury they don't have many weapons for Baker Mayfield on the outside they have Landry Jarvis Landry who is a very good slide receiver [noise] um but I think they're lacking weapons right now but I think may feel given that is actually developing very nicely\nUm defensively they're a team that likes to pressure the quarterback their high percentage of bullets\nRelative to the rest of the NFL or they're clearly and improve team and if they can get some weapons back on the perimeter then I think they have a chance to to ah spoil some teams as we hit the second half of the season\nTalking Greg co Sao he is the executive producer and analysts for NFL Matchup on ESPN that's moved to the giants\nI was just some New York radio today and I asked the question snacks Harrison got traded we got home snacks\nHow good was the cause if you look at various ranking\nYou would have thought one of the five or six best players on the team they said\nThe host they felt like he was the best defender on the team for a million dollars this year seven million next doesn't seem like seven million is all that much for your best defense or even next year you have any rationale on the tape to why they traded him for a fifth round pick\nWell first of all I'm sure they couldn't get more than that and I'm sure as good a player as he is\nA defensive tackle who is essentially a rung stuffer and he's very good at that RJ we're not saying he's not in fact you can make the argument that as a pure runs stuffing defensive tackle he's among the two or three best in the league has been for a number of years but I don't think that position is viewed as a premium position in today's NFL\nWhich take nothing away from his ability now I'm sure the giants look to trade 'em and all they could get was a fifth round pick which will likely speaks to the fact that that position is not in high demand\nWho that's fascinating so it explains may be why they could only get a fifth round of the judge doesn't necessarily explain to me why they would trade him but I heard what grade said it's fascinating Minnesota changing their scheme defensively\nCause of the modern NFL and it looks like the ... that are run stuff or is being undervalued police valued less if people are limit for\nPast Russia is a ... and again I'm not going to sit here and tell you that the running game is irrelevant but I think the feeling in the NFL if you talk to most coaches now is that explosive plays on our fence come out of the passing game your defense must be geared to stop the passing game\nA and you do that with a combination of two things\nPass rush and coverage and pass rush requires pass writers and Harrison as good a player as he is is not an inside past Russia or like an hour and Donald like and Gino Atkins those kinds of player she's not that guy for trick Cox's another name that would come to mind\nHe's dropping knowledge nuggets Greco cell you can get those on Twitter directly at great Cosell to last questions\nYou talked about passing explosive miss my home I'm sure you're sick of the color or you know you've been talking about um a bunch here's my specific question what are you seeing today on tape\nFrom the most recent game that we didn't see in week one two or three because the narrative is oh Andy Reid started really fast with his schemes last year with Alex Smith\nBut then the league caught up you get any sense that there was a downward trend cause leaks figure not schemes was my home's transcending that\nWell\nI think he'll France sent it to some degree which doesn't mean there won't be a bad game or because that's happens to every quarter back in the NFL at times\nBut I think the chiefs have a really good mix of a talented quarterback who can throw the ball far better than Alex Smith can but what they do RJ is they feature multiple personnel packages a ton of formation looks including a lot of shifts in motions\nAnd then when the ball snap there's a lot of Mr rejection and deception\nThere's a lot going on with this off fence and then you still have really good players see that's the other thing they do all these things tactically that would make it difficult for any defense but then you have Travis Kelsey ... kill Sammy Watkins Kareem Hunt you've got players\nAnd then there was I'm actually on the other side I lean towards Kentucky don't like it just ... just a leaner Kentucky and to me it's about the Missouri quarterback drew lack getting a lot of love for being a first round draft pick is not a first round draft pick when he plays good defenses and Kentucky's gotta top I'd even in his career\nTwenty one touchdowns twenty eight interceptions against power Feibel teams I don't want Missouri here\nWe're going to take a look ahead at Thursday Night Football coming up momentarily we do it unless you know though that straight out of Vegas has brought to you by guy go everybody's got to do list drop off the dry cleaning pick up some milk here's an idea let's add save hundreds of dollars on car insurance and the good thing is you don't have to drop off or pick up anything all you have to do is go to guy go dot com\nAnd in Fifteen minutes you could say Fifteen Percent or more on car insurance extra money in your pocket it may just be the most rewarding to do that you do today week eight in the NFL kicks off later on in Houston it's the Texans holding steady at age seven and a half point favorite over the Miami Dolphins\nOkay we decided in the ... are we talked about it in the first segment and by the way if you\nMissed it or miss any of the show just go to your favorite part player search RJ bell you will see straight out of Vegas\nAnd the boys in LA get that baby out fast so you can hear right after the show if you missed anything\nWe said we can't bet this Thursday night game on the side why sober touchdown Houston's quarterback watching banged up so we're a little bit worried about them getting conservative with the leave Miami do their first and second string wide receiver out cluster injuries the market doesn't properly account for that\nThat makes me in ... it makes it impossible for me to bet Miami says you come to the rescue you love the props the proposition bad especially on the big t._v. games you got a free pass that bonus\nYes Houston's to Sean Watson to go under twenty three rushed yard so it was total rushed yards for the game to go under twenty three check this out RJ his first five games of the year he rushed for thirty six or more yards every game then he got the Bruce chest with the bruised along the last two games to yards\nThirteen yards clearly Houston does not want him to run the ball injured we're going under twenty three rushed yards to Sean Watson\nAnd it's about minus one ten or so about even ... yes that's the feds again if I ... I tell you John's I'm Conan audible we forgot in our ... our four team are now we did not want anyone to think Brad powers and what is this is a fourteen money line parlay in college football which is teams you just think how could they lose\nWink wink they tend to lose and would add to that was Brad started to do now loser loser loser these ... are tough let's go through it quickly for teams that you say if they just when you when this fourteen back give me the team's first\nYup Utah State B.

is on the on the men are both going to\nDo it do to match up from hit hurts a pitcher you they are writing and ... and it better on it you know what it is totally to be good at this point in time\nYou don't have any game to give away the in the regular season you can try thing but when it comes down to the come down and that's what it is right now the world's theory right for the one winner walking away\nYou got to come out with guns blazing put your bet out there no matter what I don't care you want to be my best job it right on your I'm not going to be like no number again and you see this happening in the NBA will not to the extreme 'cause you'll never see the start sitting on a bit why people are wrong because he struggled to free throws\nOr not in a game is\nNot going to happen so it's just it is it's kind of mind blowing to see that ... that this is happening at the state of the game but again this is this is what what the direction that sports are gone and it's all about analytic then\nIs it is one away from the field of the gang I mean day Robert Philip bias in a game\nWe buy your first guest wasn't it when you were watching didn't you go why are you\nThe second guess those are ... and I think everybody watching that game was like what he just mowed down the ... this is sue battery defaced\nAnd the and the thing is guys you know\n... they prepare for those moments their own life they have this moment right now and he's he's like I finally got here this is what I've been dreaming of doing and I'm doing exactly how I thought I'm just gonna walk right I'm a ... cat down they're not going to have a chance to test me and to get taken out of frustration on his\nFace now coming out because I'm quite sure that when he went home that night his wife ... girlfriend whoever is significant\nOther you know heard a lot a he had a lot to say to them the lead\nOh yeah no question about well let let's get to the NBA Eddie and there's a report out now for major was arouse get ESPN that the Houston Rockets are making an offer\nFor Jimmy Butler obviously with Minnesota and the rockets are offering for future first Albert ex must now you remember the last time this happened was when Brooklyn gave a bottles pick right gee and Paul Peirce and they're still suffering for it\nI'm not sure this is a bat window because obviously those peaks aren't going to be that good will use the ... what do you think about uh this offer\nA from Iraq has now the players it'll have players to make the salaries were you know they're not going to be stars or anything like right and you know big time rotation players but what do you think about this\nIt's funny that you said that uh not used at Brooklyn analogy because that's the first thing I thought about it was like okay you get a mortgage a future for right now but are you sure for right now this is the thing where Houston\nDoes that put him over the edge you you're going to mortgage a future for right now window argue with the addition of Jimmy ... are you still good enough to beat the Golden State warriors\nAnd some will say yet some would say no I I think if the warriors or or click it we have yet to see all those players click at one time it seems like it's always to care and\nThe other three it's kind of lifestyle so games or whatever you might have three two guys who were really good game one with a solid gay and everybody else kind of just getting in where they fit and so you haven't seen that dynamic yet so it to me it kind of scares me like hey\nGolden State is still tough but if you are using you felt like\nChris Paul not getting hurt you had a chance to clip them lesser you add a guy like Jimmy brother who is just as good a defender if not better than ever read the butter better score you feel like oh we have a chance to beat him so I don't I wouldn't I don't I look at it as a good thing because now what is going to do is going to put some pressure on the Golden State warriors\nHave to play perfect basketball almost because\nI Would agree yeah they are now I I agree with you that I think Golden State still is better but they're Houston is right they're very close\nI'm not you know that they're right where I think a lot easier I ... I don't not to dwell on it seemed to miss them but then there's an even better and better I I got here and that's", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Steve Gorman SPORTS!", "city": "Iowa City", "day": "25"}
