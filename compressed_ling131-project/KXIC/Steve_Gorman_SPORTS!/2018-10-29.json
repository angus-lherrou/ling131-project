I'm On the opinion that died Texas Tech was are trying to take out ... and the game a lot I think there was at least two if not three roughly in the past or personal fouls against him I'm I'm just wondering what you guys just thoughts on that\nKnow being that he is the Eighteen year old freshman jets\nTrying to be physical and knock him out of the game and is it possible that they knew or had heard rumblings about ... I'm not being dressed and things like that and and really\nFelt like that was a good chance for them to increase their percentages of winning by knocking pretty out\nMan I I certainly don't believe that was the case I thought that um I Do think this and thinking for the call Matt know through the use age between the two teams Iowa State was clearly the more discipline football team on Saturday and it's quite some of those tax penalties\nWhere I I I'll admit they were questionable but again it came down to putting yourself in a bad spot and tech was the team that was continuously doing that all four quarters at a football game or Iowa State really played a nice discipline game\nWell I just went went back and watch the telecast with the very first time I was actually calling the Texas fan or a I'm Sorry the Oklahoma game\nFor Kansas State this weekend so as I watch the game a it was repeatedly talked about how many pounds of these uh you know Texas Tech had not only just stay in bed previous games one of the worst penalize teams in the big twelve conference with obviously a weakness on that football team they're very aggressive but yeah they were playing\nYou know sometimes you don't ask for the west or or uh you know obviously in some sort of illegal way are on top of a rock pretty does play a style where he runs around\nUh he's sort of put themselves in harm's way sometimes and ah you know anytime you're you're halfway McWhorter back at this point you have to be you know really careful making sure you're sort of on all the different rules and\nAnd ways they can call ... now so I think they were there just undisciplined football team I think I Would say that's one of the reasons they when\nThey don't turn the ball over very often in particular day of my ...\nUh and they don't penalize themselves you know get on these very often and so that sort of style football that sort of high quality well coached a football don't be yourself and I think that's where you just sort of saw difference with two coaches to young guys difference between the Texas Tech I coach a kings variant that\nSam said we did learn today a alluding to what Matt said that ... his ah transferred here he's transferring from Iowa State I'm not entirely surprising when a\nA freshman jumps into depth short like the first of all what's your reaction to that and and secondly I'm you know is it the ... the timing of it is a little bit on what what how did you react when you heard the news today\nYeah you know I don't know all the exact rules of the trans first off of you know when to transfer when you can and how much you have to sit out and all those things I could definitely see I'm transferring at the end of the season as you said that that's for me the\nTime he was a bit surprising that I'm In that spot I understand sometimes you know these guys want to play\nYou know they they were great high school players they wanna play college football I'm not sure how much she was going to play going forward I'll be in that I was his quarterback is a freshmen I have no issue with was dumped transplant I get a great kid from my conversations with them or you know during the season is a is an unusual situation but you know to me\nUh he's been nothing but uh you know quality you know good kid a you know something about your your your mate I Wish they crowded\nAnd I enjoyed watching them play a and then hopefully find a school that uh or that he can play more and and you don't have a chance to be successful and chase their dreams and so you're not you're learning the I think in the NFL is threatened never\nAre getting to the middle of some other players contracted tuition you might be holding the house or whatever you don't get involved that's another man's business and I think in a situation like this\nYou know he has his reasons for transferring them and I think that is I Would say fancy ... runs down right by the university and by the football team in my ... from the ...\nWill get to Jeff in jak here before we take a break there was one line open right now at five one five to wait for five nine six six to ... thanks for calling sack reaction Jeff\nHi guys or if you can't justify taking out a Standley because of the poor play how can you justify that seeing ivory Kelley Martin because he bumble DePaul one\nAt a early in the second quarter I think he never saw the field the rest of the gay\nWhat are your best weapon out of the back the oldest the path receiver and because he put the ball underground one time on a sloppy wet field you bang for Tim Stanley throws three intercepted that you'd never ... I'll hang up but\nThanks Jeff I appreciate it I'll take a shot at that and I think it's separation of competition\nThat ... I'm just taking the gas and I'm gonna let Chuck weigh in on this because he's the guy to the experts I talked to my right about that though that\nThe reason that you are quick to do ... pull the trigger at running back is because you've got another guy or two guys that are right there on that depth chart with your one there's obviously separation between one into a quarterback or we would have seen the change my over thinking this\nYeah no you're not that part of it uh they have the other guy and a lot of running back coaches today or\nWill say hey if you put the ball that will get the next guy at an Iowa has the next guy in that position now that every physician but that one day do so it it it helps the competition it helps the false security\nAnd you know interceptions yeah don't want to watch the interceptions and and quarterback can make bad decisions or their substance but she don't know about that when you have the ball and and you put it on the ground that for coaches\nDon't like that you know that's 'cause you have it in your possession\nWhere the interception of balls in the area that can happen where the ball's area by then the receivers fall by to bed a miscommunication a body than a ... a misread it who knows what it is but the balls and in your head that you\nHad your drop it that's a no no that's the that's the sand when it comes to coaches and\nOr to the coaches and that's why it with the next ... mentality that's why the running back ... batch right after one bubble and a lot of case\nTo it for five nine six six jak calling from Des Moines hey Jack how you doing on Monday\nHey guys thanks for having me you bet um hey yeah I like families got the physical tools he's got a strong arm\nBut to me on Saturday it just looks like the game was too big for him and I I don't know if the game just has been slowing down slow down or I'm it doesn't seem like and you see glimpses bad and other games to where he just you know he's sort of Getty are excited and\nYou know makes a play that's kind of have a scratching our heads you know and I don't know if it's just like he hasn't played against the top level competition we sort of looks like a small town Wisconsin high school quarterback and\nDoesn't have that moxie or pedigree that other guys thanks so I'll just take your answer off the phone off line thanks I\nWouldn't interesting word to use their moxie it's uh it's actually word it's it's a word funny enough that Chris and I were thrown around over the weekend talking about rock Bertie ... ... which said when you see Nate Stanley do you see something missing there and that and that confidence moxie whatever it is\nWell so here's what I sort of mock is always been I there's there's been mocked me and confident and then a cocky now\nYou know I I felt Baker maybe you'll have a mix of sort of ... you could say ... you can also confidence you could also say with talk you know I don't need the cock you know I brought her party I see the confidence\nOr ... and the ... and so uh you know he reminds me a little bit of Drew Brees\nAt least ... ... you know talking about him first\nThere there's something about him make his teammates better and I think as a quarterback whether you're six foot Dexter or five nine it could make the guys around you better or does that how you unproven off and that's how you're sort of affects everybody not only on the opposite really the entire football team you know the question is do you guys think\nMake family makes the other guys around all that Iowa roster particular they often\nHe make them better than they actually are the some of the part I I don't know if he does that but I haven't watched as much film and as many games are you guys have\nHey this funny you said Drew Brees said I I said another drew than I thought pretty reminded me of on Saturday save your Chuck it looks like drew Tate\nHe's not a real big guy he's real shifty back there in the in the pocket I mean right now I ... and he said the secrets like I could definitely see rock pretty not necessarily having an NFL career but almost being a Canadian football hall of famer like he's just he he looks like drew tapes me back there so is that first age is is that\nYeah you know I I was this\nYou know something about the down the metal the same off a play at them but I thought they were often goes windows tight and still and that's where I think we've dealt with a plan even though we're new it's those two guys and bald early in the game I Know a lot better all\nFive one five to eight four or five million six six I'm sage I Do have a question for you and I want to make sure we get to the Senate\nAnd run and Eric hang on we're going to get the problem is um\nWhat's his name his name oh Hugh Jackson yeah was higher today by the Cleveland Browns ... name [noise]\nUm is going to an already is being reported as a potential candidate for that one with your knowledge of the NFL how how realistic that the the Campbell would be a target where there's a Ohio ties for the Cleveland Browns\nOr I I don't think the Ohio ties help him out you know really an R. and I think that was the NFL game is simply different than college football it is and what a Campbell's greatest strength\nIs that he's a really good recruiter he does a lot of good things while he's a really good people person either you're communicator uh obviously he's hired some really good assistance you've changed ... culture here at Iowa State\nOr to drop a program through a sort of a different level but that doesn't mean we can be a good at us all head coach I've seen it before I played for next David Wright who's the greatest coach in the history of college football and he failed in the NFL so I don't think\nThat uh you know make sense or any of it what ... Campbell take the job if they're going to offer ... I'm probably should I mean they're going to give 'em probably they would give 'em like six million dollars a year with ... had coaches make and so\nI don't think that's going to happen I think that you know that the NFL usually hires NFL head coach it\nUh and that just sort of what they do they are the higher coordinators or whatever they sort of keep it within the league it's sort of two different coaching ... for the most poignant occasionally a college coach moves up to the NFL I just don't think Matt Campbell is that type of coach 'cause he has no NFL history\nBefore that it wasn't like he was a guy who played the league for a long time coached a little bit in the NFL it you know he's never really been there I just don't see an end up I'll franchise a building or making a decision off a guy who was never been around that dial in and that type of football\nOne other question for you revolving the NFL again butler and David Montgomery from what you've seen this year how ready are those guys and if you were ... you know a scout giving them feedback what would you say about them potentially going early on the other side I Know of mantle walked in he looks like it at least\nUm well as far as you know butler concerned uh\nI'd like to know what his forty time is and how he doesn't somebody's bangs or you know some sort of combine things up how high he'd be drafted I when I watch him why he's about around the whole prospect on al ... was I I can tell you that right now he's got quicker feet\nHe's better going up a snack and the football away and you just started a little more flexible\nAre much more fluid in the ... I don't know how fast is you know he runs for seven you know he's not going to have much of a chance to direct before for eight or something like that or is that length ... ... what frame or you can't coach that ah you know that leaves a lot touchdowns and the red zone they are also if you'd have a lot of value there so I\nI think both these guys are going to play on Sunday I really do believe that and again Montgomery is that they like those guys that are really fast and the NFL it's just it's\nThe way it is but the guy that can do a lot of things well catch the ball well uh you have the right balance you know you see the kids in ... in Kansas City ah who played for Campbell elite off or Kareem hot\nYeah he's bigger than David Montgomery but they have a very similar style great agility great balance can do everything after a multi purpose back I think both you guys got play Mulligan and probably for a while\nLet's get to run and Eric ... Iran wants to talk I was state Eric wants to get us up to date on one of our conversations regarding the hockey guys Ron from Grimes how are you sir [noise]\nGuys thanks for taking my call 'em just wanted to ask John mentioned earlier about the uh how many points Iowa State led up to Texas Tech and I just add\nAnd see what he thought about um you know they gave up a special teams give up the block party for touchdown um those special teams Potter also are kind of a lousy\nA problem finding the ball and they're really short field which gave up you know the three and then rocks or let's say rocks own moxie put him in the same position that or to give up a sack and if I'm On the end zone so although I like that yeah yeah it's\nA rabbit correct it was they gave up about ... points in that bone or something like that I mean it was it was really an incredible difference about her\nYeah I I thought they did better than what maybe the points showed on there and some of that stuff is uh I'd like to thank hunting was could be fixed a little bit they know that that uh that court can kick the crap out of the ball but it's in his head or what it is but\nUm and then um\n[noise] the talking about democracy of the freshman I'm Brock I'm\nI've been around for college kids that ah you know they have a little bit of an adjustment period where you know they come from school and they're the guys are the best man on the field they can do whatever they want and get away with it because they are so much far superior talented and\nI think sometimes she kinda like well you got ... you know when I'm at sparing chart or any kind of got up and said wow you know it's like he worked with the big twelve kind of thing and then same thing on that ... in the end zone I'm you know\nI get myself out of this I'm going to solve this I've been here before act and I'm the best guy or whatever so so learning curve things I think there that you can probably gained from there as well I'm an ... I wanted to push back on a comment you made that bought the best freshmen in the NC double a\nUm I think he's the names I don't know I don't think he's in Perdue but that's just my opinion\nThanks a lot ... a lot to chew on their age um [laughter] what juries what's your reaction to the\n... as a chart talked about before there's a couple of different ways you can try to train\nA quarterback and and uh ... uh one is obviously been trained about before you know like the the college game this red thing\nSome of the AARP yo stuff you can tell he's run this stuff a lot of students through his puppy entire high school he played at a in an office somewhere to this there's just no way that he came from high school and automatically understood\nAnd obviously you know in ... well no I I think though you know take care of at the end of the season so I really do believe they're going to win either so that was the last five\nOr or there'll be back in ... and go five foot five I I really do believe that obviously it's first things first who they played this weekend and ... and all those things but if they play the whether they've been playing these last three games I don't see them lose anybody other than possibly attacked us I think that'd be a very good football game\nYeah I've crunched the numbers and\nIt's incredibly if Iowa State takes care of business and I they're going to be about a\nPort team point favorite this weekend they are going to be around a Thirteen fourteen point favorite next weekend they're going to be about a four to five point underdog depending on what happens in Texas in West Virginia this weekend at Texas if they take care of business they should play for the big smoked championship they should now\nThere are a few like West Virginia would win out and like there's some junkie things that can happen but I Would say like if there's like one of those like predictor deals\nIf they take care of business in control their own destiny there's probably like a Ninety Ninety five percent chance that I Wish they would play for a big tall championships because TCU is not going to be a factor and they've lost to them on a tie breaker they really need to worry about\nUm Oklahoma it'd be great if Oklahoma I but I think as a team they're gonna end up playing um\n[noise] take care of business and you should play for the championship it's pretty it's pretty much that simple Thanks Michael British and Michael Hi to more than you like about that\nJustin from urban Dallas up Justin\nHello hello hello\nAnd I didn't hear that hey I'm Joe ... stay away from the game or look at Iowa State game ... office was firing all day and that you're driving down at the end of the games were touched down in the same thing with Penn State although there was a a comedy of errors there um but he's put him in a position to win\nAnd so that's why you don't fall a nice family out one more thing I'm retired surgeon\nIowa has had a history of playing the hot and I and running back when they have multiple running backs like I knew this year\nAnd I you know they fly all the guys but my highest charge really came through in the great game I think that's one of the things that we're missing from this whole deal that kid played a great game and I couldn't be more primary hand so go ...\nJustin thanks to the phone call man right a couple of more here it's a Donovan who's up next calling from urban Dale Donovan\n[noise] hey guys are kind of a question for Chuck so I Know families and take a lot of heat your last couple of days so I decided to go back and look at the stats from last year to this year and really numbers don't lives of take a look at two thirds of the season or a games\nThrough his stats are identical so Seventeen hundred yards fifty six percent completion\nSixteen Seventeen touchdowns the only difference is for versus eight interceptions so eight this year or so in reality the numbers are really identical so as a coach is as you go back and look at that Chuck Tuesday a you know you're you're on pace\nTo to do as well as your last year which gave him all the preseason accolades are are there are higher expectations a second year in the program a there is always\nHigher expectations here to um you want you know fans why coaches want they want that you're too to be better than your one sometimes that's not the case\nFor as a sophomore Jay before or people have gone through the core of extras lawsuit that why is there a sophomore Jay well before the new laws for the higher you know they they do what your strengths and weaknesses are by studying the tape all year long\nThat's why oftentimes because that's a really good first year at that level off a little bit here and then go back you hopefully this ball there but you want and it could be sold that because it did before studied your hey\nBut that's what we call the five five that's like a show of it but it's going to show me\nThat there is so gross you understood that was the best thing that you wish that it was chaotic called me that shows that you know the other ... that that's why they ask people a little bit for but\nThanks Donovan appreciate the phone call sir and we'll wrap things up with another urban deal color Troyer buddy from urban what's up Troy\nA great show guys is always um with all the success that uh\nSome not tall quarterback than having that long for example at Purdue doing very well for a freshman coach song and I wanted out stage as well about Drew Brees got the got the record a coach law when you're a coach that Iowa and they are excuse me Ninety\nOr did you recruit Drew Brees and what's your take on him on his level of success is athleticism when he was recruited and how he's performed throughout his career\nLike its age thoughts on as well\nWell let me go ahead Chuck nobody\nKnew recruited group reached that that one person we're all wrong [laughter] it was it was it was a heck of a high school football player\nAnd he threw the ball but everybody saw short it deserves that great you know solid radar but\nHe fooled everybody one of those guys slip through the cracks that everybody a joke teller for do\nJust started his uh basketball I grabbed the last ... or do the ball around and we we can get this kid is perfect persistently Purdue idol but ...\nAnywhere near on the radar for retail the Austin, Texas studies affects us get\nIt probably wanted to go to University of Texas but they didn't require the bitter but sometimes you know those old tell little suppose a state schools don't recruit\nIs that everybody else around the country goes all older softball with them but they're not going to ask them to write the back yard that's exactly what happened at Purdue joke to lower than the rest of this ...\nSage almost ironic man you mentioned ah you mentioned that Drew Brees comparison road really show here\nI did and our debt that biking game last night and and actually talked to drew for and in fact the game of movement came out in two thousand one together first met him at the\nAt the combine and Indianapolis and uh you know you would ever he was the most likeable guy uh you know I remember having lunch with them one time ... was ... for doing it with patriots for about a dozen years a witness or do anyway\nWe're talking I could just tell how much like respect that Matt ... had you know for his quarterback but basically drew was the guy who\nWould you have this sort of an infectious a personality and inability to make everybody around him better you know he just loves to work and grind a token as though he's the guy you know he's been knocked down a million times why he's been told is too short ... not big enough or whatever\nAll that stuff has driven him to be one of the greatest quarterback medical history and and I do believe\nYou don't have to be six or six three or six five to be a good college or pro quarterback I think that's been one of the most you know over rated aspects of this position when when people are trying to judge them I Want a guy that makes their their team better Druze been doing that\nFor you know his entire life abroad for doing that for three weeks now making guys better on around them in and they're both very very fun to watch\nShark and said we'd love Monday's man thank you guys so much for giving this time awesome
