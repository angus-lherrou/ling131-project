two and a half at home this is about home field\nIf you think about it ravens are says what seventh or eighth best home field any NFL number five actual wow is what you got saints are one of the teams that rely on home field the most so if you combine that and say which series with teammate versus team be\nWould home field matter the most this'll be one of the top seven or eight that plus being below a field goal I think we're gonna be talking about this ravens game in a little bit\nGuys the Washington Redskins are at one point favorite hosting the Dallas Cowboys\nThis is all about Dallas

these Fox Sports radio affiliates here on straight out of Vegas however he offers a bonus pick and it's called this [laughter]\nNo no [laughter]\nPick number six around bonus pay only for RJ bell\nAnd only for our audience here [noise] ah I Would take the bears plus three against the patriots New England off a while I mean plus we know what's New England and there are consistent but that was the game of the year in the NFL that was the best regular season game and the NFL in about three years [laughter] I think a little let down\nThe weather's getting little choppy now and ... the last two games with Matt nagging chop it up then okay so I Would take to bears plus three in a mild upset or otherwise guy said [noise]\nWell we have to have\nA few wise guys around the table here says I'll let you step in where did you think of that\nCollins pick well I liked the bears as well and it wrong oh [laughter] oh\nMy power ratings RJ I have both of these teams approximately the media has them in the same spot that I've got them and I have a three and a half point difference and how good they are known as ... points better than if it were on a neutral field\nPassively favor by three and a half right so because the bears get almost a field goal for their home field I simply have to like the barest if I'm getting plus three\nOkay so what you're saying is it let's assume just three so if New England is three and a half points batter you're given the bears three for home you're saying you're English it'd be like favorite by half a point yes instead they're favored by two and a half\nYou know what's funny you had the same analysis or we were talking the same game in our crossfire battle yesterday you different analysis it feels like he's just kinda\nYou know like a ... you ever notice when you are in your bedroom and the lights are off and you're trying to find the light and you're like feeling along the wall feels like that's the feds\nAnd he kept in my handicap yesterday felt like I just woke up and I was trying to find the wall and I was ...\nYears old but now you've woken up oh I don't know maybe but let me ask you a few questions what about ... point and it was a good one\nAnd when we did our podcast ... really smart guy but he he really looked up to ...\nAnd when you had to pick on the bears he came running in from the control room to press the green button against you I've never seen anything like it\nThat maybe should worry you but he made the point about Maggie and ballot check and read the whole idea ballot check just went against read that's trouble for ... where did you think\nYeah I thought it was a great point frankly was not part of my initial handicap earlier in the week when I like\nThe ... year handicaps changed four or five [laughter] here's what I'm predicting when the patriots cover\nThe costs us off my ... I Try and do the authors of evil and all this\nThat's my prediction guys are pros or an agreement and onto games this weekend in the football world but before we get to that I Do want to let you know we were brought to you by guy go where everybody's got to do list\nDrop off the dry cleaning pick up some milk here's an idea let's add save hundreds of dollars on car insurance and the good thing is you don't have to drop off or pick up anything all you have to do is go to guy go dot com and in Fifteen minutes you could be saving Fifteen Percent or more on car insurance extra money in your pocket it may just be the most rewarding to do\nYou do today today here on straight to Vegas are pros are in agreement and up all the games this weekend on the board there are two\nThat the pros light\nAnd two that they agree on the first one is in the NFL it's the ravens a two and a half point favorite hosting the saints\nGame this is the flip side of what we do on Thursdays at six thirty ... is the crossfire battle here we both agree fat it's Baltimore we talked about the home field ravens underrated home field St need home field what else makes you agree with me and like the ravens\nWell to your point of home field and what strengthen the home field for Baltimore the weather forecast fifty degrees looks like the winds can be Fifteen to Eighteen miles an hour we got a dome team pursuit in often when\nWhen precision that's true that's going to be a problem for the St look at this ravens team this these ... this is going to blow your mind it really really is there's been six games ravens a play this year\nNow we're gonna take navy plus twelve and a half simple handicap it's all about misleading finals involving these two teams from last week that creates some value on navy first stop navies opponent Houston last\nWeek blah went over eat Carolina going in the box score Houston aided by four turnovers plus for turtles to Houston at the negative this week navy on the other side of the reason why like navy last week\nThe head coach for navy Kenny amounts of low if that's the worst fall he's ever seen in his coaching took a touched off the board and prevented navy from winning a game gimme gimme gimme gimme the many plus twelve and a half\nYou know something you actually sound a little bit like haystack various points for that [laughter] what was that guy's name Kenny amounts of low low [laughter] now I can promise you a haystack would not know how to use that to say that ... and ... why would the Hawaiian guy [laughter]\nA guy who made a joke is real quick yeah your two and two on your best bet yeah sure am and you're sitting on a two and two\nI don't I look I learned the terminology from you guys being in the square chair that there is a lean and there's a lake and I lean a couple of games but I don't like anything enough to ruin my two into record\nWill listen you've got to appreciate demand so humble that he sits on a tour in Iraq\nAt least I could do a Steve ... however he is our NFL expert here I'd straight out to Vegas and he's got a best buy for the weekend\nYep I like the forty niners plus nine and a half I bet the forty niners plus nine out\nIt is all about the horrible scheduling spot for the rams this is the third straight road game as it turns out if you just blindly bet against the team in the NFL and the third row game you would cash fifty seven percent of your tickets so we want to look to go against that team\nAnd that third straight road game and I think that this is particularly bad\nLet's look at these road games at Seattle tough physical game they win by two at\nDenver an altitude close game they win by three Sanford's get to the rams do now the ramp suddenly plays San Francisco this is the game I think they could look past I like the underdog the forty niners plus nine and a half\nYeah I agree with you here I I mean bastard\nWas about as bad as you could get last year how much of you upgraded him for the forty niners upgraded to him by three points for the year two points just for the Green Bay game he looks so good against the Packers so and sometimes less than ... ... it was a different age but Terry Bradshaw was being bench in its fourth year\nBy guy guy named Terri Han ratty from Notre Dame yeah there you go [laughter] rocky Blair from Notre Dame speaking of Notre Dame were you thinking about them but Brad these days to buy this [laughter] this is [laughter] I I'm going to give my best bet\nIt's the same game fast but it's the total what's the total over under a total point I Can't believe this trend hadn't been discovered I hadn't seen it anywhere and a lot of people probably are going to say arguing why would you give the world this trend\nI listen I Love to win money but I honestly love to get I think by let's say I'm going to win whatever you know less than ten thousand bucks than any bad I may give it to one team unless you said that what\nHow many people are going to bet this total that I gave right now\nRight we got ... you know six figures listening that's you know a fact it's going to be you know hundreds of thousands of dollars probably going to be bad on his game to me I Do I Love money but I feel we've been better about it\nIf the bookies who I hate or losing across the country in games were the home team is an underdog in more than eight points we talked about is that the home team tends to cover\nBut those games go under a crazy amount of time under the total last twenty games in that spot\nTo win Eighteen against the spread checked out to an Eighteen towards the under so to over Eighteen ... [noise]\nThat's pretty strong under rams\nIt's best bet is what the odd couple comes up next we are straight out of Vegas back on Monday six pm eastern time three o'clock Pacific right here\nOn Fox Sports radio\n[noise]\nJulie Leslie deal to Howard group out there with my fourth and our meals for a job I posted a link and we didn't have to sell ... loves the really good I knew we had a higher and\nHigher people you won't find anywhere else with Lincoln jobs we look beyond job titles to match candidates with the right skills inexperienced\nYour role I thought we were looking for a tractors operation that we were really looking for an Oscar\nStart hiring with Lincoln Lincoln dot com slash Fox it gets fifty dollars off your first job in terms of conditions applied\nAnd now I fought from Geico motorcycle it took Fifteen minutes to purchase the gas station eggs Charlotte [noise] eat the gas station ... and regret the gas station ... as you presented\nNumbers to the board [noise] sweat insult to injury you could've used those Fifteen ... minutes just what's your motorcycle insurance the guy go oh a\nGuy go fifty minutes good safety Fifteen Percent or more\nOn motorcycle insurance\n... coach may spend the rest of his life in prison when he's sentenced on child sex charges among charges Greg Stevens pleaded guilty to our five counts of sexual exploitation of a child\nIn court it was revealed that around four hundred boys were the victims of Stephen through explicit photographs or videos he could get up to a hundred eighty years in prison money sentence Patrick Thompson has been sentenced to life in prison for setting a fire in western Iowa that killed his twelve year old stepsister under sixteen year old cousin last year\nThompson was convicted of two counts of first degree murder and one count of arson and the judge now has sentenced him to spend the rest of his life in prison without the possibility of parole\nProsecutors say motive was to stop his stepsister from testifying against their father for sexual abuse there been a lot of telephone scans and the past few years but this one may be a new low\nThe information the message was that her daughter who they named by name was deceased [noise] and they requested that this person reply to the text message\nAnd that's when they start asking for personal information Johnson county deputy sergeant Brent ... tells our new partner K.
