the college football playoff community is going to do and where they're going to make a mistake for so we do it every Tuesday\nPros versus the world what does that mean means Vegas pros fantastic and Brad go against ESPN calling coward and the Associated Press let's start with ESPN no sacred cows and no vendettas here we I Love ESPN in many ways not every way\nI says give me the team that you think ESPN is the most wrong about and they're talking heads poll\nDallas's underrated ESPN has the number Twenty one\nI have them number Thirteen RJ\nAlright so ESPN Twenty one you Thirteen so Dallas is above average I always like to hear who's fourteen whose twelve who who's right around Dallas 'cause in theory that's going to be a pick 'em game if they were on a neutral\nAnd we could say the ... or ... going to go is freaking crazy\nChicago is number two well move the adult number forty and oh my God\nI Would say Seattle or Chicago pick him over the cowboys Brad powers what would you do\nThe same or you can Maine to make your case I Will so the Dallas defense has been very good year to date they've got the third best underlying stats and that's what's so anybody John liaison Lee is back he's healthy he missed three games exactly so they're going to get even better and Dallas has no wide receiver whether the combat\nHe came back against Washington last week okay so he's been back one way and now he's got a by so now he's fully healed up\nYet he's been back one week yeah and you were telling us for years how strongly so important but somehow they have the third best defense without\nThe he played the first three games a without a male would they bad without um they were they their stats were bad without um ya right so you're saying the defenses underwrite it yes and the fence is going to get better because they finally have a wide receiver and Cooper and Coby usually won't be their number one wide receiver\nAnd he doesn't says it makes a good point doesn't matter how bad a trade is you could trace fifty first round pegs but this year only the cowboys added talent\nNobody is safe here on ... versus the world here on straight out of Vegas including our own colon cow herd who has the Texans ten in his herd hierarchy says where do you have Houston\nI had the Texans number Fifteen and Houston is overrated because of that and the reason is\nIsn't as improbable a five game winning streak as you will ever see Houston played three straight games against not difficult competition end of the fourth quarter of three games were tied they somehow won them all I Do so we're going back like like six seven weeks now\nIn the Dallas in Buffalo ... weeks was that those were weeks four five six but the last two weeks RJ Houston got some really good situation living last week against Miami when they got the playoff Thursday game against the Miami team that was gassed from playing in the heat\nBut what about the ... you and I had a bad and I took to use the use of Jacksonville you thought it was to quote you a home run spots for the jazz and somehow the taxes went by Thirteen it\nTurns out there are no home runs spots when ...\nSo now they're so if you beat it so if the taxes being a team that means they are bad\nYou know if that was the fifth of the five games I was gonna mentioned in the winning\nI you know I think he's got a point to be candid with you because if you think about the taxes one a lot of close games they beat a ... team that that something's wrong with them and then they win at home\nWith a short road week for a tired Miami team it almost is a perfect storm for them to look good and he looked mighty good to Sean Watson on national TV fantastic says calling cowardice is wrong and the Houston Texans fast says are overrated\nThe next victim here on ... versus the world is the Associated Press the a ... got Kentucky eleventh in their latest college football top twenty five rankings Brad powers what say you\nI say Kentucky vastly over rated I only had the Wildcats number twenty four my parents let let's think about this so who's twenty three inch and a twenty five million are going to say that hold them up Missouri's twenty three here and say hey they just beat Missouri on a road\nVery fortunate Kentucky to win that game on the final play the game and behind them at Stanford\nOkay so obviously Kentucky is winning games I happened to personally no more stoops so I have a affinity for Kentucky in the world does do wins just not matter\nOh wow well when they're phoney and when that well yeah when you can\nNotre Dame there's the hostage right there are a good stuff from ... hours\nStraight out of Vegas has brought to you by guy go or Fifteen minutes gets they'd be Fifteen Percent or more on car insurance to become a Tuesday tradition here on straight out to Vegas where every Tuesday Steve Steve says it will give his early align movement in the NFL\nAnd I got to tell you fat as its like Babe Ruth calling his shot here because we told you these games are going to win\nAnd again there is no sure thing but\nWe're willing to bet on these games are going to win and ... is going to be right about the line moves and oh by the way\nThe line moves had been for and won five times he's given a gang four times it's moved in that direction fed said one time it did it and oh by the way the games themselves three one in one against the spread ... attitude again\nI'm On your Pittsburgh Steelers RJ plus three at\nBaltimore I have Pittsburgh it's slightly ever so slightly better team Pittsburgh has revenge they lost their home fourteen to twenty six I liked the handicapping angle you losing your crib you go to the other guys played on the highway and you get it done and also theory history these teams\nTend to play close games that I don't think that this is just data mining there's a reason for this Twenty one time for the last Twenty one times they played Thirteen of the Twenty one game decided by three or less obviously it was decided by three or less you want plus three not minus three\nFor years I mean that just savvy so [laughter]\nSo savvy\nAnd I mean\nDo you suspect this line to go to two and a half I Do I Will listen if illicit histories town you if you like Pittsburgh bad it now if you like Baltimore you're fading fast but if you do weight you're probably get a better number\nBy the way congratulations to those of you who ... to say the word ... more than one and a half times in the first sixty days of the show because that's\nThe second time you know something that is is there there is a little bit of a urban flair to fast\n[laughter] well [laughter]\nOh man [laughter] again here here on straight out to Vegas guys we get real time updates for what you need to know for tonight's TV games and a game where the line is also just move within the last five minutes the game of choices college football a little ... action for you were buffalo they were a minus seven\nJust about five minutes ago it's dropped down to six and a half posting Miami of Ohio\nOh well I you know at that despite the line move I'm Still gonna like buffalo hair minus ... and a half\nOnly you and it's set in line moved them in LA yeah much happy\n... much different handicapped or you see that they knew they had they end up happening on my no go yeah I like buffalo and that's one here's a team that's only had one bad performances entire season buffalo got crushed by army I think the haystack to the world are going to say hey army\nDidn't mind will high almost beat that seems to beat that team well army crushed buffalo that's why this is there's money coming out my Ohio I'll say that I'll take buffalo my ...\nHigh so Brad says he's bad news he likes it [noise] old now remember guys any time a pro makes a pick any other pro at the table can press the green button it's big it's green and it makes a cash register sound and that means auto hundred dollar bat\nSays give us just your one major point while you're fading him in Baton him and who you like\nLove the way Miami of Ohio has been playing recently they played by games three blow out when to us is by one point only if they won those games just went for\nNot six now so you like Miami of Ohio where I like buffalo well that's a crossfire guys to do what you want with that but listen let's be candid on

couple\nThanks for having me goes to the oh yeah how excited where you to do this project uh and uh especially with all this stuff from Laura Ingraham you know and how that stuff kind of blew up told me about the hitting involved in this\nWar or you know I could have projects being in in process for God almost two years now and we started a long time before Laura Ingraham you know sort of gave us porch and they gave us her title\nHow long was it was the other title I'm just curious before it was the worst title think\nIt was like LeBron James you know projects\nI gather you Jeffrey it ever had and I'm like okay I'm going to guess it would have been more than an athlete because that's one of his low yeah\nYeah I mean look it was always going to be sort of about athletes on the court of course I'd like to be on the court you know on the court is where the where the best teams off the court is you know all these guys know production companies and endorsements and fashion labels and stuff and beyond the court with like you know what ...\nWhat do they want to say what do they want to stand for and I'd say especially over the last two years that\nThird bucket has become more and more relevant and you know it probably took up all the oxygen in the room um and increasingly that became the focus and then yet in February you know I'm I'm grateful to Laurie and Graham 'cause she gave it a great title and and you know allows us to sort of use that\nA catalyst you're talking about several generations that isn't as as you guys well no no\nIt starts with Bill wrestling Oscar Robertson cream of dual Jabbar and and a lot of guys you know who have this way for for what we're seeing today\nAnd you're making of the the series what did you learn about why today's athletes are a lot more outspoken on these social and political issues then said the Nineteen nineties Michael Jordan and you know at that point it was they they really weren't speaking out you\nMentioned Russell and Jim Brown and guys like that they were outspoken in the sixties and seventies people got to ... yeah then you had a whole era of athlete there really wasn't addressing these issues what did you learn about why these guys today are doing that\nBut I think you know what today one [noise] that they they are inside the league that really support that man has their back you know the league office that's commissioner\n'em and they have coaches like the current crop of it sure as outspoken as anyone and and very thoughtful I'm so I think that's it I think it's also like they have social media so they have inability to kind of sad somewhat unfiltered\nUm and then I think also the the cost of it like you know if you look back like why some of those guys in the nineties than that that would probably be the air that most people point to\nIs you know the the consequences of speaking out like there was a lot more risk at that time not only because of what was going on a league\nBut what was going on in America and and all of a sudden there was like this surge of money bill Russell and all like you know they never had the money was never there like they didn't really have that that other\nRisk factors but you know in the nineties when TV contract started kicking into the league I mean there was a lot of money at stake and endorsements\nAnd so that was part of like the pressure that these guys and it today and with all due respect all abroad [noise] you know he can be the best cleric he can have you know like all sorts of stuff going on\nHe can have a voice and there's not the same sort of risk that you know guys before him a faced\nYeah no I agree with that and also growing up seeing a black president and powers you as well I think that you know other God we never saw you know what I mean and never really knew that that was going to happen uh I see you got your mail hill on that rate and it was the skip bill is not available and make them happen [laughter]\nI mean to vows one of a kind of thing but you know ... I mean not only you know does she have the crab like she knows the sport as well as anyone\nUm you know this is largely about the African American express experiencing as authenticity there but then look she's part of like the conversation she was\nShe was argued it right by the White House and and you know so she's she's very relevant and all of the different ways and she was recently actually you know one of the many people that we interviewed for this and then when we kind of stylistically started to make the decision to use voice over I mean she would have to talk of the list and\nAnd went back to her and and thrilled that she was able to do it\nAnd you know I was just playing a I've known Jim ... she was sixteen years old and Detroit she's an excellent choice I I think that you you nailed it right there because she's a part of this story no doubt\n... ticket part of the story and you know one of the great things like you know I grew up in Boston in the eighties and so I got to kind of revisit all of that she grew up you know in Detroit and she covered you know the nine Ninety five boys and stuff like that but she got to revisit that there's a lot of it to me like the theories of largely like\nI call it the alternate history of the NBA and we don't spend too much time talking about you know the San Antonio spurs who are the best you know arguably the best team of of their generation because most of our focus is off the court and like I said beyond the court\nUm so it's been cool to go back and like look at a lot of these areas but through a slightly different minds\nIs the odd couple Chris Broussard ... Parker we're joined by John awesome show for the director of the Showtime series shut up and dribble which will debut this Saturday November third on the Showtime TV network and got them I I'm One of the guys I feel like\nThe athletes speaking now I support it I think it's great but I think speaking out in the sixties and seventies was a lot\nDifferent it was a lot more powerful it took a lot more courage than it does to day I think the next step from speaking out from ... athletes today is to create businesses is to build schools that can you know empower masses of African American people still suffer\nFrom the greatest unemployment rate in in miss education and things like that LeBron is doing that and I think he's sending a great blueprint\nDid you find a lot of other athletes who are indeed creating real businesses not just a restaurant but that can really hire people and even addressing education it by creating or helping schools become better\nYeah look there's no doubt that the bond that sort of leading the way and and I think he is in power and a lot of other guys and his\nGeneration but I think in some way way it is doing in\nChicago some of the stuff Carmelo doing in Baltimore you know in areas where they came from you know you see young players like Caitlin down still very early in his career but it's very outspoken and you can see\nThe potential you know he's a guy from Oakland and and some of the things he wants to do Steph Curry who had sort of Oakland become is adopted 'em\nYou know ... ... native city um and some of the stuff he is doing there and and like you said look it's not all just philanthropy so it's it's creating employment it's about you know\nProviding jobs and inspiring others and I think a lot of them yeah I think you know ... you talked to guys like dream on green for jailing brown or whatever and like\nThis isn't even a choice anymore like this is not like some this is instinctive to them like why why wouldn't you come out\nAnd speak to you know what's important to you they're not this is not like even the Bronx generation those are choices that they kind of made in every generation before them today you're starting to see like\nAnd this is not just because of the players is because of the coaches commissioner you know and one of the things that I'm silver said to me look as long as our guys know what they're talking about and they're educated than we absolutely", "show_name": "Steve Gorman SPORTS!", "year": "2018", "city": "Iowa City", "day": "30"}
