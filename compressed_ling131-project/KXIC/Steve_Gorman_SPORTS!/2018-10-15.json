Rosen bells were presented by ... will be coming up here\nAnd just about ten minutes or so I I did sit down with him and we went in depth Ross\nOn Iowa state's a win over West Virginia and looking forward and most of them and I are now suing you'll be favored in every game except state and Chuck like I told Ross before I wouldn't go conceding that one after what we saw from Penn State\nIt seems like a much less consistent team this year you lose your off into coordinator news the once in a program sometimes generation talent in say corn Barclay and it seems like this consistency has been the issue at Penn State this season\nYeah they were not ... I think they're going to be the print it said the past couple years going into the year they they replaced a bunch on these says it ended up on channel ... so they they lost all their wide receivers\nThey're they're big tide and get sick either last them a rash of Barkley but they lost about oh seven or eight players to include or linebacker course O. j.'s great was actually get a lot of those kids this year but I don't\nSee them and I did not see the contending for the east at all of this year and it's it's kind of playing out that way now they are out of the race but ... you know ... as a great chance going in happy valley beat that\n[noise] yeah I think it's going to be Ross a situation where you're probably going to be an underdog in that one but I should be favored the rest of the way much like Iowa stage me favorite in every game the rest of the way except Texas we're gonna have a fun month and a half\nYear he had this could be a lot of my church is looking at that Big Ten or looking at Easter ... there's still a lot of fun to be done out there out east with some really good football teams ... are you with most of the experts quote unquote in the country that think Ohio State still in the driver's seat there\nOh how strange that permit driver's seat their their quarterback is is playing lights out right now I mean each\nIs playing such a high level to ... a couple of things were bad though they're not run on the ball very well urban Meyer because of the way and a half to being a more hawkish traditional pocket passer urban Meyer is not used to having a kid like you\nKnow he's always used to have a a running quarterback the guy that could do quarterback was while they had to change their philosophy a little bit\nAnd that's not in Rome Myers comfort zone so they've had adjusted or not loaning the ball right for additional running out of the ... of a shock going like like\nYou know like they used to do so that's been a significant change for them and then at times at stopping Iran so those are say those are two things they have to work out if they want to be a playoff game if they want to be a a contender for the national championship so there's still a ways to go but right now I see that was the editor\nA lookout for Michigan in the east and then\nOf course this year in place at Michigan State this week and Michigan State they're starting to you know they have a great personal victory on the road as parents look out for ... what was going to be a battle for the ads over their\nFinal minutes with truck long here on science reaction against said Rosenfeld will help Chris wrap up the program here in about ten minutes Troy wanted to weigh in on this Maryland often Troy thanks for giving us a call but how are you\nA great guys great show as always a coach from what do you think I Would I Would defend states' do against a Marilyn why sleep action how do they attacked us on the line and then the backers\nAnd uh wanted to ask you do you think the big well has it bake than we're both get teams in the final four and thank you\n[laughter] [noise] yeah Chuck that's in this office from Maryland does look a little bit different you're uh you're kind of putting guys in motion a lot out of the guys respond to that\nBut it's the jets were off bad ... you know everybody's off of that at ... at that\nRate I this when as a linebacker safety you cannot fall for that yet we stuff you have to read through the guard office that God the what the two guards at the center will take it to the point\nWhere they have to keep your eyes that keep your eyes on those ... better when they want to get their eyes and the backfield that's the difference and\nIf they have great I disciplining they'll stop that yes we often lie for teams right now are just not include big well or the pact well um I mean does do Congress's being edged out\nOf the playoffs this right now that's my that's my main I have I had a I have Alabama I had one that I have Ohio State that I had no today do today\nIf they say and they did a good not to conferences out of the\nTruck with love having you on Mondays thanks so much for giving this time sure we'll talk to you again next week okay\nThat got you bet talked too soon sage Rosenfeld is coming up next year on ... I see\n[noise] getting ready to be in his new view streaming edition\nThis month has no shortage of Netflix Original to take over your TV\nYou out this week it's hard to of making a murderous season three of Marvel's Daredevil man Ronnie White's new comedy special get expert advice on allergies sleep diet and more with the help from the new documentary series half the doctors and illusion is Darren Brown is back on Netflix with a new special called sacrifice\nSome like getting out of the Amazon Prime this week include the claustrophobic horror movies Seattle a young jak yelling all in the weird cool ... pizza place builds on a gateway to hell why not the new horror comedy slice comes out\nThis week [noise] and on the complete opposite side of the spectrum kids Daniel tiger movie lands on prime subscribers can be your premieres on with the Alec Baldwin show the season five from Europe Blackfish the debut of the counters the kids are All right and more this week on Hulu and that it wouldn't be streaming edition and I heart radio\nAM eight hundred K. ex icy Iowa City\n\nFreaking down Iowa in Iowa State football ... reaction on fourteen sixty ... and he um eight hundred I see [noise]\nAlright welcome back to science hawk reaction here of course we're presented by her friends at G. mix aren't we talked with\nChuck Long did a lot of hot guys there in the first couple of segments now let's switch gears go to the big twelve conference and what was a really fun night of the names on Saturday said Rosenfeld joined us they said how are you\nI'm doing great are looking forward to the show\nYeah it's good that it's good to have you specifically we we kinda miss you last week man with a rock pretty coming out and doing what he did or I'll give you the stats and the first two games okay Bronx pretty the true freshmen thirty six of forty eight five\nOf course we're presented by ... eggs in valley junction\nThat was the difference I mean we're we're talking defensive line right now we hit on the office of wind ... there's a different feeling around the program right now from where I sit stage and that's where\nEven West Virginia gets the blocked bill goal or runs it in the scoreboard way closer than the box score would lead you to indicate going into halftime\nI had a different feeling in again I mentioned I watch the game from the sidelines Iowa State was dominant up front on both sides of the football and I feel like even in the past\nWhen we've seen um ... and to talk of modern era Iowa State no since I don't really even considered you guys to be in that any more I'm Talking like ... on probably hear\nEven when there's been some good moments it kind of felt like lightning in a bottle I thought because Iowa State wasn't that good up front on either side this is where it's different stage in the the way they've recruited\nUm there's a lot of young guys up on both sides of the football up front ... this feels different to me because of that I feel like this is more sustainable because it's built from the inside out\nBut I was just going to use that word sustainability you know before you they'd beat Oklahoma State that huge upset a few years ago or ... you know with a ... with your ... Iranian backed Woodley er and er I'm a ... that that that sort of seemed like it just sort of happened\nThere was a huge upset a but you know this does feel different themes sustainable you know even the football games that are going you know is is this often says West Virginians often are they going to start putting up some yard they are they going to hit some big\nPlay and come back and be assigned a last second play that always seems that happened that they did and they didn't get any better and uh\nAnd as I said get up about a hundred and fifty yards or something like that there is no gift there does seem very sustainable uh with the guys I have a plan with a guy these young guys are starting to come up and play on your ... like roads like a lot of these DVDs or you're in a new piece and they brought it brought into signs were kinda like the way he hit\nA in the way he plays football they got a lot of good football players and some young football players and ah I'm really looking forward to seeing now what the future life not just not just this season but uh but the next few years\nFor the seasons change I mean you look at the rest of the schedule and I mean I I think any analytics or anybody who's watched the games would say I would say it will probably be favored in every game the rest of the year except the road trip to Texas I Believe that game is on November seventeenth men um\nIt's funny 'cause we were all complaining about how front loaded the schedule was just a couple of weeks ago and now it looks really favorable and I I think it's a great opportunity they they got through the teeth of this schedule okay\nIt three and three although I Believe with Matt Campbell we're here with us he he wouldn't be happy with where they are at record wise however there is a real opportunity to win eight or nine football games this season and\nYou know that's that's right where he wanted to after last year right I mean you're taking another step forward and your proving that I Would say not just a flash in the pan that got lucky one year and one the liberal\nOr you know this this this this cycle and seems to remind say the Vikings a little bit how much I Love her to them and they had a really tough schedule early on or try to sort of find themselves and and they had a I I the Viking Tibet surprise loss of against the Buffalo Bills but you know\nNow they're trying to play a couple of good football games that are playing better it'd be often defensive starting to work together and you know hey we'll we'll see what this season ends up and I think I said the same way it started off tough but man I mean extremely hard way or the ... to start to the college football season a\nNovice you're not getting that sort of easy first went against South Dakota states or wasn't a good way to start and then going going over to ... and good football and and then just sort of you know bounced around but now they're sort of making a comeback they're starting to come together or you're starting to see the younger players stepping up and and most importantly you're saying the quarterback position if it's\nCompletely change this football team a you know we all love tile or in in what he has done for this program about\nYou know he he was no threat or with a glaring no start right there ... it was just sort of a\nA steward of the off and it was just going to sort of run the basic version of it but you know in today's whether it's NFL or college to have a God as a plate make or a you know back there that can do a show above and beyond a is a special tend to have to have it with his with his party kid and he has said that though I thought he played\nYou know pretty quality football at times to you know he's out of that quarterback what would you have that added a elements\nOf a guy that can move and Ron Paul right and if he makes good decision\nMan that's really something special 'cause a lot of times the guys that can really move and\nMake things happen make bad decisions they're just sort of a either a pocket passer or got up to you know more of a runner party is a sort of reminds me of a four men Drew Brees I guess I don't feel really Drew Brees with a great athlete\nOr when he was at Purdue they rammed his don't read\nThey ran the ball a lot with him or he threw the ball over the field he was a fantastic athlete announcing breakfast that good or bad he he's very he's pretty dang far with the football I make some great prose and I and I would say you know the stuff that he does with the ... the option and fake and guys up in the air and all that stuff is is a lot of fun to watch I Hope the coaches\nDon't sort of put the shackles on him you know ... you started she sort of like freaks you out when he does some of the stuff he dies and there's gotta be bad\nPlace and there but I Hope that the coach of sort of allow him to make some of those effects the mistakes can you make so many good plays a and I just you know a lot of times coaches want to control everything and sometimes acted like pretty he's going to make a lot of really good is that they'll make some\nBad ones is still make a lot of really good one I Hope they started allowing them to continue to be free or allow him to to create because that's what he's really good at\nAs far as this development goes a little bit I I'm I'm taking a stab your because I feel like I I Know ... Campbell style pretty well this kid's been really good his first two games he's got wins over top twenty five teams\nI think the by week comes at a good time tearing down a little bit um teach him now that you know he can take a step back now really get into their own room I Know he's a film junkie is that right do you think this comes at a good time for ... pretty ...\nIt's a great time I tell you there's times where are you my my NFL career where I Would play a little bit in one\nSeason but you know you have that entire offseason to go back and just sort of pick apart or maybe it was only Fifteen past plays there before or it was a game and a half I got the ... he really gets go back and really think about all those plays the coverages and\nAnd the throws you made and how you then you can sort of improve on that going in the off season and uh and I feel like you know ... it's hard to train a horse in the middle of the screen you know as they say so it's hard to really\nGo through all the details of the kid during the week of the games you got to run these new place and you got to a game plan and all those things but now as you said they can go back they can try to fine tune something he can get more rapidly these wide receivers uh you know they have such a great group I Love the fact they're using the tight end now yes I I feel like that was a that was an aspect\nOf the I we've talked about the show you know I I'm a big padded guy loves grown to the tide and either they face they found is that now they're freshmen are a couple of times in the game\nWhich were huge place in ... in that football game I think that you know milk ms really come along are you a big time is now the younger guys so uh you know the more work you can get in but also like hey you know on those place where he is making those sort of bone headed decisions are are scared decisions are really trying to sort of home though was a little bit you know what is your thinking\nOr you know and maybe even try to add some new concepts that might be better for what he does I mean we're talking about a completely different ... and my opinion a very different often\nAnd what we were running a month ago you know with Kyle versus Iowa is two different quarterbacks from different gods\nSage thanks for your time we appreciate it you're the man we'll talk to you next week [noise]\nAll right sounds good seats Rosenfeld um the safe loans\nWow that's good stuff [noise] six to Chuck Long said for a joining us here on psych psych hawk reaction cycle on reaction on Sundays Ross and I'll be back after this and we'll count you guys down here in case you know up until the cycling coach his show a there'll be\nNo miss meat Fridays with the damn Patrick show on K ex icy\nDonnan, Iowa joined us on this me friday Hi Don when you have for me\nRight Dan thanks for taking my call the truck driver running across the country and I just thought I Would ... with my uh Barney version of the friday\nGive me a little horn here if you can on your ah your regular\nSalad I like it but I don't love you you love me real sure the dam that go with the place to go back at the back row [laughter]\nYou're gone kind of like the dons drive in his truck cross country and just took time out to do meet friday\nAnd not only that ... uh yeah I'd want to live yeah this is going to be amazed at the Grammys to me there's no lip sync and here there is\nNo tracking no way then Patrick weekdays nine to noon on eight hundred K. ex icy and heart radio station\nYou can win one thousand dollars in a harbor some cash text to win contest about eight hundred tax icy sponsored by the hazing yard and we in Cedar Rapids [noise]\nFox Sports trending\nFamous and breaking news from the world for Seattle Seahawks in Portland TrailBlazers owner Paul Allen has died at age sixty five from complications of non Hodgkin's lymphoma\nOrder to get it together he's got a rough patch everybody has a\nRunaway I don't like Tom Brady you don't like pat my home I just say here you are defending Blake board wait a minute\nWho said I don't like ...
