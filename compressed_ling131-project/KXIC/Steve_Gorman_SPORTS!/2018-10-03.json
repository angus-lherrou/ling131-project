intended and they the guys were so nice it was the one episode\nI mean I've watched it three hundred times and it was actually one is there was a guy that was my stand and it was Tuesday and it took Thirteen hours the shoes so in between they have a guy sitting there so they can set the camera and everything and we got to talk and he graduated from Yale with with a uh acting degree\nSo here I Am standing in for me\nHe graduated from Yale drama school life's not fair if anyone thinks like fair Jonas de ... you know and I say the great free [laughter] life's not fair [laughter] also lastly hard and plus six fifty so LeBron is the favorite says I don't like\nPlaying shock but I can tell you I think I Know the MBA\nAnd BP is about storyline it's about narrative and we all know Michael Jordan should have won it pretty much every year in his prime but it gets boring it's a boring story\nAnd to me ... is another example where it's hard to say there's been a year well let's just say the brush as true to want it what Seventy percent a minimum of his prime years what you still in\nSo why hasn't LeBron one at all those years well I think a lot of it has to do with its boring\nI Can't imagine LeBron winning the MVP this year being boring\nI'm not saying that it but I'm saying the idea that hey LeBron doesn't win it even when he deserves it I agree but I think this year if he has a monster year he has a much better chance to win the VP than he would have if you stay with the cats thought\nI liked the logic but I think we need the Lakers to win fifty games never remember their season when number is forty seven to forty eight right now historically if you're gonna win the MB the NBA MVP your team needs to win fifty or more now Westbrook did do it once with forty seven wins\nAnd listen you're well and it was history right which shows you about story Westbrook was the first triple double sense Oscar Robinson right and then he has a triple double the next year and not one person in the world was talking about\nHim being the MVP 'cause the story was boring so I Would say LeBron is clearly the favor Joe what's your take on this MBP\nWell if he's got to win fifty games to qualify it that's the qualifier I don't anticipate him playing every single game like he did a year ago so he's not playing every single game say he misses ten games so right there the most they could win is what Seventy two\nSo if you look at their roster without LeBron competing against other western conference teams I don't know how they win fifty if he sits out ten games\nAnd in that ten numbers coming\nFrom where I just that's just a a number I buy pick because there's been other seasons where he's missed in the teens before when he took off once a month or a couple of times a month\nI think you're making a great point in fact as you too which is\nThe mentality LeBron takes with this season dictates if I knew for a fact we're going to make a statement I'm going to play hard and play most every game I maybe I'm going to dabble a plus three thirty is a favor I think it's such a big question mark I'm staying away when we come back\nWell we talked everything about football

exports give me the biggest upgrade of any team since it started a season\nKansas City chiefs they weren't my number four team team going into the air you know just to manage above average yes ... season one number was eight to eight and a half so I was consistent with the market place it's all about ... you know you don't win being consistent with the market you know you got to go ahead and\nGet a lead on the marketplace which some people did it did it that season when did get an update nap it's all about moms and he's been great and now they're my number three team and great I think

question no one can answer\nI Can't get one person to answer it how did my homes get drafted number ten what was it that had him for the number of ten in a world where ... you went to the same year okay Kansas City big upgrade\nBiggest downgrade biggest downgrade of teams that didn't have a quarterback change Atlanta Falcons I had them as my number four team going say quarterback change we're just take it out the forty niners because obviously if you're a franchise quarterback\nGoes down and not only upsets certain people like ... I mean ... usually it's all about the money but went with Jimmy gee\nI Love Jimmy ... it's a motion I'm saddened yes but let's set aside so the biggest downgrade otherwise yes uh Atlanta Falcons Adam is my fourth best team now my fourteenth best team to team spin ravaged by defense of injuries and that's the key word power rating not on some theory how good is this team\nRight now and boy we talk about cluster injury is more than one injury at the same position and on defense they gave up\nWhat forty plus points to the bangles forty plus points to the saints to really good safety is out they can't cover anyone guys\nWe look ahead to this weekend's games the top four games according to us at this point in the week and we start with college football and we start at the cotton bowl in Dallas where number seven Oklahoma is sitting right now a seven and a half point favorite against taxes\nI brought powers I've got the green button and green it has a big money sign on actually tweeted out a picture of the button and all my winnings I collected this week just stacks of hundreds at our Jane Vegas if you like a certain team in this game I'm going to be pressing the button who do you like\nNow like here uh it's wrong and all of us can anyone batch you that I'm dressed and go ahead fortunately not but I Do lean on a longhorns who are plus in this game and it all comes down to me that taxes defense hunting exonerated everyone sees that first game this season last two years against Maryland when they're given a forty three points for game the reality is Texas has defense\nThrow in those Maryland games this is a legitimate top and defense even playing in the big twelve they're allowing Eighteen points per game the last Fifteen games not playing the Turks I guess this Oklahoma team Texas matches up wow five and all the last five times they matched against the number average covered by Fifteen points for game giving their hearts\nI like this one I bet this one I like taxes my thinking is is\nOklahoma is optimize as a team to be big twelve teams and they do exceptionally well\nI think Texas is most on like a big twelve team of any team in the big twelve getting over a touchdown obviously it high intensity of the game I bet taxes\nThe guys are next early look at in college football is Notre Dame currently a six and a half point favorite at Virginia Tech\nNow Brad we've given you a lot of heat you didn't like Notre Dame all that well a couple of weeks ago you've come around and we want it that's the beauty you know there's the old saying a teenager looks up crying\nAfter getting caught drinking or something and they say mommy you won't let me be honest with you I think there's some truth to it right if parents for example don't aren't realistic about their kids the kids are going to lie to him All right Brad if we let a pro\nIf we force you to defend every position to the data for the rest of your life\nYou're not you're going to start being disingenuous we like you've had you've come up and you'd be except that Notre Dame is not the most overrated team quote unquote in college football what do you think of his game\nHuge against that Lana the last two weeks I think it's going to happen again this week I think this lines going to go up I like Pittsburgh ... okay so you say if you do like you gave your on Tuesday every Tuesday in this last segment right before seven eastern you gave your line move prediction pet\nWhat was that yesterday yeah I like Seattle plus seven and wind move production is that wind will drop down from seven now in this case it's not an official Mahmoud prediction but you like Pittsburgh you also think there's lines going up so if you do agree fries you wreck recommend banning it\nEarly one last thing about the Steelers I'm going to draw one more\nDomestic analogy here\nYou know when you went to college or you got to be Eighteen\nAnd you started drinking in front of your parents you know most people drink and high school not everyone but many and then there comes a time the first time you have a drink in front of your parents your ... maybe it's a beer you know nothing serious [laughter] you're a little apprehensive that first time\nAnd then three four six eight months later all of a sudden you're drinking like it's nothing right\nThe dealers are like a team that doesn't get scared until their parents were ready to ground them for a month or an average\nTeam would say oh my gosh we're only won one in one were playing the ravens we got to give our best performance but somehow some way that didn't scare like the Eighteen year old is a little scared of drinking our first time in front of their parents\nThe Steelers don't get scared there were like you know to them they're totally seemingly indifferent they're like chugging beer and everything until there's real real fear and to me if this deal is there was another one at home\nAnd that's when I think they played bat so I don't like this team I don't like the intangibles on the Steelers I don't like the levy on bell situation but as a fan of the Steelers this is where they play bass when they're back is really against the wall not just against the wall really against the wall\nGuys it was an ethics Thirteen inning game last night now we've got the AOL wild card game coming up later tonight it is the AIDS at the Yankees Liam Hendricks taking on Louis ... the yanks currently slightly better than a two to one favorite which leads us to a best bet from ...\nI'm On the Oakland A's plus one sixty five with the kind of sneaky pitching edge year Severino is perceived to be the ace of the Yankees but he is an Enron an average of five\nFrom July first on he is not pitch while the second half of the season and I love what opens doing this is historic\nTeams have done this during the regular season where they started reliever and they're just going to bring out relievers all game long but I've not seen this in the playoffs we filed successful this was for Tampa Bay during the year and for Oakland in September they've done it many games in September they're doing it tonight I think they have the pitching edge give me the\nLast one sixty five that shark because they're thinking is you've got that classic all the starting pitcher is half of the handicap at general some\nBaseball guys think it's even more and if you look at the starters here it's deceiving because the starter against the Yankees does it mean as much as normal situation yeah Oakland third best both in Iraq and the major leagues and remember guys if you're plus one nine four one sixty five\nHundred when you went to ... five means you're going to lose much more than half the time the theory is if you win enough at that plus money you're going to be profitable\nAnd guys we've got ourselves that we have a special guest in Las Vegas RJR we are we grazed by his presence\nI I think ... is a little strong and we have the host we have the host of\nStraight out of the biggest weekend edition we called SOB weekend it was just announced officially it's Bernie Fratto Bernie is going to be their eleven Pete Pacific to midnight

the MVP who got seven percent of the vote from from the gym yes\nIt was hard so this whole ideal notion\nOld is Jim DeMint little wrong going to win the MVP he's unbelievable they thought he was unbelievable a year ago Chris Broussard\nPick them at fifty percent and he didn't win he wasn't even a runner Rob he wasn't even the runner up harden was number\nOne was the runner was you should wait a minute now who\nSo I think he was the runner I Am I should say he and I voted for harden I thought he should have been hard should have been hard and but I'm Talking about he wanted but he he was in England brown was saying it doesn't matter who second but I think he was second\nBook but I'm just saying that the funny thing is this is the the talk he went down from a year ago he was fifty percent last year at thirty percent this year and people like\nOh they didn't look at last year oh look Ron oh my God this is unbelievable he's going to go to the Lakers are going to win the VP gonna win fifty three games are going to go to\nWhat's the covers finals its its hogwash poppy cop I don't know what other word to use and you know what Chris Jones your dad that falls or jazz you've ... you've heard that the LA Lakers will turn into a sitcom you know that you remember the show ages enough\nThe show was going to be called not enough and that's what brought and the Lakers are going to be turned into\nNot enough because when they don't do what everybody thinks they're going to do they're going to say look of all a bra\nWhere do you expect you don't have anybody you don't have a big star second star you can't expect them to do anything this is what set up for him it's going to be disappointment and people will then make excuses for LeBron James that's what's gonna happen he's not winning in MVP as you\nSay a number of ... matter of fact no way I'm not I don't I don't want to be good enough I don't believe it I don't believe who who the team will be good\nEnough the team will win enough game to put them on the consideration if they win forty four games forty three gave George and he will want an empty pie\nThat's one reason I picked over fifty because I Do think little brown really wants this MVP now I don't think he's going to come out there\nAnd say anything about chasing Michael Jordan anymore I don't think because he knows he can't whether whether he says it or not he's not a stupid guy he knows it's going to be nearly impossible\nFor him to win six championship and even if he does he still got the losses on his ... and the only other point that short he's he he understands\nRob his road to beans that go it has to be individual and that doesn't mean you don't want to win of course you want to when you're going to try your best to when you're going to give it to all but he knows if he leaves\nThe game as the highest scoring player in NBA history most points\nTalked ten in us is the only player ever to be top five storing top five in all the time of this he's got the same number of MVPs is Jordan he's been to more find those then joined even though we didn't win you know that that will be here and he can say\nYou know maybe I'll add three teams to the find championship which no other player has done\nAnd I was the oldest player at least the latest that my career to winning MVP of longevity is going to be part of his argument I think that's what he's trying to build toward\nOur I hear you but I just do the God father time will remain undefeated ... will not be able to get there and I think people will look back and they'll make an excuse for why the Lakers on what the team that they thought they were\nThat's that's all I'm going to tell you I'm going to lay out the scenario I already know what's gonna happen and then there'll be like well wait till next year when we get another player waiting until next year when we get it when he gets another star that is what the that's what the narrative will be wait till next year when he gets somebody I'm telling you I've seen this movie before\nHe's not going to win the BP could knock on wood enough games and a ... somebody on the war there might when they might win a ... set a record in one Seventy five games I mean Iran\nCould hear if I'm up in the five game holding on to say well\nI think this is the Iran's best chance since he's been in Golden State to winning and BP you know I think all of the even though the rent doesn't seem to let it go\nI think all the talk about you know he's gone it is great team we all remember it of course but people have gotten past that people are like look he delivers in the finals in a big moment something he's the best friend in the world I think if they go out and win Seventy plus games Duran could win the MVP\nSo look I think there's challenges I mean a lot of it to your point depends on how many games you win not since Nineteen eighty two has a player one the MVP a war with out at least fifty when it happened once and that was Russell Westbrook\nPainted ... festival that nobody had done in what forty years well yes and\nLeaves yes and soccer Oscar Robertson says the saying you average the triple double and and I was a voter not voting for Westbrook\nSaw because he got a triple double that was it and it was it was it was historic you had to give it to him\nNow even if we're on average a triple double and they didn't win a fifty games I don't think he'd get it because we've seen a triple double before now\nExact recently I Know and the other part of this last one less\nThing is ... you want all abroad to to to fill up the stat sheet and and be tired come postseason by trying to put up numbers to one of them BP I just don't think at this age that's what you're trying to do that to me well I think\nHe can do it
