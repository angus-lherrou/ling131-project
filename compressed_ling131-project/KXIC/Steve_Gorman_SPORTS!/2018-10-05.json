clearly the right side in this series the last five years taxes five straight covers against Oklahoma\nAverage covered by Fifteen points per game and let's break it down why and a lot of it has to do with the Texas defense which is just a bad match up for that Oklahoma often but specifically what the new coaches that taxes Todd Orlando the defense of Cornell has had Lincoln Riley's number each last year and you might say hey\nLeach last two years these two teams I mean Lincoln Riley just got there you know the coach last jobs at two years Oklahoma play the Houston team in a season opener two years ago ... almost held the seat and low as far as points\nThat year against Houston and Tom Herman entire Leno and then last year again Oklahoma held the seat and lo and points I lean with

U.S singles charge\n[laughter]\nMaybe I should tell them I said you know a dream my dream I didn't want him in the west and I didn't want to see my auntie class despite that became anyway\nHe was dying to get the LA\nIs one thing to come I still think that a LeBron is out at a championship business and you came in and be the next Meryl Streep but I'm willing to one another championship will it will I Would actually won a championship all abroad for years year that's my question\nIs it the west is so strong right now give us you know what give us a year to get it right I say the Lakers win do hold chip next year really yet I think\nTank 'cause we we've had you know very very young team out there and the blind is\nIs going to teach them well and they got Magic Johnson standing in a suit around most of the parents I I just think give us a year to get it right you know the the blonde is brilliant he's a brilliant man\nI I didn't think he was making the right choice when he didn't want Wiggins I look at in the past and realize that every time I'd ever challenged him I've been wrong I think this has got to come here put it all together they're going to have a really long practice session this season and next year there in the finals\nSpeaking I Know you mentioned you mentioned your we all know you you've been good friends with Magic Johnson for a long time\nHow nervous was the I mean he's obviously a coup customer but was the nervous about getting the bronze you I Know you probably have some inside info or whatever like give us some insight into how mad you got a little brown and all that\nWell first of all like one of the things I always tell people about my relationship with magic magic we'll talk to a brick before he talks to me\n[laughter] I Try to pick his brain\nBecause I Want to know when I say you don't I never told him that night hotel but he keeps a lot inside I Do know that he seemed very confident um\nI don't think he was ever worried I think magic is one of those guys even as a basketball player if you prepare right in your intellectual lives a situation you don't have to worry and this man had done all the things you need to do as a businessman and cloning be outside the bond house at two minutes to nine\nRight you know he was sitting out there and was waiting for the law to change and ah and and he handled it and I don't think he was ever nervous because I think he has tremendous confidence I think magic has more confidence in himself as a businessman than he did as a big point guard\nWow no doubt or the other thing is a\nLorenzo ball is is is\nAh is on the rug being here is that good for a long though I mean at one point magic said he was a face to the franchise and that change very quickly to he's not going to be the starting point guard to start the season\nAnd who knows how well Ron do plays well we'll ever get back into the starting point guard what do you see that what did you see from lawns or last year and what are you are your expectations have they been changed to alter that all\nI I think the jury's still out on that young man and I do believe that LeBron is a good evaluate or of talent and he'll he'll know what to do once you get because you know pre season doesn't matter you got to get him out there and\nBattle test him in real time and see what's up [noise]\nI the only thing I Know for sure
