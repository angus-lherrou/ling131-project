the road\nYes one in eleven Denver Broncos straight up one little Lebanon against the spread that is really poor performance they've been on the road twice so far this year got blown out against Baltimore okay that can happen got blown out at the jets not a team I trust on the road\nDenver not a team he trusts by the way Denver\nThey have the home field advantage even more than a typical team cause of the altitude but that out to to the fact is even more prevalent early in the year why the opponents not in as good game shape as he will be later they're sucking air in the fourth quarter\nDenver had three of the first four games game one game to game for at home\nAnd they are particularly good early in the year at home due to that altitude factor and that I didn't Denver their records their performance is a little inflated because ... ... ... they don't look all that good\nRecord why stat wise the Broncos but I think they are even worse because they had extra altitude advantage early this year a great\nAnd I think that's really the only reason that they beat Seattle and then that they beat the raiders was because of that altitude\nI last thing I'm going to push back well first off let's talk about who you like so what we do on these previews it's lean or like ... ... yeah like is you're going to back to a game so you lean this one or like this one\nWith Denver at one point favorite on the road against\nArizona I like Arizona and I bet Arizona pretty big out of my own pocket\nOkay now did you ... do you ever\nBet like out anything other than that out of your own ... sometimes I just click on my phone as opposed to walk into the window as a kind of like the old like I wouldn't bet this game out of your pocket right that's a little different now\nI'm going to push back on this idea of Arizona being\nWorth a bat tonight and here's why they've won one game it was against the forty niners it looked like a it was a road when it looked like an impressive when if you look at the stats and that game Arizona was dominated\nThe first towns were like thirty five to ten the yard is was hundreds of yards the only reason Arizona one was turned over they were plus five and a game when you're plus five in the game it's almost turnovers it's almost impossible to lose maybe Arizona is not as good as they seem and they don't seem very good yeah\nIt's a great point than they really weren't as good as they see him on the road in that game but I'll come over the top and say they lost their left to home games against Chicago and to Seattle last by two points in three points and in those games they really had great chances to win\nOkay so your point is yeah they may be got lucky in the game they won\nBut they got I'm lucky in the prior to rice\nAnd you think Rosen is trending up or the other reason than because back in like Arizona and Thursday Night Football we have a bonus at the end of the show you're given a ... bat\nOn this game also when

reason the bears lost because of the heat in Miami and the fourth quarter\nIt did seem like the heat affected them that's you're saying okay the marketplace most people are overreacting to a lost it wasn't the barest fall which means there's value on the bears correct okay now I don't want to play Perry Mason but I'm going to play Perry Mason\nThere's such a thing called the look a headline we talk about that a good bet look ahead line is you can bet next week's games now what's the point of that you can see what the games that happened this weekend how they affect the lines\nIf you would have looked at the bears and the patriots last week\nWhat was the line New England was minus three New England was minus three okay interesting now you're saying okay everyone's going to undervalue the bears cause of this performance but the line has improved further the bears\nAre now only getting two and a half so if anything the bears have been upgraded not downgraded and I think they I think they're just say I give a betting against against the genius and the patriots were always in medical am I the genius in this case\nWell you're always [laughter] I mean what what you're saying is I get that you would have thought that you could say oh the overreact to the ... in this line went up to four and a half\nI don't think the look at wind properly looked at the patriots in this hot\nOh so now we're going to go back and debate to look ahead lot we are but I've never heard you do that when you agreed with a look at like the move that have\nWell no I disagree with the look of headlines because the patriots have played three straight big games and\nLast call let's call this one on points the right side list that fast ones who held in ... super contest is give them credit\nThat was

Bradley defense and that's been a very noticeable change on film\nOkay wow I have not heard this fascinating so what you're saying Greg is the complexity and it sounds like going into diamond beyond it sounds like a very modern defends the charges are running\nWell think about this when I watch tape I notice things and then we have a a great group on our matchup show here and it felt films you know for our show and so I'll sometimes they'll say hey I'm noticing this can you pick up some stats on this\nAnd just to give you a quick example when the chargers blitz okay the the opposing quarterback rating when they blitz is thirty seven far and away the best in the NFL thirty seven think about that\nWow and he mentioned the show Greg Cosell executive producer an analyst for NFL Matchup on ESPN\n... the high the some column that we got a lot of data on him he looked a lot better you know coming in unexpectedly right before game time anything different or do we trust the big data over the one game\nI think we temper that I I think when you throw five yard balls and your receivers are able to run long distances\nAgainst the defense I think you have to be a little careful\nNow he made some throws absolutely you can't take it away from him in that regard but what the I in the sky as we say about film that doesn't lie and uh there are a lot of short throws and miss tackles a and and that's you know hey those place to count but I think you have to look at it with a little dose of reality\nAlso man Greg's Jonah today yards after the catch critical\nMaking does that look a little deceiving perhaps on August ... performance you can follow this guy on sweater why wouldn't you if you're a football fan at\nGreg coats out let's talk about the champion the eagles yes\nEveryone's saying oh line up playing as well as last year the line not playing as well as last year now they seem to be getting healthier do you feel like this team on the lines especially the eagles can get back to where they were last year\nWhile the datelines playing well ah the old line is still to me a\nPotentially problematic depending on the opponent um they've got Jason Peters who says he's going to play with the biceps injury uh but he's getting older and he's not quite the same player they've made a change it a lifeguard um so I think your line is still a little bit of an issue now Carson went can compensate for a lot of that he's such a good player um\nDefensively [noise] I think the secondary is still a little bit of a work in progress due to injury due to some guys playing quite as well as they did a year ago\nSo that's again now its opponent based you know it's funny when you watch tape like I Do uh I'm rarely surprised when things happen to me there's not really upsets per se because if a team has a weakness or a flaw\nBecause I think LeBron is going to be hyped tonight might not be high for the season but I think you can be high for the whole season I mean but hyped tonight\nJust to lean on Portland my story and a half because of that win streak fasting clay drive is every Thursday gives is exclusively to straight out of Vegas his SEC pick of the week\nHe's in London so he could record it for us but we've got it he's got LSU Mississippi State under forty four and a half clay Travis\nExclusive SEC pick of the week do you like that ...\nI Do with the under and not one Mississippi safety path under rated I don't know why they're the number of effects in the country not a lot of people know that about Mississippi State\nSo under clay clay Travis is under LSU Mississippi State pick of the week\nGuys every day here on straight out of Vegas we give out a best bet today though we're giving out to best bats courtesy of our college football expert Brad powers\nYes not just to best bet is to from Brad first Stanford Arizona State\nYeah best bet is going to be on the cardinal Stafford minus two and a half at Arizona State Stafford struggling to straight losses for the cardinal but keep in mind Stafford proud program strong pedigree the last ten years Stafford has now lost\nThree straight games in a decade ten years and staffers lay in a relatively cheap number here last five times Stanford has been in this role off to straight losses they responded quite well five at all against the spread average covered by four points per game Jimi Stafford avoid that three game losing streak I take it might have two and a half\nOr so best bet tonight Stanford minus two and a half\nNow we do this every week it's the fourteen money line how could a little wink wink parlay listen guys the reason we do this is because they can lose and\nRight now Brad you're proven at two in two on the season we started out to go now to stray losses\nLet's do it so you got four teams that you just need to win the game and his parlay\nJust need to win the game here take clams and to win the game over NC State take Washington to win the game over Colorado Ohio State they Thirteen point favorite to win the game over Purdue Arkansas to win the game over tall so\nOkay so let's go over that one more time first so that's kind of money on parlay law you do if you don't stay away\nYou know how the with drugs will say don't try that drug don't try money on par lays we're doing it to show you it's hard to win Adam where do we think we're going to you got a profit but it's hard all team's gotta when you look at Ohio State you're saying they're going to win\nOhio State when Brad teams cubs is going to win okay Washington is gonna win OK Arkansas that's tight when not to touch down they're going to win\nBut all four of them women is far from a short thing that's rats for team or Ohio State climate in Washington, Arkansas all to win the game one hundred dollars wins you one o seven that's what is so dangerous the idea that they all seem like they're going to win\nAnd I can bet a hundred to win one o seven\nGimme gimme gimme well that's where Freddie fanny pack does don't be Freddie fanny pack\nGuys we seven in the NFL kicks off later tonight we do have the Denver Broncos a one point favorite at the Arizona Cardinals\nI felt

didn't even make the playoffs a month so that wasn't a ready made team\nNo but my point is that he's always had a hand in ... what he was going to do and when he\nWent right that first year he went back to Cleveland he did say and and you might say he was lowering expectations I Would say he was actually being on is that look this is not the Miami Heat team I just laugh no way they want us this

that are stacked together so the Lakers good finish at the top of that six in third or not the bottom I don't think there'll be out of the play offs but they couldn't finish near the bottom in the seventh or eighth I don't think anybody would be shocked by that know what you're saying he's destined to fail\nRight because you say to say anything about Michael Jordan when he went to Washington I Know there wasn't about championships when he went to Washington that was a mistake\nEverybody knows it I don't know what he was thinking even go there and I know he went on to run the front office

it was Michael Jordan and for civil with\nHim and any ... any four guys who make the MBA finally went to one yes they thought like okay I don't even make the play off course now we know anybody\nI mean I don't want to just ... but it was I mean he was thirty eight years old a Rob you try to find as hell when the lead that team to its habit no but I'm telling you what what I'm saying that was it a wasted season this is even to seize wasted in abroad\nIt's what I get it he's not getting a championship barring some major injuries he's not getting a championship but if he wins the MVP award\nHe
