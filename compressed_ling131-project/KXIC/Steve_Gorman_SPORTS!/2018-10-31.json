doubt\nFox Sports trending\nThe answer is probably somewhere in the middle Joan is is I Do think\nThe committee is playing games now for drama understanding the only rankings that ultimately matter in any way that\nAffects who's in the playoff is the last ranking yeah and what we've seen in the past is and and as a Buckeye fan I didn't mind is one Ohio State was six TCU was above him\nAnd Baylor was above him and Baylor TCU didn't have a game that week there was no big twelve conference title game I'll say wins convincingly and jumps to of oh what a coincidence or the big money team got in and so they they're going to rearrange at that you know you can have\nIt be any way you want they're going to get the four teams they want in there with any rationale they choose because they don't objectively state this is what we're trying to accomplish with these ranking so they can tell all conference championships matter\nOkay well wait Alabama ... well they matter sometimes I mean we can think of every scenario oh house they had accomplished image of a two losses is unacceptable okay you know what else we've been told or at least we've seen you can't lose your final game the conference championship and get in well let me ask\nThe Vegas round table if Alabama wins against LSU wins out and loses in an upset the Georgia is Alabama getting in the playoffs yup yes John is yes\nOkay so oh wait there'd be a new rule that day you can lose your coverage championship in certain circumstances qualifiers\nChange all the time with the committee\nAnd and give them credit they they've been able to pull this off where we don't have to define what we're trying to cause the two main things that could try to do is best\nTeams or best performance\nBut the thing we teach on straight out of Vegas every day\nIs the best teams aren't always about winning or losing a few goal mater missed an end of the game is a binary that W or an hour but boy it's not like that winning team is so much better than the losing team they are probably pretty much the same so you could have a three last team\nThat theme of the country the community is never going to put a three last team in the U.S it's not going to be the best team it's going to be the best season\nBut Brett let me give you another scenario Alabama loses Alice you there's almost a twenty percent chance that happens this week almost they're underdogs for sure Ellis you about you know\nMore than Fifteen Percent less than twenty Dallas you ... percent chance okay\nIf Alabama loses\nAnd Alice you wins out Alabama will once again not make the SEC final do you think of one loss Alabama the winds out makes the\nPlayoffs yeah I think they have a\nBetter leader ... better than fifty yeah I thought you said that you saw that you couldn't imagine\nThat in there and yeah so the fed yet they're in because\nThe committee is going to choose them over every other one the last team but at that point what criteria with Alabama\nMeat would they be the best team perhaps but we haven't even though they lost the game but we have in no one thinks it's about the best team would they have had the best season no not even close\nBut we all know they get in so yeah hey any committee can surprises but I think what we've seen here clearly over the years is they're going to put in any team they want\nAnd in the interim these rankings don't mean a ton and there for the drama is Joan is sad\nBut boy if you can't trust him now [noise]\nBoy does that go against the trust\nI think it does when we come back we're going to ask not necessarily answer the biggest questions of the sports week\nHe's RJ bell I'm Jonas access to the pre game show you always wanted right here on Fox Sports radio\nJust\nRemember whatever you

[laughter] but here's the thing I don't haven't won a hundred percent clear cut answer because he's the one thing the buckeyes have to their advantage this week if they're coming off of by and who's the best coach with extra time to prepare and the ...\nOur country it's urban Meyer so if we see the Buckeye perform poorly after a by something they rarely do on urban Meyer then that's where the major downgrade outcome in my opinion\nLast question of the week straight out of Vegas ...\nGreen Bay Packers and just a few minutes we're going to break down the four biggest football games a week to cause to NFL one of them Green Bay at New England\nI Am ... by green back okay they traded the guy the ... no big deal it ... it was a power play they ... and in a way they had to it would seem if he\nUh was in subordinate and they say don't take it out and you take it out there's got to be a consequence\nBut they traded their D. back ... Clinton decks\nNow listen Green Bay doesn't have a great defense and now you're trading away even if they were he was going to get demoted still death with defensive backs is key\nEspecially in the two thousand Eighteen NFL we had a ton of optimism about Green Bay after that close loss against the rams that was our best game I Would make the case of the year\nWe thought they'd be clearly over a touchdown underdogs the Packers to the patriots it's down to five and a half or six but what in the heck is this team telling us by trading away a fairly important defensive players the Packers\nI don't know but my only theory is that they got rid of Montgomery he was in subordinate maybe there was something going on with ah Clinton ... as well and they said we're going to clean house\n... ... he's he was there a long time it seems kind of weird that just emerges at the last minute in one minute we are going to break down those four biggest football games\nThat's coming up next but for all the latest from around the world of sports the size of golden crowned [noise]\nBreaking news from Fox for\nGood afternoon Jonas and we begin with breaking news Rick Mayes of the Washington Post has just tweeted the following quote in a stunning twist the University of Maryland has parted ways with DJ jerk and more coming soon again that just reported by Rick Mayes who has been covering\nThe Maryland football story and athletic department investigation thoroughly for the Washington Post Rick Mayes of a Washington Post we didn't just a few moments ago in a stunning twist the University of Maryland as parted ways with DJ Dirk and again that coming from Rick Mayes of the Washington Post\nFurther details expected to emerge and that comes on the heels of\nJust a short time ago the governor of Maryland Larry Hogan issuing a statement regarding the Maryland board of regents reinstatement yesterday a DJ direction as well as athletics director\nDamon Evans saying quote I Am deeply concerned about\nHow they could have possibly arrived at the decisions announced yesterday the university system of Maryland has led down the University of Maryland community and the citizens of Maryland and now is the time to fix it unquote\nJimmy Butler the Minnesota timber wolves not playing tonight against Utah of course with butler in the midst of a trade demand there were conflicting reports about who's decision it was for him not to play tonight well Fox Sports radio ... butler spoke with Jimmy Butler and set the record straight on the herd why isn't he playing\nSome neutral decision from tubes in front office in itself you know he's he's ... he's ... he's ... he's a little ... and it was a mutual agreement to rush to sort of artisans Utah\nAnd again this coming down just seconds ago Fox Sports zone Bruce Feldman is now also reporting that DJ Dirk in is out as the head coach at Marilyn so Bruce Feldman and the Washington Post and now multiple outlets besides that reporting\nThat DJ Dirk and and the University of Maryland have parted ways finally in the NFL dolphins I'd go to Adam gays ruled that Ryan tannahill for Sunday's game against the jets\nDue to a shoulder injury brought us while there will once again it gets distorted recapping the news that broke just seconds ago multiple outlets including Fox Sports Bruce Feldman and the Washington Post report\nThat the University of Maryland has parted ways with head football coach DJ Dirk ... back to you thanks Isaac straight out of\nBasic Vegas comes do you live from the guy told Fox Sports radio studios where it's easy to say Fifteen Percent or more on car insurance with guy go go to guy go to a comical eight hundred nine four seven auto the only hard part figuring out which way is easier coming up in about twelve minutes from now here on Fox Sports radio we will have an\nEarly best bad from Brad\nPowers I Am Jonas knocks the voice of view the fan and he is the voice of Vegas RJ bell on the latest DJ Dirk an out as head coach of Maryland\nYeah and as a rowdy Roddy Piper used to say [laughter] when you think you have the answer I changed the question [laughter] we just ask the question about Maryland Brad let's ask what the updated information\nI still think Marilyn obviously dealing with distractions all week how much time have you been focusing on the game plan for this week against Michigan State at least in the last twenty four hours still got a dog and a little bit but there's gotta be offensive relief not they know it's not going to be hovering over on the next three or four days leading up to the game\nGuys we're going to take an early look at some of the biggest games in the NFL and college football here on straight out of Vegas and we're going to start in New Orleans with the rams going to take on the New Orleans saints right now New Orleans is a one point favorite on pre game dot com\nSo undefeated rams fan as an underdog thoughts\nYeah I like the same similar to pull back the curtain a little bit here RJ because this is a situation that comes up in sports\nA time and time again and whenever I got\nA number to see him into things are clear cut number two team in the NFC hosting the number one team\nI almost always look to bet on the number two team why and ...\nTo one and two in this case is the NFC\nYeah okay so this might be one and two in a conference will be another way to correct okay one or two in the east in the NBA just in general if there was a a group of teams\nThat care about being in that group because like NBA divisions don't really matter right they don't they so this is somewhat subjective\nCorrect but in this case the saints clear cut there they're looking at the rams they know the rams are the very best team and it's going to be an all in effort because this is the one game that is clearly the biggest game of the year and their home field advantage with\n... so do you think the rams are going to put less than a hundred percent effort in\nThe rams are gonna be at a ten but as we say and this is spinal tap I expect the things to be an eleven\nHe says I don't believe that ... and I've never seen one now they do oh really [laughter] that must be some dungeons and dragons [laughter] and you fly now let me give you a trend here and this one's fascinating ain't no teams in the NFL\nThat are under dogs\nThat seems unlikely right last Thirty years\nThere's been twenty seven of them the teams are eight and Nineteen straight up ten sixteen and won against the spread\nI like this and this is analogous to a trend that you hear in college football Brad which is you have a ranked team that's an underdog to win on ranked team ... often times if you just play the un ranked team blindly you don't want to play blind but\nYou're getting pretty close to a good bet why because it's got to be so\nOverwhelming the public is thinking I gotta\nI see a little number what would haystack hang say San Juan teams right one team's not right yeah that's right exactly that logic applies to quote and he's not here were quote that logic applies with the undefeated team getting points\nYou know actually you got to wonder what Hank would say about that I mean if he were somehow here away\n[noise]\nAnd you can may know LA rare haven't lost again points just when it came out I Love that boy genius Germany may ... quarterback oh my goodness Todd early that defense alive they smoke\n\n[laughter]\nWe're gonna take LSU plus fourteen and a\nHalf year how historic has a slight note top four team ever ever has been this big of a home on our dog I get it Alabama's clearly the best team in the country I'm confident that but what I'm not one hundred percent confident in\nIs this really an historically great team because one thing I Do know and I am a hasn't played an historically great schedule so far two teams in the top fifty I'm not quite sure we really fully know August Alabama's we do know August Alice us five teams in the top thirty is what the tigers have already played gave me the tigers\nBaton Rouge Saturday Night Death Valley plus fourteen and a half\nNow how many extra points do you give our shoes home field at night\nWow it's like a you know an extra point and a half compared to day night and not just energy yup bruised up crowd all time daytime LSU went straight up about fifty five percent of the time nighttime that record justice Seventy eight percent of the time straight up\nThat's ... powers best bat early on LSU plus fourteen and the hulk\nGuys that we do have one more game and cultural but we're going to get to but it won't let you know we are brought to you by Geico they say thirty second commercial and I'm going to throw a lot of numbers that you please stay with me and just Fifteen minutes you could say Fifteen Percent or more on car insurance this company has been offering great rates and great service for over Seventy five years in any time you need help you get\nIt's one of their trained specialists twenty four seven the company is Geico good a guy go dot com today sorry for all the numbers and in five four three two one I'm Out of time it is the middle of the weeks of course we've got ... guys Toledo a Nineteen and a half point favorite hosting Ball State\nI remember right before seven o'clock eastern every weeknight we will break down real time info on the key TV games of the night all the info you need this went on ESPN two brat\nSo yeah I lean on the honor so again this isn't the best bad it's not like it they lean under sixty four hair and here's what we see from Ball State\nCourt starting quarterback the top two running backs up left tackles out we seem to line the spread of the game adjust but not necessarily the total I got a question the effect that Ball State office that's why I'm leaning on the under hair\nAnd by the way we got Matty hold in Studio just walked in we got a recording after that he got destroyed last week [laughter] I mean it was fifty fifty if he was even showing up he's here so let's give them credit let's give them credit for that\nThe guys who got a couple of games in the NBA on television as well to we started Madison Square garden where the Pacers or a six point favorite at the Knicks\nMatty Jose fighting to get to the Mike say wait I'm Still up on the Europe stuff on the air okay fair enough mix Pacers I don't have an opinion on his fast but that's the beauty we lean to the network right ... dot com we've got literally thousands of people make picks\nHere's the beauty of computers we track every one of them and we're able to identify who does well in the next when he picked either for against who does well with the Pacers well this is an extreme case\nThere was one top ten nixed picker depict this game and to talk ten Pacers and they all three agree all three on the net so right now the collective IQ says there's a good\nA good value on the next night\nGuys to San Antonio spurs are six and a half point favorite at the Phoenix Suns says you like this one\nYeah I bet the spurs minus six nap I liked the spurs it's all about Phoenix being overvalued argue you might remember you bet Phoenix opening night because they were playing a Dallas team that was jetlag coming back from China\nThat was the China Syndrome is you've\nGot finished their when their own five since then and they remain overvalued from that blowout when opening night and now they have cluster injuries that guard their best player Booker is out and\nTheir point guard is out as well so what's your back Pickett's this first minus the\nEyes so your Batman I did hey good show today and and listen we got a chance to bash the NCAA and I thought that always feels good\n[laughter] the odd couple comes up next year on Fox
