the biggest games in both the NFL and college football and we're going to start in the world of college football where Michigan is a seven\nIn point favorite at our tribal Michigan State\nSo we talk about each and every Thursday on that show it's trends of the week major trend floating around this series between Michigan Michigan State so the strength so good we're doing it a day early and we have\nTo I mean you can't talk this game without talking about Michigan State the last ten years RJ a perfect and and oh against the spread I guess Michigan I think that's part of the reason why\nI vastly superior Michigan team is only laying seven point there I think is building a number I think ... a lot of that past history out the window Michigan I think got the monkey out their back last week against Wisconsin I like the Wolverine there might have seven\nSo you don't lean you lie I like him a couple of questions let's be honest you been on the Michigan bandwagon since the summer yeah and\nIn any you know we do our show prep in in the email I couldn't even hear the wind in your voice like it's like it's it's just an imitation of what I'm saying is exactly what it would have finally\nBeen people has been mad at me 'cause I think Michigan is really good when now other people they like oh you that defensive like what is it with\nYou and Michigan I think they're really good yeah but it's like you're taking it\nPersonally as you're picking up the green button ... which is about what are you oh you oh okay oh All right for the guys here's what you need to know and\nA long time listeners know any time a pro likes the game likes it any other pro can pick up the button press it you hear the cash register automatic hundred dollar bat hunter yeah\nIt matters but it's about the pride these guys have losing and boy it's fun to see them page either we got started taping that real quick the last thing on Michigan I'm going to give you a little credit Brad May be harmed though heard Joe ... was on and he said something that was pretty positive about Michigan\n[noise] I just saw how say last week against Minnesota I'm an obscene Michigan even in a game in which they didn't play while they're down Seventy nothing to to North western before they came back and one\nFrom what I've both seen on tape evaluating both teams and what I saw live\nMy new favorite to win the conferences Michigan\nOhio State had so many holes I mean bad ones the big places are given up all ... states given up twenty two boys of thirty or more yards that's six worse than college football they're often said wind was atrocious last week and Michigan just had I Would say at the top two three team performance of any team in college football last week [noise]\nSo Brad [noise] Michigan Ohio State obviously if Michigan's going to win the Big Ten they got to beat the buckeyes\nYou can bet that game now game of the year type lines early what's the current number off state they six and a half point favorite well listen this is great for Joe Klein he has a huge opportunity here right is he can come to Vegas and even in Michigan loses as long as they don't lose by touchdown he's going to win a bunch of mine I'm sure he'll put\nTen twenty fifty thousand on it I'm going to be interested to see when the press reports come out of the big that\nI don't think it's going to happen because I think we all know two things about Michigan\nThey don't beat Ohio State and John Harbaugh it smells Jim oh ... well listen I don't like either of course I'm a list and I'm a Steelers fan and it'll have state grad how can I like the ...\nUh well John Harbaugh will be the subject of our first game and our next to NFL games are going to get into but first I Want to let you know we are brought to you by Geico this eight thirty second commercial and I'm going to throw a lot of numbers that you\nBut just stay with me and just Fifteen minutes you could say Fifteen Percent or more on car insurance the company has been offering great rates and great service rover Seventy five years and anytime you need help you could speak to one of their trained specialists twenty four seven\nThe company has Geico go to guy go dot com today sorry for all the numbers and in five four three two one I'm Out of time it is time now to go to the NFL where we find the Baltimore Ravens a two and a half point favorite hosting the St\nLouis intellect fest I liked Baltimore I bet Baltimore minus two and a half hour day it's all about I get the number one defense by my numbers in the NFL in elite defense against a high flying off and what they suspect defense it's a bad I make most of the time\nYou said suspect defense for the saints last year the saints were really good enough and\nThey were the year before the year before the year before they've been pretty much since breeze was there\nOne day when the super bowl when they advance deep into the playoffs the St usually the defense gets from historically bad to average\nLast year saying how would you rank their defense average and they some would say we're some still believe was the best team last year and they lost that listen sates would have been a three point favorite in Philadelphia So it wasn't for the Minnesota Miracle\nWhere do you rank the saints defense this year I have the number twenty disappointing whoa wait a minute do they were sixteen last year and twenty this year how disappointing is that it's still a tick down I think twenty is super optimistic I'm even more\nPessimistic about the safety and to me that's why Baltimore less than a field goal remember three's the most key number in the NFL more games and three\nWith the margin of victory than any other margin we only have to win by\nThree or more I also like the re\nNext up on our early preview of the biggest games of the weekend the patriots or a three point favorite at the Chicago Bears\nSays we talked about this game I Am shocked you're like in this\nGame yeah I liked the bears wow plus the three RJ and it's all about I'm going to get the bears a little bit of a free pass eighty eight degrees in Miami so super hot for the Chicago team\nThat's ... let's talk about we talked about that quickly yesterday bears were leading comfortably I bet boat un brat\nHad the bears I was feeling great by the way I bet it my street clothes at

Alabama is going to use to a\nTotally as far as the neuron game in the past and are they going to be super aggressive I don't think so because what the Alabama got stuck up by so to me going up there
