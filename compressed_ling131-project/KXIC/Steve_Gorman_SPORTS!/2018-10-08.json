not you're not supposed to look at your off into Lyman but it's just look bad because he played so poorly and into the through the office down right\nStep aside insiders there's somewhat new to the game yes Dick Vitale getting in on the inside information as the longtime college basketball analysts tweeted this earlier today quotes\nOh source involved in the FBI hoops investigation told to me there could be some testimony tomorrow that can create a big nightmare for some coaches in schools stay tuned in quote\nLet me tell you let me tell you what\nWould the NCAA took about ... ski\nWere willing to kill food and Rick put the no oh it's terrible Rick Pitino did well Rick Pitino shouldn't have been fired because I support the coaches anyway good [laughter] that's pretty cool but not\nFor the coaches that could be named some are all that will be very cool for them\nAs soon as there's loads up at the no ... ski over William job a lot of blue so I'll just do it through name see if we give me some of the\nYear ... you've got to have a\nIf all guys won a rubber Montgomery night remember that one that can be it always say the middle name Robert\nMontgomery in the general uh yes\nRoger that do have to be with your ... will be waiting with bated breath on that tomorrow how 'bout right with those beautiful suits but [laughter]\nNot bad not bad at all or John ... got a new thing for the Michigan go beyond that there's going to be oh did ya I'm Sorry yeah let's see uh gas Roy you at a material\nNo oh no I've got I got a couple of more for you know Mike Stoops officially candidate ... nobody knows that ...\nNo question of I Know that sort of I I that that that I saw\nIt blows my mind blows my mind and that that Oklahoma had zeroes hadn't had prevented scoring zero times and the red zone as you're Twenty one time steam and reach red zone Twenty one times ... opposites\nWhere you might have different perspectives here because check went in there where in Oklahoma colors so yeah the ... was a little different [laughter]\nThey are on it and it's like oh yeah I mean it's it's loud like don't even wrong I mean you get fifty five thousand I just think it's funny I guess it's a good it's a hard place to play because they're really good like their Oklahoma State of gunny Oklahoma State team is really good I mean they've had a ... a weird little\nMostly like eleven and seven in ... home games in the past like three years ago like that like I'm some really weird home stretch where they're not doing well but they're good at home I just think it's funny because they pump up those paddles so loud\nLike they ... you know the announcers oh they've got those paddles beaten up against the walls\nAnd you're like oh I guess they did yeah I forgot about those it's like somebody clapping behind you it's not really that loud I'm but to to dovetail off the question yes I'm pretty was awesome ... the running quarterback like when you have the capacity to run and now you take Iowa like Iowa LSU Wisconsin like those teams\nThey don't need a quarterback that can run because the amount of bodies they have in the box counteract whatever speed you'd need so like\nIn any run play you have to account for every defender doesn't mean you have to block them means you have to account for them so like we're like Iowa I mean Chuck knows as well as I as anybody is when you ... the threat you don't block the backside defensive end on a stretch play because if that guy crashes down hard you bootleg mean Chuck knows about ... legs\nSo you bootleg behind it to keep that backside defensive and honest\nWhat an a spread often\nThere is more space so there is less clutter so it means there's a lot more if there's ... there's a lot straighter line to get to somebody while the sudden you have a running quarterback\nThat guy that you're not blocking now even though he has a straight line to somebody who doesn't know where that ball is actually going because you can't count on that Miller just giving it to David Montgomery being like see I have some fun\nAnd there was no threat of him actually running and so now the entire playbook is open which it doesn't mean that the like blind blocked any better it doesn't mean that somebody else like a receiver caught a better pass it's just\nThey now have to respect the entire field as an offense because you're accounting for like a defensive and that you're reading by the quarterback running and so I Would takes care of that with just trash in the middle by their Seventeen dudes in the box and they're going to keep that backs that defensive and for a bootleg and somebody you're gonna get tripped up on something else\nI Would stay now with a running quarterback has a viable run read so it it really does open up the dynamics of the fence\nBut before we move on off of ... if we do that\nLet's pump the brakes for a second on and I told him the next greatest thing of all time we've done that a lot with cycling quarterback highly likely we done that too many times yeah he's really good and don't get me wrong I think the kids got a really high ceiling but\nIf we keep going back and ... Miller last year ... ... ... ... as a kicker Franken he was in high school so is that no one's gives me seven oh one\nLast year against Oklahoma State ... last year against Oklahoma well ... ... grant ... against what can I onion okay I'll am Richard sent against Kansas I Want to throw\nA couple of things that you and in in defense of the excitement fans have for pretty okay I'm grant row Hodge or ...\nI don't I don't want to put ... when we started four games it's not fair like he he he's completed sixty four percent of his passes for touchdowns one interception he's been fine brio states so I'm not going to camp to be three top ten teams last year I mean he he saved the season I could make that\nThe difference I think right now that gives fans the reason to be so excited won the amount of freshmen are out there playing it's incredible how many young guys are out there freshman snaps you a freshman yet to\nJeff is jumbo Fisher and Nick Saban didn't recruit any of the guys before\nLike they did ... ... so his talent levels a little bit different I think than some of the guys we've seen before but three more importantly is he's thrown hooking butler Maddie makes that coverage at great weaponry guys around him that no offense but when you were playing Sam Richardson didn't have a keen Butler's ... you know what I mean like I think\nSay fine and the ball object [laughter] try and not allow low white Midwestern exactly who wants to do that\n[laughter] oh Chuck Iowa got a I thought it was really weird game I'd be fine with it if I was a Hawkeye fan but nobody saw forty eight to thirty one game coming between Iowa and Minnesota what did you think\nOh I'm In Minnesota\nNow a lot of guys or add on what their best the best player I did not run the ball scored a budget for itself over is that great and uh I Love it down there\nFor a that was off a great great call bike ride on that spread for for\n... you said last week when we asked what you wanted to see from the ... and and I stole this from me because I thought it was really good it was consistency in the running game\nAnd I think you were the first you said I asked you which guy you wanted to see you said Kelley Martin I said how many carries you want to see you said twenty I becoming Martin got twenty carries on Saturday when it comes away with fifty some yard so not a great output\nFor him or what what did you see that you liked and didn't like just in the running game from my one Saturday\nWell a lot of that off the ball now about the best way\nAll year that the one bad game that they gave up a bunch of yard but they have really good against the rod\nAll year long so that was that was a big challenge but it is that they just said both ... ball like water and you know they don't need to find a little bit for that one game if they can find the little town of ... or the oil and God or what I mean they\nOr they get really open up their game or just that they're not doing that yet I Hope they do it down the road\nA Jeff I Want to talk about I was states the events with you\nIf you if you're one of those surface level scoreboard watchers you oh they gave up forty two it was an impressive\n... or get it right they don't get my first time to check it and get it right\nUh you know say either force it or take it away so that's a you know the review and that's a good tool but a lot of that\nAnd I think that we'll get to the consistency saying I think that if they\n... the problem is Jeff I think that by consistent I mean they will consistently call it aggressively that they they are going to use this rule\nYou like to party won in a couple of years that's going to be a no brainer that'll die ... absolutely be a penalty but I don't think we ever get to the point where the money Jones one is not a penalty right thing by that\nI think it's going to be more inclusive with heads to be a good that's the right is it this hit is currently not but it will be in the future so basically every hit that is currently going to be targeting will stay at targeting and I think that's true um I I Do again I Would like to know like\nIf you're going to say exactly what it is and you're gonna have guidelines of there is direct contact like the the NFL roughing the passer stuff\nLike the the ones that I understand that you don't like that you just I mean they just got a five or ... the contacted the head if there's ever contacted the head you go oh fine it's stupid I hate that one but you get it like it's a very clear\n[noise] kind of like\nThis happened but the problem is is like the Indiana again the NFL the right thing to pass the rules the full body weights lamb Matthews call yeah we're like\nWhat do you even actually look for there is no black and white standard this is what it is so with the targeting I think it's just just in hit a black and white standard and enforce the black and white standard and that's really all thank you all you think looking for just make it simpler and consistent in Florence system to a four or five nine six six\nIs where we'll reaches us well thanks giving us a call here on fourteen sixty kicks no and a eight hundred kicks I see what you want to add to the conversation\nYeah I Want to talk about a ... a quarterback for him so uh I'm sure you got all the crap that they retreated a\nWell hold on hold on and we've got to get Christmas headphone back on and I've talked to him here besides the Braves are falling apart the wheels ... author car guy that was over there are still went into to one but they've got runners on first and third so\nGo ahead ... than I have no sympathy I Can't walk down the bomb went over a hundred ... what are you guys will yeah so\nUm surveys by now that are you at a ... graduate again\nAnd you know I've heard it back or maybe some from the eastern side of the state you know talking about how that's just you know him trying to earn brownie points staff\nBut you know I think we saw a you watch the game or you can talk about is that coming over and graduating early on\nYou always drawn a touchdown and I just think that's really a indicative of the culture change the chemical ... that it's not just talk and you know these guys really are just kind of one big family and it doesn't matter who's out there on the ball if one of them that they're all happy\nYeah well I Would I Want to throw this to the player for quick Geoff any chance that that's just him trying to get brownie points there's zero chances that just brownie points that it doesn't work like brownie points I don't I ... I was in fact I was hoping you were going to throw out there that I mean I can probably put where's that is I mean because this I was in this position with\nBack as a tale back like I Would have loved more carries\nI Would have loved to be on the field a lot more but if\nSean trail or James wider somebody was like they had a hundred and fifty yards and the game like hell yes I'm happy or either they're one of my buddies are their success directly equates to like an the enjoyment in the locker room so yeah I mean does he want to be out there I guarantee you if he didn't want to be out there he's playing the wrong sport\nBut the fact of him being genuinely happy for his teammate is absolutely they're like the competitive is one of the play doesn't leave out the the happiness for your team may also is still there at the same time\nYeah I don't think that by sending out that tweet you go from being the backup quarterback to being the extra special supermax ... Campbell scanning\nTwitter going [laughter] that kid right he seems like he's got it together you know what brought you had a good game but that said nice things on the Internet but\nCheck I Do think two wheels point it does say a lot about that camaraderie in that room where we are we over thinking this\nGuy I\nKnow [noise] [noise] [noise] [noise] [noise] [noise] [noise] [laughter]\nStruck you are a little bit different situation trying to pull for those dudes 'cause that was your was your career your way to get started so a little bit different Chuck Long is with us well thanks for the phone calls that answer your questions at all\n[noise] yeah yeah I just think it's an odd thing and a cycle\nThat far can I add awesome see can I make a comment to Jeff just on the quarterbacks in general part goes out camp comes in as\nSuccess ... camp goes out that comes in as success sub goes out pretty comes in have success is that indicative of culture to do just that within that room these guys are engaged\nI think it does I think that his his go to have trust the process which is if you look to and saving does I I say saving because saving as the guy like you you you know everybody's drive you talk about college football you talk about next Damon\nAnd the funny thing is is when you do interviews with people do interviews was saving is like why why do you not ask me what's wrong and then like Tom looting bills that guy that actually asking the question he goes what do you want to do better how do you keep these guys from the complacency\nAnd they always go you're just trying to be the best version of yourself that you can accomplish and if you're the best version of yourself\nThen no matter what you do against the opponent you're going to have your best success\nAnd I think that's the process that Campbell is talking about and so\n... he's not looking to be just better than Zeb and not looking to be better than camped it's I'm trying to be the best quarterback that I can be and then when the situation is presented to me I have taken steps in the process to make myself successful therefore I Am successful\nAnd I think ... medically the other thing and um and again I'm not saying that this kid's not going to great I'm not expecting him to be poor I mean just like again tampering a little bit let's not expect smart let's not expect Eighteen or twenty three with five touchdowns let's let's slow that down for a second but\nThe the success that a young like you can have pretty much right away is\nLet's say like a team had to snaps a film on rock pretty and then high school and so if they're planning on them and they go okay this is how I was states defense runs and if my ... my memory serves me correctly Oklahoma State generally loves to run man coverage well you with a with no running quarterback you can't really play a ton of man because then you turn back to the quarter back\nLike you guys are playing the wide receiver they're not playing zone and so their eyes go away from the quarterback meaning that kid can run well\nParties things them for a couple of early because they wanted to play man all of a sudden they have to go back to his own they're not good at zone so they've had to on the fly because they have no idea what this kid's good at had on the fly adjust and hope that they're adjustment works\nSo this the first game is always really liked that's where a lot of times the success and come from right away because maybe like Kyle camped against Oklahoma maybe he's really good just super good at seeing cover three unlike you planned on playing cover three and all of a sudden you run truck cover three out against the guy that picks it apart like it's his job\nWell shoot right here pretty bad situation so now there are like this next week\nThe ... the defense of staff for West Virginia is going to find something in his game that he doesn't love to do maybe it's boating to his left maybe it's throwing against man under maybe it's some something they're gonna find something he doesn't like and make him do more of it and so he can overcome that\nNow that there actually is film on him and he can ... you can find trends in tendencies of what he doesn't doesn't like\nNow if he can succeed against that that's when you have a successful kid was this\nKind of what we were talking about the other day and this is a but it's great to hear from Jeff it's preparation on both sides are absolute that the quarterback has to be ready\nFor when that opportunity arises and the lack of preparation for his skill set on the other side ... is a component does it mean we're on the conversation where James van der ... got brought up you know a good dose for three hundred and eighty five yards at Ohio State is very first start you\n[noise]\nThe safest off his ... reaction on fourteen sixty care you know and hey I'm eight hundred K. R. I. C. [noise]\nAnd welcome back [laughter] just kidding welcome back so brilliantly genomics is always\nYou can tell exactly how the game has gone\nBy al ... and the ... you write your mind the guy that's fine that's fine means word on your sleeve man you know we love that good callers today though been real yet have been great ... keep it up guys we forgot about ten minutes here and we do have two phone lines open we'll get to Jason in Calvin here to start our final segment Jason calling from Cedar Rapids thanks for calling sack reactions are how are you\nGuys hey thanks for having me on a Chris I called\nI called your show a Saturday Night after the game knocking about ... ... ... is really you know I ... I like the I liking him to like a point guard plan a quarterback right yes agrees on defense worth worth ball fakes\nHome fix 'em among young kids and basketball the ball said 'cause the last start you know because it can open up passing lanes driving land when I'm On on wanting to know is it a lost art with young quarterbacks\nThese days the ball fake fake 'cause I I Would think even in football it could freeze the Democrats and open up drawing lines open up receivers and do all kinds of coordinators even try to incorporate that in their architects anymore well I think thanks a lot I guess\nYeah you bet I'll take that one so I think the uh the ball fake is\n... it's underutilized unless you're running his own skiing because if you're running his own scheme that every ball fake you go there could be an option in that direction and so that's why like her to using a ball fake so like the the touchdown run that he had it was a double read play where you read the defensive end and then he could have thrown into drink milk or it could have just run it\nAnd so we both faked it to ... which is still an actual viable threat it wasn't just a pump take down the field and so because of his his running ability his ability to actually like extend plays and make big plays in his feet\nThey can incorporate zone plays back in like you're talking about earlier in the show\nAnd now that you're incorporating zone plays back in and then you've got the ability to fake those place and so the ball fake it really only works if it's an actual threat because like you know if Shaquille O'Neal standing on a three point line and someone pumped thanks to him the guys like All right fine relax just as you go had\nThis kind of piggyback someone and things have just been saying the last couple of weeks if we as we've been trying to diagnose\nThe problems with the I Would say dolphins ... his thing was you can't do or run pass option when the run is not an option right and that you're you're you're faking into something that they know you're not going to ... that I dare you go head to exactly fine exactly to eight four or five nine six eight we should talk about that yeah yes and the\nQuarterback is that you don't see that we're as much as back when you were playing shock is that is that an accurate assessment on the pump fake there\nWe actually did a lot you know the old shows that ... we were kind of the old school a fake but it's good to see that come back in college football because I I it was it a lot of\nYou know you don't do much more big bags of master at it but um we used to do that quite a bit this winter where it went away because I get rid of all that\nYou know back then we add that was that Rob I you know we want a long time to grow it but then the spread gay man just get the ball out of your hands so you're just as much but now you're seeing a little bit more which I\nI Want to get to Chuck before we run out of the time and ask you about this northwestern rollercoaster but our buddy Calvin he wants to kind of take us in that direction was asked about another a big tent team Calvin thanks for giving us a call buddy how you doing\nGood checking\nAccount on ... what you want what you want to add to the company has made by the time you bet fire away\nOkay what does that and what we did we end up with a ... bill finally be what we don't ever recall I was being let 'em in my second\nJob or a dad triple overtime you're going out\nWith that is that it was that that I\nHope so [laughter] what's your third one Calvin\nBut it wasn't as I said no kill me away on the on the field Saturday out yet in it in fact that we we haven't even my main man I Love my main man but I met him yet\nMitchell on the field that before and that ... going up a list and they guy thanks\nFor those phone calls or those questions thanks for the phone call or we'll talk to you soon right let's start with you Chuck hawks against the cruisers this Saturday at eleven what are the hawks have to do well on the ball go\nOut and got to find a way to pay rent to use them coverage is in the back end up the snap\nThere's kids really good I mean he is he is the ill hurts you can read her very well they just can't stay deep sea that's standing in the back and\nAsk for the football and then when you're on the road to find a way to run the ball on the road and\nAnd the turtle and and then uh you know they should be a good shape but but got put some pressure on the fate Ramsey too he's ... he's one of the better ones go right now the highest percentage ... ...\nWhat are your cycle and to have to do to be the top ten West Virginia team\nA on defense West Virginia is one of the most explosive often says in college football and they got a quarterback that can sling it and so your we talked about earlier is the defense of I dare you to do it perfect fourteen times in a row do that\nYeah don't give up the play that you you know they get three plays in they get a big you know twelve yard Thirteen year old play and because they got a Thirteen year old play you get complacent or you get on your heels and all of a sudden sales hits a fifty five yard touchdown pass you you can't have that address so forced them to beat you underneath not over the top\n... what's the what's the story with\n... you know I think it's just probably just not ready I ... I don't think it's that he's not performing well he's a freshman right and I'm ... you're already seeing one out there at this point it doesn't make sense to marry more than ... space out the class is\nVery clear he's not in the quarterback class that ah the ... and they were else on the field raising up ... well I mean\nMaybe he's your backup or whatever but you could use them and gadget areas\nI mean I saw an incredible athlete shocked we have ... seconds left we want to know what's happening with this northwestern team this seems like a rollercoaster watching this from afar you're on the beach the end you guys are probably broke this down a little bit how good or bad is northwestern\nWell on a roller coaster but it's really very disappointed I mean they want to do this comment that northwestern that's\nWhat it was ... you always rushing the football and they still couldn't afford the I mean they are just rushing football that still won that game I mean I really that's what happened and give it up the quake stores but we are we not soccer and what's his name I school and it or not a great good\nChuck thanks so much for giving this time on a Monday nights and we love having you on great great insight I got thanks a lot of talk to you soon chuckle and joining us every Monday Night here on TALK reaction\nBrought you by Jim ... just going to stick around for a little while so you folks over in the Iowa Jamie to a chair listening on ... get that heart radio lap you can listen to the last half hour of this program each and every Monday Night and then just make it a part of your daily routine I mean I'm not sure what you're doing from four to five it'd be better than this but I mean\nChris and I bring it to ... months he not one of the more of noxious players in baseball\nHe he just he's one of those guys it doesn't look like he belongs making I Know that's a horrible thing to even say and as humans we should get past this sort of insight and an instinct but between him and\nWe who do you have more [noise] I we got to get in the ... thing because I uh [noise] I don't have a ... [noise]\nI don't either this is probably not the best time to have the conversation when we come or maybe it is [noise] we'll figure it out [noise] guys here in Des Moines hang tight on fourteen sixty cakes no over in Iowa City you got a great program and coming up on a made under kicks I see that's what I meant to say [noise]\n\nThey do in our kids to school sick [noise]\nOkay so what have you got to pay for the blind or their support in the classroom [noise] just sharing faced they keep students nervous so they're ready to learn [noise]\n...\nThey are there when accidents happen oh you're going to need a band aid [noise] and they keep our schools beautiful\nSchool bus drivers custodians nursing parent educators to deal with the education for court professionals who home schools in Iowa runs smoothly everyday\n... pregnant that'd be I Would say that the case of the nation the insurance than ours can harm a safe ride to school how the meal in a clean environment to learn\nTo take a moment cafe thank you to the E S P than yours a message from the Iowa State Education Association\nI'm okay with it only from the standpoint I get the frustration\nDo because this is not what the giants signed up for not what I'm sure he thought\nIt was all going to be don't forget people made all kinds of excuses last year Chris oh the injuries oh you know he lost his all obey Jay and and and other receivers and the offensive line wasn't good and they they have back coaching every excuse in the world what a giant suffer through a three and a Thirteen year\nAnd was able to get the second overall pick an address so this uh\nThis is unexpected people really thought the giants have fix this\nProblem we're going to be good and and granted it doesn't matter I Know they were close it took a eighty five yard field goal in mind you know what I mean the guy kick the sixty three order with time expire and it just made it inside the the upright I get it\nSo they could have won that game but if you just take a look at how this team feels and and and you see all the numbers\nThey they they have a score well that was the first time they've called over thirty points right in three years as twenty Fifteen to twenty Fifteen in this man's NFL Chris where everybody's putting up\nNumbers and points in all kinds of other stuff so that tells you one thing number two he lied on the habits he lied just doesn't he doesn't he he\nWell he was better no that was an escape went up to them I'm home better overall numbers though he doesn't throw the ball law and and and let's just be honest I mean right now although Beck um junior could be the quarterback touchdown he threw that was\nA nice throw it out with a really ... I mean that was one of their along as fast as many\nRight and I wonder I don't\nMaybe Rob gee see if we can get this but that ball travel and how far they travel in the air maybe forty something yards thirtysomething yards I Wonder if they've had a completion in the\nAir in the air that it's gone longer than that ball and I get it a lot of people are like keep it to yourself do rip the team in public don't we ask guys to be honest and candid\nAnd then when they are we got an issue and I just you can't have it well a way when they give us the politically correct answers and don't say anything we ... we Republicans say he's useless you don't say anything do you have an old way was\nGreat jokes either I mean she did a great job pulling out of him out of little way and we're there to pull it out of him to or you know what I mean like to make you more comfortable but whatever the case you got good calls out I'll say this Rob I Do I I'm not going to hold\nDown costs that ball was twenty four yards in the air there was only twenty four yeah\nOkay if I bet you within their top five completion though as far as time you know a month in the air\nBut but longer than anything he lies thrown in in about a year\nSo we're right on your mind that comes with what thirty three the touchdown they connected on yesterday was about thirty three yards or something like that but up to that point yeah he lied hardly connected on passes that far near but but\nBeyond that if and here's what I say about oh dealt in his comments I think it's fine to do what he did if you ever been beating this drum to the coaches the coaching staff he lie all season\nIf week after week you've been like look I can beat my man less go long less throw it deep give me some different schemes they know what we're doing less ... less change it up you know if you're saying all of that\nAnd they're not listening it's falling on deaf ears then eventually you're only recourse is to go public right\nBecause now you want to put pressure look they're not listening to me I say the same thing about air Rogers last week when he talked about you know Mike mccarthy in the scheme and the plan and all that if they're not listening to you behind closed doors\nThen at some point if if nothing else is working\nThen not only recourse you have is to go public and and here's the thing Rob they did it change some things that\nThey we saw I mean it doubled faster too old now when he threw the touchdown it's like well I'm Barkley right that was unique he lie did throw deeper in three of his first war games the average six yards and a tip yesterday average nine yards and Tim so I think that's what\nOh down Mitt when he was saying if this is what it takes to get us to play better blah blah blah than I Am fine I'll take it now I must say I don't know that oh Dell's beating that drum\nIf he hasn't if he's never you know if this is the first the giants have heard that oh down and think we're putting him in position as exceed and you know he's got questions about you and then I think you\nDeal with it in a house first before going public that would be my only criticism of of what they'll do a\nI'll give him the benefit of the doubt that yes indeed he's talked about why would why would he just keep it to himself he's not that\nHe's out there you know ... I'm a give him that he's had a conversation maybe didn't see been maybe the frustration of got to them a little bit more but that stuff happens and if not the end of the world you can live through it it's not like he said it'd be totally different if you went out public and said\nUh eleven manning is a bomb and we'll never won anything when quarterback and they need to cut them okay now now we got now we got an issue you know what I'm saying they learned out as an issue so\n... and and here's the thing to Rob when we also don't know it's possible because oh Dell is is it seems like he's very popular on that team he is viewed as a leader whether we like to view him as a leader not he he clearly has some clout with that team and his teammates\nThere may be teammates going to him or not they may be talking about it amongst themselves I can we throw the ball now feel like what's going on you know what I mean like\nOur stuff like that Brian said about the cowboys are stuff is basic we need to do some different things so maybe some of his teammates had been saying this and he went public like I'm going to speak for the team so there's a lot behind the scenes that may have\nBeen taking place to lead oh bell or they'll back um junior to do what he did but hit us up as always eight seven seven Ninety nine or Fox if you want to weigh in we're talking NFL particularly the New York giants were about to get into the big game of the week in\nA Patrick my holes in Kansas City chiefs just ... robs Jacksonville Jaguars how many how many touchdowns it I'm a home that they were thirty point I mean ... that's all I Know it's the couple of Fox Sports radio\nCome back we'll be back next [noise]\nHis Fox Sports radio [laughter] this is where you get your than I fell\nFrom morning I'm

... Parker would come and you live from the guy told Fox Sports radio studios it's easy to say Fifteen Percent or more in your car insurance was guy go go to guy go dot com or call a hundred nine four seven eight you Tio the only hard part figuring out which way is easier and we bring it on next gas\nHe is a hall of fame defensive back one of the greatest to ever do it in his position also and that fast one contributor rod Woodson welcome to the odd couple\nOr appreciated why what about you guys\nWon't hurt a lot\nDoubt no doubt about it [laughter] I'm ... and oh yeah [laughter]\nNo but Ron we were speaking of strange we saw some of those passes Blake borders to yesterday against and she said that loss can look this team is superb defensively everywhere else a chance to win the Superbowl though was Blake borders that quarterback\nFor adults a great question I mean that's the question I had at the beginning of the year the there's a lot of question marks for some of the really good teams are white borders for the Jacksonville Jaguars the big question mark the uh I had a really good game of the post season last year against the Steelers be fair\nUh oh yeah you know I'm All right I mean blow 'em out you know court orders a forty five points out it was\nA and I think that's what everybody thought they were going to get and there's a lot of people saying this guy should get a lot of respect uh but you know ... and the national football and you have to earn respect every week\nAnd I'm I'm just I just don't know if he's that guy I think he's he can't have good games uh but then every now and then you're going to see games like that were like specially with a good team did he faces a good defense says he has issues are making played down the field what a consistent basis what he's playing ... hey\nRod in the Packers lions game I mean was that the Bing Crosby amazing Crosby kicking field goals I'm ...\nHow does that crazy\nThat is crazy I I thought to myself seriously and put people don't know he more news for field goals and an extra point he looked totally lost out there and I'm just wondering if your package you think that maybe lost it and you need to bring in some pickers to to to try out or get ready just in case\nYou know I I talked to a couple of guys that have been that played in Green Bay ... widow of a sudden they they said that it'll if he misses want it messes up his head and he kind of goes down that debt row you know that's\nWhere he just can't get his mind straight again um but and that's what happened ... you got to think about it you know Aaron Rodgers and play a great game he didn't play a good game at all he had some\nDecent throws and the second half I'm In ... and the bad thing about the football team is that it's all about Aaron Rodgers if Iran does not play football they just won't win because their defense is good enough they don't give them enough turnovers and give them a short field to be able to score like easy\nDominant out I'll bases are so we have to be that guy weekend a week out they don't have a great running game and then if he makes he makes us feel go it's again it's a tight game all\nBig time and then they wouldn't they they they lost him easy miss Thirteen points right\nA lot more like ... or was eight eight I think they may not have it ... ... they were the one yeah\nSo well let me quickly\nWhat is the relationship with the kicker to the rest of the team like 'cause I always hear players say man we don't even talk to the kicker too we see 'em on Sunday or he's always you know and it gives you the impression that do if you have a game like this\nThat the team will be like man get him out of here and get somebody else and I know Aaron Rodgers backed him up you know but they are purely they're good friends apparently did make some calls have you been a great kicker for a long time so\nHe has I mean he just had one of those games that every player in the national league if you play a long time you're going to have a bad game and it's going to be one of the game is not going to go your way now the evolution of kicker since I've been a lake so when I came in league in Nineteen eighty seven\n... used to go out to practice and as soon as they were done with special teams so they went up to the locker room\nThere are some coffee\nAll that stuff you know and then it kind of all where they had to stay out the whole practice even though they weren't doing a whole bunch you know they would sit on the line and do some parts of some kicks and all that stuff but they wouldn't and they still don't do a lot at the end result they have to just\nYou know what players get upset about and disappointed about is that they had one job\nRight and that job is to ... or kick and when you add that opportunity what you might have you know say you know two or three at the most as a kicker and as a partner or do you have in a bad day as often as you might punt five or six times they just want you to do your job\nJust do it in and out of the hardest thing because when you when it doesn't go their way they're going to get blamed on on the owners of the ... as a scapegoat because they didn't do their job that day\nThe odd couple on Fox Sports radio our guest is Rob what's in the hall of famer and our buddy and our colleague get at this one that contributed you want to get to him at a Twitter was Arab Woodson twenty six\nAnd ... what do you make of the uh", "show_name": "Steve Gorman SPORTS!", "year": "2018", "city": "Iowa City", "day": "08"}
