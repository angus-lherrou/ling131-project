of Asia Vegas we transition to the NFL the New York giants have shaken up their roster again first it was former first round pick Eli Apple who was traded to the saints yesterday\nAnd then earlier today pro bowl defensive tackle Damon snacks Harrison was sent to the lions in exchange for a fifth round pick RJ what is Vegas make up the Giants' recent moves\nPersonally I put apple in a different category a locker room issues last year a lot of turmoil\nNot surprising right if you're not winning why not get the character right or at least get the and ... and it's easy to point sale back hairdo I don't know I just know he apple at conflict with the giants but boy snacks now I have a personal affinity to anyone name snacks\nI mean you know ... it's like just embrace in your true nature you you got you got to kind of a I appreciate anyone that really embraces are true nature\nUs when we go to the whole middle one place and the right to another place and that was another one buying back right so [laughter]\nYou ever bang bang\nFed I have bang bang [laughter]\nThere's a drop off that they hated him into that but I got to tell you something this is\nA shock to me so we did some work at ... before the season we went to a pro football reference and we got every player that was an a plus so the number a like a snowman eight\nPlus in their rankings which was the average teen had about six or seven eight plus players the giants had to and snacks was a seven so that was an a plus but there were only two players\nBased upon pro football reference imperfect like any system is better than stacks Harrison\nAnd he has multiple years left on his deal\nOr I think it was used as what was it four million they're paying them this year and seven ... seven next so explain something to me they got a fifth round pick what is the rationale the giants making this trade if you were saying all that I get the raiders the raiders got a first round pit\nIf you're trading potentially your third best player if you're the giants\nAnd you're getting a fifth round pick and if it's your third best player even if you're paying them seven million next year that's economical\nSo I mean the raiders receiver they got traded ... is fourteen million they're paying thirty nine\nI don't understand is this feels like I mean I don't use the word dump in teams are dumping in the NFL I just don't think they do you can kind of say as a euphemism all the giants are looking was an eye towards next year\nBut even if you have an eye towards next year why would you trade at minimum when your top five guys it's only going to be getting paid only quote unquote seven million and by all accounts he wasn't a locker room problem\nSo to me this is a sign that there's some uh some real discombobulated shouldn't within the giants would I don't know exactly what you're thinking when it doesn't seem like the giants are thinking about winning\nAnd what's interesting is you could say the same thing about the raiders but the raiders line since last week in this game against the colds has moved four and a half points against the raiders\nThe giants after this move which I think signals that winning this season doesn't seem to be the priority the line hasn't changed\nWashington is favored by one at New York they were favored by one yesterday favored by one today but it seems like we have a signal from the giants that they're not ... that there were number one focus is not winning\nThis year so I'm going to look to play against them\nAs a weak progress is when we come back\nThe biggest

weekend and we always celebrate that right now at six thirty on Wednesday\nWe'll call it the ... with the three biggest football games or the weekend we're going to starting college Brad powers other college knowledge\nGeorgia Florida right now Georgia favored by between six and a half in seven in different spots\n[noise] what's the big factors in the gay well let's talk first and will transition from just a question segment that we just had in the NFL\nGot a question here is quite simply about Georgia here we are almost Halloween and I'm not sure really how good Georgia's number for my power ranks almost by default because everyone out fine them has bigger losses than Georgia\nGeorgia given credit they can only play the teams on their schedule beat five on my twenty four points or more who's the best team Georgia's be [noise]\nMissouri on the road and wears Missouri and your rank right around twenty twenty\nFive [noise] okay [noise] college football\nIs unique and I'm using the definition of unique one of a kind singular [noise]\nThey're unique in college football 'cause you can be into late October\nAnd really not a play the game that super meaningful if you're an elite team now meaningful is probably not the right word\nNot super telling it doesn't tell me beating was what was it like you remember the line in the Missouri at Georgia was a fourteen point road favorite that listeners how state was almost fourteen poor favorite got be so let's give Georgia credit they didn't\nUh you know lay a huge aid and some of these other games but boy winning a spread\nOf fourteen a game like that by Twenty one or twenty eight tells you something but it doesn't tell you the same thing as being a team of competitive the idea where this late in the year we have so many question marks about Georgia\nIt really is unique to college football\nAnd if and George despite exactly one game what I Would consider legitimate opponent LSU not a good look for Georgia at twenty point last so question still remains how good is Georgia so do you like Florida I Do lean with for a lot like Florida ... Florida\nOoh okay now remember guys if you glean it's like hey RJ force than me but as they like it means er baton the game\nGuys we go next in our early preview of the biggest games in the NFL and college football\nTo the NFL we just talk about the historical significance of the line the betting line in the Packers rams game if you miss that you can check out the podcast on Fox Sports radio dot com it'll go up shortly after the show but the rams right now a nine and a half point favorite in LA hosting the Packers\nAnd says [noise] what we know\nSmoothly Joan and if he wasn't\nIn LA I'd have no shot at say an\nHonest to God [laughter]\n\nI like this I'm betting on the red Sox Allison strata Vegas probably has more dedicated listeners than the typical radio show why because once you start figuring out hey I can\nDo better with my batting by listening now it's fun and you're doing better right so we got those dedicated listeners they might say RJ you said dogs in baseball I agree I generally do because I think that what's ... seemingly predictive in\nBaseball which would be hey how many games this team when during the regular season is it really that predictive in the postseason that's what history tells us\nAnd we'd been very effective just in our five weeks we'll straight I Vegas batting dogs in baseball given those picks to you I'm going favored here two reasons price has a history the red Sox starter of not doing well in the postseason that's probably a little bit of an understatement\nBut he won his last one monkey off his back so to me whatever optimism I have for price entering this game off a win\nIs so much higher than it would have been entering last game before that first win but I think the market just looking at it saying hey here's a guy that has a career really good in the regular season and a career really bad in the playoffs\nThis is different in my opinion at least potentially cause prices off a win\nAnd obviously there's some psychology psychological elements to underperforming so much in the postseason\nSecond reason and every other sport football college or pro basketball college or pro pro hockey I don't know much about soccer and I don't like to talk about soccer so let's stick with the American sports if you have a must win\nIt's an advantage now it can be such a stressful situation it can start to have some negative elements but in general and football if you have one team that you know is going to be motivated and the other team has questionable motivation that team with the clear\nQuote unquote must win motivation has an advantage football basketball\nBaseball is not about effort it's not about ... obviously you got to make a minimum effort but it's not about we're going to try extra hard today guys know if anything that tightens you up that stress you out baseball is a very Zen game it's not about aggression\nSo the instinct to the betting market artist say wait a minute Boston there are up one oh they're fine but the Dodgers need this when\nTo me that's a negative not a positive but right now Boston favored minus one forty it seems like it's being price that oh the Dodgers have an advantage because they are more motivated I think that's a disadvantage RJ about says free pick Boston minus one forty tonight we\nWill get defenses best bet here coming up in a moment what about you know we are brought to you by Geico were Fifteen minutes could say be Fifteen Percent or more on car insurance it is a double header tonight on ESPN in the NBA and we start in Atlanta maps at the hawks Dallas a one and a half point favorite\nSo fast you got first I I think NBA best out of the year on straight out of Vegas\nYeah I like Dallas I bet Dallas modest one and a half it is all about Dallas being undervalued based upon last year's win loss record the only one twenty four games are Jay\nHow did the only one twenty four games well they somehow what eleven and thirty four in games decided by seven points or fewer coin flip games but they really weren't coin flip games because Dallas\nHad some very questionable personnel and the final five minutes of many of these games late in the year they were trying to lose in my opinion by using their second stringers now they're trying to win so because of that Dallas undervalued solid I get tonight Dallas might want an app\nSo what you're saying is Dallas was tanking that led them to have a worst record last year there were being valued this year based upon last year's record but they're trying to win this year value on the ... you specially liked him best bet tonight against the hot correct okay and we got one more NBA game remember guys in our last block\nRight before seven eastern we always give you which you need for tonight's TV action that's why we call it Jonas coined the phrase the pregame show you always wanted its Milwaukee it's Philadelphia lined opened up walk he favored by four and a half\nIt's been box box on the bucks I've never said that before box on the box up to six\nI actually still like ... year I'm not patting it so that's called the lean and here's why I don't think any team in the NBA has benefited more than ... from the new coach\nAnd they're running a very modern off fence\nAnd this is a team that uh is going to benefit from they got the players to benefit from that type of ... on the other hand Philadelphia if you listen to the guys watch every game and be just not moving as effectively in the block says he's been\nIs it injury is it something I don't know walk you know I think is better than the record\nPhilly probably a little bit worse somebody go with a pretty strong lean on the box tonight minus six\nThe odd couple of comes up next we are straight out of Vegas

I'm not this how the science and so on and so forth\nBut analytics if a piece of the puzzle it is not the whole puzzle in the end it's not just baseball is the NBA\nSam hanky tried to run the Philadelphia Seventy Sixers based entirely on analytics and where to give them they were horrible now I Know you can say oh well they got on the phone and they got all them people that are terrible let's see let's see how well that works out\nThose are two guys it looked like there'll be start but remember they also drafted in our lives do well where's he and Joe mill ogre for do they have they ended up so many times in the lottery that they finally got lucky and got two guys who looked like they could play two guys who have been hurt too\nSo I don't want analytics used to have an analytics department\nBut your baseball operations or your basketball operations should not be run entirely based on analytics\nI'm getting sick of it eight seven seven Ninety nine or Fox a seven seven nine nine six sixty three sixty nine give us a call do you like this analytics stuff do you think it's gone too far Ron I'm Sorry\nI don't I don't know if there's going to send anybody but as revenge of the nerds no it is it's a bunch of nerdy dues to mount a lot a lot of them don't do anything about ... ... playing it at any level you have to be a pro we didn't play pro you know we didn't play big time but highly baseball you know baseball's feel\nThere and all these guys I Believe that can't watch the game and and tell us how you know from from knowledge they can just tell you about the numbers and it is revenge of the nerves the guys that never got picked\nTo play on the playground and and they were upset and they were maybe unfortunately they were bullied I don't justify that they were you know whatever they weren't the popular kids the cool kids the in crowd like the jocks\nBut now they're they've taken over sports and they like it and it's gone too far no doubt about it and as for all the Billy Bean\nYou know ah they give them so much props on all that\nCan you tell me the championship that the Oakland A's won with Billy Bean's running an analyst ain't of nine zero and so everybody oh well you guys are dinosaurs you're living in the past\n... you know you've got to have the right match ups RBI don't matter wins don't matter they got all these different things that will tell you oh no walks and run scored matter how ... strike outs don't matter they got all this other stuff\nAnd it's been killing his bank killing baseball I is\nKilling the game because I'm I'm ... I don't recognize the game anymore I\nArrived GR produces just that day Roberts obviously the the manager for the Dodgers just used the phrase on him LB network trust\nOf the process of stop stop um he he he decides like here's all these guys and then there's the other one\nIf you don't want to play ball they're way\nThey won't look at all the older managers who they got rid of ... whatever yeah they all John Farrell one of ... what a championship with the red Sox they got rid of hell Baker dusty Baker's out of a job Joe Gerard he's out of a job\nUh that we just saw um Mike soldiers out of a job and and buck showed all of a job and uh who was the uh the Mets mount a judge is a ... ah just this year no two years ago just got fired ah just forgot his name but but the another one another older guy who they got rid of\n'em and this is where we are now they don't want those guys any more they want these young guys they want to be able to hand Jew there are and they're not\nThat's why they're not paying these men and no they don't want to pay and they don't believe the manager has anything to do with it is so bad\nHere analytics led to what we saw last night ... and over emphasis and when the analytic because again I'm not saying it doesn't have its place\nBut it led to what we saw last night with pneumonia is taking taking Alex would deep and an Indian\nGame one for the chances for the Dodgers it led to the Houston Rockets missing twenty seven straight three pointers\nIn the playoffs right ... ... against the Ghost Wars how do we have seven straight do we not this right but he made his when he got re believe you should only shoot a three point or or something and the pain and let me say this fall the analytics ... Linux hands out there who are getting upset with Rob Parker me\nIn terms of the NBA they love the Golden State warriors\nThey say the Golden State warriors are the team that you know revolutionized basketball and that is true with a three point shooting and all that the Golden State warriors don't\nShoot too many three pointers last year that were around twenty fifth and the league ... said that they were first in three point percentage but they were a number on the mountain right and the amount that's a great tap into Iran is a mid range killer\nSteph Curry and clay times the ... green and the ranch they all get back door lay if they get tons of back girl a of off cuts they don't over extend themselves just to shoot the three pointer people should learn from that their bounds and guess what his balance the Boston Red\nSox right right now probably the best team in baseball they don't they knew of analytical they don't go away don't they don't go overboard\nYou see we've seen them
