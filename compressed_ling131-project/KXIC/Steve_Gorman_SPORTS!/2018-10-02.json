didn't know what to do their well Notre Dame sixteen but for him not to recognize that they made a quarterback switching they went there as a short dog against the guys from Winston Salem they bloom out by twenty five plus\nI let me ask this question clients and we were talking about where they should be Ken Thompson you have a very strong opinion because let's be candid Brad's been getting a lot of love here but we call it the way it happens truth is the king\nYou saw Clemson was right there with ... ... ... for the first game of the year you know cold what what's that ice cold takes or whatever they call them what would you had the line between Alabama and climb some neutral ...\nAlabama three okay and today [noise] Alabama twelve\nOkay that's a big job and I'm On some of that bam a but some of that is ... and Ken what are you staying with climbs\nTheir secondaries not stronger defensive lines that standing there is no doubt we know those four guys are all going to play on Sundays but other than that\nThey're struggling and the often who's going three and out sometimes and putting pressure on that defense so the defense outside of the front lines not strong enough and killing month protects you saying that showed even though that line is great you can improvise and you can make plays outside and stay away from that defensive line which is a strength of Clinton and then Lawrence\nUnless he's going to be able to get in there and take good\nSturdy hits I mean if he's not able to take a good shot like he did last week\nThey could be in a lot of trouble now Brian Scott\nYeah and here's the issue that habit clams and okay now you've got a quarter but you've got a really bad quarterback situation right now yes you have traveled Lawrence who's back\nThis week against Wake Forest but are you going to be willing to ride him anymore are you going to run your full off and knowing that he's already got banged up in his first rare start you have a relatively inexperienced guy behind them and after that it's just a bunch of walk ons and through freshman I got to wonder if climate is going to be very conservative on the off on the side of the ball moving forward\nIf ... if Notre Dame and Clemson both finish undefeated and there's one spot left in the college football playoff who gets it\nI don't think I think that's an impossible hypothetical or I Will say impossible because in theory Oklahoma could be undefeated and Ohio right but I think an undefeated clams and an undefeated Notre Dame gets in a head of any one last champion\nYeah and and I mean I mean even if Alabama's somehow loses a game early\nStill makes the conference finals and beats Georgia indoor one last champion I don't think you can have an ACC champ especially one with the pedigree at Clemson this undefeated not may exactly\nMy sentiments exactly\nAll right so what if all of them finish undefined but we have here yeah\nAnd it doesn't happen that uh there how it happened\nI Know and then when I was sixteen never be the one but it happened this year no no I hear you in a list and it'd be a good week for talk radio [laughter] I don't it will be doing God or our overnight shift no for a\nMan I'll just take the top six and do two segments on each come on man that will build the whole show\n[laughter] last question to the college experts\nMatty hold who is a book maker longtime book makers super sharp he's going to be on the show tomorrow join and a wise guy round table\nHe said look at the FCC and look at all the underdogs covering if you look at other than bam a the dogs are covering at a very the underdogs at a very high rate\nAny ideas of why my first thought my gut instinct\nIs this is a the SEC is not as good as they typically are and that's the difference between the third best team in the eighth best team isn't as much as a typical year invest the dogs are cash in any side does that sound right or what do you guys think\nIt does I mean for several years when when the SEC one six straight national champions and it was three or four dominant teams in the conference each year LSU Florida Alabama Georgia all those teams now it's pretty much Alabama to a lesser extent Georgia and then everyone else seems to be on an even playing field not\nSurprised that but that's not perception no that's not per se and that's when when the perception has there been being a big difference between teams when there is not the dog's cover dogs have been covering the SEC\nYeah but it's also the lower echelon teams in the SEC like Vanderbilt to pick their game up dirt masons done a nice job they wanted to South Bend only lose by five so again you're seeing some of the bottom two teams\nUp there on a a little bit sharpest roundtable on radio Ken Thompson Brad powers I'm RJ bell and when we come back\nI'm all over the guys with the twelve man the guys from College Station Texas\nOkay so this is early Tuesday early best bat and usually if you got an early ... if you are going to play play it early because that's the weak progress is the lines get sharper and when they get sharper well you win last\nBed early when you can if you like it ... what's your take on that but\nYeah I've already bad and em I Love that he's in that game so green button no green but I Know I have a green button ... now eight to ... when the I mean that was that aspect of toilet paper he's not going to do it\nLet's do it real quick because we can quickly negotiate a bad here so the markets eight to one\nI ... I just I don't want right now [noise] holy cow ... no\nIt doesn't matter to a toilet quarter you're talking about like they're going to get secretary of men are you kidding me to try to go up out of that so that's the only way you're saying the market is eight to one yeah I'd write a bad if I go out and say I don't know I Want to bet there's got to hide but I can\nGet eight to one Brad powers as Kent talks they'll give you twenty five to one can says no thank you and there you go wow you got to get ... hey listen give Brad some credit right there no doubt about our\nJail getting some credit real quick cash Daniel also suspended first half their for Kentucky they're leading tack were so good first half that but that line will come out today the game\nI saw the best pet early from can ...\nYou know there's an old story in baseball where they say Babe Ruth called a shot in the world series they say he pointed to defend against the cubs pointed towards the injury but nobody knows for sure if that's true a lot of people have debated whether or not that sort of make believe to make Babe Ruth seemed like this mythical figure\nWe have somebody who we've actually seen and call his shot somebody who actually pointed towards the fence and in fact did hit that home run and that somebody is Steve ...\nIt was impressive I mean it was like it was like you had a premonition some people have premonition it was like you had a premonition fast tell the story last week\nOne week ago I picked the Cincinnati Bengals why he didn't get he didn't you think you'd be it\nOh shot coming out like aw shucks no he comes out ... and I tell you about federal\nPlus five it out by saying you got about this now the wind is likely to drop I liked the bank it was a lot in this game for the wind dropped all the way down to three and a half\nWhat happens with the gained the bangles are trailing by five late in the game with time running out everyone knew about the bangles late in the weakest sweating it out AJ green bake them the money not us because even if they hadn't gotten again so we went to cash plus five and now\nThat the fans are all the five boroughs\nIt makes sense though is if as you actually put out your line move predictions every Thursday right yeah five of them a week you say these five NFL games this is the way I think the line moving you've done it for years\nAnd when the line moves if the law doesn't move at all it's a tie when it moves you've been right over Seventy percent of the time now why does that matter Joan is think about a a an NFL game you like\nIf that says a lot going to get better for you you wait effect says the lines going to get worse ... early\nAnd Seventy percent of the time you're going to get a better number doing it that way\nMakes a ton of sense are fed by the way you can follow says on Twitter at ... exports F easy gee I carry a tragic sports get those on Thursday thirty seconds says what's your early ... this week\nBatting betting Seattle plus seven\nHosting the rams Seattle has the biggest home field advantage in the NFL worth four points and Seattle is only what played one game at home so their stats don't look very good because most of the games have been on the road home run situation for Seattle and the odds makers they've had enough of these rams catching all these tickets they've been waiting to decline Seattle for seven\nSo you're so you're saying you speak the launch going to go down yeah the rams are the most bet team in the NFL and its president says that the lines are going to drop away from the rams
