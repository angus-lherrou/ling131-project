having home advantage so the seventh games in Boston if it happens they're saying there is a little less than a sixty percent chance Houston wins the series if Houston had home advantage\nIt'd be about sixty five percent chance the idea\nYou know actually if you look at the math a little closer if it weren't a neutral it'd be sixty five if it were in Houston it'd be Seventy two so the idea that you own a neutral let's use that\nHouston would win two out of three series\nBut the red Sox won five more games that does that make sense on the surface explained\nYet because the playoffs are all about pitching and starting pitching and that Red Sox team that can rake with the best of him hitting wise you look at their pictures number one picture Chris Sale dominant picture much of the year he is not right he was pitch in one or two innings in September trying to get back\nInto the groove only pitched five and a third as first playoff game either number two starter David Price has not been right and he has a long history of failure in the playoffs\nYou're saying the reality today is different than across the seas and so even the red Sox have five more winds throughout the season Houston without the advantage of the home advantage still supposed to win\nAlmost sixty percent of the time and the series listen guys when it Vegas odds don't make sense on the surface there's usually a good reason\nGuys next up we go back to the NBA the regular season starts in less than a week and on bleacher report there was an article talking about how the bronze supporting cast for the Lakers is comparable to the one he had including in Cleveland Colin Powell heard\nDisagrees folks if you think this team's going to struggle to get the forty when you're out of your gored\nThe cabs without liberal on in the last four years that's with Kevin Love that was with Kyrie Irving that was when Jay are Smith in Calgary last for years without liberal there were four and\nTwenty three and the weaker east the Lakers last year without what brought in a bunch of babies a bunch of kids one thirty five games in the significantly tougher western conference\nThis Laker roster is younger more athletic quicker longer significantly better defensively Lakers got to be just fine\nYeah call and I agree could not agree with him more\nWe talked about this on the weekend straight out of Vegas show before the football season started by the way guys there is as over the weekend at eleven o'clock Pacific right before midnight on Saturday nights Joan is hosting this week and my crackdown that John is\nThat is correct it will be the lowest rated episode ever I'm\nSure okay for [laughter] worthless yes absolutely but we were talking [laughter] we were talking about this very thing fed the idea that this calves team with outlook Braun is somehow compare comparable to this Lakers team\nWith LeBron or I'm Sorry without liberal in both cases let's just talk supporting cast\nThe Lakers supporting cast is just so much better if these teams without LeBron just disappointing cash were playing on a neutral court what's the lot I'd make the Lakers a six point favorite a six point so\nI Know I'm just asking you this off the cuff is Golden State played the Lakers with liberal on on a neutral which a lot\nGolden State minus seven so think about that the distance from this Lakers team that everyone's saying oh even with LeBron who knows\nTo the best team of this generation Golden State is about the same distance from the Lakers supporting cast over the Cavs supporting cast\nSo bleach report mainstream media mess as we like to say way wrong to last things about the Lakers this year\nIf you answer this question you know what to do with their wind total by the way their season when total forty eight and a half so they went forty nine or more games they exceed expectations Lakers\nForty eight or last they fall short fast you liked the over a little bit here right yes I Do if I could get the answer to this question I Would love\nThe over or under based upon the answer\nIs is a statement season for LeBron is he going to say hey Lakers LA has welcomed me with the\nLoving embrace that I Am used to I'm going to prove to them I still got it and if he's going to play every game or close to like you did last year play with the vigor during the regular season we play last year\nI make one of my biggest ... of the year on over forty eight and a half ... regular season Lakers\nIf he considers this a transition season\nThen I think all bets are off I don't know the answer to that question to me it's the key to the Lakers season when we come back\nWe're going to talk we'll let you say that there is going to be a intense debate between me and Brad powers\nThat's RJ bell

saying rams are about plus what one Seventy five you're saying yes and you're saying even during the good paths ... and you're a plus two fifty plus three hundred\nAnd some seasons it was best teams five to one six to one Seventy one yes so once again NBA historically big favor college football historically big favorite\nAnd also in the NFL with a ramp see not pal attracts deem a historically big favor and just a minute we're going to talk a little bit about that patriots team actually we're going to do a preview of the four biggest games of the weekend\nThat's all coming up next year on straight out of Vegas first though for the latest from around the world a sports fan by\nJimmy Butler actually practice with the Minnesota timber wolves today and one of the practice it was in the twin cities ESPN reporting that\nButler at times during the scrimmage ended up yelling at GM's Scott Laden saying quote you bleeping made me you can't win without me and quote butler also yelled at teammates yelled at coaches and then left practice\nBut after practice she went and spoke with ESPN about today's practice\nWhat is the right way to do it no I Can't control that when I'm Out there competing like that's my love of the game that's wrong me me at my finest him I'm sure if that's what you're going to get inside the lives\nWell we'll see if another team gets Jimmy Butler as the Miami Heat want to talk with the timber wolves about the trade again they did have substantial trade talks earlier before they broke up there was a report to the ... spoke with the rockets as recently as yesterday but no deal obviously was struck their customer base recruits Bryant\nReportedly turned out to two hundred million dollar offer for a contract extension with the team\nAccording to NBC Chicago Bryant is under control of the club for the next three years\nThe third baseman reportedly wants to go through arbitration during those seasons build said go Sean McDermott didn't dismiss trade rumors surrounding running back with John McCoy\nBut did say that the team is getting calls all the time but Germany wouldn't answer specifically if McCoy was available and declined to answer if the eagles had called about a trade the NFL did find Steelers coach Mike Tomlin twenty five thousand dollars today for criticizing the officials following Sundays win against the falcons guys\nWhen he called the officiating quote a joke and quotes unhappy over a penalty called on CJ walk on a shocking of Matt Ryan guys back to you they\nStand straight out of Vegas comes to you live here from the guy go Fox Sports radio studios where it's easy to say Fifteen Percent or more on car insurance would guy go go to guy go to a comical eight hundred nine four seven auto the only hard parts figuring out which way is easier\nComing up Fifteen minutes from now best bets here on straight out of Vegas your chance to make a little bit of cash on a Wednesday night I Am Jonas knocks the voice of you the fan and he is the voice of Vegas RJ bill\nYou know this is kind of like the the turning point of the week John is we have five shows a week\nEach ... an hour so the halfway mark of the Wednesday show is the mid week turn and we start focusing on looking ahead to the weekend and we've got a four big games here to NFL two college\nLet's start with the Steelers\nSays Pittsburg at Cincinnati Bengals home favor two and a half home field advantage in the NFL is worth three so the market is saying since he is a ... worse than its dealers who do you lean to who do you like I like the Steelers\nI bet the Steelers plus the two and a half it's all about the bangles being over rated ESPN has them at the number six team I have the Bengals as my number four team team RJ and it's because of all the close games the Bengals have had and somehow they keep winning\nThese coin flip games now that's the question though because I had\nThe Miami Dolphins fan either way [laughter] and I had it everywhere I Do Adam Corolla I was on with him having and being in LA biggest morning show\nHad their had it in ... and our five thousand dollars super contests [noise] now working competitive [noise] they were winning\nThey were winning Seventeen to three and the fourth quarter they were blowing out the bangles\nThey weren't getting six point\nI mean you should be lighten up a red our backs the guard at that point picks sex pick pick\nPick six off of an offensive lineman face mask Rick itching backwards [noise]\nNow there's two ways\nAfter you're done crime to respond to that one is the say okay Freddy fanny pack he's eating his Twinkie on a stick that's been deep fried and in between bites he's saying\nThose Bengals are mighty good they know how to win and I heard serious talk radio guys like you would think there are serious saying the bangles know how to win [laughter] come on it's ... NGOs got lucky\nAnd to me this team the bangles could easily be one and for that three calling for they've all three gone for them for and what\nThey could easily just as easily all three go the other way it'd be one and for what the line be in this game then would still be favored by six [laughter] seriously if the bank was one in four what's the line and this cat\nI think the Steelers would be laying three they were laying three in the playoffs in since the not that long ago\nI'm Glad you brought it up I ask is what the bangles doing big games RJ they don't\nWin them and guys I've actually learned this from hanging around you guys I don't know if it's a good thing but I'm assuming it is because I have learned that if a team gets a lot of breaks one year they're probably not getting those breaks the next year and I've made mental notes on the Cincinnati Bengals probably going for and twelve or five eleven next year based on what they've had happened\nAs well listen I think we can feel that reality this year\nAnd I like also Pittsburgh so we have a double like on the Steelers next NFL game quickly ... patch favored by three and a half at home against case the now actually John as we've got a little bit of sound on\nThe yes on good morning football on the NFL Network Nate Burleson said this about the Kansas City chiefs defense\nAs we all know about the NFL is so what have you done for ... and that have been lately has so little league but\n\nNo editorial no we added the cuckoo's now last week\nFive hundred yards they gave up to the jags five hundred yard that with the legit defense from Kansas City and oh by the way and calling towered on the herd and the staff at the herd do a wonderful job they had this today through five games\nKansas city's given up more yards than any team in NFL history so by that\nAnd I would say this guy's eye when people criticize me for betting on preseason football or pre season basketball\nWho what kind of nuts that people that have a standard supposedly I listen it's not preseason cash it's it off\nBut it's the same so who cares just you know it's a different time of year\nI've said this before if you told me RJ I Need you to go five and oh and one sport and one month of the season so you can pick up my pick a sport you gotta pick five games if you go five and I'm giving you a million bucks\nI Swear I think of the major sports fast kills the WMBA hey we promise we won't talk much about it we'll get back now and again\nFor ... chose the WMBA but at the major sports I Would pick the best chance to go five no NFL preseason let's go around the horn says what would you do NFL preseason\nNFL preseason even a brand new used to work fulfilled steel who used to now the markets passing by I think in the pre season for he used to dominate the pre season how you can be the pre season and in the NFL\nGuys next up we go to Thursday Night Football where the Philadelphia Eagles are a three point favorite out the giants\nI so we'll be talking about this game a good bit tomorrow fast but our promises we give you a ... bat and our promises we talk about all tonight's game well we already talked the Lakers preseason let's look ahead quickly\nYeah I like the giants I bet the giants plus three and I'm sure you've been batting a lot of these get I'm going to make a recommendation I Would bet this tonight not tomorrow because this wind could drop down to two and a half hour Jay and when you say it could it could go up to seven so it\nSo you think it's more likely to drop yes and remember guys it's not just who you bat it's when you bat and fads is really good at predicting these line moves in fact every Tuesday during this last segment of the hour we give his early NFL pick\nWhich was what this way Tennessee Titans plus three against Baltimore so you think not only is Tennessee going to cover your to know and this pick this year\nUh but you also think the line drops you went to bed early and you're saying if you like the giants you recommend batting early there's no guarantee the either the games get a win for sure no guarantee or that they live in a move that way\nBut when you have a strong opinion on these ... who says ask like what four years you've been writing about Seventy percent of the time I have so hey I'll take that anytime\nGuys next up we'll take an early look ahead to the NFL cs it is set Dodgers brewers game on friday night on Fox Sports one\nAnd right now and another road\nTeam favored in this series and in this case Dodgers minus one let's call one sixties between one fifty one sixty\nAnd that one sixty brewers are plus one forty so Dodgers minus one sixty walkie plus one forty so we're in that\nSixty two percent range ... or so where the Dodgers are supposed to win clearly but not a dominant favor again to row team favored you know I'd like Milwaukee\nHere this is like who is the baseball sexiest team left\nYou could count as say the red Sox I say it's the Dodgers and who's the least sexy team\nRight certainly not the red Sox it's certainly not the defending champions it's Milwaukee and if if we know anything about baseball and we've seen it we had the red Sox right here on this show yesterday as a pretty big dog\nThe good teams the dominant teams the seemingly dominant teams aren't as dominant in the playoffs so it's usually dog first and when I have a baseball sexy team and the Dodgers being a big favor against the least sexy\nMilwaukee Brewers if I can get the plus one forty I'm actually going to like that I'm not going to make that best that I'm going to like Milwaukee in this series I'm going to give you a quick RJ early Best Buy here to keep our daily promise\nI'm going with the Steelers I'm a Steelers fan but I bet
