{"month": "10", "state": "IA", "station": "KXIC", "content": "Titanic I Can't even go to Nate beat him and huh down you know no can't do it\nI'll I'll say this dug for the rookie quarterback so that we saw in the national football league this year all of them at least had a plan ... plan B whether it be Bradford in Arizona with Glenn in the brown situation with bigger may feel you know the jets at a bunch of quarterbacks with Bridgewater andme account to the bills just completely whipped\nOn having any sort of backup plan no they had AJ McCarron there remember he got hurt then it within traded to the raiders so you have a ... you know\nYou may even cares hurt though and he ... he was hurt in the pre season right\nYeah and then and then it it was kind of a ... like situation where they didn't expect to play Josh ... and then he played better than they thought and they had an ape you determine who they thought he could be a viable backup but yes I think ... Jimmy Karen originally was supposed to start a couple of games but then he got hurt in the pre season where he couldn't he couldn't start\nYeah the thing that Josh Allen to carry the load though I I don't know yeah they botched it oh yeah they screwed up everything offensively their defenses in terrible for them or to Michigan I go to Jim ... still isn't ... past yeah with the Michigan State Spartans in at George marked Antonio\nThere was the pre game walk on Saturday by Michigan State Harbaugh calling it a close line of is of players he also called the Bush league after the game and today ... even more to say\nUsing the word juvenile I think that's brought trying to brush it under the carpet because you know their strength coaches were out there leading it they're just in coaches route they're coached Antonio was right behind them was\nThat all the euro markings and an evidence of a a orchestrated storm trooper march ... further during birth and used coached Antonio's words from from a few years back it's it's not a product of the team but their program blue\nVotes so everybody think Michigan is a bad guy because uh wasn't getting Bush would ever west Robin he was doing that like like a dog barking at territory and after the game they called him a little brother ... little brother here that before the game Michigan State players like lock to arm locked arms and started walking out on the field\nAnd like there's like Michigan players in their way and like it didn't matter dome ... dumb\nMark Antonio vinyl\n[laughter] [noise]\n[noise] [noise]\nOh you know you know Jim album missed a golden opportunity\n[noise]\nI was too busy you they held them to below a hundred yards total often\nBryan Lewinsky was horrendous actually you know what if I called them Iran does there's players that play that ... that would be offended [noise] so I I think Michigan I understand why Michigan ... starting quarterback Michigan State senior five twenty five or sixty six yards\nL. J. Scott star running back ten yards that doesn't care he's twenty five yards rushing [noise]\nI mean it was a complete and total up Michigan say on third down their downs that converted one zero zero of twelve doughnuts bagel zero but uh yeah the ... river march clearly ticked off Michigan it didn't exactly work from Michigan State\nFinally dug Lakers forward Brenda ... says he was expected to be expecting to be suspended more than four games and the guy for his role of the problem with the rockets ... was started to this place than out against the spurs loves all starting in places will be suspended Roger I'm Rhonda huge opportunity for Alonzo ball\nWill that change in the future may just based on how the game on bowls but\nI think it's always smart to try to get certain touches for certain players if you can do that I always had that we always had a guy we want to get twenty touches too don't regardless of how the game\nWhen it just forces you to do it because eventually I was twenty touches you get some production out of it even if it's a slow start so I think that's I I Know that's what they're doing just watching it they're not telling me that but yeah I could see that have the\nSame age or maybe it happened before the Maryland made you turn the game off [laughter] ... how did you get a chance to see Stanley's interception it was the the third game in a row they had a real strange interception ... he's trying to throw about five yard pass\nTo Hawkins and over the middle he air males Hawkins in by a few yards and hits a linebacker and the numbers third game in a row that you sent an opponent in almost in stride\nOr did you get a chance to see that how much of that can be blamed on a strong wind\nYou know I Do not dinner exception uh but I Will say that you know when you're throwing with the wind or I never really had issues the sort of overthrowing\nA on a shorter intermediate half know throwing against the wind up the ball doesn't come out of your hand right you know who knows where it's going to gather some time to nosedive sometimes it shoots the writer to the left or even occasionally shorter rises on yeah if it was a pretty stiff freeze I Know there was a map all game I Will say that I did see the other quarterback\nOr come in there I I watch the driver to it is I I don't know much about him I was out and my father hawk eye as closely as the psych loans but ah I Love I like the way that kids play I like this or that the\n... energy for that often or he ran a couple of times on some nice run by just sort of you know I sort of like it when the kids out there trying to make things happen and and uh I enjoy watching it seemed like a you could be an exciting young young quarterbacks blog guys\nSay shock nailed it earlier I think when he was talking about I was defense and just how good they are up front and how it's enabled the the rest of those guys to kind of learn on the go and I I truly think that we can talk about rock pretty David Montgomery whatever I think the reason I stayed is is set up\nA for some success\nThe long term and specifically this upcoming years they're defensive line I I just I I texted Ross Ross it was after ... made that play I text you and I said do you realize that I I truly believe we've got two of the best defensive lines in the country playing in the state of Iowa right now and it just changes\nEverything when you're that good up front\nAnd I'm specifically anxious to see\nWhat Iowa State does with the Texas Tech quarterback and we we can get to that here in just a little bit but I I I Am curious on the by a week of if you got to watch the new film and um that defensive line for Iowa State in the versatility that it's given Iowa State Steve in so far the season\nOr yeah I mean for for one I Would just plays a sort of a difference the deep end that nobody else place that I've seen him and major college football they have a really unusual funds and they'll look and\nThey have this middle safety that really is almost like a linebacker who's coming down hill a and is there any way or the way that why I Will say that you know if you have a really good friends of mine and outlook like we've got two teams of the state of Iowa have good defensive line\nThat changes everything and I think like you know what the NFL or the ballot check you know the great friends of mine to build ballot jak those teams those great teams he had no back some days of ... or ... and those guys on that you can find a really big enough that the line that was\nIncredible off five guys across the board you know then you had just marked stab you guys like have you Bruce the behind them who\nLook probably much better than they actually were the secondary guys thought looked bears and they actually were there a damn about from South in the run caused loss or long now they're throwing the ball you get past rushing in and you make these look pretty dang good so having a good deal on the line\nOr make everybody else look better and particularly on the middle linebacker let's look at Iowa State\nAnd then I was Mike roast can he looks really good but no line backers are are you know guards can come off of the but the the the double team on the nose tackle really quick because the notes tackled not any good and ... on those line backers\nUh it makes you know that that makes for job really hard and so it's no my roses or is it Mike Roosevelt tough to Rome a little bit and and and the office of lines like at hand on them some time\nOr we saw that last year or with or without the middle linebacker so you get a good deal with the mind trades makes everybody else look better linebacker look better safety look better and and uh it's really fun to have you know good defense but that's a great way to place especially in the big while because\nEveryone in that sort of designed a roster to al ... is that these are up and down games but I said is are chosen the route of\nA you know if you have really good defense you'll stay in nearly every football game and have a chance to win\nA it's really really hard to find out working you know sixty nine to the sixty like facts as that goes I actually that got you know try to do I think long term and and uh you know consistently over the years went on a game\nOr the way out if they find right now is is conducive to wins I think we're going to allow gay McGrath OSH\nAs far as the by we goes I I feel like that's a really good time for Bronx pretty safe to have that\nEverybody's telling me how good your um you know there's there's ... there's you know everybody's super excited I can only imagine what that film room was likely lake with him I I Would guess that they probably beat down every mistake he made over the last two weeks and just hit them over there\nOr throws it just one like it did the other day where you just kind of roll your eyes or what what was that were that come from and I I don't have an answer for that this has one of those throws a game where it's mystifying and but I think\nOver time is limited though I think he's gotten better already\nHe's had a you know he says one is that a two or three like he had to pass\nAnd hopefully you'll have it all cleaned up by the time he graduates but just every now and are you going to have one of those and\nI think so to some degree knows he has a strong arm he does and I think he feels like I can grill I can grow this thing right in between guys you know I can do this or that it doesn't work out\nChuck lung said Rosa Vilsack reactionary and fourteen sixty ... I see in Iowa City sage Texas Tech comes to town um I I'll throw in as a quick commentary I think they're better defensive Texas Tech team than we've probably seen in ten years they're still not about\nDefense though a cliff kings marries the coach they've got their true freshman quarterback Alex Bowman who had collapsed lungs three weeks ago he's back ... Kansas my question for you\nIs what is it about the kings Barry Mike Leach system where it seems like they can plug in anybody in there and they're going to put up monster numbers it doesn't matter if they're true freshman walk on like we saw Baker may feel do\nMayfield and Patrick Murray homes to me seemed to be the outliers here because most of these tech quarterbacks to not perform well\nOr even make it to the national football league so what is it about the system that gives guys an opportunity to put up the numbers that they do and what do you think about this match up on Saturday [noise]\nYou know I I've always sort of thought that the way you know Texas Tech coaches the quarterback is the way\nThat you brought stuffed her career or South Korea earlier I'm I feel like that's the way they teach their quarterback just sort of be a a a shooter know shoot your shop and they do it a lot I'm sure the practices they're throwing the ball all oh or or not if they do with the games as well\nAnd so you just have your quarterback who are just\nConstantly throwing the football I mean just all day long they're just thrown thrown up on it and you get really good at it and then so they have a lot of you know ...\nYou know deep in shorts and uh but you get really good at it I mean do you find different ways to do it in there for a wide swath time uh they usually can't run the football very well uh but you know over time though by the way they've actually gotten a before they have some really good at all or vaccine Baker Mayfield\nDavis Web or an hour Patrick my home those the last three or your Texas Tech quarterback so they do have an assault guy which\nLet me interrupt you really quick just for prospective to show a great ... was Web and Baker both transfer because they know they couldn't beat out mom's isn't that ... ...\nThe home because ... tell you that I met a couple of guys don't already know about the home really is good but like I [laughter] this throws now or what's cool about for me is that he's very on traditional like he started was trained that way\nUh you know it's no again about talking about stuff curry like he was not hold no you're not old like don't do it or do it this way and don't do it this way you have to throw a certain way into the to have to be a certain way you know he just throws it however it needs to come off and and the dog is so strong that there's a lot of\nFor nature and that but uh you know he throws a lot on your boss sideways mouth the wrong button whatever he has not been overly like put it into the shackles of this is how you have to be a quarter back in and out perfect fundamentals them\nAnd I think that makes a big difference you know it it can really yet he really is a lot like a a young Brett Farr but a better butter or more athletic and so yeah I I'm really I'm really looking for he's going to be I think the most fun quarterback to watch\nProbably over the next ten years I'm if I'm going out of algae yeah I think the next ten years I I think Patrick brought home the guy who want\nTo wait for five nine six six if you'd like to jump into the conversation that we are key from Des Moines checks and hey Keith how are you sir\nHey guys had got a couple of questions for each of yeah say agent and chat about the conferences first for Chuck I'm who'd you vote for right now for first team all big trend quarterback and is seeking\nPurdue to win the Big Ten West is that out of the question wow\nTwo good ones Chuck do you have a name they threw out right now for all Big Ten quarterback\nI'd tell you what guys right now I always said David for a while for do\nAnd it's it's it's\nIt's him or ... of Ohio State and they're both\nPlan is very high level so loud you know is bill how state and it was loud doing it [laughter] that could that could even start the air but is on fire right now and look out for Perdue guys look out for Perdue\nMan he ... he's a hell of a coach you a million ... they've been they've been better press that was a team you thought would you step back ... and then they did at the beginning of the year I thought I was going to be pretty smart and he his I mean he's done an incredible job there I mean they\n'cause they're not as talented chunk is they were even a year ago are they all just be just coaching them\nA lot they lost a lot of guys last year he's an excellent football coach maybe one of the best in the country going right now and uh and I always say the same for a mat Campbell up in Iowa State\nA more situations yeah he's one of the hottest guys go right now but man as a plate color or Jeff ... there is nobody better right now they're called ways\nHe is such great creativity he says plays up if you want if you want to study a guy that knows how to call play study that guy he knows what he's doing\nSome trip when you're going ... very very intense when he calls players like uh the whole a\nOf the world on the line or something it'd be hard not to be excited the runoff has to play or foreign I'm On the big twelve the first stage I have a couple of questions number one at Oklahoma\nAnd Texas played Saturday who's your pick to win and um who's the most underrated coach you think in the big twelve now hang up a lesson\nKimberly ... Campbell under rated coaching the big twelve all I all I think\nThat I think that's ... Campbell I I think people don't realize I if I go to ... years even though I Know it gets a lot of\nNational recognition but you know again I most importantly what he has done that with John have talked with the defense says nothing short of phenomenon now they twenty points down\nA then about four years ago I think I think they're giving up thirty nine points to a four years ago and now they're sitting around twenty I think so now maybe less Chris probably knows that answer so I I still think back Campbell's really underrated but just because people don't aren't quite sure yet\nUh but I think he's probably one of the best if not may maybe the best books and the big well\nChuck this ... looming bounces off of you your buddy\nI still think Gary Gary Paterson's the most underrated coach and how big twelve at TC this guy who who took a program from the mountain west\nTo the single handedly got a program ended the big twelve he's in a conference that is all about a sense in the past and he's made his niche his defense in every year during the hot there down this year I understand that but I I still think nationally people don't appreciate what Gary Patterson has done Chuck\n... that I think the coaches do the coaches yeah shit obviously\nOvertime that your heart radio weakens boring time capsule\nWas said football is hungry action on fourteen sixty ... am eight hundred K. actually\nAbout ... alright welcome back ... hawk reaction\nAge Rosenfeld Chuck Long here on fourteen sixty ... I see in Iowa City were presented is always by gene mix we'll start with the Iowa hot guys Ross go on the road to Penn State and I think it's fair to say their toughest game\nOf the season I no doubt about that especially if you're looking at what's left I mean Wisconsin at home was a tough one but at the beginning of the season Chuck this was one that I thought this team would be ten into a debt\nThat looks tough right now because Nebraska is getting better produced along the schedule northwestern can come up and bite ya but this Penn State game was one that I had as a loss I'm a little bit more confident having watched Penn State so they're ... a couple of times how do you feel about Saturday\nA yeah I feel the same way I think a have a good chance to go in and a half now and when the football game or again this gets back to how they can corral ... or so early\nAnd you know they're they're they've lost a couple of home now and so they they don't have that home\n... as much any more so this is a good time to ... Penn State going into this game is is really the perfect timing if you're going to get him a yeah Fort caves in the west right now there's West is going to be fun to watch between north western Iowa Purdue\nA and all that and Wisconsin and you know of all one law says\nIt's going to be the race to the fish is going to go right down to the last weekend I think\n... any ... any added advantage to the fact that this this schedule for Penn State gets brutal after the hot guys they play at Michigan next week they've got Wisconsin coming up in a couple of weeks is this something fans talk about more than than you do in locker rooms is there any chance that they're that they're looking ahead at how difficult is scheduled turns over the next month\nYou know I think everybody's always looking at you know where how the ... starts out initiate and I'm sure I was the fans are like the schedule and they were like holy cow we start off with the top games but we can get through it\nA really open up and and we might be able to get on a role here and there are disturbed by those early games and\nAnd I I I the Iowa State are getting through with a lot of the you know a lot of women coming up here I've been shopping season but uh you know as far as baseball but are they Adam and I said\nOh you have the big ... the big on the west we don't even sort of the white there in the same atmosphere seemed like me that he just has a ... year a lot more depth and a lot more competition and uh you know it's going to be interesting to see\nWherever wherever when both are uh you know you stay on the west in the championship game and and I will say if I Do really enjoy watching the ... and a championship game every year it's a it's a really good game and and as usual out on\nStage Iowa State Texas Tech\nWar where do you think the cycle and ... they're they're red hot right now the by week I'm a weird kind of Texas Tech you know that system I mean do you think you know me ask you this is ... question this kids come to town\nTrue freshman the kings Barry leach system do you think that we'll see an Iowa State a more passive\nType of defence like we've seen have talked to in the past\nWhere do you think they'll turn up in Michigan says young men on Saturday morning\nYou know I think they what they've been doing it and and generally that a lot of times are rushing for a free man front and making changes beat them slowly methodically know down the field making their backs the acute occasional bring a fourth or fifth Rauscher but you know they they do a really good job of bend don't break rotten to the football crate and a couple of turnovers\nAnd Joe I I think going into West Virginia gave you wonder\nHow that would hold up a really really well obviously so I think that the you know the ... defense is for real\nI it it does a really good job of of you know frustrating teams that looks like there's some runs there and then everything just started get shut down to uh to yard last or uh yeah I think the past uh yeah the ... because of that unusual three now Russia can get\nA confusing to me as a quarterback defense like as if it was like an extra guy out there uh and yet they they just need to do what they do and and again\nWhat these high powered up and it talked about running the football really are you know another reason for private they try to run the football a little bit or even try to help you know keep their defense off the field about what about ...\nChuck I'd like to go back to something that a sage kind of touched on I wanted to get wrote this down because I wanted to get your opinion on this also\nSaid you mentioned at the end of that game he got a chance to see ... get out there really like some of the things that he did move into football with his legs we also saw oh Spencer ... the red shirt any akin holds that red shirt because this is just that first game that he played in did you see anything from those to that or did you like to comment on\nI you know I I really like a ... man down and I I like Peter's too I think he's still a ways away there they want to give them a little\nSnaps and that for game ... rule which is a smart thing to do but I ... I'm I'm with stage of life this man's though I watch them\nI went to early practice and in a camp and watched him come in and he just has some moxie\n... has the feel of bottom kids would grab a gravitating towards him to having a huddle I'm just just bought a lot of a leadership to that position immediately when when when you see him and\nI I like I think is the future is very bright with him and in some respects me he feels more like a quarterback than than Nathan Stanley I Know in a nation excellent quarterbacks don't get me wrong I'm\nThere's a difference between the grower in a pastor and they are more of a thrower\nHe's learning to be more of a pass or as he is going to pay ... more of a pass or I mean he's got a really good feel for the game\nAlready at a young age and that's a little bit of a difference because I think they stand we still do developing that feel as he goes now he he has a strong army talented as we know but\nThe field parties had to learn all along the way this man's they'll kid has a nice feel for the game\nThere's one other question that we had earlier in the show that we didn't quite address it came from our buddy Anthony and he wanted to know about that ranking talks move up the Eighteenth check how was that used inside of a locker\nWas using a recruiting more than anything so when you call those recruits you say look we're we are right now or Eighteenth or climbing or top twenty games you need to come with us we're you know the way to keep going in this deal so really they use it recorded more than anything for the players\nKnowing Kirk and his staff they're going to keep them grounded hey don't worry about the raking right now you know it's fun and all that stuff for the media for the fans but we still have a lot of work to do and I think they do a good job in Iowa as good as any place in the country keeping those kids grounded\n[noise] I I wanted to get your both your takes on this fellows will Greer the the quarterback for West Virginia was quoted saying this today on Ohio State losing at Purdue he was asked about it and he says\nThat anybody can lose anybody on any given Saturday\nNot including Alabama geez they're playing pretty well that's coming from a guy who you know we could go Heisman Trophy candidate um do ... do you believe that anybody can beat Alabama or do you think that they're looking at a Fifteen minute type year\nOh [laughter] I Do look I have a Fifteen and I'll tell ya I kinda did too yeah they always\nTalk over the uh I was actually talking with the SEC coach today on the phone this morning a buddy of mine he said they they have one of the best officers they've ever had in Alabama\nIs you know knows what he said they can live up off as a skill that every physician [noise] ah I I think they can go fishing though I Do\nJocks aged thanks so much menu as we love Monday's you guys brings such great insight greatly appreciated we'll talk to you next week\n[noise] ... thanks so we're on here on ... you know until about six thirty to our friends in Iowa City so long we'll talk to you guys next week thanks to Chuck in saying [noise]\nAn important message for Medicare [noise] between adoptable\nPicking the right medication for the rights [noise]\nWhen you listen to or conditions like high blood pressure diabetes\nBut he doesn't have the\nCrew services can help you get to connect to kill you need\nThe dots between your point of view [noise]\nYou've got to work with the camera\nAnd chicken with you David keeping your coping with your health\nYou can spend more time doing what you now have Medicare\nPlanning to get more information on Medicare search for chronic pain for by the U.S [noise]\nI mean every chance I see I always say these news in sports station available on your Google homes smart speaker just say okay Google Play eight hundred ... see heart radio\n[noise] talk for strengthening\nYour ... name is Josh for the first three games in the world series Clinton Kurdish I get the ball for Tuesday's game one in Boston game to hunt Jen reel you have to start watching the dealer against an eye for game three NFL train going down\nHey Rob jeep planners is on the phone pick up\n[laughter] you know who else should be salty [noise] wow that was a good Walt standards and called Chris Anders ... is on the phone numbers are I think too much about that did you plan or salty uh\nCome on I don't get it [laughter] I'm Sorry it was alright but\nDallas fan she'll be upset too because even if this works\nOut let's say a mark go there and does become a good number one receiver where you're going to get into the super bowl ... I don't care who they would have brought in they're not getting to the slippers also gave up a first round pick when you know you're not getting to the super bowl with is about\nBut you know the whole thing is\nPeople have these magical fantasies that if we get in Christian if they're going to happen we get in the playoffs anything can happen and and you know what I'm with you you're not winning us a Super Bowl glued to the super bowl or whatever you want to say\nBut that's what it is just like we got to make the playoffs we make the plug you never know something can happen book about our way it could be a you know what I mean like that's really what they saw that they're going to load up\nGive away a first round pick thing we'll worry about next year next year you know the ... only because they should be buried in the division and instead because everybody struggles in east they're still alive in the division and\nJerry Jones needs to hire a football man are they going to happen they ...\nThey run the cowboys like a mom and\nPop or end but how how long did you have to look at it before\nYou save this isn't working it's been what twenty Twenty years I lost his they won their last Super Bowl was in Ninety five Ninety five twenty three years of you run\nIn the show and you got nothing to shoot barely\nWins the show for it you were in Akron doing high schools back in\nNinety five yeah that was my first year only was it ... the Cavaliers wow but Ninety five when the super bowl took place in ... at that time January I was still cover and high schools he I Know it looking at the end the MLS\n[laughter] no I Know nothing about soccer I did I did my thing with it or not enough role some gyms that for the Cleveland Crunch [laughter] but they\nLive and all of a you know the cowboys I'm Sorry first of all you got Jason gear the most cautious play maker in the league\nAnd then you have another call this ... clearly at the end of the game instead of trying to score the field goal should have been the last resort right right usually go to score and win the game he went for a field goal and it came back to bite him\nSo I the cowboys are mess they're lucky they're in a horrible division and here's the thing you're better when that division are they going to have a wildcard team out of that division now I don't I don't think so\nI'm only the division winner probably the way the way that it's going so far less somebody catches fire yeah James catch fire you know what I mean and leave the other ... behind and I just I don't think winds are on a on a daily or mean on\nA giants are definitely are they going to lose the night you you got the giants win and then I uh I don't think so I think the giants lose I'm going to desperate one in right yeah and the falcons I think they're just a better team\nThan the giants just don't do the I don't know what they're ... not not not what it comes to the playoffs I'm not I'm Out on the focus on just like it was\nJust because they couldn't hold off braid yes that's a ... how about given me a little credit twenty right they guarantee eighth grade and a third or water Clearwater horrible ...

follow him on Twitter at Tony bus Sally Toni welcome to the odd couple\nWhat's going on God you're doing\nHey right away nobody looked ... let me just jump in by Sony just one day I got to say to you\nWhile higher Lucy what what happened to the defense down in Jacksonville what happened\nWell I mean I I mean listen they play barriers Dallas but let's not get carried away they held the ah the change to like the lowest point I'll put all year I got to remember that seven of those was a pig six by the\nWay they were they were five judge downs in by six touched\nDown by game got me a while it was all it all out pretty badly don't you think\nThey play bags Dallas for the last two weeks I mean they held the shah was hurting thirty five yards passing again the often turn it over him too short fields the score now here's the problem though this is why everyone feels this way and I get it\nIs because they ran their mouth so much to say now that the greatest events ever and they're not playing as the greatest events ever they're playing good defense\nBut they're not bad I mean there are no no no let's not overreact without are they playing dominant defensively best event ever know what the standard that last year no but they're not the problem often\nWhen I when I watched him Tony I look at a defense that I feel like it's just almost deflated\nBecause the officers use that keeps turning over given them a short field and you know you pretty much have to pitch just shut out almost to have a chance to win like I think the defenses deflated because office is a horrible\n... you know but the here's the problem they it was like this last year at the beginning of the year in the defense showed up in a big way I mean they just kept on turning people over and they kept on\nBecoming a big and they were score\nAnd so you know I I Would I get it I get that it's a little bit later but guess what no wonder you know why are you a deflated again Dallas when I went up and down the field they're terrible\nAnd so you can't I mean this is a defensive prides itself on being good and they have a lot of really good players so I just don't buy that I mean I mean if if you want to be the best I mean I played I remember in two thousand and when I put a we play the ravens and the best seasons I've seen\nTheir on their offices scored a touchdown for like five\nGames in rural and they want them all what's that mean that that's a great defense\nWhat's happened to Blake borders I watched him tear apart is the New England patriots yet for touchdowns three hundred Seventy seven yards blah blah blah blah blah and I thought wow I'm not expecting that every day but it was good\nTo see what's happened since then\n[noise] yeah it's it's a you know the problem with Blake is and and I love 'em and I hate to say that 'cause I actually really enjoy music or do you like them from Adam\nIs when it goes bad it just goes downhill so fast and his bad is really bad and he's in he's in a funk right now he's he's not confident I don't think he's seeing it real well the last few weeks and you can see his feet\nI think he's anticipating ... getting hit because he got hit quite a bit in the Kansas City game\nUm and he just does not look comfortable back there at all in Blake's a guy that you know if if you get the wrong game going\nAnd things and and he starts you know starts well during the game he's he has the ability to play football\nBut he's a shrinking choir and when it goes the wrong way it is bad and right now it's gone the wrong way and they're just not playing good but it's not just him I mean you turn on the tape it's not like guys are getting wide open out there so I 'cause a lot of winning going on\nAnd uh they'll be better the you know they traded for cause side that'll help a little bit from death running back and get him on the field so it's more than just Blake but you know and this leak it starts with a quarterback or he's not play a very good right now\nIt's the odd couple on Fox Sports radio Tony ...\nFormer all pro offensive lineman Westwood One sports in jaguar radio analyst and or is there any chance that they're going to Jacksonville ... look for different quarterback get teddy Bridgewater I don't know or they just so that they come hell or high water and they just going to go with Blake borders no matter what\nWell I mean I think you maybe make some phone calls with the hard part you know making a trade a quarterback position this time of year I mean you got a brand new guy in and learn a whole new system\nI mean you know it's not like ran a running back and I mean that's one thing or off into line man or you know a wide receiver me bring that quarterback and he's the he's the guy that makes you have to make all the calls and they were going to do that they should ... teddy Bridgewater and the options and they did not is not to do it they said they're gonna roll the dice with like\nI think that's kind of where you're up there at right now so they have a shot I may I mean you could make some phone calls yet you know I don't know I mean I'm a realistic that is\nA jailer Ramsey started this season off talking about everybody's been quiet when I'm writing [laughter] right and I think ...\nThe mass excesses against seemed like it they have this play falling off a little bit is he a little bit over rated did he give full of himself or or is he just playing as well as he always that\nWell he's not overrated and\nHe I mean you even go look at the tiring killed numbers I mean character to catch it was against the one who was a man well one of them was a de Paul diaries very good lawyer that's going to happen when you when you get on to when you go on an island by yourself\nAgainst the best receivers and that's what he does he travels with the best receiver when they play man and you look at the Johns Hopkins game I mean he I mean I watch the the coaches tape this morning\nAnd he was every play he was with John hopkins\nAnd really the ... beat him want now he made\nHe made that one great one had a cat but he pushed off like I mean unbelievable I mean I Can't believe that a capacitor fear it's often simply now he beat him on a great slant move by the goal line for the touchdown got to take your hat off of the great released by the under ... but the jail is not playing well it's just not accurate um but when but here's it's the same thing guys\nSame thing with the defense in general when you run your mouth and you tell everybody you're the greatest ever\nStandard in the bars higher\nAnd that is what Jay Lynn did he put he put everyone on blast and everyone wants to put them on blessed\nKitten able to cover ... or I mean I there's a long way to go into football season but I I just what they had last year was amazing I've I've they were all twenty to ten in the fourth quarter and Fox borough what a chance to go to the Superbowl this team doesn't look anything like that\nAt this point but it's still possible you figure that they can get right into specially 'cause whenever you have a defense you always have a chance to win can they can they get they get it back to where it was\nUm\n[noise] can they yeah I mean because they've got a lot of good players on defense so I mean the number one thing they got to turn around and turn turn around as a ... they're mine is twelve right now last year there plus ten\nArrest twenty two that's a big difference for some big turnaround right\nYeah I mean they've got to change that around if they can get to turn over if they stopped throwing the ball over and start getting some on defence the defence is good enough to make twice I mean there are quite makers every level\nAnd if they knew that that yeah they can get it going AFC South great the only one game back um you you you you stack them when the gathering you get some confidence back\nAnd I think if the defense I mean here's this why everyone gets on me and towns like why are you put it on the defense I might because that's where all the best players and she put it on your best players and so I put it on the defense for them to take the game up to another level and if they do that you give the office the margin of error and you get them some confidence but I think it has to start with even though the ball", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Steve
