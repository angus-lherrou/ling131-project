that may be released these Thursday night betting odds early\nBecause they know they can get action from people that are that are looking at it saying well regardless of how maybe Sunday's game finishes up I Know that this team is at a disadvantage Thursday night let me go in and get some action on it regard because it seems like it's such a disadvantage that we know that every single week going in regardless of the outcome of games\nSo in general here in Vegas every game is available all week early so right now we're entering week five you can bet week six right now now you're going to bet that without the knowledge of how the teams play if there was a in the game coming up and just a couple of days\nOr if there were any injuries did it go to overtime all the uncertainties both sides the bulky and better have to deal with\nUsually the limits are smaller and then as the uncertainty decreases that's when the bookies are more comfortable raising the limit\nGuys one of the other big events outside of all the football games will be getting into a ton of football games coming up tomorrow is UFC two twenty nine ... made off the champion at lightweight against Conor McGregor it could be currently sitting in at about a one sixty favored in this fight\nAnd one of the things that as a de ... the Russian by the way ... one of the things the fasting does like draw going on

every Tuesday we have our special best by early and last\nWeek the line move drastically will see this week this is one I'm going to predict aligned move I Know a number of serious UFC\nHandicappers batters they say they would not be surprised if McGregor isn't the favorite come fight time this baby opened up with the Russian can be minus one Ninety she almost had about two dollars to win a dollar it's down to one sixty\nBut despite weekend coming up and when everyone's on the ground here in Vegas the biggest you after the event of the year there's probably going to be a ton of McGregor action I don't know if it gets them McGregor favor I'd be very surprised\nIf the line doesn't get worse for McGregor so here's some clear advice if your button this fight if you like the Russian\nWait you might be able to get costs money but most likely you're gonna be able to get a better price if you like McGregor that it now I doubt\nYou're going to get a better number at are you guys feeding on

we don't have many gas on straight out of Vegas but Greg is one we have every Thursday and we're lucky to have him NFL analysts and senior producer for NFL Films for thirty nine years Greg how you\nHello Greg RJ I'm doing good excellent excellent great to have you on first question tonight's game coats off over time\nYou've been around the game so long you've got to incite we don't know what what are the negatives what are what's so hard about coming back\nFrom an overtime game there's a lot of history that says often over time it's tougher on that team we get the idea of hey they played longer and it makes sense they might be a little more tired can you give us some insight\n[noise] well I think or J. that you're you're dealing with the physical part because I think what teams likely do when they come when they have to play three days later four days later\nIs they stick with they're foundational principles and tactics on both sides of the ball um they can game playing quite as well as they might in a normal week\nSo other than the physical part which I think every team faces and maybe running a few extra plays I don't know if that necessarily makes it worse but I think in terms of the tactics of the game\nYou probably don't see as much because they don't have as much time\nAnd that's interesting so there's the physical side now last week you mentioned and I thought it was super insightful that the rams do they seem to be well coached by all accounts they have a very simple offense where short rest wouldn't have meant so much for them is\nThat I did so poorly in that Thursday night game too\nIs the opposite is true though that have very complex team a team that has a lot of variations we do we like a ballot jak is at a disadvantage on the short week [noise]\nUm now you get down to coaching and don't forget ... ballot check that's something that's ingrained right from the start\nSo this is not something we're all of a sudden he will say hey guys this week we're going to do something totally different that's built into their entire approach through an off season through training camp um\nIt'll be interesting tonight because obviously he gets Julian Edelman back [noise] he has Josh Gordon with another week but last week was very interesting now they did not have Julian Edelman but he did something last week that he rarely does and that is he gave the ball to one running back twenty five times\nAnd not only did it give it to a back twenty five times RJ but he had to fall back on the field for Nineteen of those wrong by Sony Michel and that's very very rare in today's NFL now knowing bill double check\nThat may not happen again for a month but that's what he chose to do on Sunday without on Edelman back Gordon another week or practice for all we know tonight he could go empty sets and throw it all over the field\nWe're joined by Greg ... decorative producer and analysts for NFL Matchup on ESPN or straight out of Vegas that shifted the ravens\nYou hear a lot of talk gray that defense is that such a big disadvantage a ruse wise other reason quarterbacks are just so much more prepared a deal for was on to her talking about all the rap and I thought that ... that was a compelling point I thought\nIs if you look at the ravens they've had a quarters in the second half the game for games a quarters in the second half they've given up nine points\nThat I mean what are they doing well they've also played buffalo [noise]\nAh no I mean you have to look at the schedule this early in the season because the sample size it's a quarter of the season so you do have to look at the schedule RJ at this point you know another four or five weeks and then we have a different conversation\nBut they they are very good defense they get a Smith the or the corner back as well this week I'm so it'll be interesting to see what they do but there are good defense they're good at all three levels they've got to really good safeties\nAnd Tony Jefferson and Eric widow and safety is often a position or J. that's overlooked when people talk about really good defense of play but I think in this era of more spread football with three wide receivers on the field safety's have become so critically important to defenses and they have two of them\nAnd and they're very good but the one thing I Would I Would add about Baltimore and this turns to the other side of the ball is I think over the last two weeks that Joe Flaco was throwing the ball as well as he has in maybe two three years if not longer he has really throwing the ball exceptionally well\nAnd with a new receiving corps and with all the dimensions you could want in receiving corps the vertical dimension with John Brown the intermediate\nWe'd Crabtree the the slot receiver and release need\nA multitude of tight and they really have every dimension offensively and the passing game\nSo it sounds like you're a little skeptical and I love talk of sample size because the average man tend to overreact to short small sample size\nIf I said oh we'll raven look this good defensively across the whole season not that they won't have a bad game or two but he added all up you think that the ravens it sounds like you think are playing a little bit above their heads right now in defense\nWell I I wouldn't say it's above their heads I think it's the nature of the opponent um [noise]\nBut I don't give a world\nNow in the NFL because there's so many pastors thrown quarterbacks dropped back so much I mean we have games relatively routinely were quarterback struck back forty five or more times\nSo you already numbers gets skewed you know ten Fifteen Years ago if a team gave up three hundred yards passing we would view that as they had a really bad day defensively [noise]\nNow a team could give up three hundred and fifty yards passing but if the quarterback drops back fifty five times that may not necessarily be a bad defensive day so you know I think we sort of have to recalibrate a little bit\nBut I think that the ravens do have a good defense and again they can rush the quarterback they've got really a CJ mostly when healthy as a very very good line backer\nAnd they've got a really good secondary so they have the pieces to play well throughout the season\nYeah last question for Greco cell you can follow him on Twitter at great coast Salah Steelers I'm a fan but I remain objective I'm going to keep this one simple what is wrong\nWith the Steelers whether this deal is well\nI think their defense has been very problematic and we're not used to seeing that there are predominant is zone defensive team and there have been way too many voids in their zones now every zone has voids otherwise everybody would play the exact same zone but their voice are have become too big\nThey're not playing with the assignment discipline needed to plays own coverage effectively\nAnd I think our fence hopefully they're struggling a little bit and\nYou know it's it's easy to say they misled the on bell because he's a good player\nOr just saline that's on ESPN tonight and I'll listen Fox Sports radio it's a family I mean there may be some\nYou know sometimes brothers and sisters fight but still family well we got clay Travis every week given straight out of Vegas an exclusive it's nowhere out as the pick of the week let's listen in\nOrder to make you guys lots of money slaves rabbits is\nAt the the pick of the week [noise]\nMy at the the lock of the week\nOr ... years ago offered in Mississippi State played at historic three to to finish\nOff ... [noise] the under is going to hit maybe not as well as three to two but the under forty two is the play offs like it in my FCC guarantee\nThe under\nOn Auburn at Mississippi State [noise]\n... not a lot of analysis on that [laughter] there was a game a while back to like go under\nWhat do you think though right if you listen to our podcast we do each week my favorite total play of the week was Mississippi State Auburn on during the total or are you implying that clay stole your ... now I had a much better now than a much better numbers [laughter]\nOr you wait a minute I can cut on the other guys you can\nSay you're sorry sorry clay arrogant I I like to play I bet it also ... who I listen\nIf you have clay a pig in it and ... baton it probably in pretty good\nShape by the way that's two straight under for clay Travis a and his pick of the week yet South Carolina in Kentucky and the under last week very negative approached SEC football I think maybe cousin's house given them to show a sharp opinions are guys that you mentioned uh the guy with all the college knowledge Brad power\nBrad offers up a gift every single week\nIt is for team or sometimes five team parlay\nThat this is an interesting concept because if you say is Larry Bird gonna make a free throw in his prime you're like of course\nHe was Ninety percent free throw shooter but Larry Bird making seven straight free throws was below fifty percent just get your calculator go point nine times point nine Pence point not you'll see it go down\nSo people tend to do is they say that you can't lose and just play him on the money line they just need to win that team can't lose well one of them tend to lose well Brad we have your how could this partly lose wink wink that's irony pick of the week but\nYou're too and it hasn't lost you got five teams in this baby give me the five ten\nYeah again this is ... and you need these teams just to win the game Clemens in Michigan Boise State Iowa and Wisconsin\nOkay those by teams have you been a hundred for all of them to when you when one o seven so you're winning more than you bet this is better than the regular spread but in that regard one more time Clemson is\nWake Forest twenty points favorite favorite twenty Michigan I Seventeen and a half point favorite over Maryland Boise a fourteen point favorite or at home or San Diego state Iowa seven point favorite over minutes\nOh I I went out and that's the one you went down Fifteen an hour last Fifteen times have been in a road favorites and lastly Fifteen Wisconsin Seventeen point favorite over at a photograph now where say wink wink when we say how could lose but all that said he is two and a broad powers follow him on Twitter at ...\nPowers that's within that seven ... seven but we talked about in the first segment of the hour and boy it goes by fast we talked about the Thursday night game I think the real takeaway here is\nThe trend of aid overtime team playing on the road on Thursday that's what the culture and true in Eighteen to an Eighteen against\nThe spread that tough tough tough but the lines going up from seven and a half up to a lab and so it's too expensive for me to back the patch right now you agree I agree wish I could get into a time machine and go back well we can [laughter] I'd guys we're going to be back tomorrow\nGuys tomorrow six pm eastern time three o'clock Pacific it

and\nI'm not saying the patriots or world leaders but I\nAm saying is they are still going to be a force to be ... have you watched it and then I have some other than the last year and this year and it's I mean they they ran but they don't break I mean they break a little bit beyond and I was gonna say they give up\nEach that that's what they do I mean you know but they're they're they're going
