[noise] um [noise] uh I'll be honest with you I don't [noise] uh I don't know about the emotional distress thing I don't know how close the Ottoman came to hitting it's a little kid and if the kids really feeling emotional stress but\nFeels like a weird still feels like a weird story I I Do like part of me wants to process that I've I've got eighty thousand dollars with the stuff stolen I'd be ticks to I'd be punching through things in front of a thing and the other hand I don't think I have eighty thousand dollars worth of stuff to seal and I don't think I Would ever\nGo incredible hulk and throw up on 'em and out a window [noise] so [noise] yeah I'm a little bit lost and store it sounded the alarm [noise]\nElsewhere in the NFL inhaler news the Jacksonville Jaguars about all sorts of problems keeping their running backs healthy Leonard for net out and definitely DJ yell been battling an ethical problem Corey granted number three running back to put on injured reserve just placed I just signed rather\nFormer for time ... money back to them all Charles what a great run over nine seasons of Kansas City but [noise]\nLimited usage and not use that all much last year when he played for the Denver Broncos so he's or next option a running back and Jacksonville [noise]\nAre you still there [noise] um look I'd like to see Jamal Charles be back and be fresh and be anywhere near what he was in Kansas City and you can go by yards for Kerry but he didn't have it in Denver that's why you didn't stick ... let's see let's see what time off and how much he rehab and how ready is yeah [noise]\nSpeaking of running back NFL media reports that Adrian Peterson of Washington\nWas diagnosed with a strained shoulder he'll get a second opinion but in any event it is not expected to keep him from playing and initially appeared that he had just dislocated a shoulder in fact that's what Peterson\nThought happened at the blowout loss of the saints he said I just popped it back into the race it up and ask time so it looks like he's not going to miss any further time so he really cool so he's rigs basically from lethal weapon I Would actually go ahead [noise]\nI made my [noise] dad finally\nIn baseball do or die game tonight for the Yankees and they're gonna get Aaron Hicks back into the lineup so if he does well it hits went out sterling can fellow fix I wanted to the sticks or their seasons on the line so we as back in the lineup tonight for the Yankees after miss him to the hamstring injury\nMr cycle Brock hold however will not be in the lined up for the Boston Red Sox\nYeah that's because I mean part of the home run was off of a position players that thing got out of hand last night [noise]\nI Do wonder how many people were actually watching that late in the night with football also on at the same time [noise] I think the Yankees make this thing to a game five Red Sox Yankees has to go to the ... the distance I Believe that was actually the eleventh amendments [noise]\nThat was going to [noise] yes crime is\nSo we had on ... uh like twenty minutes ago yep he said that it was in high school he kicked the Seventy three yard field goal Seventy one Seventy one yard field goal\nWhat was your most impressive athletic achievement that people may not have never seen or heard of but you are just like that's the best I've ever done\nOkay I had so uh our our rival high school when ... says his Woodbridge high school in Irvine and my high school or was forty four points is still school record the next time we played them I had thirty two but I Eighteen at the end of the first quarter I was way better why\n... I didn't play that well when I had forty four I missed like for free throws like I had thirty two but it was a clean thirty two and I Eighteen and like five assist in the first quarter and I just made everything through\nAnd that was the best of our place I also in a playoff game once I'd really like the court pass to a teammate and it hit often other players wrist and bounce step one in the basket and ... because he hit his wrist outside of three point line\nIt was three point shot that go there you go back tomorrow and the dog ... Fox Sports radio\n[noise]\nHey they're diehard years in football ... you might not even\nThe first football game was played in Eighteen sixteen on an average gained the ball is typically and play\nFor

and the girls are worried and the women are worried about you know we all got our war\nIs is you get older and\nDo you stay in a marriage it's fifty percent good because there's fifty percent good there or do you say hey there's a clock ticking I don't have much time left I might as well live a full life\nBut what the risk the risk is you might be alone the rest of your life so right now what we know about Jerry Jones\nIs he likes it his way does anyone doubt how good of a coach Jimmy Johnson was after two Super Bowls\nBut hey he didn't like Jerry Jones is way gone\nThen another coach comes in when the super bowl ad that's not working out either then you get some might say up until recently the best coach of our time I mean ten years ago a lot of people thought Bill Parcells was the best NFL coach ever by most accounts taught five\nI Would say and he wasn't good enough gone but then the guy you know let's give Garrett some credit he obviously play Cajun pleases Jerry Jones\nBut is is is Garrett going to give you a Super Bowl and to me\n... all evidence points against it and that is if you ... if I said let's make a bet will the cowboys win a Super Bowl and the next five years and we put odds on it\nAnd in scenario a you know Jason Garrett's gonna stay the coach for the five and scenario be a Lincoln Riley is going to be the coach for the five how much more optimistic argue about the cowboys winning a Super Bowl with Lincoln ... three times more likely three times wow\nSo that's off the cuff that's a thought but really what we're going to see from Jerry Jones is how much does he want comfort as he feels that clock ticking and how much does he won the super bowl since we're talking about\nThe future of job Jason Garrett here on straight out of Vegas I Do have a question for you guys from a fan's perspective\nWe never take into account coaches when we make bets we just don't do it it's not how we work it's not how our minds you didn't figure for the square I'm speaking for the squares for the fans for the people that don't make professional money don't make the good money like you guys do but what do you guys being professional\nHow often do you look at coaching when you determine whether or not you're going to make a bet\nI think it matters if you're talking about optimism about a team over the long run or a given game if it's a given game I think it's very rarely you're thinking about the ... you might be thinking about this scheme\nBut you're not thinking about the coach and the reason being is built into how good the team is whatever affect the coach is going to have what would the patriots record be without budget I don't know I Know how good they are with ballot check\nBut if we're saying hey so and so just high team match just hired coach why now that coach is going to be something different about that team and that change is something that a really good coach can cause a lot of optimism fast you agree with that\nI Do agree the one exception RJ might be when I'm looking at a ... type of situation coaches like Garrett excel at losing those clothes [laughter]\nSo that's an interesting question are you oh you actually are you actually thinking about that whereas so let's say there's a team it's a\nAn underdog that's plus four so it's a four point underdog and the coaches coaches you don't like is that something where you're going to be more inclined to take the four whereas if it's a coach you really do like maybe you jump on the line with the better pay off yes\nBecause the coach I like will be aggressive and will play to win the game taking risks\nOkay but you're explaining why you like that coach but you but let me ask you one more time and see if your answer my question is will you specifically bet money line more on a four point underdog or so and I'm using for\nAs an example of hey it's a close game but you could see them cover and lose a lot of games but still cover\nI lose it by one two three okay you still cover\nBut if you have a superior coach you're going to take the action is going to be to take the money a lot more often\nVery much so because he might go forth forth an aid from his own twenty two down five are now I tried to win the game no no I understand why you're doing it I just wanted that question answered and now after to\nTry to stay like he had the day off yesterday as well we come back we're going to have Brad powers fantastic and Ken Thompson critique the rest of the world\nThe he's RJ bell I'm Jonah snacks is is the free game show you always wanted right here

Brad powers against the Associated Press again Brad what are your thoughts on the Aggies\nYeah I think Texas a and M. is under rain and currently I have the Aggies number four team in my power writings and it's all about who the Yankees have played there only two losses the season against arguably the top two teams in the country I mean obviously a little cameo with Clinton but Alabama that was uh I'm actually a decent last for the ...\nAnd what happened last week protector saying now\nThey face in ... in Kentucky team\nAnd I'm gets the winning the cover and the final scoreboard was a little bit misleading they dominated and I'm being Kentucky team last weekend\nAnd I saw over Twitter upset ops that ain't M. B. rank Kentucky but they were a what six point favors exploit favorite Adam okay so broad powers a pro who knows says Texas a and M. underrated at number twenty to ten times in a great disagree\nDisagree here's the thing was am yes they're very good at home they play climbs into that to point game at home played very well took out Kentucky at home got whipped in Alabama they have three straight road games coming up at South Carolina at Mississippi State at Auburn they'll lose two of those three games\nOoh with it you know Ken's back Thursday might have to do a little cross fire\nThis game against South Carolina in just a minute me and pride or doing across fire it's probably the biggest disagreement we've had on this show and it's about Notre Dame football all of that next but\nFor all the latest from around the world of sports let's hear from I said well on friday afternoon showed us that I had an eight oh seven eastern game for the American league division series with the red Sox leading the Yankees two games to one\nMr cycle rock hope not in the red Sox starting lineup for game for but\nAaron Hicks is back in the Yankees lined up after missing last two games with a hamstring injury NFL the Jacksonville Jaguars today signed veteran free agent running back to the mall Charles do a one year deal Charles made for ... and nine seasons of Kansas City

tomorrow against the defending world champion Golden State warriors balls coming off the off season knee surgery he last appeared in a game that on march twenty eighth of a last season fellows that deal\nThanks Isaac straight out of Vegas comes to you live here from the guy go Fox Sports radio studios where it's easy to say Fifteen Percent or more on car insurance with guy go go to guy go to our comical eight hundred nine four seven out of the only hard part figuring out which way is easier coming up Fifteen minutes from now\nIt is a special edition of best bet to expert picks from our guys here on straight out of Vegas that Fifteen minutes from now here on Fox Sports radio I Am Jonah stocks the voice of the fan and he is the voice of Las Vegas RJ bell\nYeah it's not only to expert picks on this on a from two different pros they liked the same game playing tonight so if you're playing tonight's college football game hold on for that one I read I respect your expertise\nBut when I disagree I'm not afraid to press the green button which the green button it's green has a dollar sign on it and it makes the following sound\n[noise]\nAny time a pro around the wise guy round table here on straight out of Vegas says something they like a game or something strong you better be ready to bet on it\nWe were talking after the show and I have to get like an overtime or something and have these talks after the show yesterday and we debated the following point I Want the listeners to put the price in their mind what would the odds be in the following scenario\nIf Notre Dame loses exactly one game the rest of the year so they would finish the season with one last\nWhat are the odds of making the playoffs if they win out they're going to make the playoffs if they lose to they're not going to make the playoffs what are the odds are going to make the playoffs\nAnd Brad you said\nFifteen Percent at best Fifteen Percent at best so we negotiated a little bit and I think it's only fair that you offer me I think it's absurd really low I think you follow the green\nThat could be money who it could be the Irish but follow the green because whenever\nCollege football has a chance to give Notre Dame the benefit of the doubt they do because it means more green and that might not quite be the case it used to be a long long time ago but it certainly is the case so what kind of odd will you would you give me an art standard that here's a hundred bucks\nThat if there's one loss exactly for Notre Dame that they make the playoffs\nFour to one for the one that won hunter you'll give me four hundred absolutely [noise]\nOh so the producers in LA or with our jak [noise] now they're just common sense that\nTweet me at our to in Vegas if you agree with me if you agree with Brad I don't know whether or not [laughter]\nReal quick\nI Love this one so we don't do this often\nI if you are not afraid to enlist in fear is healthy sometimes if you're in a bad spot if you're not afraid\nI'd like to up this I liked it risks five hundred to in two thousand nine\n[laughter] [noise] All right so a guy you\nOf the pay off either way [laughter] now I'll tweet it if I win and Brad on his little Twitter by the way I read powers seven POWs ER as [noise]\nYou know some people following and if you think Brad is feeling you agree with him follow him so he can feel better about his\nCount but [laughter] right on following your [laughter]\nAnd tosses that get fat you fall absolutely yeah but you don't really look at his tweets did only when you tell me too [laughter]\nSo fast you are I mean some would say the you know again I think it's clearly the best NFL better in the world but in my opinion would you strive even more is in game batting ESPN a couple of years ago sent a film crew out\nThe film you on game day like a fool must show Neal was there\nThough the whole crew watching you on the endgame banning with all the TVs your abs and you're you were like Mozart plain simple [laughter]\nSo fast it was I mean unbelievable but why you're so good at that the ... dexterity it's because you actually\nCan instantly come up with a price on things better than anyone I've ever met\nSo one last for Notre Dame do they make the playoffs or not what's your price one third chance plus two hundred so the fact that I'm plus four hundred yum yum I embarrassed to say I'd like a piece of that to a rabbit [laughter]\nHow much you want the same as our day you will find that I bought her eyes [laughter]\nJoe this way we'll do this what do you think I mean if if Notre Dame has one lives do they get in [noise]\nI ... if it's close tie goes to Notre Dame I agree I agree yes you have to ... and and that's got to be taken into account the playoff committee knows that and it it it's it's about business as much as it is about qualified\nGuys out before we get the best bet you do all that you know we are brought to you by Geico were Fifteen minutes could say be Fifteen Percent or more on car insurance so we have a a major league baseball playoff faction LDS game for coming up later on it's the red Sox at the Yankees the Yankees\nCurrently a minus one fifty favorite tonight down two games to one in the series\nAnd you've got to wonder about the psychology I mean for a long time it was the curse of the ban but you know but at this point can I I don't remember when the Yankees won the world series after the red Sox won their first did they go through the red Sox I don't think they did\nSo really when have when's the last time the Yankees beat the red Sox and the playoff series and we know the red Sox have a ton of confidence as an organization\nSo in general I'm a dog first guy underdog or pass and baseball and I think you add in the fact that the Yankees you know there's two ways to have a must win game\nThe first way is hey did you focus motivated the other way you get tight and in New York City\nIf you got a must win game often times you get tight so I Do have a lean towards the Sox tonight\nGuys have it a little college football on a Tuesday night Appalachian State is eight ten and a half point favorite at Arkansas state\nRemember guys are promised at best but every day at the end of the show six or seven eastern and any big games that night we cover I'm Brad powers all the college knowledge will you know like in this\nGame I like the home dog Arkansas state plus the ten and a half and to me it's all about Arkansas state in this respect and honor dog role here Arkansas state spend the pre eminent power in the last six years so whenever I like playing on them when our dog doesn't very ... doesn't happen very often six times in fact\nIn conference by last six years they've been a dock six now against the spread five out right upsets wow Arkansas state\nThat's a good staff and Brad powers Ken Thompson agree this is a rare double like on this game\nNo doubt and I think a lot of people look at Appalachian states opener against Penn State to come back and forth core take the lead get into overtime eventually lose but Jonesboro, Arkansas has a very tough place to get a when you're going to give double digits to this team to red wolves will find a way to maybe when it straight up\nGuys we have to early best bad looking ahead first up Steve ...\nSo Steve it's a tradition now right you win one you win another then we got his streak I think it was once said\nYou on Tuesday we'll give an NFL game that meets two criteria one you're batting it and you're like it number to your bat in his early 'cause you think the lines going to your to do they call that perfect but\nYou were wrong about the line move last time you had Seattle's the line I actually went up I think there were love for the rams is even bigger than you thought you were to go on the picks and long term Seventy percent on your line moves give us your pick this way\nAnd take the Tennessee Titans plus three hosting Baltimore RJ this one's easy all about the line value let's think about this one week ago\nBaltimore was playing Cleveland at Cleveland and they were laying three now they're linked to be at Tennessee Titans I have read at a significantly better team than the browns and it wasn't like Baltimore played well they lost a Cleveland last week I Can't understand\nHow it can be getting three what the titans I like it I bet it okay this is an example obviously a re evaluation after the buffalo loss and I think somewhat justified\nBut I agree plus three All right Ken bonus best bet you've got thirty seconds this was an early college football ...\nYeah we're going to go with LSU for South Georgia played no top twenty teams all she's played three of those teams become also talked last against the Florida team in the swamp that can pressure the quarterback Georgia does not pressured the opposing quarterback rural have time to run and gave them a work and that was you will get out there from LSU wins this game by ... straight up by at least to touch them\nBest bet Ken Thompson LSU that's early look at early look ahead in the NFL from ... Tennessee Titans he suspects aligned to move that it early tonight a double like in Arkansas state and I've got to lean just to lean on the baseball game on the red Sox plus money\nThe odd couple is next year on Fox Sports radio we are straight out of Vegas we are back tomorrow same time six pm eastern time three o'clock Pacific straight out of Vegas right here on Fox Sports\nRadio [noise]\n[noise] [noise]\nCaught a sandwich for lunch huh [noise] ah yeah but that town [noise]\nWhile is that I'm sending rain or nine ... ah\nI'm honestly not sure [noise]\nI guess it's possible that once ISIS seven grain and the other side says nine grains\nSeems unlikely but could be [noise]\nI mean maybe they're both twelve grain counting\nLunch breaks are boring it make them exciting with movies to the music from AT and T the new age into your limited and more premium plan and gives you over thirty channels of live t._v. and\nEntertainment Boehner's like HBO or bend or a premium and unlimited wireless service at the times you need them most aging injury more for your thing that's our thing after\nTwenty to get bicycling or Monday the team is loaded it between the network is busy but he may be limited definition towards one ad on service content subject to change restrictions applying to get what they think the dot com slash unlimited\nBy heart radio goes one on one with John Bon Jovi to discuss his views on the importance of environmental awareness anytime I think that any of us can do something to\nMake the world a little bit better than we left that one shouldn't ...\nWe're all being educated together as to what will happen if we don't stand up and have an effect\nOn the way that the world is going to the environment especially if it's something that crosses all party lines\nAnd it's something that is the problem that we can all make it easy change I mean as simple as turning off a light switch when you leave the room you don't have to go out and buy hybrids if you're not ready to buy a car\nFor this simple is turning off the light switch in your room recycling your garbage little silly things like that that sounds so menial add up and make a huge difference\nKeep listening to our heart radio for more Bon Jovi add all your favorite artists\n\nElite Hepburn ... see I always say these news and sports station available and your Amazon smart speaker just say Alexa play eight hundred tea excise the heart radio\n[noise] Fox Sports trendy and\nOf a lot of great baseball players who didn't win anything Ted Williams is considered one of the greatest hitters of all time was it a plus one time in his right right you see what I'm saying so yeah nobody base was different so you're right about that but this\nThe other thing too when I when I think about this\nI think Drew Brees is\nKind of like LeBron James and I'll tell\nYou what I mean but in terms of not winning\nI I just out of having stats that people point to to consider him the greatest like his status stats are all through the roof right that's all the broad as unbelievable set to go to ... to a bar you're going to do all that\nBut when you get to you to take it too far no I'm just going to go and I'm Lynn explain when he Erdogan when you\nAdd up everything because it's not just that and that's that's my point LeBron James has lost\nA an the NBA Finals is it what is it six times now\nThree three and six\nSix times and he's the author ... as I said he's he's lost more MBA files than any other former MVP\nEver and that's not the same not a great player would have always said he was a great player Chris just not the greatest and the same thing goes but when you talk about Drew Brees despite the numbers you can't make an argument that he's the greatest of all ... you can't\nIt's not just about numbers ... Braun has been has numbers he has all the numbers but still winning in this case supersedes just piling up numbers\nWhere I Would disagree with you is that air several places number one LeBron have won three championships\nYou know so one in ten years in a Cleveland so eleven actually but thanks one of the ...\nSorry he's got but he's won three championships whereas bruise at a breeze has one Super Bowl secondly remember when I say it was it's not just championships I didn't say it was just no I Know but I'm I say a breeze has only had a winning record half fifty percent of the time LeBron\nJames every year for\nHis team is in contention now they don't wait a minute\nBut every single year he's in the hunt he's in contentious oh that's where I I also would disagree with you all are are finally I Would say of course I don't think I don't know anyone\nThat would say Drew Brees is the greatest quarterback of all time and I wouldn't say as you were you and I agree with Brian is not the greatest player of all the time but I think you and I also agree he's the second greatest yeah but the episode breeze I don't I'm saying breathe and even in the top five\nYeah but the differences in my only point is\nThat people look at at and try to use LeBron James is that period to talk about his greatness and I'm telling you in the case of Drew Brees stats are just all you can look at is you got to look at her and that's why I'm saying look Ron Drew Brees as the NFL's LeBron James\nHe ... you got to admit that the low for cars look there's one up new praises none lead championships what it was true free\nWorld and that generator oval one thousand right plural\nHe'd only been there once LeBron is one of my main point was not there breathe only has one Super Bowl it was that half of his career his teams aren't even a factor you can't say that about LeBron James and things are factor every single year\nIn the eastern conference yes and the other part butter that I mean that's that's the only been in a league team must be on out his career the last two years NBA Finals\nHave been a non competitive la bronze team has been not they've they've lost eight out of nine and they use\nThe the one game they won they shot like Seventy percent from the field if you remember that remember when they knock down all over the ... the only game that they won\nAnd they haven't been able to win at all or or be competitive even this past year I Can't remember the players said it somebody said from the wars hopefully the finals will be competitive this year they're even like bored I we got to look that up Rob gee\nHow players said it's not even competitive I wanted to say hello Brian is like Peyton Manning\nI could give you a little more on that 'cause manning\nOnly won two Super Bowls and the one you know he wasn't really a huge factor the defense\nDenver was so strong he wasn't at its best he was at the end of his career but\nYear his team was a factor I get every year there in the playoffs every year they got a chance to win the super bowl that's the same with LeBron I Would look at breeze more like a maybe a Russell Westbrook\nYou know not Russell never had one the only he's number one was my three days it's not whether you've got these huge numbers here but he's not on wherever the average a triple double in two seasons ever I got all that he\nDoesn't he doesn't but his teams are always a factor but given the championship breathe got the one title you're just as great as it has to have an array of\nSeparates you all I'm saying is for people who just constantly look at the bronze numbers I'm just talking about numbers on the uh aren't aren't thing that can only determine whether you're the greatest\nYeah because that's what I'm saying this about when and that and not enough to find another guy who did not unlike liberal on the blood compare to way\nBut you you yourself think liberalism second best player of all time right yeah I Do so and so we're saying he's better than Kareem better than magic better than bird ask or will all these guys Kobe and Shaq\nOnly Michael Jordan is better Drew Brees we're saying as great as he is first ballot hall of famer yes yes indeed\nBut he's not on that whole submit upper echelon of quarterback but I'm telling you that on\nThe upper echelon of players yet I understand that totally but I'm Talking about the people not the people who rightly put them in the top five second or third those aren't the people I'm Talking about\nI'm Talking about the people who use his that as the
