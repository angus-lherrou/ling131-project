out on Halloween\nOkay parental guidance or at least are going out with an adult very crucial especially the younger the kids are\nYeah definitely so we always want kids out with at least a parent or semi adult you know if you have a neighbor that taken a group of kids out that better than against somebody gets going by themselves and that same thing goes for kids on Halloween\nJust like any other
