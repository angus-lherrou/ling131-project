the community is going to be very proud of\nIn for a new business opportunities coming through our doors or maybe it's new students coming to the University of Iowa I'm uh they're definitely going to\nFeel very proud and and surprised I think by the the look and feel of the facility I think it's gonna shock a lot of people\nIt's always a good thing to be fiscally responsible and that that is or
