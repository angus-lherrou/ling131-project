[noise]\nYeah and let me let me that they're trying to take shots and is there but there is at trying to cover himself let me explain what happened in uh Ninety percent assigned apparently it's either a runner ...\nAnd I did not just wanting a pleasure pass and yet he tried to say there it is I'm not sure if he knew what he initially said if he blacked out during the beginning of that call 'em but it wasn't anything anything that he called and they followed it up the next play with another song would call a solid performance\n[noise]\nFor adults\nMore yeah and it's the same with ... well uh we okay so here's a little behind the scenes of what happened to your we've just gotten to where the Tony romas called in and he is not ... not allowing us to play that second clip\nAnd and I think that is just ridiculous Tony is a CBS I think I I don't know um but nonetheless yeah he I've noticed is as well to Jason a witness starting to do that on Monday and I thought oh are you hearing me starting to call plays he's starting to just start in ...\nAnd and the worst prop part is is unless you know and you're going to be a hundred percent\nDon't do it if you want to sit there and tell us where the

that's that's impressive in itself but\nA lot of times these guys just throw stuff out there and then do a kind of act like that's what they said no no no people are actually listening out there but nonetheless he here's a here's a thing of the game I thought he did do a good job of talking about the clock management it was as poor as it gets and I don't think we have time for it now 'cause you have to take a break but when we come back briefly\nI Want to throw it idea to you because I think maybe Dallas could have handled the end of the game a little bit different and maybe they would have had more time\nBe still my heart was that a radio tease from ... in which the I just don't you don't shoot down the side you know I Will not you down this idea that is the most shocked I've been since

hundred nine four seven out of the only hard part figuring out which way is easier so so Sunday Night Football is under way we've got the bangles at the chiefs\nI haven't the sheep's getting to Sunday night games in a row talking about talking about calling their shop at NBC called their shop before the year he they didn't know they were going to be this good\nI think anyone who and they did a practice tape of Patrick Rome's anyone who saw him during the course of\nA ... minute camp training camp\nThat people kind of knew what was coming I I had a chance to talk with Peter ... a horse read it felt network does some stuff for Fox as well on the sidelines um and it was on good morning football he had the opportunity to go spend some time out there this past summer and wasn't when I saw last week I just say hey man\nYou call it right out of the gate I said you were the one that that basically was standing on your soapbox screaming for passion for home saying this kid's going to be an MVP Kennedy and his first year starting and he's he's been just that and I think the more impressive thing is is he hasn't slowed down\nHe is he's had some a little bit of ups and downs for him but he constantly finds ways to move the football and produce and and give it to him a chance\nYou know who I Know I didn't see tape on patrimony Holmes who's got Ryan pays\n'em [laughter] so let me\n[laughter] so let's go back to that for who they take instead what was the uh the guy's name\nUm oh is it a lot with the hell's that guy's name a gross ... as\nWell that was that was way before way before you know I heard gross and used to have a hard time making weight you know I'm a ... or ... I have I talked to I Would ... you would get fined a weekly because he couldn't way the amount that they wanted him to weigh it was like two twenty five to thirty but he couldn't couldn't get dumped\n... David Anderson told me a story I hit the gross Mintz former teammate in Washington David ... told me a story that gross one would get into the huddle and if he didn't like the play is just like now I Do this just go deep [laughter]\nI don't know how to play it but but the Shannon's liked him so much that they were cool with it because he was such a good guy everybody at a fun time with it so well it helps to produce and he was a guy to slant yeah\nUm now that yeah we will touch on [laughter]\n[noise] or whatever that was from Mr Boesky on Sunday we'll talk about that at some point um but I Do want to ask you about Andy Dalton in primetime games\nWhat do you make of this man psychology of a quarterback he continues to not produce in primetime games he's got another opportunity to try and prove the skeptics wrong in a primetime spot against the Kansas City defense that you can put up points and get your yards against because teams have done it all year long\nCincinnati is often says plenty good enough but what do you make of Andy ... and not just dandy Dalton Marvin Lewis is struggling primetime games\nCake quickly there on the road for this prize I'm gay for starters and Kansas City is or at least was I think one of the last week the number one third doubt defense in the legs so look let's not paid it like it's that much of a lay up for them\nOkay well a combined it makes the story sound better or the other end of the troops in the way we don't deal with facts here\nRight so I think what happens is and this is human nature I mean you tell me if if you have an experience this in your life like the more time something happens that people start to identify you as something that\nThe more apps you are to sit there and say maybe I hand that you know maybe I Am the guy that can't ever get the job done in primetime or I just I I Can't figure it out\nIt it's hard especially in today's age could not hear what's being said about you and that's why what's so many players talk about block yeah social media or block it out the noise on the outside\nThey really do have to disconnect because it's so loud and it's so noisy that you can't help to subconsciously start to think those thoughts and to play in the NFL especially as a quarterback\nAnd to play at a high level consistently you have to have the utmost confidence and you can't allow all that stuff that gets you so\nUm I think for him it's happened enough in his career that it feels like a monkey on his back it's like that weight that he's just he's bearing every single time he goes out in this scenario\nAnd you know it's just he needs to figure out a way of either having that you know big time performance where he gets a monkey off his back\nOr that needs to be an instance where it happens a few times his team helps them out and then maybe he starts to feel more confident from that they can build off of a couple of wins that are really more maybe led by their team more so than him\nBecause he's not a bad quarterback and he said you said pretty good years or ... or you could win games of anti ... and you just can't win postseason games are games that a lot of people watch that\nThat's like and it didn't it he can win those games I\nHonestly feel like their team has not played as well around him either\nThey've melted down that that play out a game against the Steelers was a complete until I'm ... I was on the air right afterwards and it was the most fun post game show I've ever done because I've never seen a team melt down like that not only just with playing making\nBut with just undisciplined personal bond has perfect may as well and had a machete on him in that game he was out to hurt people um so yeah it's it's not completely on him but he's the quarterback so he's going to get both of the blame\nYou know what else was there for the campus at a one age ... oh that's right yeah he was with the ... your brother in law ... ankles then yeah\nAnd I remember asking him about it and he has he goes I've never seen anything like that\nI looked at me with his eyes as wide as you can imagine these shows I've never seen anything like that before my life I you know where an egg any came from Green Bay so they they want a Super Bowl they well they don't even use the F word in Green Bay [laughter]\nUm yeah I was going to say the beacon writing out YDF Wisconsin so it's this whole thing was\nMan once you got into certain guys heads\nLike a guy like botch as perfect\nThey it's just there's there's no turning off that switch and I end up at a fortunate part is you still see him play the way he does it getting it's getting it's getting by the way she has because he hasn't changed is is way of playing but\nAnyway you go about it he just said look though that's kinda how you know that gene rides you know it's it's really led by their players that it's pretty loose there's not like some hard disciplinarian when you talk about more of an Lewis and as much as that strength at times it also can be their their their downfall\n[laughter] it doesn't matter what the record as they were still going to get everyone's best shot they're still living at Penn State's best shot the ... states that shot I'm the only thing now is that they ultimately do control their identity which they did by the way they did before Ohio State lost\nBecause they're they're one last came out of conference so it didn't matter\nUh okay so now that we're done with your terrible answer ... Fox warns radio you're you're below baiting but you asked me are terrible uh [laughter] you got ...\nUm we get a little bit of a some game show music here on Fox portrayed we have a live studio band this is a high budget program I Know what you're thinking well\nI yeah and you know yeah I Know you're thinking it is a this and this is Sunday night radio these guys are just mailing it in ... hold on quite contrary my friend this is a high profile high budget radio show we have a studio band\nAnd attendance [noise] by that is an actual band a ton of recording we didn't just hit a button in between both those wiping them tender no this is an actual band that's in Studio right now here in ... radio opposite bumble um Astrid bumble\nAnd so so here we go Brady Drew Brees through his five hundred career touchdown great career touchdown as the saints beat the Baltimore Ravens erode went for New Orleans [noise]\nWhat did you know that Drew Brees as now just the third quarter back in NFL history to beat all thirty two teams\nIn the NFL [noise] can you name the other two [noise]\nSo you you kinda posed this question before the break and I gave you an answer and then after I gave you the answer I thought about it and I was like oh I don't know if that's going to work right so poverty is the first one that comes to mind [noise]\nI was thinking about how Britain I kept going All right I'm going to the teams of thinking about my feet this team is beat that seems to be just to [noise]\nAnd so if so\nTom Ridge is not one of these quarterbacks but what team is poverty not be ... [noise]\nThe New England patriots [noise] exactly [noise] so it couldn't be Tom Brady 'cause we put for one team so then I Am from that I I basically came to me I got to be in ten minutes noticed it's gotten to know it's got to be\nQuarterbacks we're all fake caliber that that moved to eat right so they were great one place and then maybe they went one or two other places or they just went to one\nOf the can I give you a hint real quick nuts\nPeyton Manning uh Brett Farr okay well I was going to say it's definitely not my ... uh since we're talking a old school Ohio State football ... threats on the bragging Ohio Ohio State school didn't times that go to Ohio State who did that because I Want to do I keep it in the Columbus area Columbus right next to\nDublin to cause you to know I'm All right uh so yes you are correct righty Quinn Brett Farr Peyton Manning and now Drew Brees are the only quarterbacks in NFL history that the beaten all thirty two teams in the NFL\nHere's some other names that surprised me on this list so obviously Tom Brady can't because Tom Brady plays for the patriots so he's never had the opportunity to play for the patriots until this off season when a dollar check probably trade them I'm Aaron Rodgers is another one clearly can't beat every team because he's only played for the Packers same with Ben Roethlisberger\nYou know who's mixed into this bunch and this order back\nHe's the only team\nQuarterback has not beaten is the Miami Dolphins right I Want you just walk Penn State think about a longtime quarterback from Penn State Kerry cones bingo\nBingo who knows they're being quarterback football or you\nThink about this by the way it's not even multiple teams it's you have to play for one see him in each conference but that wouldn't be the case for Peyton so it's kind of interesting yeah\n'cause because he was he just had the opportunity to play a nuts NFC teams where he was able to beat them all\nOkay let me ask you this more impressive feat right Drew Brees Brett Farr and Peyton Manning beating every single team in the NFL or me cheating\nTo beat my mom and a horse shoes tournament years ago to [laughter]\nProbably\n[noise]\nThere were less veterans are proven tough to perform and temperatures of a hundred and forty degrees and forty below zero because when you\nStarted extreme conditions you can start an everyday conditions like running late for work\nA broken Omar creepy Perkins run [noise]\nDoesn't only visit any of our fifty five hundred locations nationwide and let us do more for you [noise]\n\nIs your job sucking the life out of you wake up you can do something else information technology I Know what you're thinking but I'm\nNot a math and science person no problem no excuses it's not rocket science it's my computer to rear\nGo to my computer career dot edu and take the free career evaluation today you could start your new life as an IT pro in as little as four mom's my computer career dot edu that's my computer career dot E.

I have no idea aren't they playing what a narrative stadium if it's not Jack johnson\nI got no interest in it All right how 'bout that that's called loyalty to singer or no like I think some talking about your brother in law for the penguins um yeah I think he got there late or they're not gonna wanna ruins Blackhawks Notre Dame say oh it is\nA while ago that it'd be fun I Can't wait to not watch 'em so [laughter] so it's not a Fox\nHim fighting chance no or go through our pockets like NBC I don't want to bring that bridge to but I there was a a part in this part of burn like there was there was there was the lead up to that when a classic years ago and I\nBelieve was the penguins and the capitals and a guy for the penguins took a puck off his face off his cheek you didn't break his cheek bone or anything but he was a little bit swollen and he got on the plane\nAnd he looked over at Sidney Crosby and it was on film because they were doing a documentary and Crosby was like and I forget the guy's name he said\nI I think it was Ben love joy it was bad this guy named Ben loved Joe which is probably a porn name but this guy bend love joy was on the plane and Crosby looks over them goes Ben\nHis entire face swelled up because he was on the plane [laughter] so I I I Wonder how like how excruciating it was the first time maybe watch and I'm like what what do you think went into the decision\nTo not send them on a plane and how soon before they knew this guy's gotta go by bus or a ... we've got to pay\nBefore you could go any further than ended that decision if that is the decision that you're making don't you think you just shouldn't be playing but that was\nThat's my point okay so so what point did the conversation go from yeah this is really bad to\nHey graying greyhound operate from year to a ... like no way first off\nI Would much rather travel or twelve hours on a pimped out like tour bus all yeah then fly if it took me two hours\nI Swear to you it sounds crazy that's how big of an impact I think flying as in your body's naturally I'll just I'll go that far just I've got messed up feet at all is Frank injury\nEvery single time we traveled you would be the worst pain how achy and arthritic it'd be and it just ... you know it'd be swollen it barely fit into my shoe and that was you know ... years after I had initially injured it but that's the impact that\nUm you know fly house on your body because you're in a pressurized cabin and it just I it ends up playing um I met a steady injury that you've got\nYeah I just I I Wonder how close it were to just not having them play as opposed to take a bus to get to the game very very bizarre art Brady couldn't Jonah stocks here Fox Sports radio would come to your life and the guy go Fox Sports radio

know I scratch his back and he stabbed mine it is really just that just that great Diana guy yeah not him not any more is getting\nCut off you know more or less for me I found it really inappropriate now\nThat I'm not sure where you're going to lie\nBut Jesus is coming up twelve minutes from now or whether Brady Quinn likes it or not\nRight how's that so uh so he will be making an appearance but I'm going to throw an idea\nThat you that I think is actually going to work\nAnd and get this this is such a good idea that I'm shocked that nobody else has come up with this idea yet I'm so everybody assumes what what would you consider the worst statistic for\nA quarter back in the NFL\n... like the most overrated one yes ah to me it's the quarterback reading because most people don't even know how it's comprised so people will throw it out and there'll be like oh he's got like a\nHundred and something quarterback reading and there was like well what's the highest rating what what what how do you calculate that so to me that's the stupidest one when people like to use that um but they're they're all pretty bad\nYeah you don't watch the film yeah I'm like like interceptions I think are are a little bit overrated from time to 'cause they don't can be misleading yeah and I actually through the id out to you what you are you were ... I don't actually believe you responded to this idea I had appreciate it but I actually through the ... the idea out to you how about we do ... box score\nWhere you will defend quarterbacks who get where there's an interception\nBut it's not really your normal interception a lot of\nThe way that it ends I without the quarterbacks full\nYes I Am and it's a way to defend quarterback until the dying and here they are the most prominent position on the field they deserve the most respect and they deserve to be defended the most um I have another one that I Would like to throw out you looked Sarah okay this is the brand new stat I'm I'm working on a copyright for um\nThis is the should have been in interceptions that I'm should've I ended up under section\n... is this relating to a certain quarterbacks\nOkay because ... and the reason I bring this up is right now as it stands Sam ... Arnold is the NFL leader in interceptions this season\nRight mixture ... should be leading the NFL in ... [laughter] okay [laughter] because he\nWas not good on Sunday and they almost like I I wondered after he missed\nHis fifth or sixth open wide receiver on an errand throw a sometimes out of the flat or sometimes\nGuys it it you see quarterbacks and make the completion all the time I saw Jared golf you know throw the same flag route to the corner the ends on on the left side to Brandon cooks and place the ball beautifully yet Mr basically was intercepted when he at Anthony Miller open\nI almost wonder if there was something wrong with him what did you make a ... performance and now he's progressing so far this season\nYeah I think he's been a consistent and I think that's something that you're going to see 'em one ... when you see a young quarterback a guy still technically in for sixteen games starting you know based last year and and\nYou know combined with this year didn't play a lot in college we always talked about that but it but I think it shows in it and how inconsistent he is\nAnd he went up against one of the better teams in the NFL you know statistically whether or not you can make as good of an argument for New England one thing is for sure you know situational a third down red zone they're as good as anyone and you know that was you know one of the term in fact I think today but\nUm I I think he's\nFrom the pocket\nTo me watching them right now if his first reads not there\nIt's it is his percentages of of completing that past go down significantly if he has to go to a second and third read from what I watch him he tends to throw the football a little bit less accurate he tends to not want to stay in the pocket of world miss that next guy who was open um so\nYou know if I was that if I was a defense plant against the man I wouldn't place much man to man because typically when you see teams play man to man\nYou know where you're going with the football and you're already committed to that decision I'm that guy getting open and you can throw him open if he's just working one on one depending on where the defender is if it's zone danger typically going to work more through a progression\nBecause there might be a few routes in that ... in that concept that are they're so like the first and second place just supposed to look base that covers they might not be there might be the third option that might be your best option\nUh I just how do you fix somebody who's not accurate because\nI see and make these throws in in guys are open ... why it's not about separation or anything like that guys are getting open there's opportunities there to make plays and it's almost like he would rather pull the ball down and run than trust his arm\nAnd and it seems like he's he's almost scared to pull the trigger how do you fix that like is that just something you work on you continue to to practice or at this stage you kind of are what you are\nWell I think as far as how he's program right you saw the rushing touchdown on what is the third six when he's scrambled around and then ... and the findings when the end zone like that's a great highlight it's cool that he can do that he's not going to be able to do that again\nI mean the those plays probably only come once it's Rand it and then one and then defense is doing allow you the sack you the next time you try to do that 'cause they figure out different ways of rushing you but uh I think when it's in your DNA like that you know you become an end who of I always compare it into right now what older guy by compared mischievous you too\nOh a Joe Montana [noise] Mm no I'm not quite ... ... yeah", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Fox Sports Weekends", "city": "Iowa City", "day": "22"}
