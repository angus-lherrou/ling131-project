coming up next but a big story today out of the NFL and I can't believe we're still talking about there's Brian but we're still talking about as bright\nBut you have to hear the audio\nJerry Jones pretty much close the door on a reunion with as Brian today does Brian is still trying to get back in the NFL him now at this point I wouldn't doubt that there's this whole plan was to sit back and wait for the cowboys to call in\nAnd say okay we need you are often stinks ... says we need you to come back I wouldn't do\nThat that's where he's at because he turned down stupid money from the ravens\nYou know he went to visit the browns and wanted more money yeah but it was ridiculous and and so how is not playing when he's had a chance to play when I'm sure as agents told him hey does take this money this is the best it's gonna be na na na na hey here's an offer from the browns now and\nThen he goes on Twitter any attacks everybody attacks the cabbies he's not getting\nHe he's a drama guy and that's all he is and he's hurting his own cause but I wouldn't doubt if the biggest thing what he wanted was hopefully to come back and the cowboys are bringing back like that's my ultimate goal in this they release me but they'll bring me back\nBut there's still love me yeah there's there's still some of that but just think about if he'd been smart enough to sign the deal in Baltimore running opposite John Brown and what they're doing with that ... that could be a lot of fun and could have gotten some of those numbers back\nHe could be under achieving in in Baltimore now

pertains to him as an individual Amira feelings of that nature it just seems like ... cowboy\nBut we've got to look at a\nUh bought we're all having to deal with and that is what's in the best interest of the day so um that's a different story there\nAll the different stories 'cause he kept saying jak instead of dead understand does that factor as we know what's on his mind\nYou know Jack is a really got to figure stuff out but you know back then as soon as jak is that reminds me of Tony I think about Tony a boy or a who are we talking about\n[laughter] well I think we can only dream

com so tonight we watch Clayton ... absolutely dominate the Braves eight innings the longest playoff outing of his career could have gone out for the night\nBut you heard him say after they didn't know who the pinch hitter was going to be due to pinch it he would go out there 'cause dude as a lefty but they didn't flowers came up so they went to Jansen to pitch the night\nAnd day Robert ... talked about a comeback or that her shah yeah so that is hamstring tightened up a bit so how much that plays long term so no but the fact that he offered that up seemed a little little out of sorts\nYeah we're going to hear from Dave Roberts coming up on a couple of minutes because he is doing a victory lap tonight oh sure Monday Tuesday Wednesday Thursday every night that's starting young ...\nOver Clinton cursed showing game one was the right move\nBecause the Dodgers needed to move away from Clinton courage shock because they relied on him to do everything in the postseason the last six years and it hasn't worked out because Clinton cursed show has been average in the postseason he hasn't been awful yeah it's been great he's been average he's five hundred and his erase four and a half\nThat's been who Clinton ... is and the fact that the Dodgers have two other pitchers who quite frankly pitch better than him this season they saw this week can strike a blow and do three things all at once\nWe can get you to start game one at Dodger Stadium where he's been great all season eerie as one point one five and home and save Clinton Kurdish offered game to\nWe can strike a blow that if\nWe do this Clinton curse showing may be pissed off\nAnd we may get a better Clayton ... in the playoffs because he feels slighted and in the end if he wants to opt out of his contract at the end of the year we know our future without him is going to be a good one because we have good pictures now that we can rely on Walker bealer is fantastic you is very good\nThey are driven and built through this line up and a couple of good pictures now it's not just Clayton Kirsch all or nothing they went to the world series and curse show Mr huge block of the season this year he was their third best picture they still one Ninety two games that went to the playoffs\nSo when you take a guy making thirty million dollars for the next two years with back problems if he's pissed off enough to walk away at the end of the year you'll be okay\nAll three of these things have happened now for the Dodgers because we're you was great in game one\n... pissed off you had a different edge to him we saw on his statements last night he was upset with being pushed the game to set up after the game tonight we played the audio from Ken Rosenthal on Fox Sports one\nAnd now if he goes away you understand things will be okay for the Dodgers these last three games have been a change in the Dodger franchise dealer against the Rockies to win the west reviewing game one ... here now\nSome teams have only played one game in the play offs\nBut clearly the Dodgers look like a different team and they were last year not just hungrier but a team that is more\nThey can depend on their starting pitching rather than hope they get a great\nEffort from the start because last year it was well we hope cursed jaws great we hope that door vicious great and then you hope that well he'll can be good or whoever else is pitching now after this week it's well we know reuse going to be great we know viewers got it and now we know that curse Shaw is a different guy because he's really upset\nSo everything the Dodgers what they accomplish this week\nThis has been a master stroke week from the Dodgers no ...\nYou you thought the last couple of weeks to get in you you go back and forth you have the early fight from the diamond backs they fade and then you're going back and forth with the Rockies or their battle tested we saw a year ago a lot of these guys have been through the postseason wars and you've got a lot of\nCases of the franchise let's just because it's Los Angeles that everybody gets a little bit of star time and you and you try to take care of the the players on your squad and get them their face time and recognize no a lot of these guys have had their star turns\nOn longer were highly touted coming up so now it's just coming to fruition\nA few years ago it was the occasional hey here's Manny would\nOr whatever the case what happened and Clinton Herschel right it was one guy he was the face of everything mhm well now the team as a whole has so many of those guys including Machado who almost tonight and you got to figure out is he coming back or does he want to go to Philadelphia or New York or wherever you're going to end up\nBut when you look at your rotation\nIt was four guys that you hope to get to the fifth\nOr sixth and you look at a lot of filter and a six and a lot of bull ... just trying to enunciate tennis you fit in and ... that you're getting deeper into games and ... you played the hot and\nIt just from the pure metrics of it all would take a motion out for a moment this is cold hard fact you gotta gotta pitches your old one at home in his nine starts\nYou don't want to go away from that you have to give him the opportunity to go out and set the set the tone for the series and they did and then Clinton her shot comes in and now you've all been put the dagger into the braids he gives off elite elite up double George Clooney a junior\nAnd that's it one more hit in his eight innings work just a mashable or it's only three strike out and and you vanquished a young team that got there are a bit too soon and you've set things up and if Clinton crochet continues to pitch would that edge\nAnd how dangerous are you now and then you get you all are back in the mix you've got three guys in whatever you've got three guys in your rotation that you can trust to that level you're almost beat 'em on today's based\nSports radio that Jason Smith show with my Carmen\nAbout a little bit of Dave Robert let's go feeling pretty good after the Dodgers held the Braves to a grand total of zero runs through the first two games\nCan I ask you about the\nThe deep with Clayton and the night for sending him out and then making the change\nIt's just more forcing a Brian's hand um\nIf they would've brought do up there at your face claim he was gonna say some [noise] um but to for them to burn two players for one move 'em I felt that that was a way that you can get user to best hitters off the bench and um\nGet our guy in they're going to back\nDave how much consideration did you give to like Clinton finishing the game tonight [noise]\nI'm not really not a whole lot uh\nYou know he took a bar took off in the fifth or sixth sending maybe ... off the hamstring and so as the game progress or continue to tighten up a little bit and so for me um\nI thought obviously he had really good stuff but then as you get through the sixth seventh and eighth inning and understanding that the that uh the potential that it is tightening up [noise] um [noise] I felt we had a pretty good option and coming back there so uh right\nThere yeah again if we had the match up I was going to go with channel or\nPlay for another hitter but as far as finishing the game um\nI didn't think too much about it\nTo my in the front they what do we make of\nEight innings eighty five pitches three strike out ... ... in your mind what we're looking at tonight in terms of who ... news and and what he may be becoming\nHe pitch he pitched um\nI think that it was it was one of for me or one of the best outings that I've seen that I can recall in the sense that um\nHe uses complete repertoire pitches um use both sides of the play to change I Love the fact of life and um he really pitched and so with that there was a lot of soft contact [noise]\nUh he was in complete control\n[noise] it was really a [noise] you know you've got\nSandy Koufax in the front row and you've got ... he was a he was an outstanding tonight [noise]\nGiven all the distractions that will just we compress it was this even more impressive who's able to put all that aside [noise] um [noise]\nIs impressive though it's not a surprise um this guy is a potential hall of fame player uh so uh to to to have the noise around him\nBut when it comes to his day to start and to help his ball club when a game I had no concern that anything was going to affect them\nAnd [noise] you know our decision I think there's a lot of of it was made of it but I think that um I feel good we feel good that we put both those guys and the best position to pitch well\nDone so they're a little bit of day robbers noticed the uh uh the on adults rated praise for Clayton Carson he\nPitched he pitch\nIs I'm going to say good things about him because now you got what you want it but now you have this is a very tenuous situation with a very upset Clinton courage Shaw and now you got to make sure you can ride them for the post season and see how things turn out that he's not to pissed off he wants to leave in the off season now that you\nDid it you're always doing damage control after decision like that didn't quite and Kirsch uh there there's the difference between Clayton Kirsch of the pride for men and Clinton curve shot the guy who understands what needs and how to go out and just as bill ballot jak would say in between eating chicken or whatever we're calling it\nHow trashed the while you know you find that show used to be with something would happen if he would just chat Jerry Springer his name oh sure I Know that he's not doing anything to women or by that show is oh God Bless the key already guard has his own guys are going on within his own show\nBut I got to be honest I dig Eddie doing this because not too long ago\nI did I did it\nFor a bar I was at this isn't how long ago as well as the twenty\nTen this the last time the jets were good [noise] the jets in twenty times when you were trading on Sanchez it was the yeah it was they went to the AFC\nChampionship game against the cold and they needed to win the last game against the Colts okay I got to the playoffs so I'm In Michigan with my wife's family and it's such a huge game and I said I got to go watch this scandal what\nBetter about this though like you would have been better if this was during the Andrew Luck era [noise] 'cause then you ... ... in the show where they tied everything together colds bench Peyton Manning at half time they didn't want to be they were not playing for anything to George ... at home\nField all the way through so I said I got to go watch skiing we when we're in the playoffs and she goes well I'm doing you know we're we're doing stuff here with my grandmother I said well I'm going to go watch a game so I went up the street to a bar by myself to watch this game\nMcCaffrey name of the ... but so I go there and I go in and the jets are playing and may ... and

[noise] everybody everybody gets a free beer on Jason for the jets were they know\nIt doesn't matter they could have said everybody let's get a free beer on Jason because he'd just lost all his money in a Ponzi scheme yeah a\nLot of the matter is the best part of the story is that I buy the beer and people are coming over to me saying thanks you guys got a big deal it's a great gesture\nThey all thought I had that in one money on the game because the jets were supposed to win this game and they all thought I bet they were like how did you know what you know did you bet straight up I said no I'm just a jets fan and they wonder gone to the playoffs and\nThey're like oh they're all little disappointed that doesn't have the same name resume and strike because you're in Michigan right yeah

Peyton Manning but you hear a good things depending on who you who you discuss it with\nSo I like the man and a lot but if he lie Manning's last name was knocks what he's still be the quarterback in New York\nAnd seriously insert your last name with Eli Manning's last name and ask\nYourself am I still the quarterback in New York based on my performance is over the past several years and\nI get the loyalty there and I get that he's won a couple of Super Bowls I get all of that I understand they they want to be they feel indebted to Eli Manning he brought them a ton of success and he's to an elegance Tom Brady in a Super Bowl\nGet all of it but I think the organization is almost afraid to make a move\nI think that spoke volumes in the offseason when there was an opportunity to have basically your pick of every quarter back in the draft outside a bakery Mayfield and you passed on it for a running back\nI Wonder if the organization sees the last name manning and it changes their perception it changes the way they look at it and it changes how they view the quarterback position in New York\nBecause he's had a lot of rough years since the last Super Bowl there's been a lot of down times and it's not a hundred percent his fault but clearly in today's NFL when you can't throw the ball down field and it's it come on it's not like\nPat germ or didn't come from an offense that put up numbers with case keen him\nLike he's got the talent they're so what's the issue\nYou've got a wide receiver and safety in some backup quarterback who got longer completion on the year the new why\nIs that happening either it's not in the playbook which I find hard to believe in today's NFL or you don't trust that the guy can get it there\n\nAnd so I just wonder if the New York giants field is loyalty to Eli Manning based a lot on his last name and because he wanted a couple of Super Bowls the awhile back\nBecause you remember what happened last season than Mac do have the\nGall to stay to Eli Manning listen man we're going to put Gina Smith and at some point or we're going to give you the option to start the game to continue your consecutive starts streaks and then um\nAt halftime we're going to take you out and Eli Manning to his credit said no man or that just doesn't feel right that feels for just like gee you know start the game and everybody was outraged\nOutraged at the idea of ... outrage even though it was Eli Manning's call as to whether or not he wanted to start the game and how did the giants respond to it they fired Ben Mac or do the next day or the day after\nCould have been an hour after the game who knows they could uphold the tarmac stunt like they did with lame given at USC\nThat was the organization saying and and getting a reading from the media and everybody else that was so upset with the move how could you do that to you lie manning the guy who won you a couple of Super Bowls\nWell because it's demanding they got so much heat and there was such a backlash that they were afraid to reprimand or they were afraid to to back up their head coach so instead they fired him so we have proof that the organization views Eli Manning differently than a lot of people in the league do\nSo when you hear owed back him call out the fact that they don't throw the ball twenty yards down the field and then patch um or four weeks into the job has got to do a back and forth on a friday without back him in the media\nI'm telling you man insert your last name with Eli Manning's\nYou'd be long gone by now Jonah socks Fox Sports radio eight

bit I'm not going to pretend like I really care about something if I don't care I'd rather just be honest I think people appreciate the honesty\nYou know that that's just the way I look at it so we

do full segments or shows on radio for and so we decided well why don't we are when are we just called this [noise]\nThere's so many stories in the world of sports than most of them for\nA complete

Seahawks are Seattle Seahawks be Seattle super sonics worried damn good team and one of my favorite players in the NBA growing up was the savior McDaniel\n... McDaniel but he always looked like he was about to punch you in the face\nI think I even ... McDaniel shoes I might they might have been like hand me downs where I got him at a thrift store and like one of those bag deals where like five bucks at whatever you can fill in the bag you walked out with I even know if they were the right size but it was ... McDaniel he was one of my favorite players I Love saying the name ... shrimp\n'cause it always sounds like I'm going to curse on the air when I say it's so yes I actually do care about this and I hope Seattle gets a basketball team\nAmen to that or I or I Love it an interesting story from the earlier in the week up there were reports that U.S Open champions Brooks kept good and Dustin Johnson had

trade deadline until we actually tip off the the new season in the NBA all this stuff is just sort of pretty much a waste of time next\nUh interesting story from game one of the division series

just release it that you're hired the guy on social media you actually have to have a signed contract first\nYou know like gay one stuff when you go to law school as far as contracts go well they didn't do that and instead Josh again just went back to the New England patriots and so they were less scrambling to try and find a head coach I Believe they settled on Frank writes about an hour and a half ago but this was general manager Chris Ballard\nAfter getting burned by Joshua Daniels\nJosh call me and made a decision he's not common I don't\nI don't deal with New England\nI have no idea

I was sitting in my heart radio station\n[noise]\n\nI was so hard like we we just need to play with them or we're only one in three you know we last year to year we want to live in a fire we went through and through we ended up being two or three of the man [noise] so you never know when you're going to run a\nMatter when we've all gone wrong how can we can sort of all the words were yours how can we don't attempt to try and there was one of those um those are questions that we have to figure out [noise]\nAnd now I was says how energy is this what we bring rely on before the game [noise] all of the house\nNow I'm Patrick rumor the giants head coach now interesting there he talked about not throwing the ball more than twenty yards and and uh and and all of that stuff and you would think OK well this is a shot at Eli Manning well pap Sherman who was also asked about it his head coach here was passed rumors response\nI don't know I guess you'd have to clarify that probably a better question for him what he meant by 'em but I Do know that is our team has a heck of a lot of heart our team plays with a lot of energy what we haven't done is we haven't really executed quite as well as we need to yet and that's really the\nOnset of a energy it's more execution and I think that's what we're all striving for but ah\nNow we've got a lot more of these guys got a ton of heart including or do and a lot of want to and I I think that you know will break over here once we start executing better we as coach has got to continually fight to put them in the best position possible and then we got we got to execute\nOr to go back and forth there uh one one says why aren't we doing this the other said well you know we've got a lot of hard but it's about the execution which is code for you guys aren't doing what we're asking you to do good enough which is why we're one in three\nThat's why we're bad and all the back of his calling out the officer not throwing the ball down field here's what I Do know right and I was making this point earlier if you live ... last name was knocks he's not still the starting quarterback for the giants\nLet's just be honest man\nThe fact that he's a manning that goes a long way and if you don't think that organization thinks about that if you don't think that organization reacts to public perception\nIf you if you don't think that's the case I got two examples for you one they fired bend Mac do after he bench to Eli Manning and ruined his consecutive starts streak last season fired been Mac do\nBut then ... he like manning the option of starting that game against Oakland Eli Manning declined dust Gino Smith got to start\nAnd they got so much heat and so much push push back for how dare they ruined Eli Manning's consecutive starts streak that the organization fired bend McAteer during the season\nWhich is not something the giants organization routinely does it's not something that they do every day I don't know that the giants organization is fired a coach mid season\nBut because it was he lie manning and because the public was so upset by it the giants overreacted\nThe giants ownership is also even talked about how a season ticket holders when the whole uh anthem protests going on that they spoke openly about how season ticket holders have threatened to ditch their season tickets\nUh if any players Neal\nAnd the national anthem and giants ownership was speaking about it as if they were concerned if I was giants ownership I'd say ... and I did this goes above and beyond just the national anthem if anybody's threatening to drop their season tickets if I'm giants ownership I go\nTake a walk we get a three year waiting list we don't need you\nCan hear you describe will go away\nBut you think anybody at McDonalds if your coffee comes out and it's cold and you say I'll never go here again do you think any of the employees are like\nOh wait but don't go you see the drive through line it's around the block ...\nNobody cares go way you like you don't have an impact on this subject they they have a clear clear we're we've proof pattern of behavior that they overreact to criticism publicly pattern of behavior\nWhat I'll do back him as saying about why are we throwing the ball down field I got some numbers for you\nHe liked Manning's and and get your management better the last three weeks he's been better than week one but still there's no real threat to go down field in today's NFL that's that's not a good thing you've seen these often says Eli Manning's longest pass completion of the season is thirty seven yards\n\nThat puts them at thirty six in the NFL behind every starting quarterback a couple of backup quarterback and Albert Wilson a wide receiver from the dolphins and Kevin buyer to safety from the titans\nI mean anybody noticing something a little off their\nPat Schroeder you remember the Vikings ... a year ago it wasn't like you know they were ... Duncan come on man case Kim was stretching the feel a little bit Adam feeling Stefan digs at monster years\nI mean come on like there is something to it either Eli Manning can't go down field with the

like the guys weren't offensive mass or something like that in this kind of it's kind of freaky I didn't notice that one I didn't see that one\nUh Julie Stewart freaky may I say if you if you buy your favorite right what if any body solve this cause like if anybody knows this dude and has an idea of what or who the guy was\nYeah look I'm pretty good so far I got off to a bit of a bad start this season finished on a bit of a hot streak Clinton cursed Shaw not playoff Kurdish will actually put pitching well from once in a post season so if we can keep it up and I'm from ones that are doing anyway so he was ... electric\nAbout but how ... it was interesting was ... it wasn't like you were striking everybody out he used his pitches really economically he was a ... you didn't miss but he was one of those grooves where everything was over the plate like he threw strikes strikes in strikes\nAnd he's really had to change the way he's pitched this year he's really lost a lot of allows city even that last strike out that he got to end the eighth inning was eighty seven miles an hour\nI mean for a guy that was consistently hit Ninety three Ninety four ah in his prime so he's really he's a different kind of pitcher at this point in his career and he realizes that into your point you only had three strike house\nOr a game but doesn't mean he was any less dominant against that line of so pretty impressive and their best pitcher as even pitched yet\nThat's there are a young kid Walker Beeler was going to be on Sunday all you you had to try to try to finish the sweep so we'll see what happens they're willing to break\nYour age it's yours [laughter] the uh the Braves you chose yeah I think the Indians come back on the on the strokes\nHouston is tough man Houston is really tough I mean it's a lot of pitching staff or the ... under the addict Garrett call his all season ... came in and he's been dominant for them to to go along with I Will be great so I mean I had to go along with that all fence former home runs like yeah picked up right where they left off in the world series last year\nI'll tell you one thing though your Dodgers better watch out\nBrew crew mhm brutal crew cars that bullpen you better have a leave or to get or ball game no doubt that both but\nNo doubt she'll be an epic series they're up to nothing too so it looks like we're on a collision course for Milwaukee in LA\nSo we'll see what happens she ... the the ... one last great yeah are you with me here fig\n... the series she'll be seven games\n[noise] yeah I think it takes a little bit of the the upset factor out of it but most of the I think the majority of the time the better team ends up winning in about four games anyway the majority of the time every now and then you but the the you\nHave a greater chance of an upset it was like this is the NBA back to when you at the first round being alive games but those were very rare occurrence is all it did was give under dog teams a little bit better of an opportunity to to stage an upset but generally speaking\nI don't think anybody would complain about getting more quality baseball if you can so I wouldn't be I wouldn't be opposed to it\nDrives me insane I don't understand this board ... it's the best of its sport yeah happens in October\nWhy wouldn't you want in Egypt chapter in October like the NBA\nRight and we know how much the same obey all these TV networks and all of these ladies want more money on extra money at one extra game at the gate why wouldn't you\nKnow I don't understand them they should make the the the first two stupid wild card game ... five game theory that's just atrocious the fact that they do that yeah it's horrible\nHorrible All right I'm Sorry go ahead I\nGo out All right and you know it's okay I mean because hey look we all love baseball right so you were in heaven on friday because every single series was an action we call them every day we could lose I lose that's like a true fan come on and that's how you do it that's how you're supposed to do it\nLike a like the NC double a tournament the first day you sit at home we watch games the entire doc loser that's how it's supposed to be [laughter] it's not cool Sam [noise]\nNow does that raise raptors the festivities out in LA there were the final game of the night Dodgers as we mentioned snatching three nothing victory manned Machado with a two run home run for the Dodgers and Clinton cursed jaws I mentioned a shutout innings longest outing of his postseason career which is a little bit shocking\nOh the Dodgers leave that series to games and on and the other end Audie as serious as you mentioned as well to nothing has the brewers beat the Rockies by the final score for says it\nAll my car shopping can be confusing not anymore with troop pies from true car now you can do the exact price you pay for your next car so if as a true card to enjoy more confident car buying experience\nAnd the American league Red Sox scored five runs in the first couple of innings\nThat's all they need they will hold on\nFor five to four went over the Yankees Chris Sale his first postseason victory Craig kimbrell gets to save for the red Sox they win game on there\nAnd we thought that by using the defending champions hitting for home runs they not say seven to to win and their series opening a victory there as well a couple of NHL games on the night hurricane and the sharks both get victories college football Utah State beating BYU\nGeorgia Tech with a blowout victory over Louisville fellas that you

[laughter] I don't know much about baseball [laughter] for for effective even for these girls are\nSo looking you know a ... this when we look to the games that are I Am curious the big one Notre Dame Virginia Tech\nTonight it's not as it's not as sexy where Virginia tests quarterback issues\nIt's not as it was ... you know as it was it would've appealing early in the year was impressed by Notre Dame last year last week against Stanford um but I'm\nJust just not it's not it's not as sexy are now beginning to watch birds tough to play pool at church has the story but the guy in the book of Ian he's got he's he is efficient and\nI liked the way he controls the salt that's the momentum and stuff like that\nUm\nI think yeah I think it's it's an easy I think Notre Dame handles business not easy win but handles business\nWell it's interesting because Brian Kelly pickle guess Bryan Kelly has played the ... and they rank teams on the road\nTaken guesses record a three\nOf these I play ... close one in nine okay one in nine against rank teams on the road the only way men against temple which was a come from behind when a\n... yeah now I ... that says something\nBut even even even as bad as a as a matter of the office of Virginia Tech seems now\n\n... well I I mean look one nine\nYou're on the road Blacksburg anyway no doubt about it on the road in Blacksburg right yeah yeah those games are no joke right I don't know of all how the world the Penn State lose that gal oh my oh don't even get me started on that one\nThat was an absolutely atrocious call for you got to be kidding me [laughter] so\nDo you guys started ... Franklin is a hell of a recruiter he is a terrible game day coach or ... Wagner here this\nIs your baking is New Mind boggling we bad where you go on you know how the world you'll lose the game\nDidn't did you guys happiness catch when he was walking off the field into the tunnel and it was very quiet around the students section surrounding the tunnel and one Penn State fan very very civil yeah I should say he just sort of throws out there like horrible way to end the game coach shouldn't have gone for shouldn't run on fourth and five\nAnd it ignited James Franklin and he like he yelled back at the guy and an almost tried to sort of charged towards the stance really really ... and you got to look at it yeah it it's a short clip a short clip\nYeah it it made the rounds and then he he was making an interesting speech after the game it was it was an interesting Saturday and I I can attest to this guy is because I was here working watching the\nGame live and a ... or ... or a\nTechnical producer Ryan Smith who uh occupies the ah the airwaves here and basically what\nHappened was we watch the play and he just screams at the top of his lungs what are you doing and it was like the loudest shot and I'm looking at I like what the heck was that the goal is that right I mean we did a student\n... ... it was my Ryan ... is our technical producer for the show that I was producing because I come back and do the ... when I read\nAnd we're just like wondering what that what the heck was that because you guys do I'm In Ohio State fan I I was shocked that Ohio State even had a chance and again because they were awful for most of that game\nOffensively they could move the ball Penn State's defense we all thought it was going to be an up and down shootout like the big twelve it was it was a competitive it ... it wasn't even really competitive\nAnd then all of a sudden in the fourth quarter penalty ... one of the quarterback was horrible yeah yeah yeah Haskins horrible yeah Haskins just got it there was pressure does face every single a bright lights yeah he yeah yeah yeah he melting\nI saw a man and I and I it it made me turn off the TV I was just discuss it I'm like how does how does this always happen for a number twelve I mean you're right he had no business throwing that ball he had all the time in the world especially at the pass Russia's nor so well against them in an earlier in the game and he throws up a\nPrayer and he comes out and that's just five hundred that's man so\nDisgusted [laughter] and then I'll fetch I mean ...\n... it's amazing because look everybody lives off the back now right like every quarter back off that back yeah but she sent me they run it every play [laughter]\nHere's James White I ... I go to sleep remove genes white [laughter] James ... age she catches four hundred and Seventy five yeah thank you it's now it's ridiculous\nThey all live off the back but my God nobody lives on the back more to Brady\nThe funniest thing of the night I don't know if you saw because I I I was just actually doing some of the kitchen but they had the pre game\nAnd they had this little this little skip that they did for the rivalry between Indianapolis in New England and I'm like come on now it can't possibly be a rivalry when the team is owned the other team there is no rivalry there\nOh we're talking about we pay many he'd be the one time\n[laughter] you're going to store it was that was said every other Tom Brady older you're right and then when you land so don't give me this oh I hate Indianapolis though we're talking about the flight gate oh yeah you're still follow the about that\nYou don't want to have anybody bring it up but yeah you're bringing it up oh it's it's ... there's no rivalry between India that's going on it's not even close what was the what was I I I'm not a fan of his skits well I mean it when I'm Out in the whole premise of was trying to build up the hype behind the game\nBecause most people just thought it was going to be a blowout and it was going to go around his way right so they they they created this sort of like all the fans from the different from both cities\nIndianapolis and and of course you know New England Boston and stuff like that you know people were talking about how are you know well Indianapolis wants to you know Indianapolis wants to come in here we print tickets wearing the championship game you as that don't do it I mean the ... the\nColts history over the time of bread he's been there is miniscule compared to what they're doing the patriots have absolutely miniscule and so for them to sit there and say there's a rivalry I hate that I hate the Colts not even close\nYeah I I\nAs a as one of my greatest things that I Know I agree I agree with the other game this week that Monday Night game in Denver\nWhole Mahoney\nMan my lord out you can't do that to do that is that right well\nYou know what I saw I came in and I was skeptical because I wanted to see him I didn't get a chance to see a full game I just saw and I knew he had ... no doubt about it strong arm confidence and of course the creativity of Andy Reid and metal fence\nAnd there were times where it just it even when they had pressure I mean he was running away from von Miller and was able to to to you know all those other guys shave re those those guys are still able to make place making plays wise run out of pocket throwing darts those weapons man it's I I'm I'm scared because we've got to face the same twice\nI mean if you're just like how do you how do you slow this person now when one of the better defenses couldn't do anything on that\nYeah that was a\nImpressive now I ... I Will say this\nAnd be read there was a couple of times during the game where they try to get cute little play call in and stuff like that\nYou don't need to do that man you got cream hunter's can run the ball you got an office in mind that knows how to push people around just keep it simple Sam\n... and you got you you you got ... I Know and that and that's it meant that W a guy just brilliant guy that was what was that to me because you get these one game elimination of what else you don't have a you know you lose something on something on a whim\nOr like they did last year when they started off strong and then they they came up short they had a little bit of a they had a little bit of losing streak\nYeah yeah ... ... ... give me a thirty seconds on brown raiders\nUnfortunate that the ... that the rest of the way the parts that they did in it and there was both calls that was horrible calls both was uh so it's a tough one ... it's it was a tough call but it was it was a good game to watch I was glad to both teams are able to find a way to make it interesting that we [noise]\nDid you know they over Ninety percent of

two hits on the night while striking out three\nUh I feel we should be for an hour right now [laughter] I mean and that's not\nThat's not because I taught I talked to link as an eye witness I talked to Figi as an eye witness from watching that game and they both told me the browns got screwed at that game and it's just like you you can't help but not be impressed by them because Baker may field I mean yes you get\nFour turnovers but they still scored forty two points when when the last ... forty two points I mean that was a fun game to watch while at least ... and ... and they and they should have won the game yeah I I I I he going it officials and I hate doing that\nBut I just had a terrible taste in my mouth and I talked to Lincoln he was there he was ... he he was in the booth with brands\nAnd he was like triple em the brush it all in that game and the officials job though\nIt's it ... in this day and age the way the the real estate is especially in the middle of the field I'm

and it's like when I actually got much while I'm starting I'm starting in this way because uh my starting tie demonstrate burdening now by you know what I Will say\nThat I don't know if Callaway a play because he I Know he came up with an a hamstring and as I heard something else\nBut I Do think they they try a little too hard to get the ball to Calloway who's the underside God is good for a change up to me\nBut um but I I don't think that you should I don't think you need to force the ball to them I think they need to do more with their two headed monster a job and hide out of the running game and I think they definitely need to find a way to set up Landrieu because to me Landry is that what that size and his stature he's a he's a he's a difference micro to me that they don't use enough [noise]\nI was an\nInteresting fact guys I ah I saw this I think that the the browns losing after going forty two there is the third or the fourth team and this millennium there have been like three hundred and forty or three hundred and sixty teams\nTo score forty two or more and the browns read it a third or the fourth team to lose doing selves going wow while and I can think of one I'm a Aaron Rodgers one of his first years with the Packers losing I Believe a playoff game\nTo the air yeah All right that was the fifty one forty nine where they are viable yeah covering I remember that game's\nWacky that's the one I could think of a couple of more out there but not many wild\nAnimals a fact guys another thing and and I also brought this up um there's there could be some conspiracy theories with me line that was in Vegas because again got tied the the browns where two and a half point dog so that the writers are two and a half point favorite and they won by three [noise]\nWho knows if that was a coincidence I have no idea but I I just saw that and people\nOr bring an avid like problem is the ... the book's got more writer money to brown ... Oh absolutely of course yeah everybody was everybody was in on the raiders 'cause it's like it's hard to trust the ... going ... as soon as I get bigger maybe it was her start so I took completely get that\nOr let's do one more of this\nDealers one two and one\nYeah I I'm ... I think the Roberts is always going to move the ball you know they didn't know anybody ... but ...\nSays no no defence which is which is another ... exactly right I Am so Kansas City did it I don't remember the last time any team went into Pittsburgh and put forty two points on the Steelers\nAnd I know that's Kansas City but look that game against that game or against Baltimore was way more one sided in Baltimore made it seem like in the [noise]\nThe question for you is it time\nTo move on [noise]\nLike if you're a Steelers like Ronald ... and ... but they still lives in a tourist slow to do

American ... independent tax will be twelve\nIf it was it for the defense I Can't believe I'm saying this about the raiders defenses boys play sometimes if it wasn't for the defense\nThe writers want to beat the browns because they had no they had no business the ... gave them a little ... by Gehring calmly and the first um the turnover is definitely winning the turnover battle gave him a lot of confidence because they they have short fails to deal with because they weren't moving at the ball and the Cleveland Browns even they were not moving the ball [noise]\nAnd then he has reset the brown secondary really made it a better for them even though it's easy to carry finish the game when I think Fifteen tackles he was recently a writer you sign when he was with the writers last couple of

in the season I think we'll see a true test of where this ... this week against the saints I'm In New Orleans a\nBut it's it's it's going to be a tough one I don't I don't think they have a lasting

given Iraq Iraq [noise]\nI just think there's not any good [noise] let's go to the next scene [noise]\nThe defending champion Philadelphia\nEagles to what you saw the gates beset by injuries [noise]\nThey've been bag da\n... biggest issue right now [noise]\nWell one off but it's the lack of speed the lack\nOf weapons [noise] and all the sets the secondary [noise] has been surprisingly bad [noise] like ... what do you what do you see [noise] I still think with their defense overall because they can apply pressure those kind of figure it out [noise] they're gonna have to figure out\nThere are ways that you know as you mentioned with the injuries [noise]\nThey you know they they've had to manage their own and that's the reason why the record is where it is um [noise] all the games are close coming down to the wire they're resilient team a team that knows how to win and and because you have a different making Carson went [noise] I still think there'll be in it at the end so I think the real [noise]\nThey're ... they're more real to me than Redskins are right now but I I picked\nGets their division divisions delivery agree for like that but Carson is is still there are so great great quarterback [noise] and and you see these moments but he's the guy that wrote to any of these protections yeah the ads have been protected Jason Peters who am I I Love I Love\nYou just had you been selfies while there I Will say there's old as yeah that's that's that's the problem because I'm I'm watching as play and ah [noise] ... starting to catch up with him but yeah the pain is being hard to manage he doesn't move\nAs well as you said in the early part of the season [noise] with all those places [noise]\nUm [noise]\nIt's it's hard for me as an old tackle because I remember those days [noise]\nIt's it's it's hard to management\nJaycee you've got to figure out what did you start to decay for you [noise] oh it was it was actually started the K our Superbowl year the year we went to several two thousand [noise]\nWow I mean I I I had I had my mindset that if we had one that game I was ready to go because I was just out of my body was just one hour an hour you then what

the option I don't think he was going to wear so they got to be for guys [noise]\nI concur [noise]\nI think they're horrible and say well now now you got to be impressed with the amount of pressure to get on the quarter back I mean the new plan pretty well no\nBut I mean it's it's it's it's the identity doomsday no no no no come on I'm not saying that I'm just saying you got to give them a little bit of love I Know you've\nI was out last [noise]\nThey they they're playing their playing pretty good defense right now so I I give them a little bit of love but over over the the thing you know the seasons [noise] after the first month they looked like they have a fighting chance I just don't see it last [noise]\nBut [noise] the giants won three that we need to talk about you know you lie looks old effects\nIs bad [noise] they're off pay his body\nAnd their coaches horrible [laughter] [noise] tell us how you really feel about this right [noise]\nThat's just that's what I give you [noise]\nTennessee north of great division [noise] Chicago\nBears some errors one it is great that that I got to tell you I Love the bears [noise] I don't know what it is I just love\nThat the bears are good [noise] what it is what it what it reminds you of are the eighty five bears\nNow we were we were we were young you and I were ya oh it's really hard to truly appreciate the way we do now especially you know we know about football but when you have a defense is able to play at that level\nWhen you have you know of course that includes Mac has been a big difference maker because now other people have gotten fresher the people getting ... and all this stuff and [noise]\nThen there's there's an unsung hero in the office assigned Mitchell service you know one gave you know a snowball's chance in hell really to make it [noise] has has come alive and him look better every that [noise] that pick me up from the defense of made the often look relevant it reminds me of eighty five bears [noise]\nI'm not saying they're going to go away and right right right when the super bowl and but I mean right now when you talk about that division you talk about who's going to harass Aaron Rodgers and in in in the how competitive overall the division is you know how Detroit let's set time zone and so forth were where we thought Minnesota was going to be sort of self worth [noise]\nIt it is it is relieving it is a good feeling to see the bears don't you know I'm with you I I I Love I like I really liked his team a lot and they're they're\nReally fun I like Matt ... it'll be good coaches made me read but now now as far as being real or for gazing I gotta say they're real because with that defense [noise] ... yeah the real there in that division [noise] I mean they're going to they're going to create some havoc on the [noise] Packers to one in one\nI think we agree on this number twelve and that's that's it [noise] they are real she is she's so good yeah [noise]\nSummation of these teams\nWe are in the AFC\nSo central to that she was in the north central north north [noise] never used to be that show you how about that [noise] [noise] oh my gosh [noise] ... ... what a break ... pretty like did you ever you're out there\nThat the LA oh cubs happens to me all the time every time I Love about the chargers I'm saying Santiago all the way you remember when they were just seems like I\nKnow [noise] to me that it was back in Nineteen Ninety eight oh\nAll right and in the north uh Detroit Lions one in three [noise] where they are the are right yeah they are what they are in Beijing\nIs and I just don't see them coming out climbing out of it was a good which could win over the wing one but yeah that seems just putting off defense yeah drugstore and if she Sal this age are are real I think\nI agree I'm I'm surprised the saint the pet's got off to the started did but I I think they figured it out [noise] breezes\nOn his way to to join a those are probably surpassed as far as most passing yards [noise] um Peyton Manning so uh I I I definitely think that for real [noise]\nKnow your review or dangerous to the most dangerous players in the game ... yeah [noise]\nSo they're uh we both well thanks a lot Caroline that you wouldn't want\nI Want to fetch Caroline to be honest with you\nI Will vote no you you live I like them I I think they're real I think what they are they've got it they've got they've got to figure it out\nTo be viable offensively I think they do enough defensively to keep their gang their team and it I I think we're going to worry about their D. such I hate to make their office why I Do I just hate I hate the quarterback\nAnd I hate to ... everything's McCaffrey added back yeah I I don't know\nWhy like McCaffrey has come out of Stanford so I thought he was a weapon I thought it was a little bit undecided misused per se several years he was there but I like what they're doing with now so I I I I write\nTo me that they're they are they're your [noise] they are using the way he's supposed to be used but I think they overused him and I don't think they're that\nGood now now what to me what ultimately is going to hurt them in my opinion is a great golf in the situation of on him because I think he's a true possession died in\nThat gives you gives you those hard yards especially over the middle and without him I think last week this but in practice this past week with his job we'll see how it is [noise] and they come out of the by week we'll see how it goes but [noise] you know I'm hoping that I'm hoping that he's a part of it because they definitely need [noise]\n... to ... on a by number that journey Jane this after\n[noise] ... yeah I agree it's fun to watch the first month but we'll get [noise]\nYou know there's all kinds of weapons I mean that's really good receiver yeah yeah [noise] not that that's good that they're going to be helped by James which [noise] [laughter]\nI mean it's going to throw the ball down yeah you'd be go back to [noise] uh fits magic\nNo no you see how they felt about him near\n... one is three I still think they're good I still think they're a playoff the [noise]\nI just think I don't want to make a whole\nThis is too big of a hole and overcome [noise] because I now\nBecause now I Know in that division but see now I'm projecting there's two out of the south and the two out of the\nOut of the north and and and I just think the falcons or or or be are going to be like the bikes are going to be outside looking at [noise] I'll shake this would you do this butler back that either the falcons or the Vikings pick the while he was he\nA holiday I grew up in Austin and that's like\nAll right we're next do I got away that got to witness the second notion during the fall when I'm when\nI Want to witness I'm a witness\nBrands are real we agree [noise] well definitely\nEverybody else that division was not a great

C I hard radio [noise]\nIt's time for ... and more with Mark Emmert and Dave O'Hara mark is a reporter covering University of Iowa sports for the Des Moines register and the Iowa City press citizen while Davis a former Fox Sports radio TV and radio in Des Moines\nAnd a big network of football analyst and also the c._e._o. and the executive director the Iowa Sports Foundation\nBut you know we're going to talk of fence with Chuck obviously is when I Do want to hunt and I'm Glad you mentioned about defense than\nAnd special teams you know minus that blip with um oh goodness\nOr the or block punt right away against the ride in Illinois which wasn't rafters fault\nAnd then boy you had a couple of major uh blitz on radar\nA minus Stanley's tip interception at the end of the game against Wisconsin you had to special teams turnovers ... you had mentioned at the time on another show that you and I did together about ... about about all of our woods meant you know taking care of that no change in personnel still right now it's been almost two weeks removed everything's still status quo special teams going away still going to be there\nWe haven't laptop and he heads are moving to guys enter as I Know\nIt's all the same yeah no definitely not like still going to be the return or um and spent more set for kickoffs as back but uh it was interesting to see I I don't think he can afford another mistake cause where like I mean I obviously they're not gonna be watching very closely and I liked the kid but you can't just let you know you can't let that happen so how about if you get a chance and and uh hopefully for him it's that was the only mistake he makes a lawyer\nRusty and is still kicking game what's good everything's rolling their kickoff next points we'll go so we are good on special teams 'cause you're ready folks we're gonna talk plenty off and stuff coming now watch Chuck him out of the shooting tucked defense but I Know you might find that kind of problem with that but hey Chuck Long and talk about whatever he wants to talk [laughter] you know it's interesting to put a sign of a bowl on this\nOr put a rap on this a segment here in the next couple of minutes or you talk about defense and so you talk about ... I'm ... and ... and and Nelson Nelson and\nLaw firm or rock group Nelson Nelson has the area that I think the interesting thing to note on that mark is the rotation still there\nIn your piece of that but now some last Sunday's register you talked to minorities do you talked about uh you sat with him for about ten Fifteen minutes just you and he talking after the game after the Wisconsin games obviously who's a little bummed out and said they should have won that game or Wisconsin was better than I Am I Believe that analysis and write a but\nSo he's fine just so that so it's a cool the Savage beast here the fans get Little Rock ark or and and and and ... playing all the time so recover that the next couple of minutes we have to finish the segment out about ... being very cool with his playing time has rotation\nAnd backing up Parker has the if you will all that still status quo right\nYeah he's always said he's been very clear about that ever since we talked to them that that he doesn't mind the step count\nUm he really respects Parker has the ... and Anthony Nelson\nThe one thing I Would say though is looking back at that game a ... and actually got more snaps and part of an eighty happen as to which to me that's really weird yeah uh he only had Twenty one snaps against Wisconsin we leased before defense advance a an almost made the biggest play the game without yeah near force bumble so\nUh I still think he's got to get a lot more snaps a and it's been a good question asked Chuck when he gets out here and I I definitely want hasn't got no offense to another guy that I should be getting more snaps and he's getting you're talking to best athletes do most dynamic athletes I sat at the ball and they're both on kind of pitch counts for whatever reason\nBut there well there's something in the works and that's what I Want to find out from you or like I say we talked to talk about that you know in in fans case has been bandied about that he's not run blocking while right ran in ... case he's not planning to run very well so\nIt's interesting that both run game involved so as we wrap up this segment that I got a quick follow up to you in reference to that which would be\nWhen you talk about uh the deep ...\nUh and that's going to be really the the game it's going to find that kind of the second half of the season for them as if they can hang out with Penn State they plotted when they're that would be huge for this team but the next three games are very winnable um I think I was about Thirteen and then all of these teams so ah the question they have to avoid that they seem to have at one game a year where they just kind of lose for no reason\nAnd uh and they got to avoid that this year because of the sudden the skill sets up very well for them to be at least the nine one team if not attend one team wants things all sudden\nYeah and you know I forgot to mention a Purdue as well and I know we're getting ahead of ourselves\nSo after that Penn State game and like you just said about Indiana being tough you go back to the state of Indiana and again we don't know the time on that but generally speaking I Would almost always love you know think eleven o'clock at best to two thirty yeah so you know Purdue in bones got them playing again they lost a couple of games generally they shouldn't have\nAnd that's not the Iowa's benefit 'cause I like him as a coach yeah ... and I think that uh you know he was\nGood quarterback eat ah Louisville and has done a nice job at Purdue yeah I I don't see them stand down for a long I think they're kind of hit and then they've won last couple it look good yeah they do all kinds of and so you know let's let's let's talk about that than we we hit those ... middle for games I mentioned so we had you know Minnesota we hits I'm\nA Indiana then we had Marilyn and we talked a Penn State we kinda glossed over that but I really want to spend more time on at Penn State than just a lot of single right now but then they go to as as we talked about then they go to Purdue right and then their home against north western\nIf you don't think pappas Gerald is going to ... throw the kitchen sink yeah although Chicago kids all the Chicago kids go to Iowa those Goggle get some northwestern\nAnd that's always a a monkey wrench into words\nThat are always getting better as years go on to south western every year it seems like they have a bad September and then you look up and they're eight and four and you're like how did that happen yeah and they they do play Iowa very well yeah I mean every game so that's another tough one I think that might be that might be one of the last\nYou know and as much as I like levy Smith I you know Illinois oh my goodness you know ...\nThings are hurting down there and I I like ... you know it's just at the ... to the Capitol matinee gives you a nice job it as a ... fan I hated to see let me go sure but boy he is you talked about rowing boat with no paddle\nFiji for like a pun intended again I'm getting a lot of mileage out of that this week mark sorry none of it's good of course but I'm the only thing we can yeah thank you very much but you know markets interesting when you go to champagne and that's another one you don't want to be flat\nNow not going to be a crowd there because everybody lives kind of like playing in the twin cities of south of Chicago but I'd be twenty two degrees there you go and not a big crowd or not jacked up any way they are not a good team you know and then of course you're going to finish at home after Thanksgiving against you know Tabasco sauce rats talks on those two games for a little bit if you would look at those last two games I think those\nAre both I mean they should win those both but you can't be flat like you know your cat I Can't ever be out in the Big Ten obviously right those are two teams that I just have a hard time seeing I would lose too I'd had great that the tough games are the ones that we just mentioned Penn State to North western that little three game stretch I think is going to be pretty challenging thing go to and won their\nHeck yeah yeah that that's a really good sign for them because I think they still have a good chance at a at a really good bowl games do you see a gentleman season are you optimistic or eleven is to up to me that's running the table and yet possible but I\nBut that's no mistakes and you know this team usually the fall somewhere spoke at Penn State that you know and that can be favored there that's a tough place to win anyway\nA second only lives there and go ten and two that's you know that's a great season for\nYeah you know and I'm not looking at the Monday and eight and four but I still joke with ... off the air and on year about this and other shows you and I've done is\nEight and four and a nice ball game is ... I'm not saying that they're gonna lose two more more gain but like with you like you said it and I know it's overstating the obvious or you can never be flat in the Big Ten but it's those games like Minnesota\nThat kind of concern me and that concern me but you don't want to be flat against a team you should have no business letting in in the game right and same with India or a Illinois you mentioned in Nebraska you got to put them out early 'cause as long as you look at you like that hang around the get confidence some marketing last minute or so we have\nLeft at this program and then we'll be back again to the next week hock I'd I'm table here he's Mark Emmert\nMark a ... that's your protection and you think they're going to go ten and two is that how do you actually know nine and three nine three okay I'm going to fall somewhere besides tends to be a dissenter and overly optimistic I'll say ten and said I think nine and three as well but I'll go to an end to\nJazz so you know people don't think we are in lockstep on everything share share some arc you're looking for we again twenty four three I said thirty one time but and the last minute we have here this this week's program let's mentioned again that we did it early in the beginning the program that in the middle of program do want to thank our friends Andrew and crew and and I'm\nAshley at coach's corner a stop by especially on a road game if you're not going to kick their home game then obviously go to coaches corner but please do stop by the road games\nYou'll be glad you did everything's therefore you know I'll buy a beer off they're not just because you'll be at the game I mean uh yeah whenever whenever not just for a game anytime yes you'll you'll be I'm going to hold you to does it apply to meet you every time I go out and out of ... and mark and mark and mark\nWell in the last thirty seconds we have here mark thank you very much I Do things for granted do the show with me I I agree with you as funding and and uh it's my pleasure thanks again and mark will be with us each week a right here and I want to thank our producer a big Jon thanks again for your health as well in the car lot for setting this up\nMark pets as well so that's everybody I think we think accept Santa Claus we'll get him towards Christmas so for Mark Emmert I'm Dave O'Hara and ... and more that's all from us thanks to all of you like\nTo play it Hubbard chaos I see an eye hard radio elite elite Hepburn cats icy Iowa city's news sports station available on your Amazon smart speaker tests they Alexa play eight Hepburn ... heart radio\n[noise] Fox Sports trending [noise]\nReport presented vi truth car online car shopping can be confusing not anymore with troop price them shoot car now you can do the exact price you pay for your next car itself is a true card you enjoy more confidence car buying experience\nAnd yeah we can all say we like ... cheese but you know how the league is rightfully turns on it it always does\nEbb and flow when you think things are great and you you hit a couple of hurdles and and for what it's worth you know going into this weekend I think I mean of course we'll get into more of our picks but I think that Kansas City coming off a short week going up against Jacksonville I liked the jags\nEven though I'm not a big bottles fan I like the tax yeah I'm trying to figure out which gene is the team gets hot which ... where I'm looking at this look Kansas City and the rams\n... they're they're right there they're hot right now right\nBut do you come November December there's going to be a team or two that get really hot and I and our ... Super Bowl champion like you could you set your dialed up I mean you're sometimes teams go wider wire well I I wanted that sucked away this week is big\nYeah I I think that I think the ... see your point\nA hot team sort of like we saw last year Kansas City came out the gate and then they then the middle of the road they kind of hit some stumbling blocks box made the the the season a lot more interesting uh there was one point we're both San Diego a Kansas City Missouri and into the chargers the chiefs and the raiders were close to being a top there were just separated by the game\nBefore that she's finally you know took care of business and and and and the other teams didn't\nInstances like that you can probably pick out as I look at it you should have some interesting races\nAnd maybe to look into maybe three divisions\nAnd those those three the visitors I'm looking at most of the are the AFC North\nThe\nNFC North and the NFC South okay\nAnd the reason why I say because I like I'm like you I I I like Atlanta but I Need them to get hot and I just don't know what all the injuries and they had in the in the stumbling blocks they had if they could get hot especially in that division but if as long as it gets hot they can make waves you see what I'm saying they can get one of those ones one of those teams that can that can go on 'cause they got the pieces\nYeah I agree I I look is Lana I think the eagles are team am once they get out then we'll see I've already\nGiven to pretty much the division I think that you know maybe maybe of Minnesota father figure that out that there another team back and get hot that's what I'm Talking about on the north\nYou argue so let me give us so we have our wager Atlanta or many or ... or Minnesota makes spoiled ... so south ... ads Steelers chew desperate scenes\nWhole buccaneers home giants should just say they lose to Pittsburgh\nThey're warning for what they make it Tampa ... cupcakes for three and four at Washington\nDefinitely where the ball at Cleveland winnable home cowboys ... at\nThis age of game at the ravens tough game at Green Bay tough game\nArizona home ... at Carolina at chapel so they they still have some when's the real wall\nYeah they did and that's where I'm looking at their schedule saying that that's a team effort to get hot and maybe make a run\nEnergy out than what they experience and the image just see the overall ability you know if they get in the playoffs as wild card who knows what happens\nYeah yeah All right let's uh let's do chew quick geo ball the is coming

four seven auto\nThe only art part figuring out which way is easier or at our next guest ladies and gentlemen I've known him for a while\nHe's the only guy I think that has more jobs than I Do ah he also now selling a book I Can't wait to hear about it clay Travis so's out kick the coverage here on Fox Sports radio Monday through friday six to nine eastern clay good morning how are you\nI'm doing well how are you guys now I I I'm great but I don't understand how you have the work ethic clay to do radio TV you got the website and now you've written a book like\nI'm not suck it up 'cause we were buddy we we go way back like how do you find time for this when you got a wife and I\nWhat three kids yeah three young boys who are downstairs right now playing or a oh what's the the the the game of ... ... a hundred percent they play Fortnite mad and are there are two favorite things to play in life so uh look I\nI don't know a is an easy answer it's funny I asked one of our buddies loose who's a producer at a at a fast one\nUh I asked ... for his feedback on the the first couple of weeks of the new TV show and he said man I thought you were really good but he's like on Thursday and friday I just thought you worked really really tired and like I don't have a makeup person here obviously I I Do the show from uh from my house that got a camera in my house and I was like do that because I Am really really tired and you know\nUm I I think it just it it's just something where somebody said something I'm a to me a while back and they said you know you can always do a little bit more\nAnd or what I tried to do is balance things I Know we've talked about this quite a bit I spend ... ... what I have found in the ... that I have been doing the TV show is I spend much time on social media now and uh and and\nYou know try to use social media and I had a conversation with Cal heard about this and it was a good one you know at this point I feel like I have five hours of daily television I have Fifteen hours of weekly radio I Do a periscope and Facebook and I write\nMy opinions are well distributed right and at this point what I Need is just to use social media primarily as a megaphone\nNot as a microphone you know and what I mean by that is responding to individual people and reading your mentioned like it can be addictive but it's not necessarily an efficient use of time so that's one place where I've managed to create a little bit of time the biggest issue is just honestly how early my day starts\nAnd how wait it finishes now when it's you know Monday Night football but I Need to watch and talk about our Sunday Night Football I definitely don't root for overtime\n[laughter] we're talking with clay Travis out kicked the coverage host on Fox Sports radio Monday to friday yeah clay I totally agree the days of arguing with avatars are totally over you're\nRight you know your popping you drop a little nuclear bomb on social media and then you get out and let those guys let them go nuts on it uh I Want to quickly\nPivot to your Tennessee Titans a huge huge wins in a row you're a season ticket holder clay I got to say this feels like a dangerous spot for them going on the road to face you know arguably the worst team in the league and we know Josh Allen is kind of a joke at quarterback\nYeah look I mean the line actually has you know sometimes I like to watch the money come in and it makes me feel a little bit better I think the line has moved all the way out to five and a half for six the titans that's a road favored against the bills here is what I Would say about the titans right now\nMight VR able I Would take a bullet for if I was like in the secret service that's how good he has been through four weeks and I have said before and look I might have asked about the teams that I root for\nIn the last Twenty years the only other coach that I felt like that early about wasn't Bruce Pearl a for Tennessee basketball and I still love Bruce Pearl Auburn men's basketball coach now I Would dive in front and have taken a bullet for him because almost immediately you could see him changing the culture and changing the expectations and in week to\nMike variable beat the Houston Texans with ... quarterback with Derrick Henry\nTaking snaps in the wild cat without his top three tackles left tackle in right tackle out and the top the top or a backup was in the hospital\nSo they signed somebody on the practice squad to go up against that Houston Texans defense defensive front that week and they won that game\nAnd when I left the stadium that day I said I don't remember the last time I have seen a better game plan it might not going well they scored on a fake point they manufactured twenty points as best they could it might not have gone perfectly but it was a game plan that you knew had been adjusted on the fly\nTo put them into a position to win a game and it's been so long since I've seen that from an NFL coach for my team\nThat I was all in on it I think there'll be the bills I think there'll be for a new one and start to get a lot of attention because the ravens will be coming to town and then right after that couple of games to pay attention to I think I've got this right\nUh we I Know the next game is in London and I'm taking the boys in my family and ... and we're yeah we're going to London a yeah I'm excited about that even in the middle of football season I didn't know I had the TV show when I when I set up this play out I Love I Love London\nAnd uh I don't know about you but one of the things that I think about a lot now with the kids being young is\nI Want to do things with them while they still like us you know I've got a fifth grader a second grader and a four year old and they love being around mom and dad right now they think we're the greatest thing ever\nWhen you get to that Thirteen fourteen your age range beat and yet seventh eighth grade will be the worst human beings on earth they won't want to be around this at all there'll be Bradley there'll be going through adolescence eventually they'll emerged on the other side like we all do\nBut while they're still falling and yelling and everything else I like to get him out on the road and take trips with them\nWhile though that game in London and then the titans have a week off and then I Believe the next game or to the game after that next one is a Monday Night game against the the the Dallas Cowboys to me that is when the titans are going to kind of sweep onto the national stage\nAnd we'll see whether or not they're ready for their close up whether they are a legitimate contender to win the AFC South\nAnd you know do what they did last year when a playoff game and kind of advance into the playoffs or\nWhether it's still a little bit early and some of the deficiencies on ah on defense maybe we'll start to reveal themselves and uh and we'll see what happens but I look I think ... through four weeks of the season they have looked to every bit of a playoff team that can win a game and the playoffs in the NFL\nAlright clay Travis hosted out kicked the coverage you've got a new book out he is on lock it in on the F ... one daily clay get we get you out of here with the college football to give me a winner of blood bank guaranteed today yeah I'll\nTell you by the way I Want to thank you for coming on the television show for people who haven't watched it you've been phenomenal on it as a weekly gas walk it in for thirty eastern one thirty Pacific set the DVR we got to do a couple of prime time shows on Thursday and friday of this week after major league baseball playoffs\nAre the book is out Republicans buy sneakers too it's a good read I think it's smart read I think people will enjoy it um but uh best when it happened the vein right here for you J Mak a shadow of a doubt\nI did my favorite that so far in college football this season and I am on this burn embarrassing amount of money All right so if I lose a everybody else is losing on this too I Love the under\nAnd offered at Mississippi State right now\nIt's around forty four uh I don't believe either one of these teams can score remotely at all I think it's gonna be a really low scoring game my biggest fear is obviously when you take the under defensive touchdowns or overtime\nI'm a person who just got his own and but I shared it with some ... as well as the organization and everyone else in Boston you guys for having me back I went on riff on uh here next year\nWhat what's the point is that why you another thing that in the pre season now a couple of quick things on it yet Kyrie Irving or maybe it was like four months ago said yeah I'm not signing the extension it would be who've me financially to sign the extension\nUnderstandable we get that so why would I read do this on the cusp of the pre season\nI Want to just to recap I plan on resigning if you'll have me\nPlan on that's not a guarantee we know all sports works things change you know when you go out when you go on social media and then you'll say what Jason you said ... and Jimmy ... there's going to be in play\nYeah that was before Jimmy Butler demanded a trade that's now changed the calculus of this do you see the timeline\nJimmy Butler demands a trade\nA week later Kyrie Irving I plan on resigning in Boston okay let me recap ...\nFour months ago Kyrie Irving well I I Will see what happens I'm going to be a free I'm going to you know opt out as everybody knows that will Jimmy Butler I Want out of here a week goes by cover everything I'm staying in Boston like adding up people read between the lines Jimmy Butler says he wants out\nA week goes by he has an idea of what's going to go down and I can tell you behind the scenes it's looking a lot right now like the clippers right now things change but I Will tell you this when Jimmy Butler's as you go to the clippers Kyrie Irving he ain't going to the clippers\nKyrie Irving has his sights set on Brooklyn or New York but he had planned on talking with Jimmy Butler and I and I would definitely say Brooklyn over New York for sure we all know Kyrie Irving from New Jersey closed with his father Family Guy blah blah blah\nJimmy Butler was thinking New York or Brooklyn now it's looking like Jimmy Butler clippers so as these things go on behind the scenes things change career being well not as attractive if I Can't team up with my buddy I going to Brooklyn solo\nAnd oh yeah yeah the Celtics have one of the best teams in the leak it'll be a major upset at the Celtics don't make the final\nI think the Celtics could push the warriors they got a great coach they got a great defensive team I think the Celtics or Seventy when ... you don't leave a Seventy when team yes let the record show Kyrie Irving did leave liberal on okay\nHe did leave Lubrano that remember have you ever won the title than what changed Kevin Durant goes to the ... their orderly dominant\nThey smoke Kyrie in the Bronx cats I received oh wait a second\nUh LeBron's going to leave next summer will get me the hell out of here so I'm just telling you these things are constantly fluid I Know that you you guys don't want to hear that because weight but you said this things change if you're gonna be hung up on what I said six months ago about a prediction\nLike be consistent\nI told you guys get on board to ... train you said not the west and stuff you didn't want to get on board okay well things have changed their Marlboros and gets traded or to the spurs ... letter does you know to Toronto it the NBA is just so crazy and hectic I'm just going to say that\nIf the Celtics don't get out of the east I think ... but I Do think they get out of the east and I think the odds are Kyrie Irving probably states are coming up next year on the big lead Fox Sports radio\nHost it I Know he's only a rookie but did you hear Baker may feel take a shot at Hugh Jackson oh

J. Reddick may twenty three million dollars playing in the NBA last year he's made over Seventy five million in his career\nOn the court I'm sure he made a lot of money off the court he's got millions of fans worldwide he's the leading social media because it's bad news literally social media is messing with our brains to the point where\nIt's giving you that doping mean hit and again I Can't recommend this story enough ... through social media and the NBA it gets into why social media is messing with our heads instinctively wherever you are in your house you're going to hear your phone paying\nAnd you've got to go check it because you've got an update\nWhile I'm telling you the next time you hear your phone paying leave it alone don't check and see how long you can go without checking it it's probably not an earth shattering text from somebody it's an a notification by the way you should have turned off all notifications folks come on wake up\nBut all of this ties back in to Baker Mayfield because as I said when the first reaction that he had after\nThe jets browse game was I got to get on my phone and again maybe he was getting things maybe he was getting face time requests but he's a guy who's talked about social media at length and how he's obsessed with it and he uses it as a tool to fire back at his critics\nFolks avoid it if you can\nStay off social media do less of it focused on the little things in life and maybe Baker may feel to talking about his team not doing the little things in life when he said again he said this Wednesday and like none of the shows talked about it I Know there's baseball post season\nAnd you got the Conor McGregor fight and you got a good\nCollege football schedule this week there's a lot of really interesting stuff happening and I think a lot of people missed this go read that story on social media and then tied into Baker may feel and tie it into the little things at all weaves together folks\nThat is what it does\nReally interesting stuff I'm just saying the little things in life or to read recap Iowa Sam's leaving the studio here he worked the overnight shift\nI recommend that he'd go get some flowers

our next guest ah he's right to bleacher report covers college football as well as anybody out there Adam Kramer joined just show Adam good morning how are you\nA good morning man and I'm I'm On that youth sports as well I just got back from swimming lessons\nSo I can I can I can relate a rare weekend\nAt home with his ex All right now I'm with you yeah you've got you've got to love to use sports I mean it builds character right I mean you know you're gambling on your phone and then you're looking up and your kids around the corner goal so yeah\nExactly yeah there's nothing that a pool Ron at about eight am Mm it's your hard yeah it's yeah so I'm ready man I'm ready to get going\nYou know who else is ready Adam is of course Nick Saban in Alabama I just want to talk quickly their games have actually been very boring\nOutside of the first you know first half maybe the first uh you know sixteen to twenty minutes when and then they pulled to uh I got to just ask like are you enjoying watching this Alabama team or is it just so quick when they pull the starters and bringing the backups that it's not that enjoyable this Alabama juggernaut\nYeah you gotta catch them early or otherwise you're gonna miss it and and I think that will hopefully change I mean you've got some more meaningful games coming up and look there are there are thirty plus point favorites\nIn conference play a so it it's hard to get too excited right now I'm watching too it's been enjoyable like even if you don't catch him in that first second quarter while you can yeah last week eight for eight\nOr over a hundred yards to touchdown and then go have a seat um but the third but there is like a different vibe to this you know question like if you have no stake in this game and no money on them you know ... last week or forty forty nine and a half when favorites unless you're invested on one on both sides of the other the the last three quarters have been\nYeah just kind of monotonous a drug you know what I mean you know what you're getting with his team right now and we are kind of numb to Alabama\nBut this is not your typical\nThirty one and vice grip Alabama team this is like the most explosive wide receivers they've ever had it's clearly the best quarterback they've had in a long long time maybe ever and so I think we're trying to figure out what it will be my hope is though see your point to it will throw a path for fourth\nQuarter at some point this and I I don't see it happening talking with Adam Kramer a bleacher report Adam I Do want to ask\nDo you think it hurts college football that Alabama is so good and so far ahead of everybody 'cause like let's say people are excited about Notre Dame maybe go into the playoffs in Georgia looked good again and Oklahoma looks pretty good army scare aside\nI does it hurt or help that Alabama is so much better than everyone else\nI think I think it's a great question I think Alabama existing and being kind of like the the empire of that people either are like if you're in Alabama or you root for the team or you load if you're the vast majority of other people um I think that's a good thing to have\nIn general though like your list or your batch of teams that you think are truly playoff worthy of this year are really small like it's it's really condense\nTo me and I think that's concerning\nIs that how long can you just sit and have like just turn over the same teams year after year and look at the recruiting by the way I look at the white Georgia has pulled employers look at Oakland's pulled inquires looking at Ohio State will continue to do with urban Meyer is the coach like\nThat part isn't going to change so I Do worry that the lack of parity in the sport is going to hurt college football that being said I Want to go back a few years ago I went to Iowa Iowa almost me\nIt's weird Iowa with like a gold mine stop it gives Michigan State from making the college football playoff in the response from people wasn't like oh this is great\nThis is a Cinderella people are like angry about it ... it really is it's a weird dynamic in college football but I Do think the lack of parity right now is is something that yeah overall at the national vision of the sport I'm a little bit worried about\nA talk with Adam Kramer of bleach report Adam I Want to go to Jim ... who ah listen last week there was some tense moments against a north western and you know a horrible is in the ... the guy to beat up on social media because he's he's run his mouth for a couple of years of Michigan\nYou know your thoughts on on where this season goes if Michigan slips up somewhere along the way or does it when the Big Ten or go to the playoffs do you think horrible returns because we know historically three or four years and he kinda balances\nYeah the sense that I get is that he is I don't know happy as a word you can use with ... and being where he is like more content than usual and I\nI I don't know if that will hold true or not if he wants to be back in the NFL and I think ultimately he he'll get their ... he'll have opportunities to do that regardless of how things go at Michigan I'm ... I think a lot really does boil down to what you said if they are able to win the vast majority of their games\nAnd beat Michigan State and say lose to Ohio State maybe not when the Big Ten but finished the year with two losses I think we'd look at that as a success um it's easy to become paralyzed by these results like you you have to win that game that that's really the big hindrance they're building a great program they're recruiting well to develop ... like\nThe dynamic of the DNA of Michigan footballs in such a better place than it where it was and yet you you have to have the results\nTo do that so yeah if you go if they play Ohio State\nAnd they get clobbered again and I don't think they will but if they get clobbered again you wonder at some point to just say enough is enough I don't think we're there yet I still kind of like this team probably more than most I think he's doing a decent job but yeah you got to beat Michigan State this year in the overall off they certainly would help as well\nAll right Adam let me get you out of here on this one uh Oklahoma Texas they a nice game today we've seen ... Murray put a video game numbers for the sooner I Do want to ask\nLincoln Riley their head coach when we've seen the NFL going toward a young girl offensive minded guys like uh McVeigh like in a ... do you think Lincoln Riley is going to be maybe the most coveted coach in the NFL come uh come late December or early January\nAnd rivers will be like good and then throw really untimely packs and then some people will say well Aaron Rodgers has done more with less he as there is no doubt Aaron Rodgers has an all time great\nI think Andrew Luck when they get in that conversation he's only twenty nine years old so if you look at the quarterbacks that today that are playing longer you know they're not out of the league it's thirty three thirty for like other players are older quarterbacks as long as he can stay healthy you should have another nine years\nBrady and big better going to be gone folks Tom Brady got one or two years left Big Bend one or two years\n\nAndrew Luck gonna be right there my fear is that he becomes Dan Marino\nAnd I know that you hear that you'll be like well how is that a fear Dan readers in the hall of fame yeah Dan Marino didn't win the super bowl then Reno's not perceived as in the same stratosphere as Montana\nElway\nAlways got to Superbowl Montana's got for Nick is it three or four four he's got four so those guys automatically you would've Super Bowl you're better\nI don't want Andrew looked to be Jim Kelly hall of famer great quarterback but he kind of what a win three industry ... for yeah owned for the super bowl for Jim Kelly I don't want him to be that because\nI I guess I just feel like he's much better than he he's I yes I Believe\nAndrew Luck will ultimately be better than Dan Marino\nMean you know Dan Marino playoff record in his career was something like eight and ten\nAnd I don't want to hear Denver you know didn't have\nAny talent around to be the Marx Brothers Clinton and duper they're very good at a hall of fame coaching ... what is Andrew Luck at\nSeriously\nWhat is Andrew Luck at good tell me who he's had the great on a steep can you name one all pro defender they got a rookie leading them and tackles insect he missed the patriots game\nLike this idea that Andrew Luck and do it by ... nobody can do it by themselves nobody it's impossible and look still buy and sell Scott them to an agency championship game\nI mean it's just\nCrazy the narratives the build up there and I you know listen I'm not going to bash one of my guys you're Fox Sports radio host came on I was just slamming Andrew Luck with all this\nNonsense unlike guide you gotta be kidding me here's a stat that's kind of mind blowing the Colts\nAllowed thirty\nEight points or more for the third team time during an Andrew Luck start that was Thursday night\nSo he and his career in sixteen percent of his games Thirteen\nOut of six out of eighty one Andrew Luck defense has a loud thirty eight or more point you're not going to win games when that's happening\nSixteen percent of Andrew Luck schemes Drew Brees nine percent\nAaron Rodgers seven percent Peyton Manning six percent big Ben four percent Tom Brady three percent a Andrew Luck not going to win squat until it gets a decent amount to recap that career starts where your team allows thirty eight or more points\nAndrew Luck sixteen percent Drew Brees nine Aaron Rodgers seven painting six Big Bend for Brady three\nAngela not or win games if you hear guys coming out of your bashing Andrew Luck just for like that that thirty eight or more points as deep as you just opening

T. as well like what what are the golfers do that to get this when how do they how do they pull this one off well they\nNeed some things to fall there way I think straight up if each team would play their game I think there's a reason I was a seven point favorites so they're gonna you know need\nTo to ah create something whether that a return upon block upon um you know hope that uh Iowa may not be on it today and quite honestly in a couple of those games where I where Minnesota beat Iowa here in those three times or the guys weren't necessarily they were favorites those days and they weren't on their game so you've got to hope for something like that\nWhole your team has recovered from what was a a bigger loss than what I think they thought they did they had you know I think they felt they could win that game in Maryland\nAnd uh ended up they were not in the game almost from the get go was fourteen nothing after two possessions and and the gophers really struggled most of the day\nSo they're going to need people to step up and and we'll see what the what the situation is with the with trying to replace Antwon Winfield junior but there undoubtedly going to need a little help somehow um and and that's the thing I Would does it very often beat itself\nUm and and you know my guess is that the the the uh you know the coaching staff or Minnesota is probably hoping hey I Would does play a lot of close game so let's keep it close let's get to the fourth quarter and maybe about a ball in the air and you you you intercept a ball and plus territory and can punch went in and when the football games\nHere's my last question for him like a we were told that Kirk parents with his shirt Floyd he wouldn't wind up as pork chops it goes back to Iowa City can you confirm or deny that VJ black is a reassuring them the same thing\nYeah I mean that that you know the golfers really and it's been four years that the the Iowa ... won the last three so I'm In in Minnesota struggled and the two big rivals they have with Wisconsin in Iowa so Ah yes just to say that uh now I guess maybe they would make them pork chops because I can tell you folks are starving\nFor some success I\nI don't think any promises can be made now you're known for the juicy Lucy's up they're not my friend alright there's also a dolphin did take part in a big pork chop employees on her lap\nAnd I get here and there was well he's just not their style and so now turned out I offered cooker went over than a to ask Minnesota you know he was going to step up to play down well we want you to come one more camp oh chained so he did he went to the camp or by all accounts did really really well\nAnd afterwards okay you know you guys going to step up to ... well maybe we'd like to see you again we want you to purify yourself\nIn the waters of lake Minnetonka [laughter] number that from ... in ... alone yeah and then we [laughter]\nWay find you a wind sparrow and find the weight of that and all that stuff\nRight so the coach into Monica what good well we'll we'll consider that um he wasn't really quiet about saying that Iowa was but the meeting recruiter a took another visit to Iowa City committed to coach drinks and I guess but it sort of tried to commit later in his credit he said hey you guys had your chance to\nGet around all day long side my future based on your whack a commitment what's that will collect through the future so\nI certainly doing great things have been given an opportunity to pick six against a start the game against Ohio State a year ago and now we'll start at least for the first time in the backfield in front of his home town Minnesota gold and go for his own their home field at TC is thank stadium\nSucked in prediction\nSpecific Taylor wise

win the west but there's just no new world was me world not if you opt for winning over whining which is why the hawks are geared up\nFor getting their first road when the season today and keeping a hold of served bacon better known as Floyd of Rosedale and purely from a ... point of view why wouldn't Floyd want to stay in the Hawkeye State\nNot counting Floyd himself at any one time this is real there are approximately twenty million hogs being raised in Iowa in Iowa producers market approximately fifty million hogs a year so\nIt's obvious that deployed wants to hang with his poor piece he wants to do it right here in the state that produces nearly one third of the nation's pork\nOur special guest today knows exactly what it feels like the lip Floyd but before we welcome in former hawk met Vandenberg let's hear from the man looking out over ... stadium in Minneapolis the voice of the hawks Gary Dolphin and dolf I have it on good authority you had a huge pork chop sandwich last night

recruiting and so you can see from year one year to\nA ... an increase in the level of talent on the roster now it's young talent and so you have to live with some mistakes\nThe quarterback is a true freshman Zack ... dead um had a pretty good start in the non conference and then on his first row start wasn't so good a plane or a higher level of competition and I think\nYou know even if you're a senior and you know sometimes that can happen when when you're a freshman you're gonna have to live with some mistakes and so I still think that um you know the goal for team is a is a few years away from where they they want to be I mean like I said you know obviously he wants to compete for the west division and\nGet to Indianapolis and you know if if you're talking about that kind of stuff then you can be you know a national uh you know figure in the national chase maybe at some point not every year I don't think that's realistic but on occasion\nI'm white Kirk has done like Wisconsin and this west division where have you um you know if you're good in that year then you've got a chance to make some noise on a national level and I think like to let let's say today the golfers or seven point underdog they need some stuff to go their way or if they're going to pull the upset\nBut I think go for fans can at least see the talent levels upgraded he's got another good recruiting class already set to sign in December\nAnd then as that continues I think the goal will be hey when I ever comes to town if you're a player game you can win it it's not quite there yet will it happen I don't know but I think there is some hope there you can say I mean\nYou watch the freshman today and you'll see and make a mistake or two but then you'll watch this ... Bateman for example he'll make a catch ... he'll say yeah that kid is going to be all Big Ten someday\nYou're talking about the talented aware is most of it well\nThey knew they needed to get better on the offensive line and so they're red shirt and some guys that are that I think gives them ... you know and the Big Ten particularly in this division when he got Iowa Wisconsin if you can block you're not going to win and so\nUm they have some guys that there are the you know kind of bringing along there but the skill spots they need play makers um and and so they have gotten those unfortunately they're best play maker on defense got injured he's out for the season\nAntwon Winfield junior he was just a sophomore of course that name familiar for Vikings fans listening down in Iowa do recognize his dad ... field senior one of the great tackling quarterbacks ever\nUm and this kid was smart you could tell he was around the game I'm In three weeks of football this year he was Big Ten defensive player of the week one week big tent special teams player of the week another\nUm as sealed the game here against Fresno state which is unbelievable interception and now he's out a young guys out now younger people have to fill in for him but plain making I think ... that's one of the things when like goes out and watch as he wants to see guys at when\nA for sure when they're on off into the ball's in their hand they can they can make positive things happen\nWe'll have more with my career him on the roundtable segment here on the pregame show more Hawkeye football from their field coming up\nDon't miss meat Fridays with the damn Patrick show on K ex icy or done in Iowa joins his son his me friday Hi Don when you have for me\nI dance thanks for taking my call the truck driver running across the country and I just thought I Would regalia with my uh Arnie version of friday\nGive me a little horn here if you can on your ah your rig\n\nOh I like it but I dont you you love me real T shirt down at the place to go back at the back row\n[laughter] have you done been done to drive and his truck cross country and just took time out to do a mean friday and not only that law Arnie or yeah I'd want to end it live and yeah it's just going to be amazed at the Grammys so mean there's no lip sync an air there is no tracking no way\nThen Patrick weekdays nine to noon on eight hundred K. acts dicey and heart radio station\nThat go family cared dot com will call a three three four six seven eight to five night for Medicaid plans from after my health\nSo this group and able to make some strides obviously looking for more consistency especially when you get into the conference portion of the season\nYet their big thing last year and now I'm unfortunately for them this year the golfers when they stopped the run they win games and when they don't um and I mean that's not an uncommon formula but a year ago they were five and so\nYou know I'm I'm looking forward to both teams I'm you know we're looking for our first went in the west so that's that's going to be important part of this Minnesota's undefeated at home this year so far so there's\nThere's a lot to play for both teams are three in one eye it's early enough in the season that uh the seasons have not yet been defined for either of us so this is just as critical Ed Ed's point about\nComing off the loss and then what do you do in a by week and a each time we have that by week you know cooking I sit down and I I listen to what their plan is you know you arrest them guys you you work on some things you you're right the coaches or grinding on\nA you know tweaking things making things better but I think the coaches feel very good about the way the players handled it from a majority standpoint\nOr even though they did get a little time off when they were here and when they came back they were sharp and that the point is it this time just get a little bit better every week and we'll see if the if that paid off\nAnd I know you were a working harder than ever over the by week because basketball wrestling a lot of the indoor sports either have started or we'll be right around the corner and that's\nSomething I guess today is whether feels more like the winter sports like a brand and Lisa in Tom's teams and all of our winter sports are are underway swimming is is under way so I think we have a we have friends a media day on Monday so\nHere we go here we go and this is the time of year where the ball sports are still going ah you know big win for um for soccer they beat uh Nebraska Nebraska the other night a rank Nebraska and\nUh we're we're having a great season if field hockey so the false sports volleyball beat Nebraska in Nebraska first time since Nineteen eighty I Want to say Nineteen eighty seven or didn't beat him but one at one I Want to gain game off into a things are going really well let's see if we can keep it going today\nLet's see if we can make this a great memory maker a today are like in two thousand two when the hawks clinched the Big Ten championship here at the at the dome and that is our historical\nMoment presented by riverside casino\nAnd golf resort of the hawks would go undefeated for the first time in in a long time completed undefeated Big Ten championship run and then head off to the Orange Bowl a uh a few days after that but uh

take for granted in fact I was sixteen years ago about how you guys to still be the longevity and the and the great uh calls you've made over the years I I Know our fans appreciate it but I Hope they

fifty eight days before they play southern Cal in the Orange Bowl that's just the way like ah this year everybody's at home the whole month of September and now on the road for for the next five and a but we we love going to other venues around the league to do\nThat you know and and I know we're trying to move on but one of the things you think about\nBecause we had so many games in September they were all at home this is the ... first road trip for several of our players and so good point uh you know going through that it's the first time it's new and those are all the things maybe you don't think about it as a fan but you know we have to get wrinkled out I feel great about how they've handled it so far and let's see what they do on the field\nOf great seniors always All right let's go

where the rub Brooks and Dr Brian ...\nStereotyped you very much and we are on the Hawkeye sideline about the twenty five yard line with Dr Brian ... fan to talking about a stinger is this afternoon and any time you see\nA player come off of that arm is kind of dangling down toward his feet to\nYou never know exactly what it is but certainly that is a a pretty good indication that that's what they call a stinger doctorate is you have a player come off like that or what\nKind of the process you go through to figure out if he can come back and play\nSooner rather than later well these are a kind of a stretch injury opt in there and that gets tilted to the side and and often they either lead with their shoulder had kind of a significant blow to the top of their shoulder to get a bit of a stretch and are there like ... so\nOur biggest concern is one that has to be comfortable because this is usually pretty painful immediately after it happened but most importantly for us as we've they need to have their strength so uh\nWe're very quick to assess their strength and until they have their normal strength back we're probably going to restrict their play [noise]\nAs I've seen it over here on the sideline a lotta time we'll try to raise their arms off to the side that with some resistance right so it you know it's a pretty ...\nThese guys are very strong individuals so it's it's a pretty a significant strength test and\nAnd uh if they do get their strength back will let them go back there are things we can put around their color and their helmet to try to help the positioning of their head and neck to avoid having over currents that if they've had a couple of them were going to be very slow to let them go back and they are things that can recur and and kind of drag on through the season [noise]\nAll right a beautiful day for football let's go get them ...\nDr Bryan off right here on the University of Iowa sports medicine injury update dolphin ... says most Hawkeye fans know linebacker nickname and is not going to play today he is a\nWeek to week with a leg injury and that means Barrington wait we'll start at that linebacker position Christian\nWelsh will back him up and also um some changes in the defense of backfield more specifically the two corners for the guys today a defensive\nIn corner I'm Matt Higgins who left Wisconsin game with an injury and the second half of them\nDid not return that ballgame Julius branch replaced him and that is the indication that will happen today and then also I'm\nMichael OJ moody up is a not a hundred percent but is available today but she'll look for a freshman Riley moss from ... centennial to get his first career start in his true freshman campaign and he of course it wasn't the for a hundred and ten meter\nHigh hurdles this past year and then also is they drink relays chap as well so he's got a tremendous speed and as we've talked about throughout the pregame show about Minnesota missing a couple of there are a big time players are running back Rodney Smith is out for the season played in just two games this year\nWas averaging six point two yards for Kerry\nAnd then also had nine hundred and Seventy seven yards a season to go that's a big blow for the gophers and normally would go to a Shannon Brooks but he was injured back in February with a a knee injury and has not played the season will be in uniform today but will not play the hope for him is to be able to play maybe in those last four games of the season\nAnd then also come back and play next year and then of course Antonio Winfield uh the safety special teams specialist out with a a a pretty severe foot injury that happened last week he played in four games the seventeenth tackles very dangerous on special teams\nAveraging over thirty six yards her ... return and also took one back so a couple of up big time performers are not playing today for Minnesota\nYeah good points a robbery or we'll give you an Iowa injury updates further than beyond your report because I Know a ... year down there we're up here we just got some light information that\nAre definitely a a Julius branches starting in place of math Hankins who's out within our told that a Hankins is crushed\nAnd would be available but hasn't practice much this week Riley moss will start at the other corner and Josh Turner\nA red shirt freshman is available and that secondary as well the good news is ... hooker are healthy and good to go they'll solidify that back into you mentioned Antonio Winfield the third or their best defensive player\nOr he had a strip fumble recoveries had a a an interception deepened that Fresno state game that\nPreserve that victory or this could just cannot stay healthy I mean last year he only played in four games before a season ending injury and the red shirted used as Richard uh now he uh stretches a leg up to the point that it needs surgery and a foot or in the Marilyn game and has done for the year and\nI Hope you get a medical Richard so he could conceivably come back next year third year in the program as a red shirt freshman year and a and you know electric kids would just say you know what I I just what I just wasn't meant to play football or not this kid I mean he's something else in his dad Antonio Winfield was an all American\nIn the secondary at Ohio State like fourteen

back dead for his keys to today's game the first the first one on the road of any kind of let alone big jet\nWell and that's a that's a learning process for 'em all your young players when you had for at home now you've got a pack your stuff or get on a plane come up here stay on in a hotel which had a lot of business in it last night you know a lot of distractions in the Hilton downtown so you always worry about\nA lot of these are young players probably never taken a road trip for him so at any level or the and now you're going to do it and play a big game now one of the things we're going to see today as some freshmen action\nOn the part of the guys and on the part of Minnesota they they start freshman quarterback jak or next did a who's only averaging a hundred and eighty seven yards per game passing so we're gonna start today to freshmen corners\nJulius branch through six too and he's from Indianapolis and Riley mosses six foot one eighty five ... so obviously during the by week they had a chance but I Know there's there's been some injuries at the corner and there's been I think\nUh some disappointment and some of the play so it's a chance for these guys to ah start today and also another newcomer Barrington weighed will start on the outside linebacker per nickname men who had an injury and it's going to be a real challenge for Barrington he's a big guy\nI'm strong guy but he's going to after court cover that slot receiver\nAnd that means you have to do a lot of running today so coaches Barry feels very good about him\nThe wide receivers that Minnesota are pretty darn good the freshman shout Bateman these numbers Thirteen and he's got all the time and he's a porn star\nAnd he's going to be a good one who still just press room but Tyler Johnson who's a junior a is really an accomplished wide receiver so are your own corners are going to be tested right away they only good bird Israel freshman quarterback throwing up to now when you flip it over and the other side\nWhere are all finished versus ... look at the last game Maryland Rand nibble thirty seven times three hundred and Fifteen yards they only through fourteen passes I'm\nThat game you know that's kind of this kind of game I think that skirt first dreams of do under the obvious thing is to be fifty fifty ripped passing and receiving\nTheir line backers are passing and running in their line backers are probably the best part of their football team and we're gonna have to block them\nTo run the ball but I think when you take advantage of their secondary they got beat up young secondary so I expect to see a good mixture of a running past\nAnd the best way to help out those youngsters win the Iowa secondary as for the defense of lie to keep doing what it's been doing\nWell I don't want to be standing in the pocket and when you were just um you know interviewing a\nMinnesota coast talking about his quarterback them somewhat restricted to run out of the pocket who don't you think that the defense is Lynette ... looking at that on film no\nQuestion and a two weeks ago at Marilyn Marilyn ran the ball\nA big time cashing a\nMinnesota defense up the middle which we haven't we haven't seen that done to a Minnesota defense in a couple of years but the point is that the ... with ... Kelly healthy should be able to get something going on the run game ... was fourteen of thirty two\nFor a hundred and sixty nine yards and two interceptions at Maryland and so the guy's gotta feel they can win the turnover\nBut yeah I did I\nAnd I think took this Hawkeye team really played well against Wisconsin a couple of turnovers mistakes costs just a football game and so this is a good Hawkeye football team\nLet's go down to the others are eddies can use to the game by the way each and every game day last shut down to the field Rob Brooks has our fuel condition update what's the
