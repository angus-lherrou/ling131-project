not only that how petty you wanted to\nBe all I was so torn I just didn't know I didn't know what to do is just petty and then Memphis good lord it's nice that they play in a garbage conference because even I Know if you don't have any time outs and you're almost in field goal range\nIf you throw the ball and don't get a first down you better get out of bounds or that is the ball game and that's exactly what happened with Memphis completing a past no time out three two one ball game UCF wins\nGoodness I got this big man goodness my phone is your quick to say that they don't play any body ranked but they they shout the year by in Cincinnati who six you know oh\nWell you want to call and then South Florida\nOh who's\nAlso six lookout so\nWhat's what's their name the bowls look\nOut

they didn't play any buddy of great note and it's the same thing when it comes to UCS yeah UCF has won a bunch\nOf games in a row and they want a bunch of games in a row against the budget non ranked teams\nThat aren't any good for the most part\nSo if you think that just because they've won all those games in a row that they bought long and ... among the best in the country and they should be a

we're okay I got a question for you though\nFor these people like you the blooming hearts of America for the UCF nights we Labor Day ranked higher and here's the thing how come I don't hear\nNice thing about the undefeated teams ranked lower than UC\nHow come I don't hear anything about Colorado they've got a game at USC tonight how come I don't hear anything about in the state they're undefeated\nYou gotta buy week there at Clemson next week how 'bout South Florida same conference they're undefeated rank twenty third right now\nThe only difference is you see I've had the history of being undefeated\nAll last year the only undefeated team in college football do you understand that so I'm not bashing on those I'm saying hey when do you start recognizing the team that has been lost in two years\nRight in there right number ten and they will move up because some teams lost in the top ten so they will move up and if they went out and other teams falter and the top ten we may be sitting here\nLike oh you may be going crazy like autism absurd\nDo you think that UCF is better than Washington Washington number seven they lost at Oregon mhm you didn't use the U.S better than Washington\nI don't know to tell you the truth I really don't know but what do you think\nI don't know I thought Notre Dame was much better than it until they played the game today mhm do you want to you you get that right like so it's easy for us to say oh well this team is better than that gene Boise State or Oklahoma was better than Boise State when we saw them in the ... the fiesta bowl\nRemember that like so you can't do that it's one game is one game so of UCF works at play Washington I Can't see your or a hundred percent say they're better than watching it's one team that I

insurance I always love and papa bear fits in some equipment night the program\nAnd great rejoined music okay\nOkay so aid from I mean there's no way we disagree about this next story along at all at right now to Karen seat\n[laughter] I like your skeptical um\nI'd make a joke and throwing UCF but I don't even want to do that I'm Colin Kaepernick\nShe was initially not involved in a photo gallery on the San Francisco forty niners website they were putting this gallery together\nAs far as the history between the niners and the Green Bay Packers because that's the match up this weekend right right so do you plan on Monday Night football the forty niners posted dozens of photos on their website of past games against the Packers\nKnow Colin Kaepernick and they've apologize or like\nOur bad sorry about that now to throw it out there\nThere was a photo gallery this is the first one to run this year there were pictures in seven galleries that were posted last year and capital appeared in every single one on the teams website\nSo there's that backdrop but this can't happen\nYou look at Capra Nikki rush for a hundred and eighty one yard in a playoff win against the Packers sort of memorable it was an NFL record and the very next year he led a game winning drive in another playoff win against the Packers\nAnd it's one of these where you have to double triple quadruple check that it doesn't happen because of how it\nLooks it looks like it's gotta be intentional there's no way you could just coincidentally forget to add Colin Kaepernick but\nI Can't say that it's intentional because you would have to be orderly just plain dead really have no foresight whatsoever\nIf you fail to see what would happen next if you intentionally did something like that and it wouldn't make any sense because they back to Capitol Nick\nAnd his anthem protests back when he was what the niners and they've donated donated a million dollars they matched his million dollars as well so I think it's just a mistake but it's a mistake that just cannot happen because our law it's not a\nMistake I bet you I mean when you're going over the pictures are you going to select\nBased on performances in those games\nHow do you like to eat right I ... I mean you have the the ... the\nThe pictures throws your I Would like being the pictures yeah you have to not let them on purpose because they're they're right the information is there so\nLike most brainstorming here right who had a great performance again or is there really are member a geo with the catch against the Packers joke that uh what else comes to mind is how do you not think of Colin Kaepernick\nWas bogus it is disrespectful because they act like he murdered someone right\nThing to me is that's why I don't think it's an automatic is how would you not know this was going to be a huge deal how would you not know that you would have to apologize are bad\nMost people in those positions can read the rural and that's the problem why do you think we have soul many apologies\nRight how many are already been we have so many missteps from fortune five hundred companies to team right the people making decisions can't read the rules I\nRemember when the owner of the Miami Dolphins came out and said if players taking me that they will be fine and suspended right\nAnd then three days later you know three days\nLater right read the room eighty five percent of your players are African American right and you're going to make a statement like that\nI guess you could also say similar to the the football video game I think it was a maddening\nGame that same thing same exact

that's seven GP Daniels Fifteen to twenty six for two hundred and fifty five yards passing\nI just don't think the patch homes that I've seen the last two or three weeks is the same guy that I saw the first couple of weeks he still phenomenal but if I get Bill bell checked with a couple of extra days I like my chances\nI I I kind of agree with that he has not been the same patch bombs as we saw the first four weeks of the season so\nUm I I Will agree with you on that you remember the last time the chiefs one five you know they did it three different times all three times it was the first round how many times his team was the first round at home or before they get over the hump I if I'm at she spent I'm told it's like they're the the the the ... the cubs fans of football's what's going on here\nYeah and that's another thing too is that\nI I I Love what Patrick homes do and I hope it doesn't sound like I I think he's awesome he's fun I think he's going to continue to be great and I think you have a really you know offensive mind like Andy Reid with maybe the most physically gifted quarterback in the NFL now not the best quarterback and say that but most physically gifted quarterback\nIt's going to be fun but I feel like we also do this with the chiefs every single year\nThey won that Fox borough last year to open the seat and everyone gets excited they beat the eagles early in the season everyone gets excited right and they stumbled down the stretch I just feel like we see this with the chiefs every single year\nOh well just asked chief ... there'll be the first to tell you they can't lose this year in the first round they just can't do it well they all have a bi weekly altered yeah if they lose their second game at home no really go ballistic in Kansas City no lose their marbles or if that happens\nAnd I was going to say to the thing with the chief says well I mean you start to look at their schedule I mean it is a very manageable schedule going forward they obviously of course uh you know have a game left with the chargers but two games left with the raiders um Denver is not very good they'll get Denver at home\nThey they should have a by there there is no she's not look they do have some tough games they do play the rams which I think it'd be a really really fun game um but\nThere is no excuse for them to not get that by and that when the games are supposed to I Want I guess the point I'm trying to make I Want to see them tomorrow night Sunday night against the patriots I Want to see him and five six seven weeks when people have more film on them to see if they can kind of keep up the pace it there\nIf you were going to do your top five NFL teams right now I'm In what order would it be would it be Kansas City obviously number one I'm I'm guessing ... or ran against the city one to um what would you have after that\nPut me on the spot\nWell I mean I mean you got the same store for and won so you might have done as your number three team or my point is this let's say you have the patriots had four number five what say number five will make it easy [noise] um this game's pretty much a pickup nor reason the pages are three that point favorites\nIs because they're pointing at home Soviet officials tell you those really on a neutral field not much difference between one and number five or number one two three four and five is that what the NFL's total sailing or what\nArnie come on man this is you're making my point for me about why the patriots are going to win this game is that if they\nDidn't think it was so that close at top with the Pittsburgh the New Orleans or the patriots the Kansas city's um I I think there's a little bit more the rams I think there's more separation between the rams the Kansas City than the rest of the pack the then we're giving them credit for\nI Do agree right now today the second there is let me ask you where would you have the bears in the mix three wouldn't\nHave been my top five but there wouldn't be that far behind probably like number seven or number eight I think the festival either one of the best in the NFL I don't trust or a fence on the what six touchdowns or whatever ... through and that's one of the news had in his life [laughter]\nLet's see um lets them do three or more touch on on a couple of other occasions\nA curious to see how this dolphin bears game is going to go\nWell and I was going to say though but there are three in one and the one last was that melt down against that hackers yeah so I don't know just when he started asking who my top five wasn't I'm starting to look at the win loss record I think I'd have them somewhere\nI think that the third best a plus plus differential or any other ... I'll tell you for taking that what it's worth considering they don't have much of an office was I don't think they they have much of an awful thing will do will come back let's look at the rest of the week six of the NFL will get to that coming up next Aaron tours already Spanier here on Fox Sports or radio [noise]\nCollege football\nHis way in the end of\nWhen it comes to the LA football coverage

what happens and that ball game tomorrow\nArnie or boss can you get that patriots game on instead of the red Sox tomorrow you'll have to write\n'em well by the way a tell the people because uh I I we

because the thing is it's the play offs and the thing is in Boston baseball is\nAt play off the patriarch of all players are king in that town outside the Celtic holiday layoffs know little little up to ... hill\nBrady and bell a check or you know went on this historic run it was it was a Red Sox town like like eat sleep and\n... I was just you know that the paint on like the woman we lived through the you know the patrons almost had to leave town and go to like get or something but I was never the fans I was there\nOr they were going to build a stadium Robert Craft use and abuse my hometown bullied and hurt by the way you live\nIn the ... studio easy to say fifty percent or more a car insurance was Geico I just go to guy go dot com or give them a call one eight hundred nine four seven auto and the hard part figuring out which way is easier yeah tourism he threatened among the kid that\nYou know fans here in the Boston area on never forget it no I remember very vividly and um they were going to build a dome stadium in Hartford and homes that they were\nHanging haired dollars I wasn't even a taxpayer I was going to crack open the piggy bank because I was like nine years old when this happened\nI you you mentioned the Chicago Bears the go down the road to ... play the dolphins will say what you want to get Saddam is I think there's one thing we agree with the or they've lost two other oh should have won the Cincinnati game\nUm look if there's such thing as a must win game when your team's above five hundred it's for the Miami Dolphins if you want to win this division if you really want to beat the patients who are already was due but you'll have ... later on in the season it starts by beating a team like the Chicago Bears that are coming into town\nThis is a game where it's a tiny oh has to step up he's looks so mediocre ... plus he had a hundred yards passing against the patriots I've very disappointed though is that a lot of turnovers he's got to do a little bit more than ...\nRemember that stat like three weeks ago they're like yeah the dolphins are fourteen and three in the hills all these ...\nHe was eleven and one in the last twelve starts the the most wins in twelve twelve starts but that went back before the injury\nIt went back before the injury and it was a weirdly skewed because that was the year that they had a last place schedule and they want a lot of games um I don't think it's a a a pretty night for the dolphins but I'll say this look I was very kind of critical minute ago about the chargers who would they be and you look at who the bears it'd be in\nI mean the Seahawks early when the sea hawks are really struggling they beat the cardinals before the cardinals went to Josh frozen they beat the box to kind of put the final stamp on fits magic right it was not like the the bears or world leaders either\nA this is one where I could just see everybody picking the bears number one defense in the NFL and the dolphins pool in the ... I don't know what I'm calling for it but I could definitely see that scenario\nIf your seasons on the line like it is for the Minnesota Vikings\nI guess you love to have it with the Arizona Cardinals come into the town you know the cardinals or you don't want an for um Minnesota can get healthy real quick to two and one um it's not like they're behind the eight ball but certainly disappointed with that record right now and I I don't think you blame Kirk Cousins on that that's for sure\nSo you're not buying the Josh Rosen high\nI like him um I just think it's going to take awhile obviously it it it's going to take a long time for some of the rookie quarterback for get going and um it's not going to happen right away for the cardinals are horrible team\nYeah and I was going to say even though I'm they got to win last week Rosen completed a grand total of forty percent of his past is\nYeah I think what Seventy five yards came on the first pass\n... exactly and so I'm with you on this one the Vikings neater when they can still dial it up defensively I Know that they're obviously not the same team that they were last year but you need a when a you gotta win last week against Billy I think they they get that second street when they need\nHope they get on the jets the jets all of a sudden get back to five hundred with the wind over this cold Steve who they are the extra a couple of days to prepare for this what their game against doing when they have so many people out I heard on the on the broadcast I think they were like thirty eight healthy body is I\nI don't know I I don't know how you only have thirty eight football players left on your team or the certainly a lot healthier now but it's not going to get easier for Andrew Luck jets have a much better deeper that people give them credit for I think they just want to get back to five hundred\nI'm not buying it I mean look the Broncos they crush the Broncos last week but the Broncos were on a short week that played on that Monday Night against the chiefs\nThey have to fly across country I just think the jets blitz them I just think they got the the right team on the right day ah we look we all love eyes aircrew will come out\nDuring the Nineteen yard\nOn Fifteen Carrie ... that's not going to happen again stemmed Arnold I Know he had the three CDs but if you look again at the completion percentage ten to twenty two I don't think that I Know is this just seemed wasn't as good as they looked last week as the Broncos\nWhy the Panthers Redskins not getting a little bit more hype considering the Redskins uh I think a little bit of a surprise just the fact that there are five hundred panther Panthers at three in one um Redskins looked horrible against the saints that was just miserable did they bounce back and gets his panther team\nI think they do but that doesn't mean they're going to win the game though\nA remember last week when I said is the NFC East the worst division in the NFL we\nGot him said the AFC but yeah the other ... maybe not that far behind\nYeah now the FCC to significantly better they they at least have teams with pulses no a Washington is not very good I don't think the Panthers like they're kind of just because they plan that division with New Orleans\nA fits magic everyone was so excited about that I think the Panthers a kind of getting lost in the shuffle here or they had that really really nice when he gets the giants\nI like Caroline I just feel like I don't know I I I feel like nobody's talking about them and I'm not totally sure why\nAll right I Want to get to the rams and the Broncos\nPeople are saying that if the rams are gonna lose it's going to be on the road to a team like Denver Denver's defense is is it your dad's Denver's defense that's for sure um I mean I Do respect his defense at all ah really under performed the rams are big favored in this one\nBroncos certainly can't keep up with or without Rahm up ends but yeah people think that Denver going to pull off the upset in this game Aaron\nSo I ... I feel like the NFL scheduling this year is very bizarre I don't remember it being so many weird stretches where we had the falcons play three to ... three at home in a row already or the jags play three in a row at home\nI thought that was frowned upon the play three in a row whether it's on the road or at home I guess I'm wrong on that they tried not to make a a habit of it I\nThought that's what I'm saying the rams are in the middle of a three game road trip right now I guess you'd call it a road trip I mean in baseball you called the road trip but three straight they wanted to Seattle last second last week or they play the Broncos this week then next week against the forty niners\nI don't know I mean I I think that I I Do think this would be the week where they get tripped up I'm just surprised that we're seeing all these these random three game stretches but I I Do think it could happen this week because you have the you know you're kind of in the middle that low I just can't see it I don't think the Broncos can produce enough often\nThat can be better off I ... I Love a lot of games that you just start with this one [noise]\nAs I told you better start as their backs against the wall if you want to do to go five hundred especially with the Mike Arizona come into town the Minnesota scores early and often their deepest stopped Arizona scored more than ten points [noise] Minnesota with this one by three touchdowns outweigh\nThe tab against Arizona [noise] three touched them but Twenty one points buried you're doing the math that all\nThat that's a lot of points is all say I I'll stay away from that one\nPittsburg at in the open Pittsburgh plus three down to Pittsburgh plus one and a half but I think there's good reason why people love since the but if you look at look at their the fourth highest score a gym in the NFL but they're only eight teams\nIn total yard it which means that\nThis isn't going to last forever and I think the Pittsburgh is a team that needs a when they cannot fall two and a half games behind Cincinnati in the standings which they would with a last year I think they get the win as a road under dog I'm taking Pittsburgh\nStraight up I I agree with you and that was going to be one of my picks move on what Kansas City bought the three and a half of the soldier better off balance more speed I'm not buying into the patriots just because they beat the coasts adopted as you mentioned they had about three actually what three four extra days to prepare for this game\nBut that aside Kansas City the second best even the NFL\nAnd that up as will be only give me Kansas City but the three and a half against the patriots and that ... number one\nI Will take the exact opposite stance basically all the reasons you said\nNew England has a couple extra days\nComing up that Thursday night game they are more in tune with Julian Edelman Josh Gordon getting comfortable there in New England\nAnd I just think this this cheap steam that we've seen the last couple of weeks is not the same chief being that we saw earlier this year my home struggle last week the Anthony Thomas was out for the year and the patriots were really good at home this year they're averaging thirty four at home because of it I liked the patriots did you get the wind straight up\nAnd I'll say they cover that three and a half at home and\nDoing you know I hit that I like the ... because I Do like the falcons or even a one in four ... now that magic is gone James is coming in and that guy but he gave does he have under his belt [noise]\nNot enough to go ahead and go into Atlanta but up as many points about that they're going to put up I think there's an easy one to me if I had in mind that the three\n... adamant that the Colts are the worst team in the NFL and I am adamant that already spending has no idea what he's talking about while they're playing the jets at ...\nLike I was going to take the jets do that but I see you're taking the call ...\nYes well it started jets minded streets down to two and a half\nI Am not sold on the jets I think they caught the Broncos at the right time coming on a short week two new New York last week because of that everyone has jets fever\nI don't want that jets beaver I don't want to go to the hospital so because of it I Am taking a the points I'm taking the Broncos to win this came out or not the Broncos the coastal\nWhen this came up right there you have our picks do with them as you please please please please\nRemember now are they are strictly for entertainment purposes only and of course all those other games Oregon or or just nothing compared to the Kansas City a New England game\nBy the way I got a ... that gave up higher ratings of any other game and the most money bet on will be that game also I think people are going to trip over each other to get to the uh to get money on that or get access to that game\nYeah I Would say so Vegas runner said it's so quick question the radio station is leading with the red Sox game by\nLocal station is going to air the red Sox game instead of the a patriot so are you doing\nPlay by play in the corner for the for the patriots or how does that work [noise]\nNo we actually have an Arab signal also so just put that on the\nPhone I don't I don't go for ...\nYeah no no we're ah we're we put the red socks on me but my I got to wrap it up by the way coming back a straight out to Vegas our boy Joe this will be the sole light so make sure you stick around for him again thanks to the guys double R.

Sports radio on straight out of Vegas but we continue on here on the NFL here on straight out of Vegas and we go\nTo a game that I find fascinating because it puts one team in a situation that they've never been in before or at least not this season\nThe LA Rams have yet to travel outside of the Pacific time zone they've not done it everything has been in the Pacific time zone\nAnd they find themselves in Denver to take on the Broncos a team who struggled a team who was exposed a week ago against the New York jets a team who was completely manhandled and a team who looked gas the Monday Night before when they lost to the Kansas City chiefs\nAnd so the LA Rams travel to the mile high city\nAnd although it's only an hour away from where they're at the story of this is whether they are expecting snow there they are expecting temperatures to be as low as Eighteen and its highest twenty eight nothing that the LA ramps have had to deal with this season and nothing that they normally deal with\nBeing that we're here in Southern California and if it gets below Seventy in the last couple of months it's a shock to everybody involved in a shock to their systems so the rams find themselves on the road against Denver\nSunday RJ bell talked about one advantage that Denver definitely has outside of just the weather\nAnother match up it vantage you're not going to hear this discussed as much as it should be the rams defense is expected to be mighty good this year it really has been less so than we expected [noise]\nBut they're runs the fence has been horrible the rams runs the fence is number twenty eight twenty eight [noise]\nNow what is Denver do well well if you look at TV away there's a vast rushing team in football number one [noise]\nSo you've got the best rushing team I guess the number twenty eight rushing the fence with Iran\nAnd I get it hey the rams are the rams\nBut when you have a seven point underdog and that's what the Broncos are what you want the most is you want to be able to run to fall short and the game and I think the Broncos based on this that could have a lot of rushing success against Iran and the conditions might be ideal to run the ball twenty degrees RJ and some snow in Denver\nIf you remember this is not a a foreign thing too warm weather teams the knock on the Tampa Bay buccaneers for years and years was every time they got to the post season if they had to play outdoors in a cold weather environment\nYou just chalk it up as a loss they couldn't figure it out it was just something they they couldn't it it it wasn't that it wasn't feasible for them to try and pull off when the same thing as far as where you're at on the map\nThe Seattle Seahawks anytime they traveled to the east coast for years the knock on Seattle was up early start time it Seattle traveling all the way across country yeah they're screwed Seattle's got no shot\nSo you wonder if the rams who do find themselves banged up and for his greatest they've than they are a flawed football team you wonder if Denver with that running game is the guys just pointed out and also Denver with the weather and the elements that the rams are gonna have to deal with for the first time all season long and something they didn't deal with a lot\nA year ago you wonder if that plays a major impact in this football game right now it is the rams a

jets right now this betting line and its move from three and a half early on it is now set at the jets a two and a half point favorite at home against the Indianapolis Colts an R. J. ... talked about\nAn interesting piece of information on the New York jets and the rookie quarterback\nThe jets or what I call a one handicapped team if you can answer this question you've got your answer on which way to bat\nWill they be able to run the ball effectively really effectively not just effectively but more than that they ran for over three hundred yards last week and they control the game kudos\nBut the coats have the thirteenth best rushed defense by DVR way that's not great but it's above average my guess is Arnold gonna have to throw the ball and I think that's something that doesn't mean I Love the cold\nBut I don't think the jets control the game like they want to and that's the key and Andy with ten days to prepare for this game and a lot of the team is getting healthier for this game\nAnd a big reason that the jets had a ton of success a week ago against the Denver Broncos is how well they ran the football the jets ran all over the Denver Broncos\nAnd if you were to just go back and take a look at that game it wasn't so much a Sam Darnell show I mean Sam Donald got the wind and good for him that was all about how they were able to run the football and it was in my opinion because I think the jets game planted\nThink the jets looked at what they got in Denver coming off that short week on Monday Night football and said what's the best way that we handled the Denver Broncos coming in on a short week\nOh body blows death by a thousand cuts three hundred twenty three yards on the ground by the New York jets a week ago because they saw what happened on Monday Night football they saw the Denver was gassed they saw von Miller over on the sidelines\nAh keel ah bent over trying to catch his when when Patrick ... homes is making all those plays so now\nThey don't get that team this week\n... this is a team that's coming off even extra rest not just a week coming off a week and a half based on playing a Thursday game so when you factor that in it makes you wonder\nHow the jets are favored in this game Indianapolis is not a great team but they're not the team that the jets got a week ago that they exposed\nIn the Denver Broncos being out of gas out of wind\nAnd a team that was run all over to our Jay's point a much better defense as far as ... goes in Indianapolis should be interesting to see how it plays out a next up here on straight out to Vegas here Fox Sports radio Jonah stocks infer RJ bell and Bernie Fratto here on efforts are\nThe Panthers and the Redskins so the Carolina Panthers\nWho won a game last week on a sixty three yard field goal and broke the hearts of the New York giants a few days before he lie manning broke um again by putting up that performance on Thursday Night Football the Panthers go into DC to take on the Washington Redskins the Redskins were embarrassed on Monday Night football during Drew Brees night\nSo Atlanta is sitting at a three point favorite right now at home all sorts of injuries all sorts of clothes losses and a blowout defeat at Heinz Field against the Steelers a week ago and\nRJ bell says the important thing to do is to look ahead\nI Want to introduce the concept the look ahead line now here's the look ahead line which is you can bet a game a week ahead of time so right now we're betting which sick but you could also that we haven't you can bet week seven now what's the point is that\nThe point is that is that you can see how how much the line changes just from the one upcoming Saturday game so last week if you're bad is Lana they were favored by six and a half over Tampa Bay now the line is three [noise]\nWhat has changed well Tampa Bay had by so nothing and Atlanta look really bad against Pittsburgh there's one gang justify a three and a half point line move no it does not the look a headline is a good guy about when the public is over\nThe acting and I've talked about it I feel bad for the Atlanta Falcons I think they are ... I think\nThey are so talented and nothing has gone there a way it just feels like one of those years one of those snake bit seasons so Atlanta looking to at least feel a little bit better about themselves a field goal favorite against the returning Jamieson Wednesday in in the Tampa Bay buccaneers on Sunday next up\nWe've got the Houston Texans fresh off their exciting overtime win over the Dallas Cowboys on Sunday Night Football I just shot watching was banged up in that game he is expected to play coming up later on\nAnd they get the Buffalo Bills\nThe bills who are the authors of the most historic upset gambling wise in recent NFL history earlier this year against the Minnesota Vikings\nAre genius tempted to lean one way in this picky tempted to go with buffalo but he's not feeling all that hot about it\nUsually was wise guys this dog or past when the spread hit double digit [noise]\nThis is one I'm tempted to bet the Vikings for one reason why do we like the dog typically because of the team by the favor over look that really bad teams are playing that's why they're doubled is your favorite except\nWho did the Vikings lose to a few weeks ago as a Seventeen point favorite the Buffalo Bills you know they're not overlooking this team so if you got the better team focused they tend to win and cover let me give you an analogy in the play offs\nDouble digit favorites in the playoffs have covered eight straight when they want to win big they do win big\nAnd I want to go against Arizona who just got a big upset when for their first win last week will they have the energy to compete here\nAnd he's got a point like you you look at that situation and you look at Minnesota and you look at Minnesota hosting Arizona they don't want to look nobody wants to be a part of the wrong side of history twice\nNobody wants to go through that that was an embarrassing loss of the Buffalo Bills and when you factor in that list Sean McCoy was out in ... when you factor and it was a rookie quarterback and it was in your own backyard it's a bad luck for the Minnesota Vikings so you would think\nTo get the bad taste out of their mouth Mike Zimmer who is called out his team publicly several times throughout the course of the season\nHe did it after the Thursday night debacle against the LA ramps on which the secondary couldn't hold the rams receivers under five thousand yard just felt like and then he also called out of steam after they were embarrassed by the Buffalo Bills at home you would imagine that Minnesota is going to be ready to roll coming up\nLater on on Sunday I Am Jonas knocks it straight out of Vegas reminder\nEvery single Saturday Night eleven pm Pacific time two am eastern time straight out of eggs with Bernie Fratto and RJ bell and then during the week straight out of Vegas\nRJ bell myself the pheasant Brad powers three to four pm Pacific time six to seven pm eastern time you're on Fox Sports radio coming up next\nIt's me Jonah stocks the Jonas knock show and I'm going to tell you why you need to be positive about the college football season that's next year and if I saw\n\nMessage from day to raise me applying\n... the bigger\nAfter I left baseball I just couldn't stay in shape like I used to turns out\nYour body has less fruits uh thoughts\nAnd that could make it harder to get into shape [laughter] so I got back into the game with new Jennings [noise] I'm from the stronger with a lot more energy and drive you want to get back into shape region is all you have to do is send one simple tax\nFrank's right just to rule to four to four to four to get a complementary bottle of award winning new Gen x number one selling free testosterone booster GMC it's unique men boosting formula is powered by testified in a pat and the key ingredient clinically research to help them and feel stronger leaner more energetic and more passionate\nAnd guy shit like that they're supposed to\nKnow Jenike samples are not available in stores they get your complimentary bottle sex rules to four to four to four that's R U L E to four to four to four\nThey show our problem solving skills [noise] ...

pay off AT T's we gave one of the most epic cheeses and the history of sports talk radio so here before we reveal the guest right before reveal the gas and we have a high budget here on weekend overnight radio this prime ... primetime real estate here on sports talk radio a lot of people say oh it's the Monday through friday shows Kiss My ass\nIt's all about weekend overnight it's all about afternoon drive time in Bangladesh which is where we are right now so the cheese that I gave\nAs to who are mystery guest would be all I gave you was the following from Conor McGregor this was the T's this was the hint\nAnd we've got people tweeting in trying to figure out who the guest is but the hint that I gave you from Conor McGregor was the following\nThese days\nSo it is time for the big reveal ladies and gentlemen on the heels of suck these big Irish believes it is time to reveal our guest mystery guest say your name please Bridget Quinn\nOf Dublin is in the house folks the pride of Dublin, Ohio a home of Wendy's and Brady Quinn is here after calling us the Colorado game for Fox Sports ... on Saturday Night my man what's happening\nGlad to be here are just ah just got done with a game it was what a four hour and that's something that was a long one or not the best football but Goodwin for us see who now control their own destiny at least in the the patch out trying to get another pack world championship\nAnd now it'd be honest though I just between you and I know brainy and I do a show together I hear on\nFox Sports radio eight to eleven pm eastern time five eight Pacific time on Sunday night so we will be on the air uh later on on Sunday and usually it's like a segment or two before it goes completely off the rails and somebody makes a crank joke\nBut we are in the safe harbor here on weekend overnight she can be honest I just between you and I there's nobody listening because I'm hosting but between you and I\nWhen you go into the coliseum how much do you look around and you're just disgusting as a Notre Dame great to be sitting on the coliseum calling us the\nLittle honestly uh you got to compartmentalize that uh because that with this profession\nIs the last thing that you ever want to be the case um and and as much as you want people to recognize you for you being a former athlete on all that and then in your history as a quarterback you also want them to just kind of appreciate you as a broadcaster so they don't really associate you with Jean\nUm and so that's where like for example Kirk street who was at Ohio State quarterback I don't know how many young people who are applying that I grew up in Ohio so I remember it but I think he does a tremendous job of always there just calling the game as he sees it and being able to be critical of times but\nNot showing really any bias thing that I thought it was a tough thing is people tend to think that you're going to be biased um based on your affiliations or your alma mater but really they just call the game I see things kinda going down there and I think I was\nProbably over the complimentary of uh of USC and rightfully so they played a much better game than than in Colorado and it's like\nA Brady Quinn Fox Sports radio host Fox Sports one uh NFL college football analyst joining us here on fs are you were getting a lot of compliments I was for some reason tagged and I'm trying to do extensive show prep for my highly rated weekend overnight you and I got people\nCommenting on how great your hair looked during the broadcast or do you do anything different did you finally break out the blow dryer like asked you\nYeah well you actually gave me some tips so like you said there was like leaving conditions\nThere yeah yeah so that\nThat's one of the key you got to have the blow dryer which I haven't quite made it that far to getting the Cadillac of blood drives that you know um but all at all and you know it's like a good amount of time before the game a you've got to make things rocks all those you're putting a headset on and off so that clearly going to mess it up\nUm but yeah it took a lot of hard work and preparation gotta get into the ... how the air looks a and look at the table to stand the test them for up to maybe five hours and about how long it was\nA if Scott Frost wasn't a Nebraska great before he was a head coach\nAre we talking to one and done situation ever ask a\nPotentially yeah I mean I think that the toughest part about any coach in the first year especially though with with you know what I think he will eventually be there is you've always got to just you know\nJust just destroy everything and break it all down before you can build it back up and you know I I think that's the tough part for him is he's got to figure out a way of being able to keep everyone that's the ... getting frustrated with what they look like right now because\nYou know there are so far behind everyone else and then it gets tough when you're the season like this to pitch to recruit um which you obviously need they lack ...\nYou know how do you how do you pitch or what do you say to those kids about the program that you're building it aside saying hey you can come and play right away which who knows if there is a much truth to that and then again you know the the battle that you face as you're playing a bunch of young players that you basically referred it to come in and start right away it that means there's probably a couple of years from really being able to be\nCompetitive and and successful so I Will watch the ... west I think they'll have an easier time coming back\nOr being in that division versus the big cities that's for sure\nI loved what he said after the game when they were asking why the defense fell apart the first thing you said was well first of all I Know coach the defense thanks couch appreciate it thanks for making clear and throwing your defensive coordinator under the\nI just I just I don't know ... ... ... it feels like chip Kelly like ... like the consensus is you know look this is a a bad situation chip Kelly he got his first went on Saturday is going to turn around but\nOr lose it all coming up ten minutes from now here on Fox Sports radio I was great to hear from my radio ... in a few moments ago called in after the U.S the Colorado game again you can hear Brady and I are coming up later on Sunday night eight to eleven pm eastern time five to eight\nPm Pacific time right now do we decided to come up with a new a segment here on the show\nRalph

spots things on social media\nHe's the most violent man in sports talk radio and he is fast becoming the most controversial and it's time for the debut edition of a little something we call the

actually in there\nOr anything it was a stuffed animal I don't know like ... like the idea of while there or if I Would\nNever say this to him because the guy's a mock street actually really nice guy we interviewed on the air um he's a really really nice guy\nBut what I think that was\nLike somebody like it was something that that uh one of the producers want in a giant claw machine at a carnival and they brought it on that\nOf course there's a guy inside even mind they did they say hey give them a punch punch him as hard as you can do they know how hard here I don't think so he can't Wilder's

hundred a football team\nThe Redskins were absolutely embarrassed on Monday Night New Orleans and even though it's a short week I liked it it's at home\nAnd even though Carolina has won five straight against Washington idol like this spot for the Redskins I think they're going to be motivated I think they're going to play well based on last week's embarrassment and they can actually move in the first place in the NFC eased with when I like the Redskins getting a point to happen on\nThis wrong\nThe LA Rams are a seven point favorite at the Denver Broncos they four oh five pm eastern time kick

built in advantage there dominant at home early in the season because teams aren't in shape and when you go mile high [noise]\nTeams are stuck in when early in the season but everything starts to even out later on since that time and the Broncos were to no they've lost three straight and they were throttle by the jets last week\nBut I like Denver and this spot the rams have had some injury issues pop up in recent weeks and it but yet to leave the Pacific time zone until now they had to Denver and snow is in the forecast I got the Broncos coming off that debacle in New Jersey a week ago I think there are much better team at home clearly\nThan they are on the road and they're getting seven points I think the rams when this game but I like Denver to keep a close give me the Broncos plus seven and with that [noise]\nThat concludes your week six knocks locks here on Fox Sports radio [noise]\n\nIf I go five no again [noise]\nThey should build me a casino in Vegas\nI'm Serious forget the hard

[noise]\nThey're college football Saturday was loaded with upsets including number two in Georgia falling number thirty ... thirty six to six genes number six West Virginia also a victim they lose that Iowa State Thirteen or fourteen easy winner for a number one Alabama and number three Ohio State number five Pittsburgh a\nNo [laughter] do you expect all of these other teams to remain on blemish or to have these sparkling resumes at the end of the season no Notre Dame going undefeated is a lock for the play offs and it's not just because\nThey're this superior team or they've got this gauntlet schedule is just because these other teams are going to go down they're not going to have these on blemish records\nThat are going to knock Notre Dame outs all you got to do when I got to do is what al Davis used to preach which is just win baby jet winning and if your own blemish if you're playing power five teams unlike UCF you're going to be in the play off\nAnd you're talking about being blemish Durham blemish one team really yesterday I got ... pretty good and then\nThere are no longer undefeated and if you didn't believe that ... tigers before the game and maybe try to change your mindset at thirteenth rank LSU there for real they've got a huge win over number to Georgia in death valley an Saturday listen to this world\nAre they spent the pretty good thirty six sixteen and by the way now the title so I think the real right now they have three top ten winds coming back after last week's Los to Florida which I thought it was a blemish than I thought maybe they're not for real but I think that's a real right now as they wrote to the SEC championship has to include\nBaton Rouge Bob Tom Cruise will be the spot well\nThey're right in the mix but that team named Alabama still one's schedule so [laughter] I got to get through that got over that they already with the loss\nYeah what's that they've got ... Mississippi State they play next week and that Alabama so they've got right who test Sunday schedule a split I don't see them beating Alabama and see anybody beating Alabama I really don't\nRight but that was the biggest game of the day and that takes Georgia's margin for error and makes it zero in terms of making the playoff they've got to run the table and when you look at the next three weeks Florida at Kentucky Auburn was it three ranked teams\nAnd then to get to the college football playoff you'd have to win the SEC championship game which most likely will be against Alabama\nThat is tough to be able to run the table they gave themselves no margin for error but you look at LSU defense they played lights out they played excellent defense against the tough Georgia team and winning by twenty points man not only did LSU when they won convincingly\nYeah they'd be they'd be in a pretty good does tell you what another team that due to cross off the list of the\nCollege football playoffs will be Penn State I mean I don't know how this team chokes at the end that can't close they're like they're still like the LA charges of college football they they really are they can't they can't close it out at the end of the game and Michigan State Twenty one Seventeen at the end and\nNow one last teams now with a chance to him at the college football players\nForget it immediately lions couldn't hold onto the lead list another close game the second lowest of the year\nPenn State get this is twenty four and five and the last twenty nine games and those five lost is a bit by a combined\nTwelve points you know they've got to be gone crazy they're in a university park but they just can't close it out they can't do it\nNo it was an ugly game for Penn State and that's their second straight loss in the division in the big hands so they are beyond done and also West Virginia how 'bout them man number sixteen number six team going down against Iowa State will Greer\nWho's the highest been hopeful a hundred yards passing a touchdown and a pick that's all you had against Iowa State so you give that Iowa State squad credit they are giant killers and for West Virginia to get beaten down like that\nThat could do it for the big twelve you know their channel is that it's like they have bullet you look at these teams is bullets in terms of hitting a target to get to the playoffs there just losing bullets one after another with Oklahoma going down last week now West Virginia going down good luck getting a team from the big twelve in the playoffs now\nWell I'll go one step further yeah it was a heck of a winning Ames, Iowa last night for coach Mike Campbell the second year coaches Iowa State thirty to fourteen of West Virginia but if you're a West Virginia right now the ... they got the rest of the way they got Michigan Wisconsin and Iowa remaining on their schedule so it doesn't look too good for West Virginia ... it really doesn't\nKnow no not looking good at all it was an ugly last it was that there were less than six minutes to go in the game West Virginia was down by fourteen points they're backed up way deepen their own territory its third Nineteen they took it the lay of game\nWhere you should be in a hurry up off and just ... minutes to go you're damned fourteen point the lay of game\nNot only were they bad they were disorganized that was a complete meltdown by West Virginia last night but like you said give ... capital in Iowa State a lot of credit played great defense last night and to beat down and number six team in the country got to take your hat off to them\nI Do if I had I had I Would take it off I really live but I'm happy for them happy for I was saying as well but I'm happy with that we have a big\nBig football day today

I don't think they have any say about that what are the expectations for the charges I every year at the same thing they lose games at the end you know they they choke up like Penn State did yesterday they can't close out and Philippe rivers is always crying and whining but he has a decent statistical situation but the team loses\nThat's the problem with the with the LA charges\nBut they're very talented you know that they have a very very talented team so\nTo say okay by ... don't go with expectations go with disappointment have they been a disappointment they hope oh ... well that has to do with the expectations you can't be disappointment if you're expecting nothing if I'm a straight a student\nAnd I bring my report card back home and it just straight up you're not going to be like oh yeah ... you're going to expect it\nOkay to eat you wouldn't be disappointed if you expect the expected the chargers to do nothing the fact is you expect them to do something and they're underperforming so that's where I think people favor the browns it's about the expectations to brown surpassing em the charges falling short that doesn't mean then\nThat the chargers are worst team then the browns are either chargers or a better team and on the road it's going to be a tough test but I think they come out of this one with the Dell you\nHit it right on the head it's on the road it's in Cleveland I think whether it's going to be a major factor right now because these guys they used a bathing in the sun and going surfing and it got to go to Cleveland today and find out that

had to give them the land blow of the because he's giving you the UCF stuff now now Ross coming at ya I helped a little bit now robs hounding pounding the second TK over here I'm Sorry I'm Sorry I'm Sorry the guy even\nWhen they say that was inaccurate about UCF where did you say anything he didn't say anything\nThat was an accurate they just kind of giving you a couple of those UC of jabs I gotta get your UCF T shirt that's what I Want to do I want to go\nWithout ... here's the thing then let me just say this real quick like okay I have no us being against\nThe little guys I don't like\n... this isn't to relive the glory days or anything like that Andy but when I played high school football I played at a school they'll uh Sal lions okay and the south bend schools there were at like five public schools in the south bend area\nAnd we would go against this other school named pen in hand was basically all these different in South bend schools\nAll like morphed into one so you had hand which is ... feet up on everybody that was a smaller school in South bend area I\nAte and I\nBuy and because I was like in the little\nGuys school and so I I Love the underdog I Love the little guys taken down the big boys I live for that and the college basketball tournament\nSo don't act like I'm this oh no little guys getting about a year it's all about the resume it's nothing personal whatsoever with UCF it is literally no emotion\nIt just drives me crazy when the bad logic is flowing like wine when it comes to use the F you don't apply the same harsh\nStandard that you do for power five schools with UCF you should I Wish they were evaluated in great at the same way based on their resume based on who they play in who they beat and they simply aren't\nWhen that follows me\nAnd and the voters don't do that but this UCF came into the rankings yesterday a tenth of the country\nReally\nThere were ten I mean so so you you can they go all the statements you want\nBut honestly when the voters come devote a pie and or college or in the polls come out tomorrow UCF was tense last week they want to nail biter down by sixteen yesterday the Memphis and they won by a point the as big as Memphis I don't see them being knocked out of the top ten yesterday especially of what what happened on the college football season anyway\nSo they're not because he would argument makes you ... you just statements that argument\nLot of sense but when it comes to voting I think many of these voters just lived as UCF as the same type of schools in Oklahoma or Oklahoma State of West Virginia they really they know I think they do not all but I think some when you have an under no team like two years ago\nWestern Michigan a lot of heat right because they ... they weren't included in the playoffs at people look at that say well we're undefeated these are the teams we play we can't help it there's a schedule we ... were undefeated will not getting the respect with the way to do that is what happens\nThey don't they don't look at it that way you had UCF was undefeated\nYou had Washington ahead of them with the loss you at Penn State ahead of them with the loss that Texas had at them with the loss okay you're probably going to have both Michigan and LSU leap frog UCF so that's the whole thing like\nThe other part is ... ... ... if they were if they had true respect for UCF\nBeing undefeated they would be ranked higher than they are they wouldn't have one last teams ahead of them there should be one last teams added them because they have better resume remote yet to remind\nMe that this this this argument this discussion what we're having right now is a viewpoint because look they don't play the teams to warrant the respect that they should get\nThat job was saying right way somebody so you see a play somebody out of your league ... just not as strong as the SEC or the Big Ten or twelve ... that's just what does this fact\nIt it's almost an ironic argument that we're going around that around and around well there are a good football team I joined the that there are a good football team in the conference are they playing the a C which is not a top notch conference and the silver good luck\nGood like look at what LSU is done this year\nDo you think UCF would have the same outcome\nPlaying Miami at a neutral site\nAt Auburn double digit underdogs taking down Georgia okay those are three teams that were ranked in the top ten at the time that they played them do you think that UCF would have won blemish on his resume I Know people are All right I I you know I look\nThey haven't played a team with a winning record until yesterday and we're propping up UCF as if there's somebody it's crazy wild weather of it is a real quickly Andy\nI hate that we're not looking at twenty Eighteen in a vacuum because that's what we should do look at South Florida same conference they were ranked twenty third\nHeading into this weekend\nOkay why are they lower for anybody who say well UCF should be higher why don't you say that about South Florida why don't you say that about NC State who's undefeated\nTeams that are universal into that and I\nSee that is on the fetus five and oh\nRight right so we're leaning hard for those schools who are undefeated right what's the argument there because they don't play anybody either and they should be ranked higher the truth is UCF should be ranked\nLower like an NC State like South Florida like Cincinnati if you play someone and beat someone of note then you should be a top ten team\nI couldn't agree more and I I think that's almost a waste of breath to discuss why a team on that level should be I just put on the same level as an Alabama or LSU it just just put it this way but UCF\nOr as South Florida and the SEC I put a complete schedule your schedule there if they want to games will be a lot will be a lot about as long as they're right do you agree no\nBut I still got to be Coleman rights I mean Coleman at home and I like big things from Sony Michel would like to see you again I'm In is in your wind up as well uh but certainly have in common is in a way

Michael ... told me rise right straight\nWhen you look at this team I Know ... working on Thursday night got a front row seat to this thing\nAt church that he's sticking with a like you agree with that decision\nI Do I mean who else you're going to put in there yeah I'd I'd be honest with you I Can't even tell you to back up is the life has been the man that's who you stick with him he is there but you can't put it all and he like any like play better\nAbsolutely but at the same time you need to offer the want to play better because of the back and play better everywhere the only player on that team lot look at and go wow we'll take one Barkley they only go showing up Sunday the Sunday vehicle to you you know\nBefore you take a a a coach's job like that term and you're sitting there with management and they talk about obviously the future how do you guys see the players so I mean ... new obviously what they were getting into with you I I don't think they have a choice Mike at this point you mentioned the backup\nThey try to try to do some things I don't know what's what he does best might you might know that would give him a chance to be successful\nYeah were you got to just allow you out of just a good cook says Livio where am I I Will say that um but they need some energy is no end in ... in it\nIt all starts with the quarterback you you've probably got to put them in a position where you just allow him to just go out and call his own place or a spend more time with ... with the guys and figure out what really works for\nLet's say on a layer of energy guide though right whenever you allow him\nTo play the rest of the season out and you go out and drop the guy and but you can keep them as a potential backup all out and they'll just move on and see what else is out\nThere we talked all last week about oh doubt that come in that interview that he did am I crazy or is there an issue here with him and perhaps some jealousy over sake one Barclay like what's going on you guys think with that relationship because it seems like he's not happy no matter what happens\nThere doesn't seem to be happy no matter what happens in the same time though you're not as big deal you\nKnow where you're at you're in New York be happy in New York where your home is going to be too much money to send you anywhere else in a way you're acting no one else wants to take you right now because you could be either you know you're just saying here's the part of the problem\nOr you're part of the solution yet which one do you want to be oh they'll need to decide\nWhen you get that type of money you get paid a ... so you don't get paid just we'll play you get paid to be a leader as well and that's what we'll be has to do\nYeah coach on her and the question of play calling in Dallas this week when all the finger pointing that's going on right there is it a coaching issue\nOr a fire the coach [laughter] I Know much about\nThe situation is any franchise guys noticed we talk about all the time it's probably the most unique of any head coach ... own a relationship but yeah there is going to pick the players juries involved in everything seven days a week\nThis is not jury Jason gr it's going to be there I think this and I think the jury's going to take the bullet and say we got to get better players might we got to draft butter ... yeah I don't agree\nWe always dress well when you come over here they wait on my white bread yeah yeah well we yeah we're going to happen and it was a guy there now for a look at the exciting AFC match up tonight\nYeah huge game tonight Kansas city's high powered off ... visits the patriots young versus old Luke versus Vader I guess what spoiler alert in their last two regular season\nMeetings that chiefs have\nExcellent against the patriots forty plus points a game two hundred yards rushing five hundred yards of ... per game Andy ... is made bell bell a check on a tape the sleeves back on his buddy complete domination and that was pre Patrick all homes Tony Gonzales\nWhat do you get denied the young Patrick more homes the expertise that ballot shut\nDown the expertise about sick of genius\nAnd read it was a genius themselves through it that are going up into place you he got to love to see that ... this this game the game of matchups look at the tide in she got trapped healthy and you got Gronkowski those guys are the best side in the ... right now I Want to see how they go and how each deepest played them if you don't\nIf you don't like football or if you look football this is the game but it ought to watch ... of the season\nIf you love often there's going to stick that it's been thrown around a bunch that no quarterback under the age of twenty four I ever gone in the regular see that one in Gillette Stadium the chiefs are looking at with a giant ashtray why because they went in there last year we want and tore up the patriots and\nMark Sanchez Joe Flaco both when in there and play off games which are more significant any regular season game and ... and ... and they're building they've got Patrick mom they feel better than they've ever been\nHere's the issues though Kansas City on the back into that defense has been not injury riddled their decimate that they don't have any safety is what is the latest on\nThat if you're watching right now I can tell you that in August they had for safety is on the route to the effect of the play none of those guys are playing there now playing three players at safety who have been acquired after training in\nOne of them with a guy named Leon liquid a third from the practice squad and in practice this week they had markets can be a wide receiver playing safety and this is the most decimated defensive back to an all about if ever judgment day than Brady we're going to get it going today\nIt's both a master beekeeper ability right I'm going to go on record Tom Brady will have four hundred yards over

I couldn't believe that uh my first but um once I got on the plane [noise] it'll hit man and I landed I saw the job\nThat you\nKnow I Am going to say you're the most exciting\nPlaying\nAt a high level right now and especially in the league when we see a ton of points what make a good teeth that\nAll the guys on the deep as you know coming together you know how they bought them play together to each other\nDon't quite know what do\nYou want to keep ... especially troubled\nGoing to be the top essentially like there's no question about it but we weren't like every week or pregnant and now we're getting the most out of state for that's what's going to separate us and\nPicking up pieces like yourself clear on what kind of message does that then to all the players they knew our team was going to go out and get my like em [noise] um how about we wanted it off\nThose days where I'm like man I don't know my my legs go like it must be him straighten out there with that money running to it's just what a hunting run you do do it for\n[laughter] gosh what do you kind of ... like you're talking about is is that if they can vote\n[laughter]\nIs the most special part about\nOn the Chicago\nWe had a great vibe that was why it was so easy for him to come in and and be a part of the team visited because he had written a jeep we already had like\nWas like man I just felt really go right being around the a\nReally easy transition and made it very easy for me I\nIf I'm comfortable for you now to lose this [noise]\n... sitting down and it should be noted that when we requested to sit down with ...\nHe said OK but as long as I can sit with some of my teammates and that says a lot Michael about\nWho he is as a person and clearly what an addition he's been to this team\nAre one hundred percent right great job with that he said you're right it usually takes time for a guy to get to a new team to acclimate himself but when you were the hardest worker everybody knows your great player but when you finally go to a new change your heart is working on and on and off the practice field you're doing all the meeting you're doing everything that takes to win other players\nWell you immediately and you can see right there those guys at the\nHooper players led by the best player\nBe most humble at the mall and they're having fun he's a teacher on the field leader off the field he loves the game and his love of the game allow him to go out and put up with that line of just five games through the season that most guys would love to have for the entire Stephen\n... double team would help a keen he really liked him allow him to be the player the here for basic to shoot the gap and it just an amazing player\nAnd you just scratch your head and wonder how the raiders gave him up\nBut at the same time I look at Miami Today I'm thinking I'm Glad I don't play quarterback\nYeah like when you look at all I tell her own defense on top of that they've got the top ... coordinator an entire league with the band you know\nAnd this they should end up as the number one they dance in the entire league at the end of the year or the other side you've got the dolphins yeah they're banged up in the alphabet you're buying backup center you know bang up a tackle and you got tannahill\nIf he's going to tell us about a little bit later on I Would look for the running back story and breaks you get a heavy dose they run the football\nIn a very low scoring game and\nTrying to help out officially now ... or so more meat on the ball that mind right now you know it's funny because if you take a look at the old mines is the glue Mac really found himself was Chicago meanwhile there's all open team is still searching for an identity right now if you take a look at them and one is for just can't seem to get anything going\nYeah well if you're listening Jay I'm their team in transition you know their team that a John as trying to build a certain identity and obviously that wasn't ... although I I Do\nThink they like there are there young Russians call her some key but they're not Coolio math and and defensively they've struggled to get there was pressure often when when it's been a kind of a mixed bag six in total often twenty seconds do an scoring often car lead the league and interceptions reading the red zone\n... trying to press too much too much and Ann Cooper it's an inch you mentioned got\nReally tell the guy coming out of Alabama and and he's been a robo level receiver but one week it's over a hundred yards next week a targeted want it's kind of a mixed bag

Ridley their first round or that he's in his paying off but but Cincinnati Bengals kind of back burner stuff I could see a great future ahead of they're receiving corps\nBucky books that I was talking about this yesterday because he has an article on NFL dot com about the best wide receiver duo in football\nFor his buddies the Vikings ... yeah I don't know if you're going to argue that but we had a conversation with some of the others are that are definitely out there Cincinnati with a with their young core with Boyd coming in is definitely on that list\nOr we mentioned Atlanta with what Ridley are now brings to the table there's Pittsburgh with brown and Jew Jew end the rams he got ... got cough and cough and and I wonder if five weeks from now we want\nA after weeks of talking about how he has no weapons five weeks from now what would we be saying about Julian Edelman and Josh Orton\nRight you know I Julian Edelman ... automatically increases your danger because all of a sudden you have ground to cover and Edelman both of them beat man coverage every time it's very similar to how we're talking about the chargers when you have Keenan Alan\nAnd you have a A R capable back out of the ... I feel like Melvin Gordon the passing game you're just twisted up somebody is going to draw a line backer coverage on every plane that's what happens with New England\nHad burner on the outside like Josh Gordon you stretch the field you make more room in the soft parts of zone coverage and you have a lot more men beat her so you're absolutely right New England is one of those low key back burner teams the lookout receiver wise\nBig run for James Carter is going to get the ball in Cincinnati territory by just a couple of yard so we'll watch Pittsburgh's drive\nAs they try to answer the Bengals touchdown trailing seven to nothing their field goals for uh the Minnesota Vikings and the New York jets Vikings leave the cardinals tend to three jets in front of the colds tend to seven at the end of the first quarter there and how would you expect Alex Smith to react after a while it was\nAn embarrassing Monday Night I mean it was it Drew Brees party Smith could not get the ball down feel they could not get anything going off than simply\nAbout Alex Smith has staying power in this league for a reason he's been embarrassed many times and he always seems to come back at least show people the value and he's off to a hell of a first quarter start Washington elites Carolina fourteen to nothing Smith has to touch down throws well kept Newton only has to throws\nSo that that says Alex Smith is at its best if you give a game manager guy like Alex Smith\nThe lead he's going to absolutely shine yes because you don't have to advance the ball and pump it down field you don't need a score and the hurry like when Tom Brady or Aaron Rodgers George Drew Brees are behind late in the game you say okay this is still ballgame because to scores can be made up quick wears\nOut Smith you don't have that same dynamic play a quarterback so fourteen nothing in the first quarter frog Smith he's got a box score that will impress you every time but if it's the opposite way if the Panthers were leading fourteen nothing serious drug all this will get embarrassing quick because you just don't have enough to catch up fast enough\nTo make it a ball game when you have an arm like that a quarterback let's\nBe honest with what this is Alice miss a really good quarterback and there's not a chief's fan of the world who messes them no I mean that's just that's that's I think that's the way they're saying we're alive and the guy go Fox Sports radio studios easy to say Fifteen Percent or more on car insurance was Geico\nGuy could dot com or called eight or nine four seven out of the only hard part figuring out which way is easier\nThe raiders are struggling the falcons trying to extend their lead and the Steelers in bangles territory would check in on all of that as we continue on red zone radio Fox Sports radio\nThings happened so fast in our world don't know why [laughter] sort of keep up here's what they're doing to follow us on Twitter Twitter winter winter Fox Sports radio where she will you win the no\nI mean when you're talking about an older and he's not old for quarterback especially these days but a veteran quarterback if you're going to get anything worse what you drafted him out or what you're paying him currently especially in guarantees that you'll never see back\nUnless he starts performing too too that contract level um you need them to have a good year so\nI guess the hope in Oakland is if you are going to shift to move some pieces around him a mark Cooper on that trade waiver or I should say on that trade bait sort of a a rumor going around right now whatever you bring in better help your quarterback because it has been going well and if you're going to trade him he needs to play better\nBig thirty six play in Cleveland Baker may feel almost picked off look at this past I I think is our might have gotten hit a little bit and so he won the opposite right to charge or\nA and that will at least preserve the field goal attempt and we all know about the adventure that kicking in Cleveland has been this year so let's take a look at this wide by the way along with only a thirty three yard or\nIt's a mark Cooper who just took a shot over the middle of romance Mick Doug Lynn\nAnd uh I I think I think he's unconscious on the field oh it's about ... along with trade rumors now\nI mean he got hit in the head and neck area and got dropped fast and he did not move so there are tending to him in England they just went to a break so we'll we'll update everybody on a mark Cooper status when that raider game returns\nField goal is good for Cleveland so it's now seven to three in favor of the chargers there are but yes the ah the Maori Cooper situation is going to be our first and foremost in our minds right now not only for his health but it does you know immediately made me think of rural Thomas\nOr because you're talking about guys who now this is different because I'm Ari Cooper is not demanding a trade like Earl was uh but right as you have trade rumors and all of this stuff started to get this guy's\nBoat and this is what can happen in football while you're talking about trading someone who's out there on the field or Thomas breaks his leg that's the end of those conversations and now we don't know what's going to go on with I'm Ari Cooper going\nOn it's funny you mention are all Thomas because all of a sudden you know ... and the raiders are playing against Seattle and Martian Lynch obviously having played him on the super bowl for the Seahawks comes up in conversation\nAnd grew in in the way he does about that running back glows about what he meant to the franchise so far\nAnd also added in there and look we love the Seattle guys we're going to try to go after and get more of a free agency he's definitely sending a message to Tom and saying hey if you make it home in Oakland in a in a far drive yeah and so there's\nMore than I this is the second time he ripped his current safety I matter of a week by the way yeah\nWell I mean and and publicly I don't know if I agree with this because grew in throws people under the bus that I don't think you should at ... at the podium he's done it to his quarterback a couple of times now um but that's the way John does business he wants everybody understand their place in all this and yeah we're seeing the shot\nBack at when we stadium it's Cooper walking off the field with the ...\nYeah he looks or you know I mean he's a let's look at the head now wow that is an awful helmet to helmet hits and it wasn't even fly by the way he noticed that that all leading with the helmet on the Internet and flags and stuff he's gonna get fined a but it was ... to my knowledge it's a brutal helmet to helmet hits\nCooper walking off under his own power headed for the ... I think we know how this is likely going to go uh we've probably seen the last of them are Cooper today is he's going to be in the protocol now\nYeah so it's third and twenty you're absolutely right no slack for the defense on that may dug one is going to see a a a fine for that but I think what we're seeing in the NFL was scare tactics during the pre season as car is able to throw out and get first down yard itch\nOn thirty twenty gets Twenty one yards on underneath pass that was great play\nShark yeah so I I look at I look at it than a felon I see two things I see one they're trying to simulate a fence and that's exactly what they did with this quarterback sack rule and protect harmless receivers better over the middle but it isn't a priority the way it was during the pre season\nMakes certain five in Cincinnati just across the fifty for the Bengals Dalton throws and that is incomplete it was in the hands of Tyler board we must have complimented him too much she was not able to hold it down so this is likely going to be applied for the bangles that there are the defender got ahead and there are a little bit\nLittle bit could've caught it tough cat doesn't get it or this bangles Steelers game I like gets look right now this is going to be a battle today they're tied seven ...\nCorner on board this time melt in defending them instead of a linebacker on his touch downed reception so I have a feeling he's going to be divvied up by a secondary players for the rest of the night\nAlright falcons ... bucks territory Philip Rivers has got the ball in his hands again will follow all of that when we come back it's weak six in the NFL\n[noise] [noise]\nThings are looking for those who have problems winning in the past because Michael Rosie's giving it away legal rules guarantees winners against the spread out of every penny releasing neighbors and when she is the only handicap or a good enough for confident enough to releases winters when a recording\nThese games will do the talking salesmen call now from Michael roses pro football lack of the week hundreds real five zero zero zero for the single biggest lane Michael rules\nGoing to get it and I have you get it absolutely free recorded message one eight hundred three or five zero zero zero four\nI just called and it's on there right now I didn't speak to a salesman I didn't leave personally for me and I simply call one eight hundred three five zero to zero four\nGuys with all the week's absolutely free that's one eight hundred three or five zero zero for\nEight hundred three or five zero to zero or\n\nHelp bring chaos icy Iowa City sockeye sports station and now all the University of Iowa sports we carry are available via streaming fat cats like ... dot com\n[noise]\nFox Sports trending\nMore presented by true car online car shopping can be confusing not anymore was true pressure true car you know the exact price you pay for your next car so it was a true car to enjoy it more confident car buying experience\nAs off into coordinator in it is in Minnesota because I'll remind you Mike Zimmer he's a defensive head coach he's calling plays on that side of the ball he's hoping that the OC handles ... Kirk and they can get rolling and it hasn't really clicked in the season you sort of suspect\nThat they're going to have growing pains offensively because this doesn't look like sure MERS dynamic put anybody\n... the position and we're going to have success that we saw a year ago out of Minnesota\nFor free winters daily go to Vegas covers dot com Vegas covers dot com and a reminder that were alive and the guy go Fox Sports radio studios Fifteen minutes get David Fifteen Percent or more on car insurance guy could calm for a free rate quote is marked with a rich or and burger red zone radio weeks six of them were following along\nAnd it seems to be a theme that's building so far today requested a quarterback and then he goes out of touch down Dr ... a Jew a pharmacist\nAnd the Panthers are on the board as they try to mount a comeback Seventeen to stick with the extra point on the way and also it looks like the interception in Atlanta\nHas been confirmed of James Winston it's not other than the Monterey Casey who's been thrown into duty this year and it's playing really well\nYeah he's having a tremendous tremendous return on investment they made in him he was a draft pick a couple of years ago or out of San Diego state and he's\nBeen a backup rural there's been a special team or but when he's gotten time with the first deep and he's made it absolutely count you know Neal goes down with me he comes in and he's been a turn over generator the same way he was when he was in college as an Aztec it's transferred to the NFL football field\nThese are the times when you look at a defense and you say yeah they're porous\nThey allow people to score on them at will but if you can draw derived turnovers and you have a high powered up and you get a second chance opportunity dropping the ball game\nI'm just watching the play right now in Cincinnati we're watch this from Vance McDonald\nYou remember the Sunday night game or was it a Monday Night game against Tampa Bay where just swore defender often and what about Seventy arts for a score watch this rock was burger hits him for about a six year our past you get off of me\nYou get off of me you get off of me he brags about three ... and turn this into about a twenty five thirty are gay\nWell in the first one was bond says perfect then when you have a tight end going against the heavy hitters are like that on the Cincinnati Bengals defense and he's able to shrug him off you can guarantee that big Ben's going to be looking for is\nTight and again and I imagine that is going to be a storyline today because that was\nThat was a pretty incredible uh run after that that was awesome All right we're six National Football league or following all of it and the games are starting to take shape so don't go

they're starting a quarterback today for the injured Ryan tannahill\nThrows a five year touchdown pass and Nick O'Leary us while they're twelve of Nineteen for one fourteen a touchdown and an interception\nThe falcons at one and four and desperation mode today and they've got a twenty four and a Thirteen halftime lead\nOver Tampa Bay Matt Ryan twenty of twenty four for two forty with two touchdown passes and the first at Washington a Seventeen to six halftime lead over the Carolina Panthers the Seahawks with a Seventeen to nothing halftime lead over the writers in a game being played at ... stadium in London\nRadio receiver Omari Cooper being evaluated for a concussion after taking a blatant helmet to helmet shot from Bradley McDougal of the sea hawks that was somehow not penalize\nEven Scotland Yard concluded it was a penalty but apparently not the NFL officiating crew climbing at halftime or the Thirteen to ... lead over the Arizona Cardinals\nThe Texans with a ten nothing lead over the bills thirty seven seconds of the third quarter the chargers up Twenty one to three at Cleveland with eight seconds left in the second quarter Philip Rivers a pair of touchdown passes to Cairo Williams including the one that mark in which we're talking about a moment ago twenty nine you order that counted despite a blatant\nFalse start by charters left tackle Russell oh cool and it was a missed by the official touched down in the books Cleveland is just added and other field goal so they are now Twenty one to six to the chargers at halftime and finally also asked on the jets up twenty three to Thirteen over the Indianapolis Colts mark and rich\nBy writing good stuff by law we very much appreciate it we are alive and the guy called Fox Sports radio studios easy to say Fifteen Percent or more in car insurance was Geico go to guy could are calm recall eight or nine four seven auto the only hard part\nFigured out which way's he's you're also brought you buy discover card we treat you like you to treat you interesting about charger brown game the way you Jackson is playing this an addict that field goal I Know right before halftime on\nThird down and we're going to hold everything 'cause there's a flag on the play the field goal was good points on the board but the clock read zero and there's a flag on the field and everyone still on the field so we'll find out what's going on there but the rounds of attitude trips to the red zone just the last ten minutes\nAnd potentially they're only coming out of that with three points are because the last time in there the browns actually just outside the red zone there are about up to twenty five yard line out a forced into\nOr talked about this earlier the lack of confidence in kicking at that time it was fourteen to three your jacket elected to go for it instead of kicking a field goal and they pass was incomplete\nWaffling in these situations I think he realized okay um I trusted my our fence to get it done and it didn't work\nAnd you have an opportunity to close the gap a little bit here make this a to score game if you add in at least one to point conversion on one of those two touchdowns scores\nAnd you're you're right back in this ball game right so I think instead of creating a situation a situation where you're off ensues has confidence in him in itself\nYou give your kicker and opportunity here's the thing about that play we just saw it was called on the defense the the rush team against the field goal and so instead of taking on time down\nIt's halftime and they have the six points on the board from that that field goal or the penalty being decline in that field goal being real good and so yeah yeah look this is the worst showing in the first half I Believe we've seen out of the brown so far this season\nAnd Baker may feel since you started and has never looked more wobbly at the position\nAnd I think some of that has to do with that early ankle or need tweak we saw in the near side when he stepped out of bounds on the the first down monitor any twist it up a little bit so he's he may be playing hurt\nAnd that's the sort of stuff that you really need to see out of your starting quarterback\nHow does he play when it comes out of the locker room and he's down to scores at half time\nHow does he play when he's hurt this is an unfriendly league from both those standpoint you're going to play down a lot you're going to play hurt a lot what are you got number six they're going to be relying on you for the remainder of your coat career to be the guy even though the the situation is stacked up against\nYou while in the charger defense I'll have my eyes on them still know Joey bows out but I Know that when you get a rookie quarterback\nOr in a situation like that where the defense is going to know exactly what you're doing Cleveland's gonna move away from the run game now\nThat's a dangerous spot where turnover is going to happen and uh and the chargers have some ball hawks back there there are when James and whatnot and so\nUh we'll see how that factors into the second out Twenty one to sex penalty was on the chargers so declined it's halftime Twenty one to six and your daily fantasy play of the day so far has been tied around well you know I Know where you could probably get on the super cheap\nThree catches one hundred eighty nine yards and to score is coming up in ten minutes we'll give you our first\nFantasy ticker of the dead also let's go back to Miami we haven't been there since that opening Dr touchdown for bronchitis wild and there's been a good reason for it nobody else is going in the game\nYou know what I had it early conversation off the air or I stated I'm not yet a believer in the bears off ants in what I mean by that is not that they're not improve they definitely are\nAnd not that in certain spots they won't perform like they did when we last saw them once you're busy had six steps down throws\nAgainst the bus defense which gives up a lot but today I I I just felt like this wasn't going to be a good spot for them I don't know if it's an often that as I Would say travels yet\nLook at the rams off and they go up to Seattle yeah thirty something points again it's an often that travels I don't think the bears are there yet they've started the second half they still got to say on the board\nYeah you know and this is one of the league's best defenses I I mean you're talking about the ad that bottom third Miami you know the dolphins they they've they've underperform to the reasons that you know and ... there was no longer there he didn't really work out so now to\nA huge bad move by them not making it work with sue or so so no issue there but\nBut this isn't a particularly tell the defense and they've held them at bay through this game so far interested to see how this game uh works out on the other side of the half because I I really do have a lot of faith the matinee game what he's been able to do with some of the pieces employees\nIn Chicago and some of the pieces they've added obviously at the tight end position but beyond that\nThis to me is a multiple option often ... out of the backfield with Colin and and Howard\nI'm I I think they're they're I think they're going to be the surprise of the NFL season we'll see how it goes well\nThey've got a really good thing going on in the first minute of the second half in that ... fitzpatrick was just called for a deep ball down the field pass interference\nAnd so the bears have got the ball right now in the red zone a section in four at the Miami nine yard line so see if they can turn this into sex maybe tied the game right there to recall on who you just mentioned\nAnd to be playing well and you also need to protect them up and someone has been ... well that's the bigger story here but he lie manning look when's the last ... is head coaches the quarterback and he's wearing a one in five record right now

carries for Ninety eight yards and three touchdown then the jets up thirty six to twenty seven over the coals five minutes of the fourth quarter Sam Darnell twenty three of twenty nine for two Seventy six with two touchdown passes and an interception marketer rich\nOkay let's go to Miami where his feet in ... the Albert Wilson touchdown to point conversion good Thai ball game so that interception from mixture basically a few minutes ago\nIncredibly damaging as the bears were up by eight a Trump is in the bears looking to score and more\nAnd instead he throws a pick the dolphins take it all the way down the field the other way we ourselves ... minutes to go\nAnd you know it's funny I'm I'm starting to remember the commentary used to ... when the world love them some rock when he was with the Denver Broncos and shades of his time as the sun double it as you and his time\nAs the the the head honcho in Denver while I was waiting for the sheriff\nPeyton Manning to return to the fold in the postseason or he can run around a little bit and extend plays and he flashed that arm off that six foot eight frame for the touchdown or I should say the two point conversion corner than zones so yeah a great adjustment of wing pressure and making a nice play outside the pocket\nAll right and then we also have a lot of eyes in Cincinnati where down the stretch we come with six twenty two to go in the game\nAnd right now the Steelers out the ball and the lead Seventeen to fourteen but a second ... in their own territory is coming up and just a moment are really good football game they're Redskins out the ball up twenty to Seventeen\nWe'll keep an eye on that falcons up by two they've got the ball in buccaneers territory twenty four twenty two is the score there and the Houston Texans have now got something going just under four minutes to go they've got a first and goal at the buffalo a trailing by three\nCould take the lead you'd think likely to at least get the tie out of this a little bit surprised after a good start by just shot and watching the Texans often thousand scored and about an hour and a half\nHe's been picked off twice today only as author twenty three yards through the air\nBut they finally got something going there threatening at home to try to take the lead against the belt\nAnd the division rivalry in Cincinnati between the Steelers and the bangles just got more interesting Antonio Brown\nOn a little too man route to the far side breaks free on a slant catch run after reception all the way down to what the seven yard line so the Steelers knocking on the door they read by three Seventeen fourteen fourth quarter only six Thirteen remaining in this game and\nBoy this has been back and forth back and forth and now a member of the bangles secondary Jackson comes up lame on the plane and he is spinning cursing as you have the field I don't think he's well\nNo and saw the Steelers going to be just outside the tent I think first intend coming up I'm added the Bengals can hold onto a field goal they still have a realistic\nShot in this game I bought a touchdown here would probably be curtains for the bangles also another player I Want to mention you know we haven't mentioned today is Adrian Peterson at age thirty three oh suffered a dislocated shoulder on Monday Night football popped it back in himself\nCame into that game originally with an ankle injury by the way so he's dealing with multiple injuries\nPeterson today Fifteen carries for eighty five yards also are involved in the past and game a little bit as well what an incredible performance\nWhether it was related to Libya on bell or any of the other dramatic issues surrounding that team they've got it right it they blew out Atlanta last week\nIf they can hold on and get a road went in Cincinnati there three to and wanted in pretty good shape\nWell the craziest thing about the Steelers is this just happens all the time they always have some off the field\nIssue lingering with the starting quarterback or the star receiver or they have a defender who's unhappy with the way he's being treated by the officiating crew or\nIts Tomlin with certain actions on the sidelines tripping players they always have drama follows the Pittsburgh Steelers and you don't expect it I think because during the AFC North than this is hard nose grind it out football you don't expect to see that sort of level of drama but it appears every single year so if there's a team\nWho is apt to handle that it's a team that goes through it on his consistent basis that's the Pittsburgh Steelers and they've had success through at all so until they show that chicken the armor where they no longer can can\nKeep that to prop this up so to speak or you have to have believed that Pittsburgh is going to ham it up they're going to figure it out at some point in the season and like I said many times\nNobody is winning Super Bowls in September ... everybody ... like even if your team is one in three leaving the first four games of the season everybody likes overreact\nNothing's official until we hit yeah turkey time\nHere comes a broadcast Wyler and the dolphins are going to get a really nice place\nTo go on all the way he's at the thirty but it's funny that said\nIs he going to find his way and he will touchdown and the dolphins come right back with a one\nPlane dry was that Albert Wilson again Albert Wilson again\nAnd this was a simple even broadcasts while the Saudis adds up there like I don't know what I did I tell you what you did you throw the ball over the middle of the field for five yards it out or oils and did the rest unbelievable were still ... three minute mark and now we're an extra point away from a tie game again in Miami\nWell this is this is the danger you run into in the NFL this day and age you are going to see a lot more men coverage because when you played zone what you're relying on as your defenders making plays coming up and snapping out receivers well\nYou can't do that anymore because they throw a flag when you hit receivers down field from the secondary cc more men coverage and when yeah man coverage and you spread the field with only receivers it takes beating one guy and then you're off to the races and\nSo we're seeing a lot more of this in the league these days alber Wilson do tremendous effort a single singularly responsible for the dolphins\nAre taking ... she's been nodding it up here in the waning moments of this game\nExtra point is good so the game is tied the buccaneers are going to get a touchdown that's paid and barber over the middle of the cat's pajamas Winston\nThree forty seven o'clock it's a three point game with an extra point on the way\nSo the buccaneers still have work to do there was a second in St for an adult and over the middle complete down to the Lebanese yard line and again it's AJ green and so that's a first intent from the eleven admitted forty four to go the Steelers leads ... to fourteen\nBut the bangles aren't going to have\nA few shots at the end zone right here also pass along the Texans momentarily that drives stalled they kicked a field goal to tie and there were two minutes left to go Nathan Peter men on the drive to try to win the game for buffalo\nPick six she used in Nineteen bills Thirteen minutes twenty three to go Peter mid strikes again\nYeah Peter men look he's had a limited opportunities in this league or he was thrust into action on the road in LA to face the chargers when the Buffalo Bills inexplicably bench to rod Taylor\nAnd he threw five first half interceptions and basically it has an improved drum there he's done some nice things he's done many many bad things even as a backup coming in the game where the defense isn't prepared\nFor okay bangles second in three from before they'll hand a mixed in and is in touch down for the Cincinnati Bengals and they have even to the game\nAnd again you know what

throws middle of the field\nAnd that's completed the Sean Jackson but tick tick tick down to twenty down to Nineteen they've got to get up there and spike the ball they're now down to the Twenty one yard line Winston is now ready he will spike it down to twelve seconds so you might have two shots at the end zone here from the Twenty one\nBut there are only down five the buccaneers could steal this game\nThis is amazing and this is exactly what we're talking about Jim is when ... when like this he absolutely no needs to start encouraging the buccaneers staff that he's grown he's matured he can handle the moments and this\nWith two opportunities twelve seconds on the clock I mean could squeeze out a third possibly but doubtful they'd have to go shallow and a quick pass on the first play or second potentially to squeeze in a third and so we are seeing the waning moments of this game Jim is with the snack three receivers side up top he's in the pocket in trouble gets rid of the ball on the line\nI could have taken a stock which would have ended the game gets rid of it throws out of bounds\nLive another day seven seconds ago might have two shots are definitely has at least one right here um overtime underway in Miami Miami with the ball first I guess the Chicago Bears twenty eight twenty eight and a game that has had just all kinds\nOf twists and turns so we'll take a look at the dolphins there and just a second but front and center Seamus twins than in the box or down early big twenty four to six of the falcons rally back\nThirty four twenty nine is the score seven seconds to go there at the falcon Twenty one and here comes the shotgun fly from Winston a draw\nUp to the middle and then it's going to try to loud ruin it's picked up by a buck another one and\nThen Josh accent they want to add it they want to get it on\nBoth leave a ballplayer call they just ran acute draw what what was about Twenty one yard line that was supposed to be the old ah hooking ladder so he gets his much yard is just you can and starts the pitch back Jane\nAnd this was perfectly blocked the Atlanta Falcons run a three man rush and so often some wind takes care of the line of scrimmage yeah Jim is rundown feel fires the behind him and like you said twice over all the ball made its way in the south to the sideline and they decided\nThey almost data Winston throw got bottled by a few guys Mike Evans finally picked it up through it to discharge jak sit on the sidelines who was by himself for an easy walking and if he can catch it goes right through is\nLike oh I was a male what I'll tell you what the Sean Jackson documenting solves doing right now but here's jerseys really happy about that the officials because I'm not sure out all the Seamus twins since first throw was actually a lateral\nIt was really close so it was on the border it was on the border as you're talking about a really complex and controversial review if indeed\nA if indeed that had work but it doesn't the falcons when I Know why you're not win thing again broadcast while from Miami just threw the ball down the ball glanced off the back of who he was trying to throw it to the U.S will set it landed into the arms of another receiver and turns into a big gain or first out embarrass errors\nOr diamond Dole or with running back and what ended up happening is Kenny Stills was what I I at the top of his rowdy just pause\nAnd was working his way back down towards the line of scrimmage just well actually it was a scam scramble drill that's why I stopped his route and so bounce a famine does hands in a fortuitous we lands in stills and so they're deep into bears territory here and overtime\nOr just inside the forty on that Kenyan Drake runs a second and aid coming up we'll take a look at

moved to four and two on the year quietly no one believes what I'm for into\nAnd the patriots will need to win a tough one tonight in order to keep pace with them in the air sees long touchdown catch for Emanuel standards forty four yards the Broncos if even things up with the rams six six\nExtra point on the way more on that game the jags cowboys and need your thoughts on she's patriots tonight as well but let's get a quick fantasy ticker in here first [laughter]\nFox Sports fantasy ticket [noise]\nI Know we're going to start well with what ended up being the game when he touched down in Atlanta\nTight in the running back home a Jones the receiver [noise] here's Ryan looping coal but the cat down a lot of ... out of there too it's\nFootball player or nobody was there\nHe got in coal miner with the touch down for the falcons ends up having a very good day as the falcons wind thirty four to twenty dollars Dawkins radio network\nOr he back\nGap jeeze oh Jim is Winston meeting all quarterbacks right now in fantasy scoring thirty or forty one passing almost four hundred yards generic three Ninety five for touchdowns also through too big but don't hold that against him because he rushed her by for thirty one he was a reason that the bucks pulled it off in Atlanta\nWe just gave you the end of this game and it was a loss for the bears but there's another story are we getting ready to Ross Mitch strip is key as a fantasy quarterback\n\nThey're bears radio network and you're busy today the real deal twenty to thirty one three hundred and sixty and yards three touchdowns did outta pick rowing forty seven yards rushing and you've got yourself twenty seven point three fantasy point\nRwandan the clock to a game that was over before it started practically hard in Cleveland and Mel go went off\nAnd this time it's a pitch Gordon again he's got the left side line than than it is the third day\nMelvin Gordon or so and that play a pitch out where he basically ran on touched on both of them one he leaped\nOver a player or Eighteen rushes one hundred thirty two yards on the ground three touchdowns rushing but also attack on the receiving he's been great every single time or two more uh catches up of for target date yard\nYeah Mel go and go to the scores table and do that stuff curries ring count 'em off one two three touchdowns re Melvin Gordon today we gave you Michel ... but quickly becoming one of his favorite targets out of the back the old is the little guy number twenty\nTwenty one you're allowed to Miami out of a shock I ended up\nCalling\nThe recall and five Jerry's is all thirty one yard touchdown throwing seven catches for Ninety yard and he's up over twenty three vantage points today bears radio network\nOther side of that game Miami a whole meal my Albert Wilson Albert\n[laughter] sports\nRadio by the the dolphins radio network and Albert Wilson ma already he waited for six reception a hundred fifty five yards heck of an average there to touch down\nNow Albert Wilson has been good but there is only one receiver and the national football league has gone over a hundred yards in every single one of these games and he plays the ball nor\nCal Fire [noise]\nOregon I Am a site and it is [laughter]\nTo me the most season ever [laughter]\n[noise] are you in because we are down the far\nI'd have to leave it to me to do\nThat here as we cover the new season on Fox Sports radio pat Pat's why\n\nDo you find out fast one on your TV go to ... dot com or detail pass pass why [noise]\nAre you not entertained you don't want to get the job was around ten enough\nThat Prescott is now fumble twice and recovered it himself twice I I'm I'm starting to feel like we're we're seeing you know them get a little lucky for the first time the season instead of just being good football but hey sometimes that's all you need to sort of flipped the script [noise] Jacksonville is a really good defense\nOr however I Will say if this touchdown is good they go by time on the road Blake morals is not a down by ten on the road\nFrom our back now that that that that's out but soft spot in the Dallas pass the fence is actually not bad\nSo a Baker die they could make that want to get our glee quick raven get attached out Michael Crabtree from Joe Flaco\nOffer a score they lead in Tennessee seven and not paying off a Dallas touchdown is under review so technically they're only have three nothing but the call on the field was touched down so that for you in the rams\nContinue to lead at Denver six to three at our threatening for more we had said earlier and Emanuel Sanders got a forty four yard touchdown catch\nThey ended up reviewing it calling him down at the one and then the Broncos didn't get in\n... and penalties things forced them back and they end up settling for three so the rams out the lead and I and our closing inside the red zone once again\nAnd you just want to talk about things going the right way for team that's been playing well on top of it is the rams even when they had the closest one\nAt Seattle uh there were some mistakes made by Pete Carroll second chance opportunities for the rams they go forward on fourth down in their own territory and they get it to go on to a road victory in the closest game that they played so far this season\nAnd they do look unstoppable and often and they're in the red zone right now twelve yard line going in against the Broncos first\nDown starting to talk of girly pop sport for three so it's going to be first in gold about the ... yard line will watch that one for you also definitely want to get your thoughts on tonight I Know everybody has been kind of focusing on this young quarterbacks never going to Fox Berlin when saying\nThere was this stat that quarterbacks twenty five and younger in the ballot jak Brady era\nOr have gone into Fox or forty two times and their record is one forty one the only time that they've ever won was calling ... one game there with the forty niners I think the father was like thirty eight thirty five but it was a crazy game I remember it um but\nUh that's twenty five and younger more homes is is younger is part of the younger of the twenty five ... oh yeah yeah no one under twenty five has ever done it\nNo one hundred twenty five as ever done it but I also feel like that's a stat that doesn't really hold up we're talking about a new NFL where things are easier for the quarterbacks and Patrick malls in the chiefs have got to roll and this is this is going to be hard for the patriots tonight there\nIs no doubt and that's that complicates a further because\nIf you look at the stats those quarterbacks put up\nA five hundred eighty one completion stood up thousands Seventy passes thrown works out to something like a fifty four point three percent also the touchdown interceptions\nThirty one to forty four now you're talking about a bunch of guys right but when you compiled those statistics into an average it out into a single player what you get is somebody\nAbout the quibbling of a job market is Russell you know so it's it you're you're talking about holding these first and second year in and even in some cases third year quarterback\nTo such a low total thresholds as far as their play goes but I Will say that\nIf there's a team to fear even coming into Fox bro where they have an absurd winning percentage at home it's a cheap\nBecause then you read those are tremendous job gain planning around the skills of his players all of his sources are healthy pap homes is playing out near unstoppable rate\nI I mean I just use the same word to describe the rams as they converting the red zone ... legs and so they go up twelve three in this game\nI I'm I'm telling you the chief send the rams are looking about as as a fish in a ... I've ever seen so the patriots have their hands full tonight in Fox ...\nExtra point is good in Denver rams deli Thirteen to three they did wiped the touched out off the board in Dallas only to abduct Prescott run it in on the very next why\nI'm an extra point is good so ten nothing Dallas leads\nThirteen to three the rams lead against Denver\nAnd as we said Baltimore leads the titans seven denouncing what is it about that match up saying I mean everybody with his game tonight is going to remember the opener of the NFL season last year when it's used widely in their busted up over forty point it was coming out party a whole lot to the NFL for Kareem hard\nAnd so there is something that Andy Reid knows about hotter score on this nice fat\nSports coaching and Andy Reid is an off into the architect he understands again\nHow the defense is going to plant a the patriots events and I was a part of this team for many years they take away a game record so it whether it's Travis Kelsey or whether it's to re killed they're going to take someone away to absolutely need to be able to react and Andy Reid does that as good as any up and to coach in the ...\nWell that one's going to be a whole lot of fun this was a whole lot of fun good job partner or the rest of the game you're Fox Sports radio takes you the rest of the way on awake six\n[laughter]\nA sports fans football season's

cowboys it had nothing lead over Jacksonville after one the rams with a Thirteen to three lead a Denver five minutes it at the second quarter Todd girlie with a ten yard touchdown run the ravens have a seven nothing lead a Tennessee at late in the opening quarter\nIt's one of those guys where if you got him on your team and look sick all the off the field to go away for a second but but he's always been going back to his Florida State days\nHe's a gambler and he will take the shot at the big play a lot like Brett Farr would do back when he played and so far in one sense young career or they've heard it you know the only quote the only player in the league it's turned the ball over more than he has a ... foot in the NFL was like ... now I Would add\nUp until last year with Jacksonville and the guy who have the second those turnovers during that time frame was Eli Manning the one thing all three of those guys have in common obviously if they had very bad team since two thousand fifty\nIt's only been one year that James had a decent team around and so you know look he feel twenty four years old and a you know he can get himself together off the field I still think he has a chance to be a really good lawyer\nTom Burnham and joining us again was on the call for that book that falcons game where the falcons you get the victory thirty four to twenty Ninety from salaam Calvin Washington with you buck sports radio Tom let me ask you this you you mentioned uh he's only twenty four year old he being Wednesday so only twenty four years old this is his last year and the contract if you were the bucks now we know quarterbacks are falling off trees\nDo your resigned them and just hope that he grows and it gets better or do you look elsewhere maybe look in the draft or maybe free agency\n[noise] you know that that that's that's a tough one to answer and and you know what I simply don't know what I Would I think I'd have to wait and see how the rest of this year goes\nThe issues that he is head off the field of come during the off season now you stop and think about a guy you know when you're when you're trying to win games and you're trying to get into the playoffs and your quarterbacks getting suspended either for something to get off the the older stuff and he did stupid on the field of New Orleans I did that game last year when you start poking\nMarsh on ... and the talk of the head on a play over near the buccaneers ...\nYou know you gotta ask yourself the question can I count on this guy being my guy for sixteen weeks during the season is just two years in a row\nSo you know I don't know do I think he has a talent do I think he has this march\nTo I think he has the attitude of being an excellent starting quarterback it a winning starting quarterback I Do but you know I tell the story all the time I I Do a lot of baseball as you guys do and it reminds me a lot of the old days although you know very different circumstances but it reminds me of the old days when\nI got to know relatively well Dwight Gooden in Darrell strawberry and\nYou'd be around these guys and they were very engaging they were plus if they were polite they were nice guys that relatively quiet guys to be around\nAnd you know then you open the newspaper three weeks later and they're involved in something and you're like I Can't believe about the same guy right so you know I don't know what I Would do he's put them in a really really\nTough spot 'cause you just can't count on him\nThat is true and obviously with the starting quarterback you need to count on them and you need him to be that\nLeaders AOL when when one of my family to count on one\nOf my favorite thing I've ever heard in the guy who does the Bengals games on radio was a great off that's why the NFL a guy named Dave Chappelle\nThe most important part of ability is availability\nWell one of my favorite line it is and and you have a player who has all account in the world but if he's not available to play for what ever reason history of injuries history of problem solved the old happen stupid stuff on the field\nI'm you know if he available to your team and this is the second year in a row or went status not\nWell we'll see how the season unfolds you're right about that will have to wait and see thank you Tom we appreciate it safe travels\nGuys you have a great weekend they're joining us on Fox last Sunday football football Sunday that is\nA ... couple of touchdowns we've got to talk about the cowboys just scored and also the ravens a score

Murray ran for one fifty five and the Vikings twenty seven Seventeen victory over Arizona and the chargers rounded about rounds in Cleveland thirty eight to fourteen Kelvin and even back to you\nBut we appreciate it thank you and it's just been one of those daisy for we're going back to back to back talking to people who are calling these games right now is our man Charles Davis who was that the Panthers at Redskins game Redskins get a victory over the team I pick to represent the intimacy in the super bowl when I was in her phrasing myself on how great of a pick that was where there's\nA but they do fall and the Redskins were able to do this or get this victory when they really needed it\nAnd uh the the friends came up at the end big when the ... Carolina Panthers had a chance to win what was the victory akita victory for the Redskins Charles\nGetting out of the gate fast guy I mean you take a look what they've done this year go back to the Arizona games they want to go back to the Green Bay game that they want to check out today\nThey lead from the front Jake route and told told us when we had him before Green Bay we are running team we're not come from behind team but he didn't say that with a lot of uh how would you say praise in his voice\nYou know he loved to have a team that he feels like make a return and pick it up late but he has not seen that from his ball club\nThat was getting off the bat starts well check out the numbers against Arizona Green Bay they got off to the start winning and today they got off so fourteen and nothing start so when they do that they are different ball club make you chase from behind ... they play a whole lot better than they did that to Vegas Carolina\nI talk about how important a Adrian Peterson has been to them in their three when when you look at the three wind he's had a you know an average of a hundred yards rushing in those three I was just feeding him the ball really\nTakes a lot of pressure a of Alex Smith how important is he to this team\nHe's very important to them and it's actually been a little bit of a surprise I don't know how many of us thought that when he signed with Washington that he'd be able to be the ... that we would look at thinking that over sixteen games he's going to make this and of course you know how he is he hears that he gets crazy it's like the red cake in front of a ball the charges\nAnd you're exactly right I mean Ninety six yards and when it Arizona then he comes back with a hundred and twenty two touchdowns green bank control than he has another big day to day so when they do that you mentioned take the pressure off of Alex Smith and throwing the football\nI don't you know we hear the word balance all the time I don't know that I hear it with this much\nConviction and the city as I hear it when I went to Washington team talks about the on the ballot they absolutely need it they got it today for Peterson and then all sorts of line that played a really nice game they remember they missed a couple of key got only ... starting to center case really start center played guard today again\nBecause they ended up a shovel valleys been versus Indianapolis game so that makes most\nHey Charles we know you're going to go so I'll hit you with one more I Want to go to the other side of the ball the Carolina Panthers or what what why aren't they as explosive I don't know it seems like something's missing what would you say is missing from that offering so from that team to take them to the next level\nI think that the the ability to get the deep shot where you're going to ... play that you that you're terrified you think that it's Torrey Smith\nOkay guys after sixteen yard to catch in his career but we haven't really seen that from him yet he had one of his better days today I think it up catch the ball game to game with only seven to catch up here so who's going to be that one Curtis Samuels back off the injured list and he should be the guy\nBut he barely was even mentioned today I think we mentioned it might've kickoff return getting\nGreg also back helps McCaffrey helps but they've got to find a way to take the top officer defenses and open up more space for those guys underneath all the watch people keep stepping forward step it forwarded it started to took real grinder up a game for them and I think we had a little bit of that today it got to get some water to press it down field\nRight Charles we'll let you go man we appreciate your joining us hopefully next week\nThanks a lot guys ...\nTravel\nOr anybody else we want to get in front of my mom my mom was watching the game what what'd you think mom and I got my stepfather I Know he was watching the game and went to the but the\nTo hit on the Carolina Panthers ... it was you know you're gonna be different ... last Saturday and tell him anything there quietly doing X Y you lead doing that and I'm like you are you guys\nBut they don't have big play capability that is true\nIn the running game or independents in game\nAnd until they figure out a way to string like Charles Hussein stretch the field everything is being done everything you know two three four yards here maybe nine your route they don't have the ability to really push a deep fits back\nIn the secondary to open up the field and you just can't be all screened let me ask you this\nThen he's not him okay follower I'm going okay\nUh and the rams are Thirteen and three on the Broncos and a Seventeen and nothing you have the cowboys are up a twenty four actually I'm Sorry twenty four deaths in over the jags I Want to ask you a question about a quarter back that we have he's been hide these and praise and I think he accounts I think he's good I think we all know that but\nYou talked about this earlier with James ... and it's turned over with Andrew Luck\nAnd Andrew Luck did not have a great game today budget turnovers a team is not one in five and it's not quite as fought obviously they're not the most talented roster that's for sure\nUh but if you look at the last couple of the few seasons are only play seven ... seven games and twenty Fifteen he was two and five next year twenty six Daly plays Fifteen he's eighty seven this year so far through five he's wanted for\nIt's not a good record naive but everyone keeps saying he's you know the return of John Elway and and I think we see the ability there but he's turning the ball over a lot he hasn't been durable where are you on Andrew Luck\nI put 'em right with Matthew Stafford okay right I I you know he has talent of course you have talent but he hasn't been able to connect the dots yet great early success\nAnd since then injuries lack of um help offensively\nUh in terms of weapons receiving running the ball\nOr so we've we've kind of seen him take a few steps back coming off the injury and not really having those go to weapons um that he had early in his career\nAnd right now him Matthew Stafford like they're right in that you can win some games with them they have the talent they can throw the ball and get you dig up but over four hundred yards um\nBut they can't take you to that next step that next level\nUp I get better like that um he\nI Would say not as explosively maybe talented but as far as winning in any kind of your confidence in I'd say Alex Smith too and that then that realm\nWell no I ... I Would put outlets it's you're above oh really\nYeah because he's shown that he can lead a team to victory in in ... in the play offs but he's got I'm Alex Smith was one of those guys leading Kansas City passed and it'll look\nRight and they were up by like twenty four points in the second half so Alex Smith has taken that mix that but he\nBut I I guess my thing was he's not as talented the ... the two guys you name a natural town just pure natural talent but as quarterback\nThe talent is one thing but being able to lead a team is another thing\nSo if I have they're both twenty three years old and you're going to happen for the next\nTen years and then you take out some of the ... you\nKnow I Would take Andrew Luck I Would I Would make sure I have a problem the gym I Would put pieces together I Will make sure that we gave this kid a dynamic running game in an office of line and you know some rock solid tied in in in like I Would do the things you're supposed to do once you lock in\nYour your um\nYour quarterback you're you're you're the face of your friends are as you do once you have him on a rookie contract then you go out you build your team\nI think the issue as you mentioned it's been a lack of talent or around him and it's similar to another quarterback although he has been able to win a championship and and they have some more more success and I think he's had more time around them but there are times where we say man can Aaron Rodgers get some help\nCan air I agree with it more guys whether it be defensively whether it be running game and he's got it running backs as just a you got wide receiver the running back so I think Aaron Rodgers has a similar case where you say man I Know he's good I Know he's talented\nBut he could just get some help around them but the difference is Aaron is on that are elite level he he might be the best that he's three levels above you know look in and sit down about three and no no he's three\nBecause I really like you get you created some levels at that point [laughter] I added more or less yeah they got like four or level like more than ... like it was that three and then you've got air Roger that for you to put them in like six\n... ... I Know what I'm saying is in terms of elite right it's only what it's right now it's four elite quarterbacks in the NFL\nOkay I'm thinking of three who's the park as we got Brady yup yup Rogers and ... do you ever been around is there an yeah\nOkay I haven't been Rob a runoff is quite there anymore in Robert Byrd can throw over seven hundred yards in any moment says the guy who has them on a fantasy team does lend you know and it's not even about that it's about big\nBeing do look what he did today like he has that pedigree right so I\nI Would agree I Would agree with you that he has more into town right on right on right on point the highlights right there no bet is that guy ... those type of passes isn't it come on man\nHis ability to ... Matt Ryan into that Ryan that Ryan is a step below ... he he's below he's not elite really good but not All right I'm okay with that ah there's a team that are suffering and the raiders did they pay

enjoy more confident car by experience\nI don't I Know it went like this ... cut you off guard out\nOh that was been rocks burger talking about the root causes the running back okay so I Want to get to that just a minute but real quick with a B a B is starting to get an explosive ... forty a yard long reception the longest of the season was today he got the game winning touchdown he almost had one earlier he got tackled around the eight yard my he's got to go\nBut here's what's funny is is even with Antonio around doing his thing Judy Smith Schuster is kind of quietly I won't say he's our number one I think Antonio Brown and still the number one guy but man that's a great debate to have when you say is Jews you the number one I mean that it's a great\nSituation I remember a B is the more known guy but ... one wouldn't\nBe right one a one be\nBeen mocked his burger is going to spread the ball around for sure if you look I I Believe he threw the ball to ten different receivers you get through to some guy even though he caught a pass he threw a pastor was tip then he caught it himself so that counts as a target\nYeah I don't know if he was happy buddies yards though negative one yard so I don't think he was happy about that\nBut he was eleven different receivers that he targeted including him so I mean to have that type of ability it's hard to to put a guy if\nYou know ... being the number one guy when you look at a B a B is going to he's going to demand the double team so\nThat is true that anyone else has to step up and Jew Jew has done a tremendous job in getting that single coverage and taking advantage of the ... what the defense gives them\nAt absolutely true there and and that's where you've got to give credit to him actually Alex I Do want to go through been talking about James Caan are of course running back was that a lot of success this year I mean he's run the ball he's ... he's caught the ball he's got a really good season thus far but been talked about the fact that hey there may be our star running back coming back and living on bill\nJames spring attack was that that gets guys going you know it it gets your stuff that guys are being physical and um it it's a lot of fun to see guys aren't going to quit on place and ... and James I thought it was it was a bowling ball today it was all over the place what a great game but you know I Know it's his last game for us so slave I was coming back but I thought you'd want his last one\nNow what is that that's a joke right I mean he's of cheese in the rye because he he went last game maybe he made last game starting but that doesn't mean that just kind of can't place like Libya and has to run the ball\nEvery play so I I Believe it was a little tongue in cheek leaves back they're trying to me as if they're going to put him on the plane\nAlex now you don't know either\nAnd that's not bad it's that he's been gone for so long now you're going to get your value out of them make rent every freaking ball now since he's back okay now will make sure you're back we're gonna make you run every single ball or\nOr the opposite you spider\nDoes that come on back we've been winning some games lately with algae James counters looked like a a starting running back in this league were good without you know and again they're not going to not give lady on the ball the bell bell the ball but what I'm saying is look Connors been great I mean I can barely even on the roster so he'd be later on yeah so\nMaybe I'm not even on the roster the chart or anything so\nI think it's a little are they I think that all the websites update you know after last Sunday and Monday rolled around I think I think it all up day that'll be my guess\nBut as it still is what do you just\nThrow live

right now ... extra point is good to set it up you got twenty three twenty rams are over the Broncos no time out little time out obviously you're going to do it on psychic above twenty two left\nIn this game a final and the game of the the ravens titans Twenty one nothing ravens smack up the tides now for three and three four and two for the ravens a let's see if the Broncos they reduced and I'll tell you what\nI said it's when we were talking about the the rams a moment ago that we're seeing in our praise and then we should I mean I have a chance that looks like they're going to go six you know but the fact is managed Broncos hung in there\nThey hung in there and that's one of the advantages of playing a at home obviously especially a mob stadium right now though that touched down from the various Thomas is still under review\nSo it's still under review they gave him the points but it's still under review a so we'll see wait and\nSee what happens if they ever be on a review they kicked the Google are allowed to I thought it was on the way now okay\nOr am I take that back then and so All right twenty three twenty buck twenty two left on psychic coming up here you play so help me out is there any type of strategy to announce ... is there\nWhat do you want to do you want to a good balance\nRight so you want to be able to kick it down and just have a balance in the air the loan words in the air\nOr the better chance you have to recover\n... oh okay okay there's a little Sammy oh I had a ... oh yeah the shot at it\nA shot at it even that skirted on the ground yet you help in the air and then you have a chance as a ... a recovering team to run underneath that\nSo ah just to kind of give it to you how it is I played out the kicker did a little move switch sides a little semi little dance and then a kicked it but Robert was almost caught but then they bounce out of bounds so the game is essentially\nAnd a touchdown the rams held on to win at Denver twenty three to twenty to improve the six into\nTodd girlie ran for two oh eight a career high end two touchdowns it's the rams first two hundred yards rushing game since Marshall folic against the Panthers in two

I remember that is there any more that we're missing\nAh ah what's the what's the one I'm\nWith uh the the ... the younger brother although I'm baby gone gone gone gone good one that's a good one so they got ... may be gone and then they got gone girl between the two of them yes they do a lot of gone between those two brothers lot\nOf things last with the Affleck Robyn [laughter] [laughter] oh gentlemen it's a huge game tonight dare I say most important game of the season\nI think you're going to say that next week and then we got we got but however for this week yes you can go ahead and say well for him to keep\nPace with Miami in the division did is a huge game yeah huge\nGame but I think it's going to say so much about both teams for the chiefs it's going to mean the day of the real deal patch it's going to be more of the same you know it's going to be what we expected but let me let me throw that out there now this that might be rendered you know useless because of how polish homes is\nBought quarterbacks under twenty five in Gillette\nPatriots of twenty three and no no that's just that's the ... but you don't know what I Would say ... to that I Would say that everyone's heard that the last few days and then I Know Andy Reid is hard and think you\nKnow it doesn't matter it doesn't matter because the the thing and I'm leaning towards the patriots and is although I hate the patriots [laughter] I'm leaning towards them because it is something different to go up to ... to ... a farce borough and play and\nThe ... gonna defensively they're going to make them uncomfortable\nOkay they're going to take something away from him and although he is dynamic and he's talented the last couple of games he's shown that he's human that is true and the patriots have a way of really bringing Superman down to Earth Day are the kryptonite of the NFL\nThey find your best thing and they they eliminated\nAnd or at least neutralize it and say hey you got the beat us some other way um but I Will say this\nI I just wonder if that she used to have too much off for instance we haven't talked about this with the ramps demands haven't really had to feature tiger early in the backfield as much as they did today and then when they were when needed to do what they were able to do it he goes forward two hundred yards I'm Wondering if Kareem\nHasn't even been utilized enough because of the the passing and then you know drop it outside ... dropping off to a trap skills you do this do that and it's been working there so much off into so potent what did they get down there and it's called they start cream hunting you a bit\nThe ball he only Fifteen attempts at passing eleven of those\nEnded in the sec that's crazy so a Tennessee Titans\nYou got to do better man got on but it just lets you know what those credit the titans most anybody in the country has talked about them we talked about the Tennessee side for probably a total two minutes today and that is true that was impressive that was impressive so that's accredited him that they've come up and we got two minutes out of us as we can versus maybe usually about Fifteen seconds\nOr you know why I enjoy it I was I'm pleased with today\nA that is the tape is Marie ... twenty four Russians and you can maybe even\nSay that the entirety of the Vikings and that they knew to give him the ball in a rush for thirty two attempts and a hundred and Ninety five yards as a team of specifically with Marie twenty four Russia's hundred and fifty five yards a touchdown ah was able to even you know grab another ... a few yards but my point is\nLook her cousins definitely can win games what do you can also hurt your entire too and if you're able to run like this if you're able to get your deepest going and being as good or even even if it's you know three quarters as good as we thought it was supposed to be a and you did this without even having dealt with cook\nYou know which would give you that kind of that one two punch that you'd be looking for so I appreciate the way the tape is Marie ran today for the Vikings gave them a one two punch with Kirk Cousins passing the the ... and then obviously able to run with him so I was I was very very impressed with him married today in the Vikings often specifically to run again\nI was impressed with the the Miami Dolphins are more notably\nBrock ... you know I look man almost had a few more minutes later on either ...\nCame in twenty eight for forty four three hundred and eighty yards three touchdowns he did have to pick what he led the team to victory thirty one point they went in overtime against a vaunted bears defense there was one top suddenly\nThey gave up no sex which means he was getting the ball off so shout out to ... welcome back let's see if he can continue to do it ... back\nBut from what ... of security\nI mean he was cut by the browns though yeah\nYeah no that's a good game ... that's the game and they needed and got the victory so and by the way to give you a score here um with the Astros and the red Sox it was just too oh when I looked up and you and I started talking and now all of a sudden it's to to ash rows of tie this thing up I Can't say I think it's the bottom of the second uh\nOf course the actual ugly the series one oh and I was saying something to us all day to day just a rounded out\nNo foul ball ball ball\nOr but speaking of holdouts who they have they not a commercial with him in there and judge Aaron Judge is like seven foot three and Jose out today is like five four seven foot I may not exaggerated\nBut no no no no no I don't think he's into which they say that it would be John than you and your giant he's six a holiday said first of all slowly role player ... ...
