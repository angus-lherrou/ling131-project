goal that we ought to do what do you think\nOh man I you know here's what I Love about that play and I think we should do more but not the fact that we have to resort to those kinds of plays in order to beat teams I'm simply saying they give us that give ... give\nUs as viewers and fans an opportunity to see a little bit of a change up just a little bit it's like when you put the powder on the doughnuts [noise] sprinkle a little bit more on it or just the owners are hot\nPut a little bit of like a little bit something on it and I think this is what we saw today and I think people really got excited perfect play called the perfect time\nI'm totally unexpected something that they have not seen on film before and it's just that element of surprise so I was very um number one surprise leader fact that it works and scored was even a better um gratification for me so\nHow how long do you suppose it took ... to sell that play man well okay first of all it breaks all of\nOf conservatism point that's right what do we do hey we're supposed to take the points but but but but he has history here [noise]\nRight yes history BS big game history here\nWhere he can go now come on now I have history with this stuff I Know what I'm Talking about ... and I and I think our coaching staff really appreciate that I Know our leadership really appreciates proven history of researching the right type of sneaking is in little right you know ...\nIn Iowa and I were very straightforward right we like to keep it above board and just tell you we're going to punch in the nose and then punching the nose\nSpray other places they like to get a little sneaky and sometimes you know we we break form in swing with the left and cracking [laughter]\nBut I think it says a lot about cook's parents and the trust that he has with this coaches\nI mean I think sometimes coaches can be so controlling in the sense that they don't allow their their coaches to expand their areas of expertise and I think ... has enough confidence in his coaches and empowers this coaches to be able to make calls like that\nAnd feel confident whether it works or not the fact that it was able to be\nExecuted the way it was it just puts gravy on the potatoes in my opinion absolutely\nWon't consider he snapped it with his left hand and like he did this once or twice there's time and this is the lead and swing food\nAnd you got to make sure that you don't like take a step back and it ends up being a ladder All right right yeah are are are forward that pattern you want to it's got to be a lateral\nSo he just he just grabbed it launched in the hands\nRight on cue I mean that was that was I was thinking about the time they tried that good either rolled\nThe backfield somewhere random I'm sure there's going to get stuck in the two will mean you you\nWere going to be a little while and I want to hear they probably made a target for it I can see the targeting of art that guy just throwing it over there bam [laughter]\nBut you got to do but I think they were actually going to do it when they lined up there I you know I wasn't sure I thought this I thought what they were going to do is what they did against um Ohio State last yeah because that's why I was like a we've seen this before and when they when I realized\nWhat they were doing I was like wait a minute [noise]\nAnd then he snapped the ball with his left hand and they went in that\nLight the light [laughter]\nAnd and it almost\nTo a certain degree I wanted more exactly yeah but you know you know that was the play the well grandpa right\nBut you just had it in the game is on the plane near as good as the hogs are going to ... go for his ... just got to sell did they had their like early pre game and everything and it's all because I live and it all they do that and everybody goes crazy [noise] and the kids running around\nYou know I was scared Huck Finn and the place went crazy [laughter]\nThat's a that's a wake up call and it was fun and and it's great to see the guys have fun\nAnd I think that's what it's about I mean I think and I think that's the atmosphere that coach really wants them to play with it is to have some fun and to relax but\nAgain I mean look we will go back into our conservative nature which is how we do things but we just want to let the world know that if you play with us [noise] we do got to trick play here and there that we will play you a once in a while ha\nIt's once in a great while [laughter] but we will we got if we need it I Would imagine all of ours probably got a couple of more

all the rain and lightening and everything else but we were had\nIt's just a thinker McGregor almost went down on that punched in the second and McGregor is in big big trouble\nYeah the first round was spent on the ground and his main events UFC two twenty nine pay per view in Vegas round too could be with a left right combination that you mentioned then picked up McGregor and took him to the ground so they're spending much of round two there as well midway through the second round in Vegas the undefeated\n... made off against McGregor in his first M M A fight in nearly two years\nGuys Alabama is ranked number one in college football and never punted today\nAnd they now beaten Arkansas twelve straight times the final was sixty five to thirty one Alabama doesn't play any team that's currently ranked until they play LSU in November ... G and LSU last today at Florida twenty seven Nineteen gators with two touchdowns in the fourth quarter including a late ... six there were\nA combined Seventeen puns and Nineteen penalties in that game in Gainesville and the LSU quarterback transfer from Ohio State job or oh three hour and oversee was sad like five times in this game was not his day\nI I just can't understand why they are just so much better than I look I Know says they banned it but I mean head and shoulders better than everybody else\nWell when you're starting quarterback has three hundred and thirty four yards passing on ten completion yes and then leave the game ten of Thirteen for touchdowns for to talk of a little while\nTo us still hasn't yet this season thrown a pass in the fourth quarter [noise]\nNow that's just silly he hasn't been six were halfway through the regular season isn't we to the Ohio State quarterback had six touchdown passes today Dwayne Haskins through for four fifty five Ohio State was only up on Indiana twenty eight twenty at that but the final with guys forty nine twenty\nTo let me just jump in there I mean McGregor is just getting out\nOn the ground the whole time but I did it to go second\nNot stopping this looks like he may die I mean you just getting he's getting pummeled and their\nBeliefs getting hit but he isn't exactly you know it's not like chasing and losing energy that way but yes he is absorbing punches more in round two then round one by the way and again most of these first ten minutes\nBeing spent on the ground so the champion the undefeated lightweight champion is really having it his way I'm guessing this is what he would draw up and what how to draw up with the check he's going to catch shortly I'm sure\nAnd this is just the start of a U.S the deal he's beginning a new deal with us see of course\nThe beginning of the end uh no no he's got a few of our fight like you might not make it for the next couple of flights after this one\nIt's just a matter of how soon that actually what it is I guess still late in round two uh Georgia still undefeated rank number two in the country Thirteen penalties but they killed Vanderbilt forty one Thirteen Jake from three touchdown passes and the cleansing game\nSixty three three at Wake Forest unbelievable way different from last week wake punted twelve times and I only eleven first downs\nWake Forest as a team seven of twenty seven passing for Seventy four yards at one guy that meanwhile Clinton had almost seven hundred yards of off as\nWe mentioned uh two steps passing for Alabama on the ground for Clemson travesty B.

Dominion earlier in the season and that that'll down and you're the only way I felt far yeah that is absolutely I'm a great and it was a road game but\nHonestly Dexter Williams of the Irish did I three touchdown runs only Seventeen carry the at a hundred Seventy eight yards the Texas Oklahoma game in Dallas did you realize both starting quarterbacks finished with five total touchdowns\nBut the sooner skyline Murray had to turn over says well Texas kicked the forty yard field goal in the final seconds to win at forty eight forty five Oklahoma had tied it with three straight TT's and the

undefeated lightweight champ against Conor McGregor\nUh Cincinnati a overwhelming favorite in this game ... looked\nAwful I mean awful\nAgainst the patriots I expect to get back on track with their defense but the Bengals are no slouch at home that's for sure\nOf all the games we could lead off with we have a NFC championship game rematch Philly Minnesota we got a big divisional game and the AFC North Cleveland Baltimore we got a big NFC North Green Bay Detroit we got Casey Jacksonville you're telling me you want to talk about Miami Cincinnati\nYou didn't like that why you didn't know what are the intriguing games out there you know you first of all the dolphins you don't want to see what they do have to pay now he came and bang goes I mean is there any dog for real they taking the ... the bagels getting back to the playoffs and\nAnd and make it a run it does take both teams three in one what keeps going to go to foreign one and and if it's the top ... they'll have a big up preying on the patriots the dolphins are the counter McGregor of the of the house all\nThe all all says old no stake come on the dolphins are awful I'll say this about the the the bangles um I think there are sneaky\nReally really really good I mean for so long it was only Eddie ... J green right how you look John Ross and it was a little bit banged up but the run game is\nGoing to mix and also but I mean again are they using him in up in the you know getting utilized enough\nWell and that's that's a fair point but but it just feels like such a more dynamic off as if I had told you Arnie the week before the season started that we would now be you know whatever it is a a quarter of the way through the season or whatever the Cincinnati Bengals\nTheir fourth in scoring in the NFL behind Casey which we you know we would assume because Andy Reid the rams we would assume because it's Sean McVeigh\nThe the same time we would assume because of Drew Brees and Sean Payton and then number for the Cincinnati Bengals the fourth highest scoring team the fellow who would have predicted that a month ago\nYeah I I didn't see that coming also you know things do you do have that auto correction and I'm Wondering if the Bengals are going to be one of those teams with the auto correction like I said you know I Know you brought up those other big games out there this one is a monster game coming under the radar one teams could afford and wanted to have a command in their division\nThe other one's going to come back to earth a little bit um I'm I'm real interested to see if they don't get the dolphins back on track because\nThat was just an awful performance I think you have like a hundred yards passing he looked like the worst quarterback in in the history of the NFL after that patriot came ... that was a beat down there and that that was in the ...\nI was gonna say I actually did feel bad for you because I Know that you were convinced that the dolphins were ... get that when yeah as I told you that one got so they they they slap to the patriots slapped around the dolphins so bad I thought somebody should call Peter because that was what I you know what I saw that wind by the way it is yeah yes I did yeah there you go it's okay\nWith that I worry about whether you took it for me about that I made on this show will say that I came up with it because I'm Out in the real sticking genius you listen what you do in Vermont Monday through friday that's an I might as well what goes on in Vermont stays in Vermont right as I say\nIs that is that the way it works out there that ... ... exactly right let's go to one of the games are that you mentioned earlier that is one of the big games out there and that's Jacksonville the Kansas City chiefs look I Do want to pump the brakes a little bit of Patrick Boyle homes\nAnd this is going to be the game to see if Jacksonville defense is going to show them what the truth homes is now they are playing in Kansas City\nUm and I expect more homes to have still a little bit of trouble member Kansas City is not done too well in the play offs was supposed to be at home where they who's in the first round seemed like every year but we'll get to that later on I I like Kansas City I just have to pump the brakes with the homes\nBecause I'm not going to make in the mix of what what did they say John Elway Dan Marino red radar\nI mean come on now I I don't you tell them not through a five games are or for ... afford games this year\nI totally agree with you Ernie and and I look we all love the ... story is a great story the kid is phenomenal I mean that left handed past that he made the other night was like wild\nNext oh it was okay I've seen that come on come on already come on now but I Will say\nThe chiefs of kind of made a habit of jumping out not not so much last week against the Broncos but have made this habit about jumping out to these big lead against um you know against teams and then kind of letting their foot off the gas\nThey are not going to be able to do that this week against Jacksonville Jacksonville I think as weird as it sounds may be good for them to get away from home I Believe they have three straight home games\nAnd I just think that with that defense I think that defense is going to be tired of hearing about Patrick homes I'm fascinated to watch that kind of chess match ... matches were just ...\nAnd the surface on week six will come back it more of the games out there uh finish off major league baseball my Wildcats with a ... point lead so now I'm In a good mood I'm feeling good he's Aaron tour as I'm only spend your this is Fox

Fifteen Percent or more car insurance with Geico or just go to guy could calm or give them a call one eight hundred nine four seven auto and the only hard part well let's figure out which way is easier so a McGregor goes down\nA and it's a pretty much over after that except\nFor the big brawl or outside the ring\nI'm a veteran people were loving that uh that were at at a at a tendency to fight there as well\nSay your Sunday partner Chris playing just wait and apparently he's over the Oklahoma last all serious question your UFC and Dana White how do you handle the post fight situation debated debated on the post by show ignore it that was insanity and I truly don't know what the\nWay to pretend like your you know disgusted with his behavior because I think\nHe did that would kinda McGregor after the bus in so that he was just absolutely disgusted so I'm sure you'll get more of the same but I bet you laughing inside\nYeah I was going to say it's one of those you act outraged you know and I'm trying to think of a comparable example in everyday life but you know we all do that with our significant other when they're upset about oh no I'm so I I totally understand I'm so mad meanwhile data whites probably\nI I mean I don't know that he want I don't know that he wanted that but this is going to be listen ... let me ask you or any I don't I don't want to get to hyperbolic here at two AM eastern on a on a a you know on a Sunday Morning here but I feel like boring something insane\nIn the NFL tomorrow this will be the biggest story coming out of this weekend in sports I just feel like this huge I don't know if it's the worst thing for us see because of Conor loses it's the fourth fifth sixth thing that you talk about on Monday morning after the NFL me right after college football I think this is the lead story coming out of\nComing out of the I I don't know if it's going to be that big people are going to be talking about it but really you know it does anybody really care if there's going to be charges filed or not charges filed or I mean people are just going to want to watch it but don't forget about it come Monday I Believe\nI'll be curious to see how the the guys that are on this airway on these airwaves Monday through friday\nOh that will be talking about it on Monday when they get on his out to be their first crack at it though you know\nSo it will be the biggest story come Monday like I said\nWell let me talk at football trust me on that they'll spend more time on foot\nThose got more time but I'm I'm just curious clay Travis six AM Monday what does he do colon whatever time new Monday when he comes on eastern time I'm just curious I I just think this is going to turn into a huge story because it's not just about the fight is not just about a winner last that's about all the insanity that happened after yeah I'm In them\nSo uh this just came from Russia or cause he's account apparently he tweets Joe Rogan just walking by press Rhodes said quote what the bleep gentleman that's the most what the bleep moment in UFC history this this is a guy who has been around the support for what Twenty years now\nHe's ... he's been there since the beginning any ... he has seen it all and he's saying that I think about that what was it was a gentleman as in like ... yeah he's talking about like I just don't know but ... there's going to hold on just the whole thing just the whole thing and made\nIt on the wrong guy there McGregor does nothing to do with\nThis yeah I'm a ... yeah you have you guys watch the video\nMcGregor actually uh he was he was sitting down in his corner like he was gas after he had gotten choked out and all this stuff just transpires an as he stands up he gets jumped from behind sucker punch from behind by this dude from ... camp and\nIt's it just turned into a male a lake and this was all after could be went into the crowd the other way so it's like a two different directions you had two different bras\nI did not want to make a comment that you could do it that Aaron underscored tour as I'm at stinking genius one\nUm yeah I mean it's certainly going to be a big story I don't think it's good to overshadow what's going to go out in the NFL or anything like that because really people are just going to be outraged at what happened after the fight but it's still they separated and figure out what the hell happened what are you going to really do\n[noise] I don't know I just it's just to me\nI don't know it's just such an insane story I mean because we all expect kind of the bizarre to happen in this sport I Will say this like Connor is so divisive and he's so like gets under your skin I mean think about could be the mindset that he had to have he wins the fight\nIn the first thing he does rather than celebrate the victories throw his mouth guard down and go after whoever it was one of the counters trainers or whatever I just I Am a ... like I Know that with the sport you kind of just ... expect anything expect the unexpected but I I don't know it just I feel like\nEven in a sport as bonkers is this I don't know that I was ever expecting anything like this\nAll right Aaron underscore tourism ads thinking genius one just will quickly go over the NFL or we'll just started there early games that not that I care about the Buffalo Bills but I Do care about the titans you drop the opener against by Abby comeback when three in a row that great cup abide victory over Philadelphia\nThere are three in one of victory here over buffalo on the road next thing you know there for one and everybody's surprise team for a playoff run into Superbowl rotten or the titans and they're sitting in pretty good position\nOh absolutely and the thing too with the with the titans that only did they beat the eagles they beat the jags too and it wasn't the prettiest game but I Will say I think that Mike for able those guys have bought in hook line and sinker Mike variable this or do\nI Do like running when sprints before the game like if you can't be fired up to play for that guy you can't be fired up to play football and this is the I think maybe the surprise team in the NFL right now I think one day obviously continue to win this weekend but I'll be interested to see if this can snowball going forward in that division\nEspecially with the fight and it gets ready for the upcoming week in the NFL speaking about the other felt let's get two or three picks I actually got for a little music put us in the mood um and we started the topic\nIs about as much as I say let's pump the brakes on my home and all all that being said I still think it was a small price I Believe the wide screen with Kansas City\nI'm shocked that it's not going to three and a half but I I'll take the chiefs play a small number there are three [noise] because I don't know of Jacksonville will be able to match them up points for point that's a small number given the chief sponsor a perfect place to start because I completely\nDisagree wow yeah I just think the chiefs of guy in ... with these big league [noise]\nThey're not going to get a big lead against Jacksonville is by far the best defense but he knows the cheap to date have not played a top event the jags or number two in the league I think they get at least one defensive touchdown and they win this game outright ...\nI think I'm going against a Joe public just gave us the charges open up another point favorite down the part that means a lot of heavy money coming in on the Oakland Raiders who are\nNot as bad as her record shows a one in three hours of grew in probably get that first victory but the chargers have so many more up in some weapons I don't think the raiders could keep up five and a half seems a little steep prices are you going to be sick\nBut I have a six what the charges thinking they'll run away with this thing [noise]\nI Am going to go next to a game we talked about last segment Green Bay at Detroit opened as a Detroit now a slight favorite and also I see why\nGreen Bay is not the vintage Green Bay was the last few years Aaron Rodgers only six heat in the leak in passing middle of the pack he's behind guys like any dawn Joe Black go to Shawn watching this is not vintage Aaron Rodgers I think he struggles the lions are better than that one in three record they get\nTo an hour [noise] let's go ahead go to my third pick and\nI got to tell you San Francisco and I actually loving this one and I know obviously Jimmy ... gone but that doesn't mean at home and all you have to do three and a half against Arizona who if the culture is not the worst team in the northern Arizona as the worst about\nAre you going to tell me this Arizona team to go out to San Francisco cheapest was caused or pull off the upset with Josh frozen I I'm not by and they give you an Francisco minus the three and a half [noise]\nLast one from me this one started at three and a half it's down to three in some places do three and a half others Houston hosting Dallas yeah\nI don't buy Dallas looked you had the great game from each last week catching the ball running the ball the taxes for all their struggles protecting the Sean what they've been very good against the run I think they cut off the head of the snake I think he does it have those holes he had last week the Texans winning ugly one but they win their second straight after starting on\nRight and I was like I'm going to go with the red socks over the Yankees and by that series tied at one game of peace um I'd like to see the red Sox and the Dodgers are on the world series I think that that'd be a good one if not obviously Dodgers and the Yankees would get a a a lot of national attention all\nYeah that would be the air or as World Series there because we were up as a Red Sox fan or live in LA now although I Am pseudo\nAstros band George Springer on another prominent along with the University of Connecticut Yukon now baseball school reigning World Series MVP from that's going and the best guy on radio Aaron tours also from the university\nOf well [noise] I'm like there's a group that papa bear\nI Am an M the savior\nOf course I'm back tomorrow with crisp like\nWhat what what kind of modus pike or to be the same maybe you'll be back workers are you a call you may have to do it for like because he may not show up ... you know just let me know stop drinking those margarita midday guy hum I may have to really you know what I'm habits when he if he does come on the show I don't know if I were to lay off them\nI may hit him with like a two by four over their head so uh that's going to be a lot of fun with Oklahoma who is he's going to be\nIn a real grouchy mood so anyway like the guy next to my partner Erin tourists

some thoughts you mentioned the chiefs Jonah still had the New England next week and there were three point dog but before that\nThey've got an interesting game they host the Jacksonville Jaguars tomorrow and RJ\nHad an opinion one way when he first started to analyze this game but then he started to look at the other side is take a listen\nI actually liked and I'm Talking in past tense now Kansas City even two or three days ago the more I look into this the more I don't it feels like this team has been on a ... a a real high I mean there ... riding a wave and now they're short we in that combat\nIn Jacksonville hasn't really had tough games I mean they have a you know obviously against Tennessee it was tough but\nI it just feels like the amount of ah\nBut he is is it so far this season if I had to say how tired of ... or the jazz\nAnd how tired as Casey says I think Casey's a lot lot more fatigue\nI agree in Jacksonville just beat the jets by Nineteen and they could have beaten them by forty misleading final\nJoin us to Jacksonville they seem to pick their spots or Seventy one by the way in the last ... dog thoughts on this game\n[noise] yeah I I think it ...\nI was talking with somebody a year ago who said they are the toughest team to gauge because the wild card is always going to be played ...\nBut I think there is something to\nJacksonville on it or getting a team who is playing on a short week and you would assume that at some point Kansas city's gonna get a fall off I think it's a tough game to try and handicap it's a tough game to to figure out which way you want to go but the reality about the jaguars defense I think it's a little bit different than what people would expect\nBecause yes there near the top of the league when it comes to points allowed\nBut they're also middle of the road and Saks and they're almost dead last in takeaways and to me if you're if you put that up against the team who doesn't turn the ball over ... still has been thrown in interception I'd I don't know how you could feel so confident the Jacksonville is going to go in there and prove a point I just don't\nI Will say this to James are really getting their defense of mojo back they've allowed seasonal yards in the last two games\nAnd yes the chiefs are undefeated but they own a defense that ranks dead last in league and overall team defense in Jacksonville is near the top and typically in the NFL whenever a number one ranked defense who's getting points from a defense that ranks from the bottom ten the dog is favored\nIn a minute here Steve ... is going to tell you where he leans this is straight out of Vegas He's Jonah knocks I'm Bernie Fratto rely from a guy go Fox Sports radio studios will come back and just a minute so don't go away

five factor you [noise]\nThey were off thanks thanks a lot of a quick question for us\nOr they're releasing any more details who seem like the after ... mainly as being talk more about than the actual find it so far man sleepy here in Studio so the whole thing started when a [noise] could be through his mouth piece of somebody encounters camp\nCorrect yes and well it I mean can be got very upset at the end of the third round because Carter was grabbing his gloves and came out on fire in the forest and\nFrom what I'm hearing and seeing is that there was a lot of screaming coming from ... camp and so he throws mouthpiece and just went after him and then a member of ... cab jumped into the ring and jumped Carter and started punching him\nI think there should not only be a rematch between these two there should be a rematch of the ... what do you think\nOh well there may be a rematch but it may probably in fact will have difficulty being this in the states because a beam might not be able to get a visa to come back and fight in the in the U. S.\nSounds like stay tuned this is a a developing story indeed All right thanks a lot Ralph\nJoin us we talked about Pittsburgh in the open and this was a team I Want to spend a little bit of time on because they're kind of mystery wrapped up into a rental or whatever that come under ... you know it is and they're they're hosting the falcons tomorrow\nAnd the ... three points in the you know let's call a spade a spade the loser of this game is in serious trouble because the loser will fall to one in four and in the history of the NFL if\nYou follow one for you got about seven percent chance of making the playoffs the last team to make the playoffs after falling to want it for to start the season where the two thousand to New York jets so I don't think\nYour team wants to be in this position tomorrow ... has a strong opinion about this game let's find out who he likes let's take a listen\nI like the Pittsburgh Steelers I bet the Steelers mastery RJ we talked about being stubborn the odds makers are just being stubborn with the Atlanta Falcons that keeps adding lines thinking oh then Atlanta often says just clicking on all cylinders but that defense with all those injuries are so bad right now we some money coming huge against it Lana\nThe last two weeks I think it's going to happen again\nThis week I think that's why it's going to go up I like Pittsburgh my history\nJoin us ... absolutely spot on yes both teams or ... when a piece you know going into the tomorrow's game but for the falcons it's absolutely\nBeen their defense it's completely abandoned them they're allowing thirty points to a game\nOnly Tampa Bay rays thirty four points per game was worse and the dirty birds they couldn't even take advantage of her three game homes than they had earlier meanwhile Atlanta is on five against the spread and the second uh back to back AFC confrontations\nWe talked about this last week with our GI Bill they play they meaning and land I played Cincinnati last week last at home\nA Matty ISIS now seven and fourteen and his career versus if the teams and they get another AFC team tomorrow what are your thoughts about this game Jonah\nIt feels like a get re game for Pittsburgh now the Pittsburgh Steeler fan base uh they're very passionate I'm there if they're going to attack you Bernie I'm just letting you know that it's going to look like post fight McGregor could be as big as you shorted them\nAnd you said that they are one in three about to go on for their actually one two and one you you always want to count your ties especially if you're a bad football team early on so I just want to say that\nUh so yeah one two and one the falcons earn a bad spot they've got a lot of close losses this feels like a get right game for Pittsburgh Antonio Brown compared him in Ben Roethlisberger to spotty why as far as being able to connect on the field Judy Smith Schuster is that a good year but banged up secondary for Atlanta\nPittsburgh notoriously is a good a better team at home better office burgers splits are much better at home I don't think you could look too much into what happened last week against Baltimore that series has been dead even\nYou could easily see Pittsburgh going to Baltimore and do the exact same thing the ravens did last Sunday night I think this is a get right game for Pittsburgh one thing to keep an eye on though\nThere was a game of college football game that was played there on Saturday Heinz Field notoriously one of the worst surfaces in football\nAnd apparently it got torn up pretty good so to come back for a one eastern time kicked off I don't know how that would would would affect the betting for an over underlined or appoint total line but just something to keep an eye on\nYou know it's a good point Pittsburgh hosted Syracuse today the pit Panthers had probably one of your best games of the year the field did get a little chewed up so it does remain to be seen I mean you look\nYou've got to Atlanta don't team you know what I call a hot house do you plan perfect conditions they go on the road I Wonder if that shoot a few maybe favors of Pittsburgh during during the forty think\nYeah I Would I Would think so I'm just as far and and also look\nSo ... of of the stadium bedroom like I said Ben Roethlisberger splits are ... are almost um you you know it's not like science field is this nice cozy comfortable place it doesn't deal with poor weather late in the year so I Would think there should be a game that would favor Pittsburgh um I I just\nAtlanta ... much like Minnesota feels like a team that got dealt some bad cards early some brutal losses I think Matt Ryan is really played well but they've been in every single game you can make the case that Lana should be for no but unfortunately they're sitting at one in three and I think they're probably going to go one in four after\nThis game must piggyback on what you said about Ben Roethlisberger because you're right at home this guy's tougher than a three dollar steak by the way he's Lebanon one against the spread at home in games when he faces teams with a losing record when that theme of losing record is coming off a game or they lost at home and by the way here's the kicker for your Jonas\nBanner office burger is sixteen into against the spread\nOr excuse me sixteen into straight up and Fifteen and three against the spread career in October and games when the steam coming off a loss including\nTwelve and ... straight up against the spread in which it in the endgame for Pittsburgh under five hundred so you just said it at the top I think you've nailed it this is a get well game for Pittsburgh you get the last word on this game\nYeah I I I like Pittsburgh in this game I think uh I could easily see them putting it on um I think there's been a lot of talk there I think there's been a lot of dysfunction a lotta stuff this played out nationally I think Pittsburgh comes out and like I said at the top this is the get right game for them I feel bad for Atlanta I genuinely do I think they've gotten they've dealt\nA lot of bad brakes early in the season um I think Matt Ryan is taking you know or some criticism my time Steve ... and I thought I got the heat after week one which I think that was strictly on Matt Ryan I don't think it was so much ... unfortunately they find themselves against the team who feels like it's a must win spot\nTo continue to stay in contention in that division I like Pittsburgh big time\nAnother team it's looking for when after she lacking Miami they hit him to Cincinnati tomorrow to got blown up by the patriots and the Cincinnati I Believe it's six point favorite ah RJ you know he has he expects a certain team to show up kind of big tomorrow let's take a listen\nNow this is one that I Love love love and I'm a baton the team I've already bad um that backs this trend is a team gets crushed thirty one or more points they lose on the road so the dolphins got crushed by the\nPatriots it was thirty one or more points and then they have another road game so road road\nThose teams are forty and Nineteen against the spread sixty eight percent against Vegas why it's the same idea is the world saying oh my God look how bad the dolphins looked\nAnd the psychology of the dolphins is we're going to be a hundred percent focused to redeem ourselves and oh by the way the factors road road me they don't have any time to get distracted it's going to be all business and the focus has all the way that\nI agree with our Jay and by the way\nA man who's missing a key player which we'll talk about in a minute here after the break coming to you live from the gecko Fox Sports radio studios it's easy to say Fifteen Percent or more on car insurance would Geiger Geico dot com or call one eight hundred nine four seven auto the only hard part is you're going out which way\nIs easier\nNow we're gonna come back in a minute he joined us max aren't born in front of your this is a straight out of Vegas fly from a Jack of Fox Sports radio students and by the way brought you buy discover card we treat you like you'd treat you were going to

it or not or six shouldn't want straight up in games after they'd\nBeen blanked and in the NFL teams home teams that get shut out or forty five and eleven\nThe following week show their home the bills are home catching five and a half against Tennessee RJ had some thoughts about the buffalo Saturday the equation and how they might fare in tomorrow's game let's take a listen\nThere was another trend in this game the points to the bills if you're shot out in the NFL zero points and you lose that game by more than three touchdowns\nThe next game fifty seven percent against the spread\nOf fifty seven mighty good it's Seventy nine winter sixty losers so that's actually pro bills the first trend was anti Tennessee this is pro bills\nThe NFL is a betting league\nThat you need to be contrary if everyone's going one way you've got to go the other way 'cause the where everyone's going gets expensive\nSo in this case everyone's going on Tennessee because they just beat the Superbowl champs as an underdog so they get a little bit of expensive everyone's running away from the bills because they just got shut out not big zero well that's that that that goose egg people hate that but\nWhat's happening to the team the bills are saying God what are we doing and I think you're going to get a great performance from the bills\n[noise] great news there was a quick way you can save money switch the guy who go to guy go dot com and in Fifteen minutes you could see fifty percent or more\nOn car insurance join us let's unpack what are you just said there because it speaks to one of the great axiom that we've known about sports betters forever the fact that folks overreact to what they saw last\nYou saw what the titans did last week the last three weeks and you saw with buffalo did last week analyze would force a John ...\nYeah I mean here's here's the problem I have with this and and I I Would lean towards the Buffalo Bills but here's my biggest issue with it\nWe have no idea what the hell Josh Allen is nobody no we don't know what he is we don't know whether or not he's a good quarterback and we don't we know he's got great physical abilities\nBut he went from having a good game one week to turning the ball over multiple times there's an ax and even in the week against Minnesota when he did during the ball over they recovered all those stumbles so it's hard for me\nTo put my money on a guy who I don't know what he is like we talked about ...\nIn the wild card at least I have seen consistency from time to time with ... I haven't seen\nAnything from Josh out on that leads me to believe oh yeah I Want that guy I'm going to put my money behind that guy I at plus five and a half or plus six points against Tennessee Titans team who just knocked off the eagles I Would lean buffalo because of the points but I don't know how you could feel confident about it\nYou know unless you're really intelligent angle because\nWhen you consider that they've now got film on Josh Alan ... you know here's a kid comes out of Wyoming he does well in a combine for my money or the games too fast for him quarterback is the position\nThat you play with your eyes you drop back you make mental snapshots you've got to make you read progression you got to recognize personnel groupings schemes formations\nAnd then you've got to execute somehow Josh Allen went into Minnesota a couple of weeks ago and play the game and his wife even had to rushing touched down [noise]\nBut quite honestly I really think that was a bit of a fluke and now the problem is they have Josh Allen on film but this is where\nDid the numbers become a guideline or inflexible anchor because you are right\nYou don't know what you got what John challenge but it's hard to [noise]\nYou know fight that up hill battle against James who are Thirteen and forty one straight up sixteen and thirty it against the spread the week after the beating the super bowl ... plus we've got plenty of history in the NFL teams get shot particularly at home [noise]\nHow they bounce back next week that is a game I Will probably stay away from what I gotta tell ya agreement to join us in the sense that it provokes drop because the governor Center for buffalo he's the one that's got to take your home and I don't know if he can\nOr this has been straight out of agencies Jonas mark\nOn Bernie Fratto as a matter of fact if you want to stay tuned this gentleman coming up well he never\nHe never procrastinate Tuesday and be responsibilities you join us ...

right thanks Rob a Jonah socks here Fox Sports radio\nSo I'm ... this is so this is funny ... everybody knows this and you notice to be a fact ... like ... and I can I can criticize it all I Want I Do a lot of driving coming into the studio here and it's not a freeway driving\nAnd you know that there are certain things that come with an accident gay there's the fender bender there's the cars that are impacted\nAnd then there's the cars that are impacted that aren't in the accident and they're impacted for two reasons one because\nIt's traffic it's a lot of chaos you come to a screeching halt and to there's a lot of people that are lucky lose rubber neck hers who have got to stop and look at the accident and see what's going on and my favorite part is when people try and say [noise]\nUm yeah I don't do that ocean I've got things to do okay we all do the same thing when there's a fight that breaks out\nOkay when there's some sort of a skirmish you're at a bar restaurant whatever everybody turns around and look and see what happens right everybody does you ever watched a boxing match on TV\nAnd all of a sudden in the middle of the fight you see the crowd behind them on camera turn around and look up they're not even watching the fight that they paid to watch they're watching the fight in the crowd and it doesn't matter who's fighting in the ring everybody's turning around to see what is happening\nYou oh look everybody looks\nLike that's that's just the way this stuff goes so when you're watching UFC two twenty nine on Saturday Night and\nYou see the skirmish breakout afterwards\nAnd I see people after the fight these MA\nAre these ... like real enemy insider guys talk about how yeah there doesn't need to be a rematch we don't need a rematch it was such a decisive win for ... made off okay you don't get it\nIt's not about what you think look I consider myself very knowledgeable when it comes to Anna may I covered the sport I've\nCovered live events for Fox like I Know what I'm Talking about I'm passionate about it\nI watch the same fight could be their market made often dominated majority of the fight he got McGregor down early he landed the more significant strikes he's the guy who knocked McGregor down with her right hand he's the guy who dominated the fight and he's the guy who finished the fight\nI get it if I wasn't necessarily close I didn't think McGregor was in that fight outside of a couple of moments early on get felt like a pretty dominant performance guess what\nI'm watching the rematch I don't need to see a close call in order to war a rematch there's more to it than just whether or not it's deserving Lee so based on what you saw in a cage\nLike this is all about money man this is all about what draws the most money you what's going to get the most eyeballs and there was no fight anybody wants to see more now than could be versed Connor to know fight you can't think of another fight\nYou remember when Connor fought needy as an atheist submitted him you remember the rematch\nEverybody wanted to watch that that was the that would that set a record this fight is going to be a record like you want to watch this stuff don't pretend like you don't stop and turn when there's an accident on the freeway\nCome on man like you you could be scared you know what of of dead bodies but if you drive by an accident and looks like a bad one you're not turning your head and focused on the road you want to see what's going on like I got to see what's happening like people that are too close to the sport\nYou're not looking at it realistically you got to be pragmatic when it comes to stuff like this people want to watch this that was riveting television man that that was as good as it gets chaotic crazy unpredictable violence\nA couple of different variations of Iowa Sam either we get nice positive funny goofy thrilled to be here I was Sam or we get the Iowa was um [noise]\nSo it's time to find out now which one we've got do we uh Iowa sham have ourselves and I was ... on the show\nI say you do not have and I was ... what happened in positive bigger door does something happen well I've ah I've sort of retool what I Do on game day so [noise]\nI I honestly maybe I think for one game the northern Iowa Iowa game a couple of weeks ago I had a couple of beers but I just drink water I watch the game I go back to sleep or you know it's it's too difficult man it's it's just too much\nUm I'd rather yeah be attentive and good at my job when I come back yeah\nPlus Iowa hasn't even played a ... game yet so [laughter] I haven't had a chance to uh throw a couple of back\nWith a fourteen hours to spare so yeah so so you are a one single nine AM\nOr eleven central kickoff game yet so now\nI don't know I Would do they want today at Minnesota one big put up forty eight on the go for a while\nThough the aid for Iowa oh it's like dog ear you multiply that by seven no like putting up two hundred points in interest at Georgia Tech into was Cumberland Gap from like the Eighteen hundreds when I was like you were on the Jew hundred and Seventeen to ten or whatever and I'm Amazed though I Am in good spirits Jonah I Will\nWill world to be we're happy to have you ah definitely true by the way you know who else is thrilled ... this this may be one of the greatest promos Africa\nNow um if you were watching that UFC two twenty nine of and you watch the heavyweight title or it wasn't that way but the heavyweight fight between Derek Lewis and Alexander ... and that Derek Lewis is losing the fight\nI mean he's losing he's down on every scorecard going into the third route I he's been tagged a couple of times he's been ... a couple of times but he's got this right hand\nThat can put people to sleep and with heavyweight fighting in boxing but especially in the U.S see you've got\nTwo hundred sixty two hundred eighty pound guys and these little baby four ounce gloves\nAnd if they touch you you're going to bad there's no there's no other way around it like you're going to sleep\nSo Derek Lewis is losing this fight he's down on all three score card it's done it's over under twenty seconds left he lands a crushing right hand and ended up winning the fight at the buzzer I'm not going to call the Minneapolis Miracle\nBut it's something close to that I mean it was craziness and then after the fight\nDerek Lewis decided to take his pants off in the cage he's just in his drawers he took his is UFC board shorts off and this was the post fight interview with Joe Rogan\n[laughter]\n[noise] [noise] [laughter]\n\nSo\n[noise]\n\n\nMaybe very very much really really interesting [laughter]\n\nOh that was really an Derek Lewis posts fight after as miraculous when a over a Alexander bulk off

one on the year Atlanta his got injuries they've got close losses there ... there are deep into the fluid starters either injured or out for the season and Pittsburgh's problems have played out nationally\nWhether it's way beyond bell an adult situation with his teammates calling them out whether it's Antonio Brown not being happy with the ... and him in bed Rob this burger maybe butting heads whether it's Mike Tomlin whatever you want to call it all this stuff is played out\nNationally for the Pittsburgh Steelers but I think last week's lost a Baltimore as bad as it is I think it says more about the rivalry\nBecause if you were to swap these two teams later on in the year when Pittsburgh goes to Baltimore I could see Pittsburgh doing the exact same thing to Baltimore did the damage the rivalry the records they're almost dead even historically that's just part of what that game is\nI think Pittsburgh rebounds [noise] I think Pittsburgh rebounds in a big way and in fact I think Ben Roethlisberger feeds on a banged up falcons team\nMy knocks lock isn't whether or not the Steelers are going to cover the spread you can find this prop that in certain markets you can find it on certain Web sites around the country if you go on and you look and you look hard enough\nI like the Steelers to score over three and a half touchdowns in this game [noise]\nWires that one\nAt ... pm eastern time jags and chiefs are the Patrick\nThe home shows the best thing going on in the NFL Monday Night football was so damn fun what a good time that was mad I could watch Patrick ... play football for the rest of time I'm In it's exciting\nI don't know how it's going to finish up but it's exciting or he can make every throwing the book he keeps them alive in games it's an element to the Kansas City chiefs and an anti read off instead it's never been there before and it's a lot of fun\nBut it's a short weak\nAnd everybody is waiting to see when Patrick Boyle homes is going to throw that first interception [noise]\nThe reality of Jacksonville defense though maybe a little different than the hype yes Jacksonville is number one and points to laugh [noise]\nBut they're middle of the pack insects and almost dead last in takeaways so then why\nIs there a betting line on mobile homes to throw in an interception in this game and why\nIs it a slight favorite why is more money coming in on ... Holmes the throne interception isn't one of those while he's do situations isn't one of those well you know love averages he's got a throne interception everybody throws the interception I'm going to go with it I'm going to go with where the money is flowing I like Patrick\nBoyle homes to throw an interception his first of the season in this game [noise]\nVoice [noise] the\nTexans are a three and a half points favorite on Sunday Night Football look I'm Still pissed off over the game from last week I talked about it I mean what a bunch of crap what a what a load of crap that was the Texans shouldn't have won that game\nMay come on man they shouldn't one game that that should have been a tie it best below Brian even settled for a tie in that game now I can make a case for teams with the losing record because I could say look you've got a bad brakes teams got injuries are all sorts of stuff you know a couple of\nHere a couple of ounces they're tipped pass interception like I can make the case with that but I just don't think Houston is very good [noise]\nAnd I'm saying that after picking them too\nAnd throwing a Dali through a bus window and removing fighters from cards because they're not physically capable of fighting a couple of days before a fight just to promote another fight that may not happen\nThis was real and this is the potential when you have the fight game\nLike I made the comparison earlier if you have a pet tiger because you have so much money\nDon't come to me two years later and go I cannot believe he wrote my arm off I can you believe this this is unbelievable that this pastor this ungrateful you know what he ... my arm off well I mean yeah he's a wild animal or that happens you run the risk\nThat's how it goes in fighting you run the risk of this stuff happening now Dana White was upset after the fight or this is him talking with the media and the press conference but Dana White as good as there's ever been as far as fight promotion I think he is disappointed but I think Dana White\nIs going to wake up tomorrow and he's going to think about things\nIt's going to figure everything out and ... some way or another I think we're going to get a rematch here was data white afterwards though\nGive us an idea it kind of where you stand I mean\nShould these guys running back or is that an awful idea for the U.S see\nWhere we have to see what happens with the Nevada state of the commission I mean not just in the\nThe the commission I mean there's going to be fine there's going to be a God Knows what you know because these guys get visas get back in the country\nYou know what I mean I'm an I mean Habib [noise]\nMostly on this thing plays out and you know like I was saying and doing this for Eighteen years and uh um [noise]\nThe biggest night ever and I couldn't be more disappointed you know you know what I mean obviously mad and everything you know not even that I'm I'm just really disappointed\nI mean I I I get it man it it it's the optics look bad you don't have control your sport you don't have control your fighters\nBut I think if you ... if if you look at this for what it really is which is the fight game and things like this can happen and I'm surprised they don't happen more often I think\nThe rematch although maybe stylistically in what you saw in the cage doesn't make a lot of sense 'cause if I wasn't all that close the rematch\nMakes even more sense because it sells itself\nThe fight sells itself it's true genuine bad blood\nIf they can figure out a way and they talked about all the security they had there just in case and it still wasn't enough if you can figure out a way to do it to where none of this stuff happens maybe you bar the guys who jumped into the cage from cage said next time there's no way\nIf if if\nIt's available and if both guys want it there is no possible way that there's not a rematch with this fight you got to be realistic about it the onus knocks Fox Sports radio eight seven seven Ninety nine on Fox is the phone number and that is important number and here's why every week we play guess that garbage\nI'm going to go around the country sometimes around the world and I'm going to ask\nYou basic NFL trivia questions but here's the here's the catch\nIt's all things that have happened in the last week or so so this is all recent stuff all recent storylines\nAnd it seems like it's easy until you guys get on the big stage and then you decade all over yourselves on national radio so we're going to give you another opportunity\nIt's only for the people out there that aren't nervous the men the women that children whoever you are if you are not nervous and you think you know the NFL now is your opportunity eight seven seven Ninety nine on Fox\nThat is coming up next we're all the latest though\nRobert ...

All right they're not like that it's a different like they're not they're not that same kid anymore like they actually did get this right a couple of the best talent evaluated in the NFL have talked

right returns you\nMean guys coming back yeah engines that have left themselves and their teams shaking their heads about what the hell are you doing\nHere like I personally have Julian Edelman on my fantasy team here at her and he came back and I met a PR league and I was in ... he gave you a Thirteen fourteen points I was good with that man from a flex position if\nOnly he'd caught a couple of other ball and left like he gets a butter fingers getting back he didn't get the ...\nHe did um but mark Ingram yeah there's a lot on because he is back for the New Orleans saints ... what does that impact on that team who who does it affect the most and a good way or a bad way as he is back for the St on\nMonday Night what brings you back your sledgehammer between the tackles and Robin come air owners they're going to be a little bit salty about it 'cause that's probably ten to twelve touches maybe Fifteen or on the right\nGames script that go the other way on your income Eric coming into the seat coming into this week we're looking at the highest fantasy point score among running back Dr three touchdowns a week ago Drew Brees owners if you didn't watch the game you saw that final point total\nLike oh I'm sitting pretty and then you checked your fantasy team and you started throwing stuff and causing a problem so uh for where I think you're looking at the goal line stuff going away because you want to make sure he's ready for the stretcher on because you were just talking about the falcons and they're bad luck starting to catch up with the AIDS looks like they're pushing Georgia playoff run\nAnd uh and what's interesting show Drew Brees has got the record that he's going to try and and get 'em and that's on Monday nights where he's going to try and pass Peyton Manning for the all time passing\nYards record so if you know a guy I mean this is just fantasy psychology yeah get from somebody who is actually good at it unlike me\nIf you know one guy has got X amount of yards to break her record\nDoes that impact ... who you play on that team for that game specifically like is there like would you would tie go to the to a receiver um see better receiver got one spot to fill and it's a you know it's not a top name receiver and another game would you give it\nThe edge to the guy who's got the quarterback going for the record just based on you know they're going to try and get that done in that game yeah you got you things\nYou go from milestones and you also go for your over honors right those are the two games we play when you're going and try to decide between players we don't necessarily look at\nAt some of the the target counts can fluctuate right 'cause a lot of folks just look at straight target counts as opposed to what the game's good cause they might have down Twenty one nothing after a quarter and all of a sudden there's Thirteen targets well they've gotta hang an asterisk on that one right 'cause the game to play out\nAs a normal flow if you're unless you're getting buried every week than Thirteen is as a magic number but in this particular case for Drew Brees going up against Washington given up only eleven points for fantasy points per game two opposing\nOoh not to you but they are at home so I guess you know you always have that Washington also coming off of\nBy week so figure they come in with a decent script but you're still looking at Drew Brees he's going to break that mark certainly probably by the end of the first\nMy car and Fox Sports radio is fantasy football insiders with this year on up as art disco fantasy

the office of the Atlanta Falcons you know what he tells us the falcons have scored one hundred Fifteen points in the first four games combined\nThere's still one in three to twenty nine point game average so so where are the holes right there the whole on the defensive side of the ball that's basically what the problem is and speaking of that you're going to write this going to be a lot of points today because the Steelers are much better on defense they've given up for Ninety nine for forty nine four fifty five and\nFour fifty one yards and then last three games so yeah they may have a combined score of Seventy or more this game yeah\nTotal fifty eight which is really high for an NFL total but one of my buddies\nNight on the east coast he's a\nHe's a big time gambler but he's good at it [laughter] and he ... he was like one of his plays is going to take the over in this game and I'm like man that's a lot of points but when it's twenty three to twenty or somewhere around there at half time off of a sudden it looks pretty good that expected to be around that time around that total at half time is going to be a high scoring game today\nAnd those days are fun to watch so I really have no money on this side of the kid who wins and I enjoy watching a lot of scores that's what I like to do Brian ... we all live for the guy go thought sports radio studios and you know what he almost gave up on football\nAnd now he's the best of the league that's that's the first to the best in the business ... with the latest\nWell thank you very much in Europe seats you're twenty nine

it's easy to say Fifteen Percent or more on car insurance with Geico got a guy called dot com oh call eight hundred nine four seven or do they only harp are figuring out\nWhich way is easier and by the way in about ten minutes from now Bronx talk radio which Sammy K. right here on Fox Sports radio so how do you like that and is the no ... that\nAlways looking forward to it man ...\nYes you know it's a treat working with you it it really is because you appreciate the world is sports there's not many people out there who could really say I appreciate a great performance and you do you know I have to some extent at times I think I Do as well and today we'll get a C. hopefully a great performance\nFrom the Kansas City chiefs 'cause they're undefeated at foreign oh they hosted jags three at one end this patch it more homes the quarterback that achieves a great story I just read the sports illustrated like to share with you if I can I don't know how many people that read it he played football the White House high school in Texas in Sports Illustrated story goes his mom Randy Randy with and I\nSaid he nearly quit football there's some before his junior year of high school because he felt he didn't get a fair shot at the position he wanted which was quarterback he played safety is a sophomore and I had no idea he was drafted by the Detroit Tigers and the thirty seventh round that uh twenty fourteen I'm I'll be draft what a story that is\nYeah well he's off to a fantastic start there's no doubt fourteen touchdowns no interceptions but\nThis is a step up significantly and defenses that he's faced with us far\nAnd I'm really really curious how he plays today against Jacksonville because it's the number one scoring often in Kansas City just over thirty six points per game and you get the number one scoring defense in Jacksonville only allowing fourteen points per game so as we always like to say Andy something Scott I guess\n[laughter] and I think there's going to be a fantastic I mean this is the match it but the day when ... homes in that Kansas City often since coming up against that jaguars defense I cannot wait to see that I think Patrick ... and give you a prediction Andy\nI think my home throws his first picked today I don't think he's still have a zero in the interception column when this thing has done\nWell I think that right now I think the chiefs Stevens has to be tested I mean they've given up so many yards and so many points this far and they want it on the ... more homes but here's the key can achieve stopped the running game of the Jazz Can they stop let it for net that's\nThe key I doubt so yeah I Am an issue yes so I thought he was going to be a DJ yelled in you're going to be that it's gonna be a little bit running back by committee but they could still run the ball effectively look at the chief defund they're allowing a league high five point seven three yards per Kerry and this is short week so\nYou got that going on you think about that she was playing on Monday Night football and they've been playing atrocious the fence chest smelly stinky nasty defense and the UN's yes it's been brutal man where they think about this study I Love doing this because\nWhile the chiefs have had their by week I Love looking at the total yards given up for the entire season you've got the patriots who you wouldn't say they'd been world leaders defensively right right right you've got the patriots right now\nPlaying an extra game compared to the chiefs write\nThe patriots have given up wanting to wean more yards this year than the chiefs you think there's a chance that uh the jags gained twenty four yards at least today total oh I\nThink it was a good chance so when this is all said and done you're going to the Kansas City on the bottom again most likely in terms of given up\nYou know I I'm going to go back and I'm Glad you told me this I didn't know limit for net will be out today but now I'm hearing from our produce that has to be several always with a hamstring and ... and I thought that like when the last time I looked all heard that he might be available for today and now they say it'll be out several weeks without a hamstring\nI mean I I had no idea but that really to me maybe I'm wrong I don't think was that well publicized I thought he might be in the lineup today\nAre you using a different Internet Andy [laughter] like a different a Web browser or something\nAnd I thought he was dead I'm Glad I'm not betting on this game and the honest or ... or ... or ... you know they can still\nAgainst that they can still have a lot of success against that Kansas City defense regardless if it's T. J. yelled in or Leonard for net healthy writer for net is dynamic there's no doubt but it's not like that ground game has no chance to do anything whatsoever against the Casey rushed defense\nHe's he's just brutal they're bright all against the run so I I think that you can absolutely have success against them when it comes to the combination TJ yelled and it's going to get the bulk loaded the carries but you got to see some Corey Grant and drafted free agent\nOut of Auburn you know he's been in the league for a couple of years\nSo I yeah you can you can still match points against that case the defense it's just one of these where\nAnd later for nets had a lotta nagging injury he missed three starts last season he's got them in his third start this season gonna miss more weeks with that nagging hamstring injury so it's unfortunate that that he's weak it's just he just can't get right health wise\nThat's what he is he really is you know you look at I think we ... we touched on this last week you look at the chief stats\nAnd if you know not looking at the one last record you definitely would say that he will be five hundred a below with the stats that they have especially on defense even time a possession the opponent well obviously Tom a position they're not going to happen because they're on the field so quickly they score and that's the end of it but\nHonestly the total net yards like they give it up almost Nineteen hundred yards it it's amazing average birthday one twenty three they're only gaining one Thirteen again for themselves and average per game as far as what a totally yards three twenty eight given up to two Ninety\nI'm wrong to talk radio commentator right up its Brian ... well Sunday by the way he probably broke my biggest Gore's an odds are

that I really do with some some age maybe bake bake and we're like ... like they can yes yeah right on Lake\nOf vaguely oh by the way\nAaron Rodgers getting back to this game [laughter] yeah he's gonna have to earn his money today\nBecause you look at all these receivers who are banged up Randall cobs out divide the Adams got a calf injury ... got a concussion when you're like oh man Toronto Allison might not be able to go today you know or he's out like oh gosh\nWe're really scraping the bottom of the barrel here and you're going to have to have some of these lesser known receivers really step up and they're gonna have to get really creative against the lions defund now\nThink about when the lions smacked around the patriots I think it's very very comparable because you've got Jimmy Graham\nIs very good and very capable tight and you just double him like drunk\nEnforce these receivers on the outside to beat you\nAnd what they banged up Aaron Rodgers at least he's not as healthy as he typically would be wise nursing that knee injury\nI think it lends itself to the same type of scenario as we saw when the lion smacked around the patriots so don't fall into the trap of thinking that just because he's Aaron Rodgers the Packers are going to be fine Tom Brady is outstanding and he could do nothing\nAgainst that lions defense even what their their one defense as bad as it is so I said well why isn't as one Andy\n... well you got any July but I think this one glaring statistic that we have to touch on the ... the lions rang dead last converting possessions to touchdowns so they can't do squat once they get the red zone except for ... the field goal kicker and if they rely on him and the red zone that's basically what they do so you know Matthew Stafford\nIf in fact he could get things going in the red zone yes they'll give the pact as a problem but I Will tell you the right here and now I think the Packers have less of a margin for error then the lions doing I think the better team than the lines I think they went but again if the loose today the lions when that really puts a stranglehold and that division\nIt's just all about today Andy at full strength yeah but you look at the Packers more than the lions but the Packers are not at full strength\nAnd it's all about when the game's happen we say any given Sunday for a reason you know right right it's about timing and this is a bad time for the Packers\nAnd if you want to talk about the lions and converting touchdowns and all of that that's fine but when the patriots only put up ten points the last time the lions played a home game you don't have to convert many touchdowns\nFears off and do you do know that and very well how many points you think the Packers score today\nIs a pack of ... about thirty today\nI was all your trait you are out of their mind I think God I just worry about starting Andy yeah they are\nThey going to do that anyways they write this down I Want you to write this down because next week I'll I'll eat crow or I'm going to be banging on my chest\nI say they've when thirty seven teams today right that oh my gosh yes well at least ... thirty points and yes yes hey ho who's going to step up no devised a Adams no Randall Cobb no drama Allison all out\nThat's fine that Aaron Rodgers has already Boyd Aaron Rodgers creates he creates a lead them last week against the bills it's a bad team you know what sometimes is a form and you\nPlay the competition you really do\nAnd say okay so are the lions world leaders you just start to convert touched that okay so why what kind of lions bring out the Packers\n... and I know I'm making you feel bad because you probably have some school based on this game I you'd\nTake I Know yeah but I've talked myself into it I upload nobody will lie in\nThe bay that's fine unless you are good for you by the way did you discover card but that's what brought you by the ... you like you treat you

home against the rain on the amount of\nNot at all either they're able to better team and certainly I think that the raid was put up a lot of points against him today too\nI guess you don't want to have been overlooked Andy is all this Baker focus what happened to that Brown's defense last week I liked their defense overall they've got absolutely torched by Derek car who by the way only as six touchdown passes in seven interceptions this year and Derek car\nHad a field day against the browns so I don't know what their defense is going to do today against Joe flak and when the ravens when the ravens have had a lot of success against the over the\nAnd here's another factor I think a lot of people talk about\nThe browns they may have some personnel and have a decent defence and offensively got the ... gone maybe who knows and the Baker's love fest I Know but at the end of the day this team doesn't know how to win because they've never won I think that means a lot in sports not just in football they don't know how\nTo when they don't know how to close and they don't know how to win and that's going to hurt them until they\nGet a couple of wins together they're going to

the dolphins three of those start was maybe the beginning of a new day for dolphins football and they have seized let's face it not be they were overblown overblown they were premature they were

the room you don't have to go out and buy hybrids if you're not ready to buy a car\nBut as simple as turning off the light switch in your room recycling your garbage little silly things like that that

whopping three thousand thirty points board hall records\nIn that span and went\nHigh powered ... bringing our high powered talent Jimmy Johnson the coach to help us make sense of how does the fences stop stop this with this historic foreign coach\nOr you look at the rules changes you know you're a quarterback here you can't touch him in a helmet hit him down here if a receiver goes across a metal hit I'm God you're going to penalize usually remember they used to talk about receivers I have an alligator arm up\nAcross mental no problem you know so the rules are such that everybody wants to throw the ball but you look at Minnesota\nYou know they wanted to throw the ball they had a pretty good team last year and now they're given up twice as many points because they're throwing the ball more than anybody in the lead there not run into football you got to have a little bit about\nThe only team and leave without rushing touchdown and they're having to throw because they're behind right well\nLook it's ... it's affected their hotel yeah they can't shut the temple where the game but the red zone you know short shortage that came protected any fancy also they came around\nThe world I don't like it it's like seven on something in a football no right to sit back there in the quarterback is having all the time if they do hit the quarterback it's going to be a ... a weapon the pastor like Italy or an office why would you not want to throw the ball when you're not there was no reason really run the ball anymore\nAnd and and you and love that though there is no such thing\nAnymore

past Russia eight teams are lining up a climax\nBut girl Thomas came to leave market Peter those guys were on the market and I was interested because why would you pay money for defensive back cover anybody now why do you know what it's all those last year and the super bowl was eleven hundred yards passing with all those point\nThe writing was on the wall you can't play past events anymore the only thing you do is hope you bend but don't break\nWell and then there's the scene of phrases defense wins championships so if that holds true can we actually look at any of these high powered authentic and say that we can throw away the defence when championship phrase an authentic teams can when Superbowl\nI I think your your priority on defense now is pass Rogers and cover corners that's what you need on ... I don't I don't want to intimidate or I don't want the big hits but pass structures that are good and won't hit the quarterback above or below and then have recovered corner\nYou know what I think it would solve all problems is doing the ... shall we\nSay we can't we just had a lot of rain out looking for answers and throw it out what I call it\nAll right as\nThe legend of Patrick my home's grows Monday Night in Denver obviously was a duck fining chapter\nHe shows a little of everything on that game winning drive the left handed brawl with von Miller Shane rain and the back pocket that pretty special a converted to second and third essential ... at\nNo point in the moment seems to me I get no point that's a Monday Night football stand alone game was over well\nGreg you play with a couple of gunslinger ... then you remind you at all a foreigner Rogers\nHe he reminds me of both but more and Raj ... far it is\nIt simply because of the way he spends a play and the things that\nHe does what does harm if you look at this boy he just everyone's always alive he knows where everybody does it doesn't matter how he gets\nIt in their hand the same thing here was hatched in my home\n... special things can happen and we all know the armed forces there the guy on the end of this plan it out in that play just for your arm strength that this busy on guard possesses second\nThe guy who's been limited when I watch them\nPlay by the barest started in Kansas City as as they should\nNow it changes now Mike in Jacksonville deal it's going to be major heat or they've gotta elite corners what came from a home so they could as part of the best to defend her she'd never\nFair no doubt a block from four and then you got the probably the best quarterback daughter he's faced in his entire life you know with those guys are doing is Jacksonville but the thing ... can do is extent please turn to\nPlay for six to eight seconds if you take a look just lay right here he's in a park and looking down feel so far as the waiting list making my type her\nCurrently in the back of the end zone extended the place for seconds and maybe seven or eight seconds officer defends the cover for that long and we find\nWhen you can make accurate boroughs like this on the run\nOf the stress in the defense out and making them run from selling solar is just a recipe for which\nThere is a step curry element with the NBA there's that no no no that was great like oil homes you wouldn't coach a lot of it but he makes that happen of course you guys\nMake it happen next year I'm living in Seattle body Wagner is familiar with the good things and seemingly blooming surrounding my sit down with the app linebacker when kickoff return [noise]\n\nIt's been mother here everybody's got to do is drop off the dry cleaning pick up some milk used an idea let's that saved hundreds of dollars on car insurance and the good thing is you don't have to drop off or pick up anything\nAll you have to do is go to guy go dot com and in Fifteen minutes you could be saving Fifteen Percent or more on car insurance that extra money in your pocket it just may be the most rewarding to do that you do today\nAt discover we believe anniversary should be a time of celebration not obligation\nThat is why we think annual fees are ridiculous and now just for giving us a try we're going to get new card members a one year anniversary gift they'll never forget at the end of your first year will match all the cash back you earned dollar for dollar\nNo cap and no catches because we know if you try us you'll like and that's worth every penny try it and believe it at discovered dot com slash match\nCash back match offer only for a new car members limitations apply am\nPete hundred K. exercise [noise]\n\nI heart radio goes one on one with Neal Sean to ask about journeys music being featured in the final episode of the Sopranos I\nDid follow the Sopranos and I watched it when I wasn't working and\nI remember getting in the meal months prior to the last episode and\nIt was I Believe it was from the director and he was you know basically saying he we're talking about using don't stop bleeding\nAnd the final episode of the ... and I went home cool that's cool that happens gray doesn't school too\nAnd um I wasn't glued to the TV was actually on the Internet and my phone just started blowing up people were like do did you see that and I was like one in ... and it was just like I got so many calls one after another\nCocktails and pitchers of beer or just five dollars each [noise] it's good to\nBuffalo wild wings Bryson participation vary by location not valid with any other offer police drink responsibly\nAM eight hundred J ax icy Iowa City [noise]\nMethod you know airlines veterans showing house didn't know a career I was Airforce from Ninety three Ninety eight that got hurt a practicing\nCombat search and rescue fill up fast roping and um so ...

today there are two won and won their very banged up they're not clicking\nA and the lions at one in three at home or going to be a desperate football team and Hey Mike McCarthy give the ball the air and Jones those are my things I Want to say about this football game\nYeah well you know outside of Detroit's first\nGame against the jets where they got out early dominated on both sides of the ball a I I really do respect to a map Patricia done there because those guys didn't quit and boy oh boy job field but to retail ... game up\nI was a that was low and around and he'll took it all the way down to the thirty are lined the jags however there was a flag along the way so not in the backfield\nBut something tells me this is going to be a block in the back and this is going to you our we've got a ... so this one's coming back at least part of the way and more redo first down so golladay and hill right out of the game [laughter]\nI really would have called it an Samuel knocking on your wide out who are willing blockers you love this stuff and you really do but\nThat gentleman Ramsey it was a physical corner and he got tied up we'll walk in then and on his way down there was a lot of Jersey being held so that one goes back in and they'll be first in twenty instead of a first down on the twenty\nWe did learn this though hills is not seem bothered by the wet grass no he he looks justice ... aren't really down yeah he uh yeah\nUh ... hill can run folks I don't know if you've noticed this over a short time in the NFL but he is extraordinary with the ball on this and so uh that is good news for Kansas City but again you know the running game right there on that plane just a quick outside playing near side a Korean hunt tackled a\nWith a two yard game I I think this is going to have to be a game where you really aim to run the ball inside the tackles because if you're going to stretch the feel left ... should say east and west instead of going north and south you're going to have those situations where a runner\nThere is going to have to get his feedback under him before he can actually turn up feel\nOK I Believe that touchdown indeed in Pittsburgh was overturned so uh the review shows James Connors elbow we're looking at the freeze frame right now by the way he's not down at the one he's down to one inch line yeah the that ball shy of the goal line with the elbow down so here comes Thirteen goal from inside the one\nWho knows the ball is almost already Blake breaking the plane in fact when I played center when we had situations like this just to screw with the defense I Would put my feet right next to the bone I'd extended into the end zone a you know obviously those don't count as such sounds and James Connor with they leave being run over the middle of the offensive formation\nSteelers first blood\nAnd there you go yeah so and that's what this game's going to be all about if you don't score on one play it's okay you'll score on the next one I don't know how we're going to see in Pittsburgh today and now it's official the Steelers are on the board six adopting within a PHD try on the way and that is the first score\nOf the game there are many more no doubt to calm Baker Mayfield is about to take the field march slower earth will also join us next how's the cardinals in forty niners get ready for battle in the bay later today it's red zone

dot com let's go straight north to Seattle the rams will be visiting the sea hawks today so we get to visit with\nJoy sailor hey joy what do you do don't you need to work in the mornings hey Willard good I'm good and you know sitting in the cheers that we used to sit in together the venue that they don't they don't belong there you don't do that with me anymore but anyway\nUh let's see I get on this journey and the rams embassy all this is a this is something written I I've been following very closely because uh we work during the week on the fly should radio station for San Diego state were bigger shot penny fans\nAnd this guy just cannot seem to get to the top of the ... even though he's a first round draft pick very strange what's going on with the CEOs running game\nOh well yeah running game is a it's like the show today because obviously they lost their first game it's time to rely on most of us at all and I do I sound like you\nKinda get out of pocket and then provide some squirrels and squirrels and uh they said they're going to try and get away from that because of the games that they won they relied on their running running game it's going and they're going to need to do that because obviously the ran for office is killing at right now\nTaking the lead by storm and the events is pretty much decimated so they're going to have that confidence back there and often I'm Howard show that there is well China's you'll feel to hold the pay day riots and Earl Thomas so uh yeah they're running game it's going to see that\nLast weekend it you have gone through four sixty five five touchdowns zero interceptions on thirty three attempts with twenty six completion die I mean it looked near perfect it was actually a perfect pass or reading where does this off ... go from here ten anybody stop the rams\nUm I I don't think so [laughter] I think we're going to have to wait and see I mean obviously it's the the huge underdog today and like I said they're effective for you to plead it so coming up against Iran dynamically not what you want to be with pleasing Earl Thomas and having all the entries that they have but\nYou know the rams often is just operating at such a high level that the real that that that even for their often just keep them off the field\nBecause they're they're decimated like I said in the confidence that Goff and Nick they are playing with right now just even talking to them yesterday it just unsafe so we have some respect for the the outside playing playing in Seattle it's a different kind of tests you know they haven't really left the state of California yet\nAnd they felt that that you know you know they haven't really faced any adversity so far so they're they're treating this game with respect they don't want to go into it thinking that it's a a low especially coming off the side of the giant chain guys out there right now I'm especially coming off of last week performance\nBut I mean they're rolling right now so that's even keep them off the field\nGeorge Allen with us see on the rams later today on Fox I'm Glad you met with John McVeigh and Jared golf I have a question about these two guys it almost feels like out of the game we have a little bit of a microcosm of what Tom Brady and Bill Belichick have dealt with for years where people are going is a Brady\nAre Isabel jak Isabel checks or is it Brady Jared golfers playing really well but I don't hear a lot of people saying that it's Jerry golf a lot of people give credit to Sean McVeigh what did you what did you gather from talking to these two guys\nIt's funny that you say that because after they left the room talking about just how uh\nHow they ... on on point the two of them are and you can tell that they're all on the same page is as he because they use a lot of the same terminology and uh just ... when they are answering questions from us\nAnd I I said the guys are like you know it sounds very solid check yet [laughter] what does happen um except for you know he's a little more uh you know upbeat Miley than a dollar jackets but yeah you definitely have a point there um they give each other credit though um\nWe're we're we're all we're all kind of trying to get to the bottom of like how to turn around its team from having to work often end up to a year later having that that's often now gossiping from what would have been a fuss you really I mean between him and I'm the only discussion for NBC this year\nVery remarkable and they won't give us the uh the hidden camera\nBut basically what they say they both say is that there's a lot of chance ... Haitian within the whole team and they often worked really hard and I mean no don't like to think that if we work really hard because subjects often you know the the starting quarterback from LA ramp but\nUm you know they had some kind of secret formula that maybe one day we'll get the thirty or thirty or something but\nTo me the method that got from both of them is that there are there are all this really on the same page they all just go to work every day and he really focused and\nYou know we talked to two and he kind of had the same the same ... so I guess that's the answer but I'm sure there is a much more technical a theme that bank opted to turn that around\nIs staying on the rooms are really talks about Bob and so I think the defense has not done enough press their top ten they're using less than twenty points a game\nYeah we'd fill up to now the Denver Broncos missing their middling defense with one of the world's best past Russia Zimbabwe Miller one has way done with this organization that shows special on that side of the ball\nUm well you know wait till it he's not gonna take credit for anything\nUm so you know we talked to him yesterday too and he really does he says he has a lot of talent which is true I mean he has Donald rockers yet do like you can't really ask\nFor um a better line that he has it sometimes it really is just having great players that's really what he when he talked about yesterday with that you know you have experience layer do all kinds of by and see what you do and at the way to make it happen it's just like them buy in to what it is that you're selling and and wait till it's obviously has\nAn incredible amount of experience as accessing a leak so it probably an easier sell for a guy when it when he walks in the room and he just\nYou know he just such a calm and and simple guy like even talking to talk to about football you just a matter of fact [laughter] about everything that I think he's just got them on the same page and they and they are operating the whole team is just operating at such a high level right now I'm going to they're just kind of like a machine you know so\nUm that that's that's really what I got from talking to him and still yesterday is that they they just have a lot of talent they got a lot of guys and they're all just plan together\nJoy great stuff great to have you great to talk to you thanks so much for doing it today\nBanks hope you're well aware alerts health and that's what I\nI Am I Will and thank you joy Taylor ... up there for sea hawks rams coming up later today on Fox him Rosen Robin barber rest of the team up for that one ... blood as to touchdown runs already today\nWell right of course oh everybody a new album up of course that's fantastic outline\nA and now they've turned the ball over have not been able to sustain anything they've got all of the injuries as far as the receiving corps is concerned about they Avon's doesn't doesn't even have a ... yet ah this is just been\nAll lives yeah and the lines again I think better than than they showed out early in the season on prime time football so everybody has this thought process about Detroit going into the season in its ill conceived because map Patricia has proven\nTo be a more greedy and determine coach in a I'm a a better team than I I think anybody expected to see this season they have a lot of weapons up and said well you mentioned golladay earlier golden ... obviously Matt Stafford who everybody\nLoves to pile on with this this theory that he's padding stats at the end of a lot of losing efforts but I'll tell you this right now I don't care if it's at the end the games I don't care if it's at the beginning of the game I don't care if it's when you're you're going down in the fourth quarter to win the whole potato\n... if you are putting up the sort of statistics that matched effort is put up over his career that's a good quarterback in this defense is playing inspired right now after having a really tough start against the jets they've built themselves back up to a what looks like a contender\nI don't know if that when this division but they'll give a lot of people problems\nAll right we uh we are trying to gather information on what just happened to Carolina I think the Panthers just took a fourteen three lead they already had a cab Newton to Curtis Daniel touchdown play earlier in the game but they've just scored again\nMe read the game cast report for you that just came down in front of us here it is um the Panthers pond\nDown to the giants too old outback must the cat's touched it the giants to recovered by the giants Norris Jenkins at the New York giants five Jenkins to the New York giants three for two yards fumbled recovered by Carolina at the New York giants zero touchdown\nGraham go extra point guard what we have is a moth followed by a recovery followed by\nAnother fumble followed by a recovery and the Panthers are in the ads out\nBy the way if you're following this Jacksonville game that's in Kansas City right now to Kansas City looking great offensively Jacksonville Monday or go CJ yelled at and the Kansas City territory that and that is going to be something you're going to hear I say a lot during the game because they are out of back so Leonard for net out\nAnd court grant just left the field or on a cart because he has a lower leg injury that occurred in their last series or before the break here\nAnd so TJ yelled and going to get a lot of run out of the backfield for Jacksonville\nAlright yelled and already on the day is looking out let's say he has only had one target did not make the catch the seven carries thirty nine yards grant had the one carry got hurt on that they don't have any other they've got to have some other back on the roster I didn't go into the game or two\nMy my guess my guess is they have a now they're back active I have no idea who it is because I went to the official a page for the Jacksonville Jaguars checked out their debt shark Corey Grant is the last on the list Leonard for net and yelled in ahead of him so I don't know who they put into jail yelled and\nI'm seeing a guy on the roster named Brandon Wilds out of South Carolina ...\nJust grabbed the he just grab the run up came out said enough is active and out of here ... years so this is what happens he may be especially the Murray may have been a scout guy who got activated for game ...\nI don't know but they're in trouble in the backfield in Jacksonville they don't have a lot of their horses what\nAll right and tend to nothing is the score for the chiefs already in that game and actually interesting thought producer lead just rejoice because you know they should do or they should bring in miles jak and let him be running back room every did that in college I used in the LA is all over the field\nI Would love that gosh if he gets a goal like charity day Lee a doughnuts on me next week [laughter]\nThat Jerry there's that today and actually if he doesn't do that certainly that's rich anyway I don't\nShocked because I'll tell you I've seen it where titans played off into tackles in situations where injuries came up in bunches so uh yeah I I bet you they're starting to circle the wagons\nReal goal for the line there up by Seventeen the ravens are knocking on the door up three now two working for more left

touchdown I Apologize if we were in commercial [noise] as I say\nFound laying down the left side of the field he takes [laughter] [noise] and the cat or an extra point away from time again so they\nGo oh I mean let me let me count the times that I've been a part of the broadcast like this\nThe answer is many really it's just that none of them are in the national football like when I was in college and I did a high school football games that are out of stuff happened to all the time they all the time I've never happened to the jets the oh I have had\nSome explosive plays ... Seventy seven your GD run ... and had a Seventy six yard TD reception and then moments ago you mentioned the thirty five year grab from Sam Darnell so they had nothing but Aaron things out against Denver up Twenty one of the den near the end of the first half speaking of explosive plays in Kansas City in Jacksonville horn\n\n[laughter] he's still is both both though is it a man that kind of hard yeah it's very exciting but it is in a fog the\nSuit is twenty to nothing yeah Kansas City at the end of the first time me well in Carolina\nLaugh they throw it back\nOver under oath Beck and juniors quarterback rating was fifty seven over the over under I mean it don't forget people asked him about manning being may be the kind of culprit of of a bad op ed for the New York giants and\nThis might be more animal in his back pocket so she passed from back home to stake one Berkeley\nCaroline still leading though right now at the half it's twenty to Thirteen brown six to three over Baltimore Miami a road dog winning instance they fourteen and nothing the lowly bills on top of the Tennessee Titans seven to six guys lead elapsed\nSucks yeah well he may Packers are brutal yeah you don't you don't need to rub it in why not as lead laps a Packers just fell down twenty four now [laughter] um I Believe that's Marvin Jones in back in the end zone is unreal bought a bullet for Matthew Stafford and uh that\nAaron Rodgers bubble has turned into the Jones habit gosh she did what you want to watch\nMad that is absolutely ridiculous that not athletically possible we pick up your head and watch them and watch you watch it I'm late\nYou watch it again it is twenty three to nothing and then I Want you to pay close attention to this partly I Know it was you afraid oh here called ... and I want you to watch this late watch this now they're going to snap whole they kick and then the ball goes through the upright\nAnd I'd have prater I tell you at all that and so he goes in between the up and that's the goal\nAt age twenty four to nothing the lions are crushing the Packers you broke Sean's Hi you're broke his heart saying what\nAre you what you know what's broken the NFC North yeah I was going on right now is broke broke it is broke the Chicago Bears or three in one\nOr the lions are only going to go to two and three assuming this hold 'em but you know what's upside down his right side up\nThe the Vikings not only are one doing one but there in Philly right now and the Green Bay Packers again if this holds fall to two two and one and everything is all just completely jumbled up and John ... first round draft pick is now fallen to about twenty fifth in the league\nWell well I Will say this last ah or should win they'll win last week it was weak one against the bears Aaron Rodgers second have knee injury pulled off a seven so when we come back yeah so is hope last what twenty four points\nRight now kind of okay yeah okay fair enough [laughter] yeah yeah there is a there's a difference between Seventeen and twenty four boys yeah and there's a difference so much down yeah and and there's a difference between limbo field and Ford Field no there there's\nA lot I'm pushing yeah and the way\nI'm not going to call and impossible I'm not going to call it impossible 'cause twenty four points actually it's not just the three score game they could get your point conversions Everytime to\nNow you're talking down have said said turn that brought us down a very anxious are looking I'm a\nVery optimistic guy we're barely even checked in on the buffalo Tennessee game for very good reason mainly because buffalo\nIs playing tennis feet in that game right that is a yes yes however he finished a battle little pitcher yeah going on and buffalo right now is a football\nGame and the bill's lead to tighten seven just stick 'em if you combine the two quarterbacks they've thrown for a hundred yard that where he talked about that\nA Josh Allen six of ten forty a yard he does have a touchdown run Mario to seven uh fourteen sixty four yards and does have a pick as well so both of these off ... which are challenged\nThey are challenged ... I'm playing a challenging games evidence Dick believe the titans but somehow you know what the most under disgusting\nIs in the entire NFL this year what's up the titans are three and one no I Know and they just pulled up a reason why a\nTremendous victory over the Superbowl champs last year against the eagles last weekend\nAnd ... look ... that took godsend it took some intestinal fortitude and I tip my hat to Mario to for keeping the wheels on this thing I Do blame him for a lot of the struggles that this team has had I think they felt handcuffed to them in some ways\nUm but I I'll give him the excuse she's out a lot of different head coaches during his time\nAs the titans quarterback so maybe this time it's for real you have a defensive coach there who's gonna largely stay out of the way let dolphins do its thing and it it it appears that he has belief in what he's doing he's won them a bunch of games in a close on last week in overtime against the champs\nAlright short time ago we had the giants strict way Cole against the Panthers were touched down that was ... W F a out of the giants radio network also were live and the guy go Fox Sports radio studios easy to say Fifteen Percent or more on car insurance with Geico guy could comical eight or nine four seven ought to the only hard parts\nFiguring out which way is easier so do you have a fantasy team this is about the time of day I think that you should open up the shop and check the score for the first times a lot of time lapse a but we're going to help you if you are stuck out at a kid's birthday party or you're in the backyard doing the honeydew\nLet's check in on your fantasy team the ticker is next on reds on radio\n[laughter]\nThat'll be the thing goes off\nOn we'll have a job or from the city on\nGo home as are right here and he's he's Fox Sports radio\nHey it's been Mather here everybody's got to do list drop off the dry cleaning pick up some milk\nHere's an idea let's that save hundreds of dollars on car insurance and the good thing is you don't have to drop off or pick up anything\nAll you have to do is go to guy go dot com and in Fifteen minutes you could be saving Fifteen Percent or more on car insurance that extra money in your pocket it just may be the most rewarding to do that you do today\nThere it is that one on your point on the game falcons radio network the Steelers lead this game Thirteen to ... to catch is fifty seven ... James ... says come with me if you want to live\nInches away the Steelers and the I guess [laughter]\nAnd James Garner is looking fantastic for the Steelers and lay beyond bells that that was from one one oh two five that Ben Stiller's radio networks look here's the deal about James counter Seventy six on the ground one dog rushing but he's also got to target to to receptions he's the dual threats\nThere were hoping to find in the running back room\nSuperbug about backers of going against James countering fantasy today however it's all good 'cause I got all the ... [noise]\nDown in San Diego they have a casino called sick won but in New York it's a running back he's got three judges for sixty six yards of his store Nineteen yards on the ground as well oh T. V. for catches fifty three yards one path one completion\nFifty seven yards at a store and the giants have their quarterback of the future\nI don't know if you heard about I'd say a crow wells new indoors meant but he is or wiping up around girls right now\nWe'll just ran Seventy seven yard touchdown jobs that we were in commercial saying well found laying down the left side of the field he takes the Tipton [noise] and the jets or an extra point away from time again\nVery discouraged jets radio network play by play their butt girl well on that Raj gain Seventy plus yards of his one twelve on the day with a touch\nDa da da da da da da da da de\n... down around a lot going on ...\nDevoted third of dread it didn't touch down jet laid down that didn't do it missed an opportunity but that's okay I bet she's radio networks been having a blast in rainy Kansas City down\nI Love the way the Kansas City broadcast you say the words like board all it makes them very excited both goals he just keeps interception yes but you saw the\nAd that changed that depends on the board today with their big six and may lead twenty to not being over\nThe ... yeah I mean if you're going to tell me Jacksonville being the top defense in the lead going into this match up that would actually be the cheese with a former recovery for a score two interceptions into Saxon this game so far\nIn Jacksonville falling way behind them statistically I would've said a no no no but uh but that is the case\nLet's point out a couple other names often Hooper the falcons signed that eight catching Seventy two yards um so I keep an eye on him I Know he's available and a lot of league and tight and it's just a wobbly position this year\nUs or a jacket on Austin Hooper Kenyan Drake or the dolphins or carries Twenty one year orange to catch is twenty nine yards and a touchdown and lead Garrett one watch this one five carries six yard\nTouchdown that's right well well well well where's this low class\nJak Kenny Golladay three catches Ninety three yards juice this juice or three judges thirty one yard at a store for the Steelers\nAll right it is time barrel down get focused and get ready for

on\nUh out out a out or I should say ... from the yard standpoint out doing the Panthers by nearly a hundred yards at this point in total often so so yeah look at the giants it has been a story\nThat has gone oh wow look at a high round draft pick it running back really dynamic player\nA old veteran quarterback who can get it done one them a couple of Super Bowls are revamp the offensive line and not fences falling flat with pot trimmer at the helm who had success deep into the playoffs last year with the Vikings and so I think there were a high expectations in low outputs so far this season\nMaybe some more of this creativity is what's going to Boone their success as the season rolls on everybody's still getting used to that op and again judgments made in the first four weeks of the season not usually smart judgments let's wait until we see the end of October before we can tell you what the giants actually look like\nOK Stafford is alliance come up short on third in Eighteen they get just twelve so its fourth in six or are they going to try a field goal or are they going to punch in a way to the Packers and let them get the ball back\nOr the right about the thirty seven yard line so uh that is a place kicker this warming up there ... on the field so they got themselves close enough to at least give it a shot but this is a long one\nThis is going to be what about fifty five yards yeah this is a fifty five yard attempt for parade or on the lions it is on its way it is nowhere near good that things took a right turn about halfway there so now the Packers get the ball and the Packers are going to get really good field position\nMeanwhile in Pittsburgh James Caan or just takes a while in first\nOr so this game is starting to get out of hand for the falcons\nGoes by fantasy saying\nYeah yeah well listen James Garner is one of these guys who I think a lot of people picked up in the later rounds in fantasy football on and it was a smart choice because way beyond bell dug it deals in the ground on these contract negotiations and in the interim number thirty for Pittsburgh is looking maybe like the running back of the future\nOh yeah that's definitely make the case for because even if maybe on comes back doesn't uh doesn't look like he's going to be this still running back next year let's keep an eye on the ravens here real quick as they are facing it is a crucial third down here trailing nine to three\nAnd the ravens are going to have about a third down and to\nFrom the browns six yard line so they're knocking on the door of field

good showing now and the second and your your fantasy doing really well now Iran are y'all\nAll these touchdown passes just throwing it all over the place where I picked\nUp Marquez Valdez scaling oh you did yeah but it's all my badge on a good job I mean it's the Green Bay is down right now this ball game was on Fox twenty four fourteen Detroit has forced three turnovers and this ball game as you mentioned Kansas City leading Jacksonville and club with them thrown into seven right now that game starting the fourth quarter\nAn interesting one right now in the Buffalo Bills leading the titans

uh let's see who defied\nOh my yeah around again Antonio Brown with a second score the game isn't it interesting brown back um people wonder why wide receivers or sets divas there was why\nIt works squeaky wheel back um big game Antonio Brown big game both of them after squawking this week\nAbout their off at well here's the deal and I mean and to me this is one of the things that I'm taking away from social media now watching a a college team even experienced some of these things as a color analyst\nAt the college level ... everybody wants to have a voice now and everybody's aware that the more of a voice you have on social media\nAre the more famous you become and with fame come inherent privileges or you get treated differently than everybody else you get endorsement deals you get huge shoot deals and so Antonio Brown and they'll back in the junior I have no idea if this is manufactured if they're letting their quarterback in on the joke\nBut they are becoming Hoover famous\nAt they're given position for making a lot of noise outside of what they're doing on the field we seen this work at the quarterback position and have wild success stories like Richard Sherman attacking Crabtree and Josh Norman attacking though Dell back in the junior and all of a sudden there were launched\nInto super stardom and they are in these giant contracts and everybody wonders why it's because they're box office it's because not only they counted on the field but they also get people to buy their jerseys and ownership of teams understand that that's a significant play gentlemen Ramsey\nRandomly these same things over the Jacksonville Jaguars like a book I mean he's absolutely following the thing to the\nGQ article asked me a question about another player I'll read them for you just ask\nI mean that's the game that he's playing a people taking his face value you probably shouldn't um but you're a you're a hundred percent right alright Tennessee Titans Ryan sucked up fifty yards through the upright good that's clutch\nFor forty three to go in that game the titans of just taking the lead for the first time twelve to ten at the bills speaking of box office this game is lacking it [laughter] well to lead that football game or Cincinnati\nHas moved now into scoring territory in my or not in Miami but against Miami Joe mixed in with a big run that has got them in field goal range five forty and counting Cincinnati and the dolphins tied up at Seventeen\nAnd the bangles threatening to score this will be a devastating loss for Miami after going three into after having the game go the way it did in New England last week so now have them when they Seventeen nothing lead in Cincinnati to see this dissipate and lose the football game I could definitely put them emotionally in the wrong state of\nMind well yes and and also when you're you're losing tune AFC team and you're aware of how important it is to have the edge in the AFC especially when you're in the ... in the same division\nAs the patriots your hopes of beating them out for the top spot in your division are slim as they are every year so AFC rivals especially for a team like the dolphins rolling

problem their answer is no touchdown Carolina\nBackup by two scores twenty six sixteen\nPoint after is on the way so Carolina back in control however still plenty of time if only the giants wouldn't let the quarterback oh Dale back him throw the ball a little bit more uh maybe they've still got a shot in this day and eleven Twenty one to go they're going to need some help jets out a\nField goal twenty seven to ten and the lions just converted a big third down and one which continues to tick tick tick on the clock plus\nThere in the field goal range rich and they do not have the field goal problems that the Packers do today even a field goal here all would be a big deal although it's a ... game and it would still be a to score game if that's the case if you're just joining us base in Crosby today as attempted three field goals and missed them all\nYeah no and you know here's here's the big thing about the Detroit Lions right now\nA extending these drives is absolutely crucial you need to milk as much of the clock as possible you've entered your four minute mode and you're here in the early stage of the fourth quarter and so yeah you're going to see a lot more of this they're running the ball and they're doing it effectively now here in Detroit and do we have an injury\nI carry on Johnson a little slow to get up a little campy looks to largely be okay though nice run for him is going to set up first and goal for the lions also a big play coming out in Cincinnati in his third in goal and about the two and a half yard line right now\nFor the bangles three forty five and counting at a tie game\nA ... going to come out in a shotgun formation with mixed into his rights or they'll fake it to\n... you know if a kicker this earlier in his career he's caught\nNo ... and and later in his career you may give him another game but I'm ... I'm not saying he's ruined but this is this is a really bad showing that he can't seem to get them out of this whole\nWow All right so a lot just happened delayed us but we're we're going to get to it right now fantasy ticket [laughter]\nI'm much more fantasy ticket [noise]\nAll right we're going to start in a game that we thought was going to be wonderful for fantasy players and it was high old Bradley\nExtra fix and wants to hear it I\nThey asked dealers radio network is fantasy owners are asking where did you come from as well there you are six catches one hundred and one yard to touch downs for a B\nAaron Rodgers is in Detroit and like a mold he just won't go away\nI for me [laughter]\nJoins Rogers from\nOne yard touchdown pass last Kendrick\nYeah so that was earlier touched on Kendrick tag on another one that ...

opportunity to put this within a within range of a win Crosby on the sideline beside himself because nobody else's near him\nAll right now we got to shift our attention to Carolina where the giants with just over two minutes to go travel thirty to twenty four but have the ball so here comes the two minute drill\nThey've got a second into coming up at their own thirty three yard line they've hit the two minute warning so here comes the second into the line many much maligned this year the offensive line the same\nBut they've had a decent day today they've certainly done a good job of getting old job back I'm involved with the first time\nHe's got it catches a hundred thirty one yards a score and he also through a trick play the sake one Barclay first score Barclay as forty eight yards on the ground sixty six through the air and a touchdown catch that went for fifty seven yards so I Do love the giants chances year but they got to shout\nI'll tell you so mad Stafford jobs back first intent after the turnover rundown Smith kick in Detroit and what happens first rattle of the box\nThe Seahawks just strip Jared golf and forced apart so here come the Seahawks onto the field and the chargers and raiders are at the home of the raiders or even though it's not the home of the raiders will keep you up to date on all of this let's get David gas got in here as well update to fall scoreboard\nDidn't die seven seven check this out we were watching well one of the studios I was watching the browns or ravens game ...\nYou guys yes and direct TV turning came off\nWhat it'll do what for channel seven oh five to seven or seven so if everyone's watching this at home and listen to the show whatever turned seven o seven or eight out there it is what the hell man\nYeah three Eighteen to go in the overtime Syria and and I now Baltimore how's the ball back still tied nine nine\nOh Flaco through a prayer almost answered but they're gonna have to put the browns would you time outs remain an extra session or need the football back ball game is tied nine nine now I'm going to have to do this because Mason Crosby had a brutal day at the office and this will be a a special tribute to him\nThree hours away\nYou know his law\n\nPanther I come from behind a beat the giants thirty three thirty one and also more for Mason Crosby\nHolding down\nFunny\nHow many of their God God it's

jaguars they fall in Kansas City thrown into fourteen Pittsburgh club the Atlanta forty one Seventeen\nBen Roethlisberger ... at a pretty good game because James Caan or a hundred eighty five twenty yards into CDs and turn you around six grams per one oh one\nAnd a score a couple of scores are Deborah loses in New York to the jet thirty four sixty nights aircrew well Fifteen carries for two hundred and Nineteen yard in this contest also had a one score one of them for Seventy seven yards out as a team the jet to dirty Russia's for three hundred and twenty three yards\nKind of gives you like the patch for like a shot penny and the aspects yes these that that was it was wild a couple of the afternoon games as you mentioned charges lead the raiders\nThree nothing Vikings and eagles on Fox there's no score same thing in the Pacific northwest Seahawks and ... just underway and in Santa Clara the cardinals and forty niners that game is also school this guy's a\nI'm going to go look for new kicker yeah Crosby uh he's joined thinking sell us right now and the a waiver wire browns\nUp just signed Mason draws now that I'm looking forward to tomorrow I did they live guy go far sports radio studios easy to say fifty percent or more cautious guy go God could are calmer eight or nine four seven out only ... plug figuring out which way is easier Baker may feel just\nTook off running um and now a third in age from their own Eighteen is coming up until after two minute warning raiders in forty niners both knocking on the door and the red zone a marsh Charlottesville take it to the five\nFor the forty niners I Believe it's a touchdown is that Brita it is Matt ... for an opening Dr touched down for the forty niners they'll lead the cardinals the raiders trailing three to nothing or knock it on the door with a lot of second in gold coming up\nBut it's the quarter break so that'll be the first day of the second quarter the\nRams are blocked apart for the second time already this year act by the way it did that at home against the chargers as well\nPlayer Corey little tin who's the San Diego kid comes screaming up the middle and both of these I don't know if anybody studying special teams filming NFL but the Seahawks allowed the same exact play to beat them on the block pond so rams are knocking on the door and the red zone and this game in Seattle\nRight there was a mat breeders shoveled paths from CJ bathroom such that the extra point is no good mainly because they they never checked it\nSo watch this to get a well let's see if they'll replay they snapped it and I don't know the whole just wasn't in the right spot but Robby gold walked up to the ball and then just didn't kick it\nAnd so on no extra point they're forty niners laid six nothing being John Brown's third down huge play I'm Antonio ... finds cow away and that one is going to move the ball down field and Mrs Mayfield on a total improvisation\nHe finds no that's not Callaway actually oh who's this now uh yeah this is their fourth receiver\nWho's going to flip the field and take it to the other end I'm I'm gonna get a name for you number eighty four that's deemed Willie of course yeah of\nCourse the ... which sounds like a joke name that you give your buddy in high school yes a de ... is taking the ball to the Baltimore forty three\nFirst down a bunch of course the Cleveland kicking game is going to need more and there's a minute sixteen left is all on the clock and I hate we said every week I hate this clock thing in overtime or because we are getting ... perilously close to get another tie well\nAnd that would be the second time the season for the Cleveland Browns or the Bronx I mean that would be absolute insanity after seeing back to back ties in the NFL for the first time\nA in is since the Nineteen seventies uh we could potentially see the first team with two ties in lord knows how long and so the browns\nIs it ever it is ever go\nIts ... Greg Joe so food today is made from thirty five minutes from fifty five but also missed an extra point\nClaimed it off the upright you know the browser going to want to get as close as possible they're going to get ahead off here and that's a I don't think that's hard I think that's a ... Johnson do Johnson's get to take about ten yards off the right side\nAnd that'll definitely help and get it down inside the thirty five yard line still along field goal still a very long field goal but this is going to go down to well actually he's inside the thirty to the twenty eight so it'd be about a forty five yard or from right here\nNo no it it you're you're well within range of ... field goal for an NFL kicker you'd assume but we've seen a lot of crazy things this season and the kicking game already a field goals let alone extra points and here we go do Johnson junior still in the game and rumbled\nFor another six yards up the right side of this line the browns right now imposing their will up running this game Oakland by the way in LA right now knocking on the door second and\nGoals that can go from the five now there is a flag down so this'll probably moved back a little bit let's keep our eyes on the browns only twelve seconds to go in this game second and father run it again and again do jobs will take it to the Nineteen they're going to run this clock down time out\nAnd bring the kicking unit out onto the field for what\nShould be about uh thirty eight thirty nine yard or and this one scares you because that's close enough to wearing NFL kicker is expected to make it and if he doesn't I have a feeling the browns might be a cutting their second kick her again this year\nThis is incredible it's just incredible well let's also incredible as how many overtime games they play it in through this this short season so far four out of five weeks\nA and do John from receiving do credit on the sideline as he leaves the field and Joseph Greg Joseph new kicker in Cleveland are lined up\nFor what will be probably the most important kick in his very young rookie career here thirty seven yard at times\nThird and one\nIt'll be the final play this game\nFrom the right harsh Joseph for the browns the kick is blocked blocked what it was so\nMad\nThing that has happened this is Matt rounds defeat the ravens twelve and on All right so a trajectory on which makes\nChris Carson and continues to lead to the mystery of where is your first round running back ray shot penny and and we don't see this very often you know when you watch your team invest first round money into a player usually very is ownership and executive pressure\nTo play that guy and so is the one thing to say look Chris Carson is clearly out played them so that's going to be our guy right now we're going to use them in okay fine but he's not even the backup\nHe's not even getting he's not even get you know Chris Carson miss the game last week Amos comes in runs for a hundred yards and so you can't blame it on the offensive line any more than ... back to back one hundred yard rush years\nI I think it's definitely cause for concern for shot petty\nYeah there are times where with rookie use and um and this has happened many times throughout my plane career and then afterwards following the game where it comes a point where the coaches sort of make up their mind and be a consensus decide you're taking a red shirt year\nAnd I don't know if that's the case in Seattle yet but if you can help now\nAnd these coaches their whole lives depend on winning or you're not just talking about the the head coach you're talking about the assistance to what happens do assistance when the head coach loses his job by by ... it's like when you clap your hands loudly by a flock of birds it's ... they're gone and so this is an issue\nAnd and when you don't have a play or even if he is a top round talent coming out performing well sometimes you say okay we're going to pump the brakes we're going to let this the developing simmer and I think that's the decision at least early in the season they've made with rich shot penny\nRaiders out the ball deep in their own zone three three inside between the raiders and the chargers as of right now the rams trying to answer the Seahawks touchdowns hard girlie takes a little catch out in the flat and we'll take it into the red zone so first down for the rest of the Nineteen\nBut it's an interesting starts this game still late first quarter nothing to worry about it yet but you do wonder I even joined sailor told us earlier today Sean the base where the factor seems not taste any adversity yet\nAt all for oh all seemingly I mean not blowout winds blow the Vikings out um and there goes girl in fact inside the five now to be first and goal\nSo ah you know they they'd been in some ball games they were trailing the raiders at halftime on opening night so I get that but they have not really been challenged hard in the fourth quarter of a game you wonder if a road trip to Seattle today might be the day\nWell I'll tell you it's a challenging environment I played a couple of games in Seattle and it is one of the more uh active venues as far as the twelve man's concerned and I believe we have a girly touchdown ... that's the ruling on the field as the rams have gone down the field and had their way with this ... defense much the same\nThat we see every week outta the rams offensively this this feels like a jog or not they're receivers\nAre all playing exceedingly well they're running back is playing exceedingly well they're often the wind is playing mean and their quarterback to dealing there aren't too many weak spots so yeah you have been hit much adversity but it's because your powering through all of it\nChargers raiders game I'm looking at this right now or the raiders just got a penalty on Melvin Ingram I'm Still confused especially as an ... a former officers Wyman maybe you can help me\nStill confused as far as who draws who all sides when everybody's moving before the ball gets now who's the penalty on\nWell what what happens is if a defensive linemen and Curt encroaches in the neutral zone and then an up and said why men respond\nThen it is defensive all sides or or you call it encroachment right and so that that's what you see when there's a ton of movement it usually means that a defender of fell into the neutral zone jumped out of his stance on ... minutes trying to grab the easy five yards\nAre the extra point for the rams is up and go the Gurley touchdown is confirmed southern tied at seven ... their\nMain signed the Vikings defense\nVaunted group coming into the year so far today in Philadelphia has sort of look like that group Carson once in a company has had a hard time getting things started early in that game Vikings lead it\nThree two

couple of weeks in the in the defense hasn't been able to hold up their end of the bargain but ah I'll give credit to Pittsburgh defense is especially their\nTheir their past Russian and the pressure that they they created a if it's a foundation an element of what they do defensively and it gave Atlanta fits all day today and uh you know you always saw Matt Ryan out of sync with his guys today and uh I I just think that that was one of the keys that\nThan they were they were there was never that called for when he talked back to pass because Pittsburgh it's such a good job or whether it was just a poor man rush or you know kind of his own blitz scheme where they show up at ... on the office\nWell I um yeah sometimes they're adding five sometimes are adding you know another guy gets six\nSo they kept them on their toes all day and not focus was what's astrology what they deal with what's packages is is pretty challenging it's not going to be clean course all day but we've got to be as good as we can be and and I think if you were talking that he wasn't as good as they they needed to be but yeah\nYou you mentioned earlier that defensively or I mean\nYou know usually off ... let them down to the shootout today neither side of the ball wanted to show up they weren't able to get constant pressure on on being they weren't able to separate themselves and stop the run what do they need to do defensively the juice off\nWhere it's going to be because those key injuries that key spots on I think one of the things that\nThat ... shirt with us is you know when when you're

Rosen looking pretty good and even despite you know the game that first couple of plays that he came into the game and they say hey man what was it a ... a few games back but now he's a he's doing this thing is he has a team fourteen of fourteenth six\nBut another team that I feel like we're not talking about enough is the ... and I actually picked this team to represent the NFC and the super bowl that is the Carolina Panthers\nA tough when there was a difficult when today a credit the giants were stick it in and hanging in there and finding a way to actually take the lead but then of course the Panthers or when it on a field goal um which is harder to nowadays even extra points are hard\n... I Do know and that's what's funny\nAh two thousand two or something one of the Nineteen eighty five what they did today they ran the ball who does that\nAnymore they did more that run the ball thirty eight times they rushed the ball\nFor three hundred and twenty yards men that I\nMean I'm trying to think of well never mind with the last time I mean other than the Vikings and Adrian Peterson\nWhere else would you go for it I mean that was like that run a priest home shot Alexander remember Larry Johnson A L T I O the there was like that era you guys getting the ball at the minimum thirty five times again yeah it's just what it was and and one of the plays that are that accounts for those three hundred and twenty three hours with this\nI've had for well just ran Seventy seven yards for a touchdown I Apologize if we were in commercial as I say I crawl\nFound on laying down the left side of the field he takes [laughter] [noise] and the jets or an extra point away from time again\nHe was disgusted he was just ready to network there on the ... so that is that they went to a commercial so on and they weren't editor Marshall break while the touchdown happen came back you hear them cut the commercial halfway off and he's like\nYeah that was a touchdown by the way who ... who ... who either got fired or who got suspended\nFrom something that something that they miss time that they did a but man I'm telling you I was laughing at this because yesterday was doing the show or that if there was the apartment and we're talking about just the fact that whatever happened to the future back remember growing up you knew all the features back yeah of course is in the and the uh I was\nA married man Emmett Smith Thurman Thomas I mean ...

Gurley a run for about three are touchdown run there waiting on this\nExtra point because the way these extra points are set up\nTo see that you never know a little weight here two seconds to see if it's good it's up you have I made it barely made it and it's good twenty four tight in this game five left with a third a tiger early again looking looking really good\nAnd it's amazing the way also how they used ... by the way because you forget ... Gurley if you need to you can load up and twenty five thirty times you can\nGo in there at all you could you he's one of those guys we talked about earlier today are not a lot of them in the league\nHe's a bill Carrey you can call you about twenty five\nThirty times a game and it gets stronger as defenders get tired and and and you know and and weaker throughout the course of the games on the fourth quarter he's a big deal he's able to do and accomplish a lot\nThe best the best part about this for the rams they haven't had to use him like that right so as you mentioned later on during the season let's say come we ate and you're like oh we need is some teams you know maybe the games are tighter or some of these teams have a you know you're better off running against and maybe they have explosives ... that's when he's going to be fresh\nHe's at at its you know he's because he's not being use thirty thirty five times just simply running it I mean yeah he gets the ball definitely in the background as a receiver but they're not running the ball thirty thirty five times with him beating them down wearing them down\nSo I think he's gonna be for a second half of the season when they really may decide to start going to have some more um interesting it'd be interesting to see that for sure the writers are down here\nAnd soul\nNo signal yet looks like maybe they were stopped short the one yard line trying to score touched down here against the charges charges up twenty six to three up big on the raiders man tough season right now for the raiders as we mentioned there one in three looks either gonna fought and won it for and it could have been on five to ... to get robbed last week\nUm\nDo you think about that they're going to have a extremely high draft pick if this continues why would be wide open touchdown oh because it looks like a tight in was wide open on the outside to hurry up got the ball\nRight as the other ... set the ball down in a hike it and they just do it all the way out to the rise with that title joining us it could be joining us I couldn't see has already Nelson\nWhy how is joining Nelson wide open because I Want to see the replay how this happened so again they got\nDown to the one that was not a touchdown they broke the huddle nobody went over to the huddle in yeah just for some reason the best receiver maybe the best receive are
