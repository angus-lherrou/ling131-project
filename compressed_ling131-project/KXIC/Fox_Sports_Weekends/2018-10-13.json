there now\nYou talked about Herbert and obviously that's going to be one of the other Markey games Oregon hosting Washington tomorrow\nDoes he look like the number one pick in the draft you mean like

handle being that number one overall franchise guy\nAgain you know this year you got so many good prospects out there again with the guy like family guy like Steven Montana's even out of Colorado\nA

in the postseason [noise]\nUm you know uh\nI just as far as tonight I'm\n[noise] first of all we gave up too many bases we didn't play claim when he was in the game [noise] fair's fair to the game but uh as far as clay I I just think it was a [noise]\nOr execution and stuff was good but she just made mistakes and the strike zone and uh defensively again we didn't do any favors\nMaybe there's aren't going to build and their way through this series how big was it in your opinion to get that rally together in the eighth inning and make a naval we're a little there and\nI thought I thought we we played a an entire baseball game I did try for them to use later for three innings tonight [noise]\nAnd uh [noise] for us to get a good look at their arms and the and I thought that we are good at fast [laughter] oh wait until the ah so you know they were selling out obviously ... with a Josh won three and excite against us but I thought are as bad as even when we weren't scoring runs I thought they were competitive\nQuestion today I'm Down to write\nAbout stunning was it to see what drove rarely has bad in the major leagues or pitcher no kid hit a home run off her Charlotte\nYou know for

way this game ended it seemed like you guys picked up some momentum is that something you can carry into\nTomorrow I saw I saw that um the guys in the ... came in and I thought we could have bought well [noise] I thought our quality throughout the night was good I I Know we've punched a lot\nTonight [laughter] but they're run into some good arms out there\nBut for us to get a look at these guys out of the pen and a seven game series I think that's a good thing and um for our guys to [noise] you know for us to have the tying run a third base window some good things tonight so um yeah the goal is to win a baseball game but I think that\nShows the ah the computer in our guys\nAre so there's Dave Robertson one quick thing to get too you're\nTalking about he was asked about ... I mean our guy was in there to standing in the back they send it back Dave next to Tom ... is that about ... and how he pitches I thought he did alright\nI guarantee you the one decision day Roberts would do over again if he could was bringing or he is in the seventh inning because at that point\nHe brings in but it's a five one game and the Dodgers are doing nothing against the brewers really are not hater comes in for three innings and they're doing that they had the one in ... home run and they've been doing nothing so at this point or is this coming in to eat in a ...\nTo come into it so I don't want to use one of my good relievers and I'm going to bring in a guy 'cause it's five what gives up the home run so you are right okay it's a six one game\nTurns out to be six five and you realize man had I brought in one of my better relievers not you're bringing a jets at that point but had I stuck with one of the guys are brought in the ...\nWere doing a lot better and instead of bringing a guy to eat innings and he turns out to give up\nThe game winning homerun I bet you that's the last time we see him this series and that's the last time day Roberts will say All right I'm going to a guy who is one of my weaker guys at the end of the game because five one is not out of reach not what this led them eventually with relievers and this is and this is a truth no matter what kind of open you have\nEventually with relief pitchers if you start going to too many of them you will find the one guy having a bad night and the brewers kept going and like they found Jeffress was the guy having a bad night no matter what you can try to bring in what you're really rolling the dice saying okay five guys come in and every body pitch well you will find that one guy who was not his night\nYeah we'll look at as Jane Roberts chose his words carefully certainly execution when it comes to quaint and courage saw that one stood out\nA and but ... the the long pause before he was okay it was alright ... or ... is very telling of decision process you could see him rolling back those decisions in his head as your role there and certainly\nHaving him on the roster certainly raised a lot of eyebrows as you got into this round so that's the other thing you know you're ... you're left a couple of guys who are important to you over the course of the year off the hope that really is coming off his injury\nWas ready for primetime Twitter out how about a fresco Mike it's rolling down the Jason's rich with my arm and coming up next we got more on this game the latest from Vegas on a very big weekend in college football the national football league this August view Joe Jr already\nHad that Texas Rangers that has a job and if you don't get that go with that [noise]\n[laughter]\n\nI like talking about earlier I took him out\nEarly [laughter] we're\n\nNot standing in the ... the\nM LB postings at Largo Roger Dodger fan pregnant in high in the area\nWe got you covered\nBlock sports radio even if you're a big basketball fan there might be a few facts about the game you don't know why did you know the first groups were actually peach basket or that award basketball is bounce you're then the cold one or the players can run as much as four miles during a game\nTo the college football playoff and of course we'll have a stranglehold on the pack twelve north this is strong number though on the road off the stadium for Washington linked three and a half\nEvery time this number ticks down to three there's professional money coming in on the husky and while the series for twelve out of the last fourteen years has been dominated by Oregon winning twelve in a row Washington is kind of flip the script the last two years drumming the ducks a hundred and eight to twenty four during those two meetings\nI look at the coaching mismatch and Chris Petersen I'll have a game plan and store miles gas can has a day and this one feels like fool's gold if you want about the home underdog here\nGeorgia LSU will only have a couple of matchups between ... Georgia sitting and number two seven point road favorite LSU and we all love ... does he have any voice well by the\nFirst time since two thousand eight Georgia go on the road to Baton Rouge and you gotta love those unveil on schedule isn't the SEC and how things play themselves out\nWhen you look at this Georgia team despite their hot start largely untested\nYes they have a few dominating lens against actually seized opponents in South Carolina and Missouri and Vanderbilt but at the same time\nI mean this is a Georgia team that has a lot of youth on the defensive side but I don't think Ellis you can really test them and we talk about a game with the sun out a tiger stadium it's a far cry from that bourbon infused environment that you get under the lights\nAnd LSU was exposed in my opinion a little bit the last two weeks as far as they're run defenses concerned giving up three hundred and fifty plus yards door to go on the road they win this game covering the process and I think the game also stays under the total\nYou know I think that's actually something harm and make something in a bourbon infused environment I Do I have\nCoach oh in the kitchen 'cause then Jason we might have quite the reality show on her and if it's harm and coach oh making bourbon infused sponge cake or I don't know what the hell you do with bourbon and\nI don't know can we get that Greenland on Fox Sports one you up on our\nPossibility I mean lock it and it would provide the perfect leading the turning that into a ratings buster with you and coach oh doing your own cooking show during the college football season\nI thought I was speaking of college football knows a lot of talk about going number one overall the NFL Draft certainly Justin Herbert getting a lot of attention especially coming off of Eli Manning's like night last night is he right now the odds on favorite\nHe is not the odds on favorite to be the number one pick in the draft I wouldn't bet on line daddy Jiang some odds on that they actually made at all over the favorite the talented defensive lineman ought to Houston well I think he's going to be the best player or we know the quarterback dominate the discussion and ultimately if it is the giants drafting number one\nThey won't be drafting on the line there'll be drafting a quarterback\nSo Herbert make the most likely fit there I think he checks all the boxes\nProvide significantly more mobility and he's the guy that can give you that versatility and strong arm but don't worry about some of the other talented quarterbacks it'll be in the ...\nAh when you look at Ryan's family out of in the state trying to upgrade his stock a you'll have a guy like will grew out of West Virginia ah drew lock from Missouri but little to say the giants we'll probably start examining their two thousand Nineteen draft plant because they're the only team that has the worst record in the Cleveland Browns since the beginning of last season\nRight John I last question goes to the show directly I mean how much due to kill you to see sound wearing the crown\nI was waiting for that I I was waiting for that I had it coming it kills me to watch him where

radio if you love big games in football if you're a fan of huge football games\nYou need something to happen on Saturday in order to make that happen right so I Will explain what that is coming up ten minutes from now here on Fox Sports radio so I've always I I'm a firm believer never fight in public\nBecause\nThat's all that people will have an image of when they when they see you and your better half never fight in public\nYou you could be out whatever save it hold onto it get in the car would you get home and then I have a conversation about it and then I have an argument but never fight in public because it does it just you give the perception of being dysfunctional and\nPeople that maybe don't understand all the intricacies of the argument or the discussion or the past or whatnot\nThey now see that and all they've got to go by is what the you'll just shown them and that you guys screaming at each other over a text message from somebody I'm a name Renee but Renee is that actually a woman a it's a guy name Renee and he's from Montreal\nLike ... you know there there's a lot that could go on to fight ... fight your way between couples but\n\nI've said this from the beginning that the only people that hate Thursday Night Football more than the players or coaches a bad teams\nThey hate him because\nYou get exposed because now\nThat fight that you deal with is it mixed in with like eleven or twelve games on a Sunday when everybody's distracted or behind closed doors now it's on the stage in front of everybody\nAnd we're all watching and we're also seeing it and we're all witnessing just how bad you really are you can kind of hide 'em there's a safety in numbers thing with the NFL when there's a bunch of games going on\nThere's usually that one game that nobody really cares about are the teams really bad or it's a blowout and you're just going to dismiss it and you go through the red zone or whatever on your Sunday ticket or the game mix\nBut\nOnce you go on a Thursday night game and you're bad then you get exposed to everybody it's why we've seen an overreaction to stand alone games in the past it's why the bangles fired their office of coordinator after week to last season\nBut two weeks in your ... coordinator why didn't you just do it two weeks earlier\n... well I don't get it\nBecause it was a standalone stage and you were embarrassed on national TV and you had to react chip Kelly got fired when\nIn Philadelphia when the eagles got beat up\nOn Saturday Night football late in the season after ... seasons he was done in Philadelphia and it was the stand alone game and a division rival that was the tipping point and the straw that broke broke the camera camel's back\nAnd chip Kelly was done the only people that hate Thursday Night Football more than the players or coaches for bad teams 'cause now all their dysfunction plays out in front of everybody it's like a fight in public with your with your girlfriend your boyfriend it's a bad situation more at a football next\nYear [laughter] [noise]\nOkay Ben matter here this is a thirty second commercial and I'm going to throw a lot of numbers that you would please stay with me you're

Smith a Canadian in his own right invented the sport of basketball basically in a group in Canada's trying to bring bring their sport back to the motherland apparently a business group in Quebec\nMet with commissioner Adam Silver earlier this week and they are preparing to install a bit to try to bring a professional basketball franchise to Quebec of course we know they have a great success with throughout the raptors\nNot so much success with the Vancouver Grizzlies that moved to Memphis or by trying to bring basketball back to Canada you like to move or no\n[noise] um [noise] I just wait until they have the raptors [laughter] Toronto does not not Montreal yet I don't get as human Seattle first I don't know what why does why don't lead is it just to have options not sure\nI mean you think Vegas was probably in in the pipeline somewhere to because they're going to have two professional franchises within the next couple of years I mean\nThe NFL could figure out which which\nGames they could put it in London and win games they could put an Azteca Stadium but they couldn't figure out a catch until recently right ... why why don't why are we doing this all raw white and the most difficult thing first aid scene look\nSeattle seems like they desperately wanna team back right and and I don't mean growing up this this super sonics were always a good team no doubt they are and they had good players I get that just seems like a no brainer nobody's clamoring for called back right\nNow where they had a great fan base to Seattle to instill do we know there was a lot of appreciates the game earlier this week where the Oklahoma City thunder came in and Kevin Durant wars old Seattle Sonics Jersey and they went nuts they loved it up there still\nAnd and by the way that's not it not to take a shot at our friends listening on ah TSN up in Canada you know we love you you know we talk CFL football here and in fact we're going to do and all CFL edition\nOf the Jonas knock show here on Fox Sports radio that'll be coming up October thirty third all CFL talk for hours\nOf nothing but the CFL October thirty third here on Fox Sports\nRadio and I believe us at Oklahoma City thunder of course the rent no place for the Golden State warriors so that's a slip on my part by the way we want a cat here thing everybody's hammered no one knows her\nFight for a while and it's still plan who knows [laughter] by the way so I think a big reason why Seattle and the reason why the sonics mood was because there wasn't a lot of private funding for a stadium apparently this group and Quebec\nIs willing to pay two billion dollars to fund the building of a stadium and buying a franchise so I think more or less nowadays we're talking about these franchises popping up who's willing to basically pay the entire bill and not have to use public money so I think that's kind of the direction these things are going because people don't want to pay taxpayer money for these arenas\nLook Adam Silver you want to do something fun man All right 'cause I Know Adam Silver everybody fall washes like he's the he's a cool guy man he's he's a cool commissioner is so cool like because he fired Donald Sterling means for God's sakes man\nYou had to do is listen to that interview he gave and you want to fire to me and what are we talking about it I wasn't like a a momentous job done by Adam Silver that was a no brainer ... um if Adam Silver really wants to to make a move that's going to resonate with people\nWhy don't you do the smart thing ... and put betting boost in every stadium okay let's turn this up a notch right let's let's really get people excited to go to uh Hawkes game\nThat's ... that's going to be difficult no matter what you do\nYou see your negative and I was just such a negative person Kevin ... is just the negativity from ... supporting candidate over Atlanta how dare you\nI'm just a realist Joan oh who doesn't love them ounces come on yeah [laughter]\nRight reading taxing by by the way the mouse he's correct\nCowboys and then it was once again Jerry Jones or did an interview earlier today as he always does it's I mean there's a microphone on his face he's going to talk this amazing on the fan once again it says dairy Jason Garrett is absolutely the real deal there was no fraud and Jason Garrett he is going to leave the cowboys to a championship\nOf course it's just a few games or five hundred has only made the playoffs a couple of times\nAs head coach and he's been there for a long while at the pig you back on that story earlier this week I saw this too apparently cowboy fans have started a petition to bring back Tony Romo out of retirement\nPosition is twenty five hundred signatures are as of about ten minutes ago they had about seventeenth outs use me Seventeen hundred and fifty\nIf okay if ... and this is just the blind game but if I told you that I've got a quarterback\nAnd he had a really really really good year I'm ... and in fact he he's had some really really good games and then not that long after that really really good year I took away his top too wide receiver targets and also his office of line was significantly worse\nNow do you expect him to still be a great quarterback no questions asked\nWell let's see the hall of famer no uh like Aaron Rodgers type\n... right ah that's Prescott yup and for people that are that are crushing debt Prescott like its adapt Prescott problem in Dallas what were your ex but what did you think he was I don't understand like he\nCan win ... games he's already won ... games at the NFL level but you need pieces around him he's not Rogers to your point he's not a uh Drew Brees he's not Brady and anybody that's expecting him to still put up big numbers when he lost everybody his off I mean he lost an offensive lineman to a disease before the season\nAnd the idea that he should still be putting up these great numbers that he did his rookie years just unrealistic there really is I I just I I I I don't understand now the petition to bring back Tony Robbins mhm [noise]\nI was I was watching the Tony Romo football life documentary I have ever going to have yeah you know it's it's actually really good um Fox Sports radio makes an appearance on the uh Tony Romo documentary oh somebody sent out a tweet like they did a screen shot one of the reviews of Tony Romo Z or early games as a broadcaster\nBecoming ... rod Stewart's biggest\nHit Nineteen Seventy six tonight tonight number one\nFor me\n\nThere's or look back at\nWouldn't leave\nWhen it goes

use pretty much every arm in their bullpen they being the brewers in game one just to try to eke out that game one victory I'm telling you this is a series of attrition this isn't a short you know three game five game series\nYou this thing go six or seven is going to always going to tilt right into the Dodgers favor because\nNot withstanding from game one with Kurdish are getting rough up there and a lot of it was due to a lot of errors behind them that that I ... I had one of the worst and he did not have the greatest season either or by the way just offensively as I'm unemployed right now not at all of a a ... as a hitter he was excellent on a plate not so much\nSo I Do think it was one of those maybe the Dodgers lost the battle but they could end up winning the war if\nThey have to keep going through their bullpen the way they did earlier today or I should say on friday night or it could have a bode well for the Dodgers moving forward the deeper and deeper we get into the series and you started wearing down these guys were they rely on so much like Josh later I'm Sorry that's a quick turnaround today for like a\nFour o'clock out first pitch their Milwaukee no doubt yeah\nYeah yeah yeah big time and I thought last night actually felt the Dodgers after after Taylor hits the triple ...

I I think I Would shoot keeps his cool that they have a real shot to win this game at home I Know a last week was tough I I actually think that that was you can pull off the upset\nWell it's ... it's about seven and a half point line I think right now a ... shoes off is going to have to produce and we've all seen like that is a problem and that's an issue\nSo I got to see how their office is going to drive the ball against this you know Georgia defense with any consistency with who you know you have to put up Twenty one points so I go see if they can\nPut up on you know well I Want to see borrow and and now he's been at times he's looked really good\nAt a time she she struggled a you know it's interesting because you know he is thrown for nine touchdown and a twelve hundred yards and fifty yards\nA more there's more than from from stroke for twelve hundred yards so the numbers are pretty calm mhm um I you know again Georgia's Georgia's good really good defense can run the ball very balanced attack uh I've just looking for I just think it's great football\nYeah she'll be great I mean I I don't know I I don't know if that LSU can can win it I Know it would be a lot different now but in the daytime I think Georgia you know they they look like this is a game that can can you put them up in those yeah in the standings with a solid win in al issue they know what's at stake here\nYeah uh Oregon and Washington it's another of three thirty eastern twelve thirty Pacific game where where did the credible did three thirty twelve thirty games are awesome today\nI mean really Georgia oh issue Washington Oregon you got Penn State Michigan State which I think the game you got to Texas and Baylor and I'm going to tell you ... you may agree with me but I think Baylor is live today\nWell if you look if there is a chance that you can beat taxes\nToday's the day yeah because they're coming off this incredible when All right over OU in the red river shootout incredible when I mean the best time Herman's tenure in two years right now and so they're all a huge right now they're all believe in the quarterback and the coach if\nThere was a time for malleable in the Baylor Bears to jump on today's the day\nYup yup I'm ... I'm smelling it\nI'm smell of it I say they got a real shot\nAt Texas a embarrassed Baylor last year they ran up the score Baylor's all beat up played a bunch of freshman Matt rules has not forgotten what happened a year ago I mean I just think and I know bales office right now is those\nAs good as they have been that's never happened the the defense has suffered a little bit though not as a top five defense right only because they're on the field more and\nThere were because they could they score it so quickly last week they scored other first play yeah and there are certain play\nBall but you know I mean they'd never throwing the ball like this before and so you're telling me no matter what they are defensively anymore because they're jumping on these legion teams are literally having to throw the ball against them or you know in order to like at least make the games somewhat close\nSo we're looking at history right here in to your question is it all just an exercise with getting to the championship game and how close can another team Ohio State Clemson whoever it is how close can they keep it right now because that's what it looks like\n[noise] yeah I I mean ... and ... he doesn't throw it completion\nNo he throws bombs [noise] like we've we've ... is the fact is the south pole just makes it look God you know like why giving\nYou Steve Young boomers size and throw it might pick how many left handed quarterback indoor gyms or me go through the list of them I mean there was a handful of guys that you can remember that we're living in L.

I have is I just had his basic said well I mean that's five percent at a point to heat stroke for Fifteen hundred yards and get you know it's funny he winds up sitting\nAnd I know it for half a ridiculous so ... that that's all going on right now and we we've never seen we've always said what if Alabama ever had a real cool yeah yeah we've always said that what they've got a real quarterback what would it look like well this is what it looks like\nYou're you're got NFL talent\nAnd all these different positions they've got three first round pick so defense that are sitting there was it might be more right now the officers' wives got two guys are going to go high you know these receivers are ridiculous but you know if you had\nAn NFL quarterback running to the ... what would it look like well this is what happens\nIs the third ... listen to this this is incredible stat Alabama average is better than a points scored for every ... that that to what has taken\n[laughter] well I don't know I don't know if you're trying to\nThink what that means I'm so forty five snaps forty five points yes more than a boy first up more of their point so I mean one point for ... whatever it is yeah well I mean the funny thing is is that that ... that all of a sudden becomes really\nLike it becomes a very relevant stat because he's not finishing these games\n...

Want to make it a full on tailgate we're going to go get some hot dogs were going to wake up in the trunk Adeline sports vehicle working tailgate this thing we're not going to worry about staying at a

it'd be at a time eastern eastern time zone 'em up and there were there were some cars but yeah it was very quiet\n... the leader the glitz and glamour of TV right Josh\nRight exactly the only thing we just we just didn't pack in a hot dogs are grill or anything that's one thing that we might have to get\n[laughter] break this one down for us I mean obviously I Will still as of this morning's paper on the road but take it a little deeper than that\nAs you know you and I talked to a couple of days ago a lot of ... or ... you know kind of worried about this game\nBecause uh uh at that Indiana and Indiana I'm even though they lost Ohio State last week gave him a bit of a game\nOr a can considering all ... states ranked third in the country but uh the big thing for\nIowa it looks like the challenge is going to be defensive like you know they're they're already down to line backers to injuries and then uh my Jones is suspended for that first half after that targeting call so you have a\nChristian Welsh at a ... having a plane middle linebacker and German Colbert end up marrying the way we could be seeing\nMaybe somebody like Illinois all the freshmen from Iowa City west of course crystal\nFun ah so it's going to be interesting that line backer and then are still trying to figure out you know who's going to start at quarterback for Iowa or you're going to cause I was going to go with the two freshmen from last week a moss and Julius friends or do you you know as Matt Hankins healthy\nEnough or you're going to go with ... or join Modi as well and the other side because then he has got some tall wide receivers they got some uh they got one\nFor the leading receiver six foot three have a one that's six foot four as well so that's definitely going to be a challenge in Indiana a Ramsey is a dog ... on a quarterback so uh that's that's probably going to be the challenge ... last time they were your twenty Fifteen\nOr during that undefeated season even though they won that was a a point game I almost forgot how to act in court that game\nWas though um you know Indiana's got uh it it seems like a I was going to have to really slowed down the pace of that often so that that's definitely going to be that probably the key thing game as defense plea just you know with Iowa with Andrew that line backer and then just\nQuestion marks of who they want to start that defensive back yeah\nOr both of those Indiana receivers rather with over a hundred yards receiving all we can go now to defensive line Josh may be the X factor you think in this one pressure on Ramsey probably uh to the extent he hasn't seen yet this year\nYou know you would you would think that that's\nGoing to be the big thing and they know and of course had three sex last week against Minnesota and we know people have been begging for more staff from AJ up and that's a um it yeah I Know what you would think that you know especially if they're going to have a young secondary they're going to go but your freshman the defensive line is really\nGoing to have to step up or I'm I'm not sure\nThat change and try and work a little bit more but um you know that format Russia are going to need a lot of consistent pressure today just to help those young guys out tennis um just to make it a little bit easier because\nUm we saw um you can look at the northern Illinois again we saw it you know northern Illinois was able to set the tone a little bit early by you know running right out the line backers and then I made a few changes and then I was able to shore up a little bit but not as could be a different circumstance that uh if they don't if they don't do it right\nTo an end Josh Christians in with us on the road in Indiana gentlemen let me leave and Josh we'll leave you with this thought this is from the daily Hoosier dot com oh boy you go through on the blah blah blah blah blah blah last\nTwo lines on the pay you or your ... are you concerned about this is I Am now but you'll find this interesting lines on the page [laughter] we're going against our better judgment here and we think somehow the who's yours will find some magic\nIndiana twenty eight Iowa twenty seven [noise]\nAh they had to convince themselves to big yeah he was\nI got a I got bad news you needed a decent judge isn't that good if I Will matures twenty seven pounds [laughter]\nYeah I I think that there's question mark survivor Kelley Martin is going to be available then it kind of change how they want to run the ball as well so we'll see but a magic or no I I'm a little surprised they want to use that\nWord [laughter] huh I'll\nLet you go here maybe I'll get\nA little ... thought only I Would say it's allowed to use the word magic\nAnd the magic getting in there today at the Hilton or at um jak rice stadium finding a parking spot with all the time they've had the magic is getting your vehicle back out that I imagine a rise evening get was a genius [laughter]\nAll right so you could have drawn a worst assignment and driving all night and go to memorial at least you know you'll be able to leave when you want to leave exactly\nThat's true because uh I mean I Know we've still got you know for our health care costs but um if if what I'm looking at you know a boy and he has got a long way to go as far as I'm concerned as far as\nGetting really pack right\nIt would be and you'd be able to get a longer now two guys thanks for the time this morning buddy you guys have a safe drive back home All right\nThat sounds good\nWhat are you or does she reports Josh Josh ... since we're getting from our sports partner keeps your GPS over in memorial stadium okay served All right now is your prediction you're going to go go go along the lines of a against your better judgment here what are you going against my [laughter] uh\nLet's see last week I called for a lot of uh ten point getting like thirty five fourteen or something more than I saw it turned out to be much higher scores I did not expect that last week you I think this one\nUh what's the deal with the uh the way Indiana throws the ball now they've got a lot of questionable injuries coming out of that Ohio State game back few that are as even live reading some of the tea leaves here\nInjuries that nobody knows about ah from the Ohio State came yet either that or coach is not shared with I Want to go\nIowa I liked his thirties Iowa thirty to Indiana twenty Twenty one\n[laughter] so yeah and ... not to go see that park on Saturday So I Am thirty two Twenty one in favor of the good guys favor

north of Minneapolis and right now you're starting a brand new job his career is taking him into a federal loan program which provides economic help\nFor American Indians and and you know you and I talked about this briefly Raphael but you know people just get a mindset and they're like oh American Indians casinos\nA you know there's a lot going on there are people here in this country people who are here for years and years and years or try to keep their culture alive\nAbsolutely and it's it's a you know going against a huge battle\nUm but you know tribes are looking at ways to expand their businesses or a you know American Indians themselves or entrepreneur Z all looking to start their own businesses but uh for history purposes you know having access to that type of capital has has been very difficult to come by so\nI'm super excited about this opportunity going to be able to help uh you know people from my community hopefully\nEstablish themselves as as business people growing businesses for the tribes or that they can continue to to be sovereign nations and hold on to their culture and be able to provide services for their members so very very excited for this opportunity to help\nAnd good luck with that now when you take off the uniform for the final time it's always a kind of a bittersweet moment for players are but after what you guys did in that final season of your senior seeds and eleven and to you go to the Orange Bowl you basically treat the Georgia Tech\nDefensive line like rag dolls\nI mean that that wasn't even a contest\nDid you feel like you were like so much better than them\nI think um you know going into any game you you you definitely expected to be a a competition but I think just with everything that we had gone through that year and you know losing Ohio State\nUm you know I think we all felt that we were the the true a big tent champions that year and we just wanted to go out and prove ourselves and uh there wasn't any team that was going to be out on that feel that day that was going to stop us\nSo looking back on it now you were able to walk away everybody remembers that you know hey you had the skill to play and start in the Big Ten and you know everybody hopes to get to the next level uh that didn't happen for you all have you been able to just kind of wrap everything up in your head and go\nThat was good now I'm off to the next part of my life\nOh absolutely and then you know the more I get older too it's it's one of those things that uh I didn't have those continuous yours is speeding up my body\nUm financially of course you know who's going to say no to that but what's what's fun now is being able to watch all the guys that I used to play with or other guys that come out and play on Sundays and uh you know it's just we're all still part of that family and uh it's always fun to cheer those guys on\nAnd of course when you walk around Minnesota you're like yeah I Know Floyd I Know him personally I picked him up and don't tell me anything about you know the guys because we'd be four years in a row you got you got major bragging rights going\nOn or it's the best is the best I mean it's I I remember one time I went to a Minnesota basketball game and they were playing you know some directional school and and the middle of the the gay and they just start sharing the who hates Iowa

Jones you know in ... I think you might remember ball he was still in the gym when we played he was a youngster but he's a broken in now Rick one Jones a is come on strong we lost some high quality linebackers from a year ago but\nThose guys in particular Jonathan ... have been all over the football field you'll see him and safety or you know he has been one that uh\nUh ... has just uh he he does so many things and it gives us leadership to boot habit Georgia Tech transfer by the name of T the rough he too is another linebacker Damien will as the decided to come back for another year had a big\nBall game against Ohio State last week so uh right now the cornerstone I Would say of or attacking ... is our line back in court to the back\n[noise] well the improvement certainly has been made and you look at Indiana football today if you can win this game um what would that do it to the fan base and the people that follow the Hoosier as for the rest of the year\nI think people are expecting us to win today though that's not being cocky\nOr anything like that I think we're four point underdogs a today going in but are these are the kinds of games against high quality opponents all little cone is that we need to start winning just like as I alluded to your earlier last year's Michigan game you know we fell short we didn't finish\nWe gotta finish in the I think that the borders of the next six here at home we got to start making some hey er here at home and hopefully this would be a a huge win for the Tom Allen program to to make us live into and in all went away from being bull eligible no doubt about it

Haley equipment incorporated in general are incredibly today brings the halfway mark of the season for Iowa football\nIs it really goes quick and the next step will go faster than we do you know the first game takes forever to come around it and then once you get into urging they become pretty quickly but the yeah the second half for surely goes\nFaster defensive line a defensive player of the week and the Big Ten Anthony industry sex rally Marcia freshmen of the week was who picks a\nDefense continues to to provide a special moments way\nSo I think both those words are probably representative ah you know with Anthony the guys up front really good a good job we declare the game to the whole group and uh you know he had he had a tremendous skin there's no question about that but the the whole group that are really good job out\nThere and then um same thing was wrong you know we've got some young guys plan and a\nHalf for some of those guys that wasn't only their first road trip this year as their first road trip period ah in college so uh you know he did a great job can feed you know there was all like Chili's did the same thing on the other side and we've got some young guys doing some good things for us so that that really is important that's what's going to take for us to to have a successful here and certainly a [noise]\nYou know when any of our big games\nSo Kirk with ocean moody in Hankins healthier\n... what's the makeup of your secondary this afternoon\nWe'll go ahead and start at the same goes and started last week so uh you know brands in in in a mosque are going to get the start but to all for the guys will play\nAnd you know part part of it is a both those guys did a good job they've been doing a good job really since August a obviously a lot to learn\nA starting on August but you know really if you look at the four four guys combined uh there aren't a lot of starts are coming into this season so it's a young group we knew that starting out and uh the good news is maybe a and it wasn't necessarily but by choice\nOr a week and a half ago but maybe the good news is well the chance to develop some depth and I'll come out of the group that to maybe ... can compete well there are the edge\nWell it it's encouraging to see the front and the ... plants do well because you you should have a mixed master of activity going on at linebacker a money certainly is out for the first test a who do you go with the district\nYou know you need a scorecard to keep track of what's going on here this year at linebacker but um for sure with the money out of who who's playing well by the way but um you know so he's a ... going to be out I'm In the men's out so we'll start with variance in again on the outside position to the field uh in\nOne day we'll go with the Welsh gonna personal being inside there is some like position and then I'm John little play well positioned again and getting the money back to the second half will help us we have to dip into the freshman pool we've got the ... on a set Bentsen also you know ready to go and um\nYou know we'll just kind of play by here but I think I'm mixed in some some I'm a substitute package last week which you know stone going in and moving them on the up and I think that all of this game once itself to that opportunity as well too so we'll we'll get mentioned things up and hopefully whoever's in her does a great job and that that kind of been the the the more we\nWe all kinds of lines given up on the ... all year that that's the best in the west and the Big Ten and as an old old line guy that has to make you very proud given all the new faces and shifting that's going on there\nYeah that uh it came to my attention last week somebody brought it up and so you know as you might imagine like a no hitter in the night that I just assume that talk about it uh but the good news is I think that you know we just talk about some of the guys on the fence and I think it's worth it spread represent we're a little bit more veteran\nJust overall offensively right now uh you know alert did a nice job last year and a trust in worse than most of the technical those guys were first year God's Plan and it showed at times uh they're they're not out of the woods yet but they're they're playing a lot better football\nAnd now on a they've worked extremely hard\nThat whole group is not a good job really Keegan the only goes really experienced a nurse so those guys are really worked\nHard and they're doing a good job and um I think that's kind of young you know you talk about the two goals you can look at our receivers the same thing those guys are for sure guys last year including neck who was you know an older guy that first year with us so I just think that experience is really starting to pay off for a little bit\nCoach to Indiana this up in a will remind you a lot of Minnesota's a fence except they have a much more mobile quarterback and ...\nYou know the the big difference so these guys will throw down the field and the little house they'd be numerous times so they do the bees beep beep and other hit a couple of missed a couple but the point is they'll they'll take their shot just like Minnesota will\nOn your point of the biggest differences the quarterback will pull down and run so somebody we don't keep contain though he's not afraid to support and go get the first down and uh he also can start run round up back there and keep his eyes on the field and Georgia that way so\nHe's he's done a he's a cattle so I think of their other off the football team and they're they're good offensive team\nThey got to tell back they're measured a little bit of Jordan Howard is not there yet but a pure freshmen who is number two in the country and cherries only to Jonathan sailor this to\nDo the Scottish put up some impressive numbers\nHe's really done a good job and I guess he was hurt last year but a couple of games but he's a big physical guy has got to bring down and uh you know they've got a really well conceived often he's a part of it certainly the quarterbacks next one player and then I'm impressed that the resumes and like you know they've spread it around a lot of guys with a lot of catch is\nNot surprising the Tom Elena former defensive coordinator uh when he got here ah under Kevin Wilson and they've been proved that defense from day one all over the map\nYou know they have and then we missed that are you going to turn sixteen we played them in Fifteen months ... so it was a little a little bit of a learning process for us going through things and then they graduate and some guy so they have a little different what this year but the bottom line is that they play with this person a very energetic they play hard um and that that's been a little bit of a problem\nOr through the years here but I think they've done a really good job of making strides defensively\nYeah while I was making strides defensively Ohio State put up six hundred and nine yards of offense last week a hundred and fifty five on the ground that's why like the hawks get that running game going today just pounded stay with the consumer clock good a recipe to have on the road\nA Michigan State with a thirty five point effort here at uh\nBloomington a couple of weeks ago so while the Indiana defense is improving they've got a ways to

job off to see all the players believe in him and his is mental toughness and the weight room and his Britain's fight\nOr extremely hard worker I'm extremely physically tough kid I'm away from the football field as he prepares and and uh you all the things to do with our guys tend to get them developed he's writing at the ... you know and what you would expect from your leader and\nA guy that ah it's it's really grown on the field as well this season so I'm really excited about um what he what he brings for us and and the way that he just destabilizing force regime\nWhat I'd like another element that you introduce this year as freshmen Stevie Scott you're losing a running back not only is she a terrific runner but he's a heck of a pass a receiver too and I know you're going to use more that are going forward but this has been quite a find at this point out a shirt to show them what does it you liked about him or ... about him\nBut there's no question he's been huge you know what I loved about him out of high school was his versatility new recruiting as the guy\nThat when you're going to be a line backer or running back we really weren't shirt he played both in and thought he had a Big Ten running back body and that's something we were looking for needed on this team and show up in the United ... that doesn't work out we're going to move into line backer and he he was okay with that I just wanted to get on the field so\nBut I think his heart was running back and that's where we started him and you know obviously got opportunities early in the season with some with an injury in a situation that you're afraid that uh opening for him on or off and then he'd never looked back so um he has trends patients' vision as a runner and as you said he catches the ball well\nOut of the bacteria which is something that we we like to do also so I'm very versatile guy can pass pro as well as long as hard for young guy to pick out but he's really developed into a find player\nCoach I Know you're in defense or coordinator and you've worked hard to improve the Indiana defense how has it gotten better this year and we are the areas you continue to work on\nBut the biggest area that we're addressing our debt you know we just a year ago we play very well a lot of the time but we get wore down like games late in the season a painting the guy too many ... so they try to address that recruiting and then player development play more guys early in the season so we really tried to stick with that\nI'm a run defenses improved um it has done a good job to stay in the past did not do the job we needed to get his Ohio State\nI'm just play a lot of young guys especially on defense so got to continue to grow in maturity ability to communicate and execute critical times when which can be a challenge when you're playing young guy so uh we just got to keep growing and and and build on that side of the ball 'cause if you gotta you know if you want to have the chance to win big games you've got bigger decent\nWell they're all big on the Big Ten is you know coach or give us your snapshot your your thoughts on an Iowa here today\nYeah just really

he's big and physical and fundamentally sound and run to the football\nAs rank top five in the country and defense is is pretty special so that's got a big challenge for our team you know both sides

zone said I don't know why they reviewed it but they did but I think it was also saw a show the ... for the defense is ... efforts there at the start do you agree oh\nMy goodness so you know the defense did a great job all day today you know they they were able to get us out on the field you know they you know we've had some guy's a step up lately especially on the other guys I mean you know show them filled out how they're preparing to practice and you know during the week you know they just they know what they're doing and and they're making plays out\nThere I thought that the first touchdown I mean you've got to know where you are in that situation at the back of the end zone or looking back into the sun the sun certainly was a was an issue today\nAll very much so yeah you know especially on that whether the north end zone over there yes um you know looking back at the sign and you know but certainly he ... he saw something on the line and he checked to that and you know like I said earlier than we have such a great depth of of defensive and everything and you know that was a great great checked by him and we just had to make for\nYou know what I said and they just a year compared to last does that touch that he has on a ball like have to show that he made in the end zone he just had a little bit right in over that line back\nYeah you you know he works on that every day in practice you know we we we were the patio and we're working on her eyes and working on you know a defender being right there and you know we use your body so you know he he does that every everyday practice consistently in it and it shows are\nDoing well and effective running game only makes a passion gave more effective or lethal in this case today was six touchdown passes by by nature are TJ a tour and young or gets better and better every week and what a compliment buckeyes charge it has to have that and that's without ivory Kelly march\nYeah those guys are stepping up you know we have a you know I often we have to get a run established forwarding past bond spread it out and you know our line is this guy's a front written you know really well\nAnd also it all starts with them you know um we can't do anything without those guys I'm ... and it shows when when we're in the second half were able to throw the ball just because we got that wrong game established and those guys are moving people off of off the ball\nWell they get that off line is certainly gave made a lot of time early in the games so he was probably be able to go to the primary secondary and third receiver at the time yeah\nOh yeah yeah you know he can make he can make ... you know really fast and it uh it it just helps them and then when we have all the all the time in the day back there you know um so yeah those guys are stepping up and doing a great job first day I've been all year\nHis team's got a little head of steam now with two impressive road wins\nA heading home for homecoming can and should be electric next week you've got a a good Maryland team coming in they were rolling it up to Rutgers at last check today but uh you guys have to feel pretty good about all

seven go hawks a couple of things to double tail off of what Jim said first of all you're thinking it way way in the back of your mind or is front and center and here's what you're thinking\nOh my gosh if we hadn't made those to miss cues against Wisconsin on special teams we would be six you know we would be rated people would be eyeball in us all over the country but it is\nAnd I don't even like saying it what it was\nWe can't get it back it's like when you have a drink you can't drink it's done yes we had the home field advantage we had Wisconsin on the robes but that's\nYesterday's

clean I think you got it all covered covered the entire field right there and of course I have relatives who are in combines right now as we speak and we appreciate them listening as well the other positive that you are taking away from his Hawkeye team is the fact that and keep in mind\nThere hasn't been a Hawkeye quarterbacks row for six touchdown passes in over Thirty years\nYou and I were a lot younger than\n... years man that's pretty amazing by itself\nBut what's happening is we're starting to see Nate Stanley become the quarterback that we hoped he would be calm and and again\nWhen you talk to bees you're talking the hardest position maybe and all of a sport I'm sure there's arguments to be made for some other positions but you got to be good quick got to have a strong arm Nate has all of that but what is impressing me\nIs the fact that he is standing tall he is in that pocket he's getting hit any shrug it off like as raindrops\nNow he doesn't escape every sack but when you have that ability now his ability is not to talk and run that's not what he does but if you have a quarterback who can pinball\nBlitzer off his own body you're obviously headed in the right direction\nSpeaking of that I Want to take a break we do have some color standing by we'll get to you if you're on the line please stay there love to hear from you appreciate all the calls I'm Jim

that always starting um those guys are playing well\nYeah they're they're really growing up man and and this this tells you the quality of Iowa's program right now I mean you know I kind of came in today thinking OK\nIndiana there they they ... explosive team often simply they struggled a little bit on the fence but today I were really exploited them both on the offensive side and on a deep inside and I was impressed with how well are tied into play when we are going to get that at some point but\nI did hear the commentator make one point though Andy and a commentator mention\nThat what is the full of black\nAnd about fell out of my chair man that I Know when the ball back made a play you know I wasn't going to bring that up and I I was I should've I should've Sean I'm Dara producing back in the studio we should have made a bet with him on an over under to see how long it would be before what are you mentioned I think what is the ball back\nAnd I said you know I I was I was like OK but\nNone of that blue they took it back to the seventies by the way they said that this was an officer ran in the seventies\nAnd the oh we're going to talk about whether helmet right [laughter]\nOh man what that was excited\nTo the Iowa today I Know a lot of our fans are going to be calling in today you're going to I mean this this is the kind of game that that that you should be excited about because we got a lot of players catching the football we did some good things on our fence that really impressive Stanley's performance was outstanding he did do a couple of 'em did do an interception\nBut having points but that led to seven points but you know he had he had amnesia came back kept his composure\nAnd was was going things on the dime man so I'm actually really sweet loop today\n[laughter] you're like oh this I'm like some like the ... stuff you get past the corn syrup passed the corn syrup put the [laughter] ... blender no no forget it yeah yeah\nI Am cane sugar today man\nI don't know a little better than that the path in games ruined the running game\nIf you're buying that well I was I was like in our guy sergeant man he was kind of run a tough man or a little number ten\nYears regularly for him and he was a lather up today either worm you guy and he made some big plays a critical times\nYou know and yeah and then a wide receivers that want to show something to write we got guys heard Lynn people that's what I'm Talking about I mean how can you know how can you not get excited today's game\nThat was on the part return it felt like that that's a

like Brian ... is a good friend of mine\nAnd um you know I think he's a solid solid up into coordinating everyone it\nSomewhat critical Trevor you've been kind of on the fence at times so about Brian

altar for cat Hawkeye huddle Hi Tom\nHi there I'm enjoying the team the I think they're playing real well together but my point goes exactly what you guys were just talking about nine minutes left in the game I'm Wondering why Stanley is still standing on the field is our quarter back with this thing wrapped up\nWe have a quarterback on the bench that needs to play and uh [noise]\nNext one injury away from having that guy in the field I just wonder why we don't have some game experience some real game experience\nTaught our backup quarterback yeah he's gotten in missiles got me in a couple of times um I thought that was interesting about today though Lois ... to it was in the family all the way Tom thanks a lot\nYeah [noise] yeah I really think um it just shows you the loyalty the coach friends I mean we've talked about this for years now I mean why isn't the second string quarterback in the game wise and the second guy getting an opportunity and and either\nThis is the advancement of the playbook wouldn't play calling but you know this game was pretty much out of hand [noise] um or well within our hands are leading into that kind of the last few minutes of the game so\nI'm not certain I don't have an answer for that I have to apologize that don't have a true answer I just have my opinion in my opinion is that close parents are very loyal to his starter and we saw it I think CJ there was one game when the day better was here that I think it was a bowl game ...\nOr he was very very visibly injured ... injured yeah and he kept him in the football game yeah and I I just don't I don't understand it it didn't make it doesn't make sense but\nShe just wanted to play in that particular case so that a little different Trevor though than this where I was pretty much got wrapped up [noise] have you back with four minutes to go I was just a matter of killing that four minutes right\nWell okay from what I from from [noise] now this is me thinking as me and what I Would be doing spray 'em [noise] when when I saw what we're doing I said just interesting working on something [noise]\nAll the commentators were saying hey there must be some bad blood there still passing the ball\nAnd to me it looked like we were specifically checking certain things in games speed with say opposing defense that that was game ready defense against us and and then maybe you know\nYes normally you would take that time split your backup get in there get his shots take shots down the field but it really did look like we were working on something now\nAgainst somebody of scout came absolutely [noise] yeah it's hard to replicate that\nIn practice oh yeah I mean how how often does Iowa so the ball when we're up that far [laughter]\nYeah yeah that's a good point I don't know I thought the last throw as much as killing time might have been about [noise] you know not accepting the ten seconds runoff uh-huh penalty but uh [noise]\nI didn't think there was a bad blood though like there was ... it didn't seem to me like there was like something like that you know we're trying to be jerks it really did Jimmy looked like there were a few processes that we wanted to work out with that passing game and we were trying them may need to learn to get ready\nFor Maryland yeah maybe later on down the road which you have is Maryland team if those slots certainly fast the along

Nineteen sixteen at South Carolina\nAnd do what they do you know that's not the top of your head Steve you're the kind of guy I Know with all along has set up information\nThat you have do you know off the top of your head the date the last time central Florida last a football game you know obviously it's like a year and a half ago right two years right I mean when it twenty sixteen yeah yeah we look that up for me when you get a chance I'm curious\nThis'll be six it oh this year was that Thirteen oh we're out here and I don't even know what the record once a year before that which got for us to by the way the brass had lately last they'd overtime at Northwestern thirty four thirty so Nebraska's oh insects for the first time\nAt Northwestern tied the scoring ten points in the last three minutes of regulation including a Ninety nine yard touchdown drive in the last minute to send it to O T\nRutgers was to for Seventeen passing and lost at home thirty four seven to Marilyn Iowa's Nate Stanley ... touchdown passes and uh when it Indiana\nAnd an NFL news forty nine or say running back ... with a bad ankle a game time decision for Monday Night if he's a no go they'll bring up a

Steelers chance of rain for the titans home game tomorrow against the ravens back to you\nAll right Steve ... and I'll leave founded December Seventeen twenty sixteen [noise] so uh six hundred sixty some odd days in central Florida Bucky your national champion\n[laughter] loss of a ball game I mean that's unbelievable\nRun unbelievable stretch they got a quarterback that his real deal mackenzie ... a lot of people are excited about him even though he doesn't have\nPrototypical height measurements is big on and the fact that they have a million clay makers their team that it's exciting to watch a dab of skip the beat Scott Prosser leads Josh ... comes in and they are still rolled in like their role in the season to\nGo well hypo comes in and we were talking to solve the top I I I Wonder what you think about\nThis as we uh bring this do you live in the Geico Fox Sports radio studios it's easy to say Fifteen Percent or more on car insurance would die go go to guy could calm or eight hundred nine four seven out of the only hard parts figuring out which\nWay it's easier to me or this is no shade on high pool but it feels very much\nAh like Barry Switzer George seaport um earlier it was reference that maybe Scott Frost was a system coach\nBecause central Florida is able to win without 'em and now ... I Can't even get a win at Nebraska and I look at it the other way odd to me it's high pool is winning with the program that was built by Scott Ross\nAnd similarly to how that took some time in central Florida it will and the ... like for me I'm not even in chip Kelly get him into this conversation as well\nI get a new coach especially a guy who has kind of a new system versus what the the the previous regime at\nIt's at least a year and a half before I'm even going to start thinking about assessing what that coaches doing\nAbsolutely nothing just the right way to approach it um I give them credit for not messing it up obviously Scott for us it a good thing going they're winning a ton of games they were ... they were to national champion last year as they call it a he's come in he's been able to put his own system it without really upsetting the apple cart and I think\nThere's something to a coach being humble enough to respect what was previously established but also being able to put his own spin on it and have to kind of success and sustain it\nYeah I I so I I think everything is a is absolutely fine with Scott Frost everything's absolutely fine with chip Kelly\nI'm look UCLA loses a quarter back to being a top ten pick brings in a regime that's got a totally different system a desk a that's going to take some time so I Know that it I mean it's hard for fans you know I mean a fan\nOf fan is has every right to be frustrated when you don't win all but but this is the deal this is the deal and if you keep firing\nCoaches and you keep paying multiple coaches and keep hitting the reset button you're bound to look like this every year\nAbsolutely can't yeah at some point you have to have a level of stability you have to allow your coaches to build a program and the way that they see it needs to be built and then you just got to trust the process everyone uses at that point a coin freon\nHowever that get now you have to ask you got to trust\nThat you got to trust the guy's going to be able to get it done and they're going to be able to the right way and when it's built a success is going to happen um I give them a ton of credit because they I never thought that they will be able to kind of care to last week and said just wanted to see\nAll right now do I need to update you on some of the things that have happened in college football means you know what what now what what what were you doing today\nOkay some high school football game on the coach in order to high school in Sherman Oaks office coordinator last night we were playing bishop ... oh man I don't know if you so just to hurt you just got roped\nWow okay to quarterback and more regular army right up pops up well not not up that up man he got smack in the face and there is a flag is there even at the college level you're not allowed to do that [laughter]\nYou know loaded so look we're about to play a game last night kicked off at seven o'clock things are going well I did all of a sudden lightening\nLighter roles are and you know you know in LA doesn't cost you know it doesn't rain people were those I was hosting is Jody met last night and people are staring out the window or running out of the event because kids practices all over town are getting cancelled yeah 'cause it's raining ... because it's raining\nBut there was lightning they were saying what new cancelled if there was if there was a lightning but\nEvery thing goes to bleep yep when it starts drizzling didn't in LA\nAnd then you add a little lightning last under yeah it was it was over so they can't they postponed the game at the beginning of the second quarter\nSo today you went bad you pick up where you left off picked\nUp where we left off ... ... we were in the midst of kicking an extra point when they stopped the game no way so we had to start today with an extra point\nDid it go in they did going okay but then it went down who went downhill from there [laughter] you're like me how many jobs you have to come over me go see busy what the heck if Steve is all these holdouts that you write for NFL backup recreated production\nOr most of the NFL Network ... okay Fox Sports radio yeah yeah we I went to off into coordinated for Notre Dame ... yeah we got we got there what else am I missing\nHonesty we pop on occasion the Fox sports every now and\nThen after I was one right as I Know he's not in the hour we we do that calling on the show\n... ... ... I moved to stick okay do that three times a week\nHow many teams are we trying to have in the playoffs or if you have eight divisions than you have\nEight division winners and you have a team oh so you're saying like have eight conferences have champions in power for super conferences with sixteen teams each did each have two divisions sixteen teams each yeah yeah sixteen teams in each for super conference each conference has two divisions A. divisions A. winners\nPlayoff oh not hard so you thought you know just thought it out you got to sponsor a [laughter]\nI have a TV dramas sponsor you have a TV telling me I wouldn't be able to get well I'm just asking do you have a DVD yet the biggest thing about college football that's always amazed me is when they say you know what\nCollege football's not going to change it because they liked the money it's actually all driven by money and I'm sitting here going okay do you not realize you'd make even more\nMm yeah I get the stands in any bowl game\nAnd tell me there's not room to make more\nAt the ratings for any bowl game\nAnd tell me there's not room to make more more games are not attended ball games in December are not highly rated no not a holiday ball but what if those\nDecember bowl games were divisional playoff games what if they were conference championship games\nAll there would be something tied to the aloha bowl and you might actually care and more people would go to the game and more people would watch the game to me there's zeroed out\nI mean I I'm a fan of the playoffs the lord the levels of college football have playoffs and I think it's exciting I think the one thing people haven't figured out where do you hold those\nEarly round games the quarterfinals with semis where where they are they had a neutral site or are they the whole team of the higher seat however that that goes how many teams do we bring in the sixteen or eight\nUm but I kinda liked the thought of that I think part of what's exciting in high school is the playoff mhm sixteen teams say what you want to say there's get going\nBy the way so you are you're a a you're a high school coach yep um and you just said you're the author of coordinator by the way to run Homer by just didn't turn are huge swinging about to the Dodgers there [noise] and for the first time in his series they've got to leave\nThe Dodgers have gone ahead for two three and the top of the eighth in Milwaukee big big big moment there that could change that series adjusting Turner with a big swing mistake for the Dodgers are always seems to be him and they always that window when there's a big moment that guy is always involved\nHe's a big player for them he owed them 'cause last last game he he was up at a chance to do some he did he did but then to come back with a big one now does this huge ... you know the Dodgers they have to ask you for that too\nOh no no no you don't want I mean no matter who you are no matter what you know where you're playing I don't really buy into the hall home road thing if you fall down to oh you're probably going to lose the series yet I'm so that was really big so four to three Dodgers keep you up to date\nOh that hold of like he didn't have a ... but he had a an extended a walk down the path ... either way the unwritten rules\nUm are you asking me if he's going to get one in your whole nice I don't you think of them get plump in light you shouldn't but he might I mean you kind of held he like he might for two reasons\nBaseball pitcher somehow think it's OK one if you hotdog yet or two if you're too comfortable with the play which is the ... if you asked me the strangest thing in sports is that baseball's culture allows some of the best pitchers the best pitchers in the world the side you know what\nUm what what you're doing hitter you're too good you're being too effective and I can't get you out some of throw the ball with your\nFace [laughter] back you out of the weirdest thing I've ever seen in my life anyway that was a big big moment for the Dodgers but\nYeah I I think college football's got a lot of meat left on the bone man I think they've got a lot of meat left on the

I'm just waiting for my mom's basement\n... playing with a C minus quarterback is still on Barclay\nWell no it's not on Barkley but the point is if you can have production like bark is giving you and you still don't win then why would you even think about a running back and number two in the draft\nOkay so that's okay so let's let's think about it this okay let's take a quarterback lists egg Josh out downtown Josh Yellen is barely over them in does align complete fifty percent of his past yeah I don't think uh but if you look that good yet right but but we're okay we're taking him and number two\nWell known what was the exact number seven number seven yeah let me say okay so let's use them don't I I think sandals so it's done in such ratio maybe like seven to six or something like that whatever is\nUm where okay taking him because he's a quarterback do we believe this and don't as a bit of ...\nThere is the thought that at some point Sam Donald could end up being more important than sake one bark they I don't know if he's better he could but the running back position as a position that historically a guy can come out as a rookie and immediately play and contributed a high level last year cream hot Alvin ... like these guys can take playoff teams\nAnd produce immediately week one quarterbacking is not that way there has to be a cultivation even the best in the game were bumpy as rookies Peyton Manning I think one three games\nOkay right so this is this is your from your uh your your premise\nBy the way so dropping Mark I'm John one to six nine a block in my mom's basement John\n... just a basement devil's advocate on here so let's let's let's use that for instance so let's just a rookie quarterback for the giants that review quarterback for the judge no stake one Barclay same offensive line or how different those the giants office\nLay it probably is no better than one in five for however but but you would put you put your federal better because you have a quarter you might be closer to a good wreck okay let's just say this has now the giants need to re booth the quarterback position and they won't do it until next year\nBy the time that guy gets good\nTake on Barclay running back careers are short you might ... you might be a good running backs especially okay if I mean we're looking at ... Charles gets signed by Jacksonville this week if you're like oh my gosh that old guide you realize he's thirty one is thirty one years old but it feels like he's forty one it feels like he's been around forever\nIs see here here's my problem with the way that we do we do this right because we are seeing any quarterback so do you think Mr too risky is good\nUm it might be okay good okay not yet not yet okay All right okay so\nOkay so if we're playing a game and you could pick between say quote Barclay admissions risky who would you\nSay calm Barclay and Mitchell Trybulski uh I mean without knowing what else I have all my roster of my situation I Would take one Barclay\nOkay that that was pretty software it yeah so what does it have to be any more complicated\nBecause here anyway because I'm a ... because it is but it shouldn't be but it is but it shouldn't be but you just can't you watch any issue because every year you might end up with five star running backs and you don't have a quarterback okay and win\nOkay so here's here's what I Would tell you about that scenario says she say running backs whatever a brown dwarf is in the hall of fame yep wrong with used to say you can never go wrong taking good players because here's what happens if you take good players and you have a surplus you trade one off\nThe right which unique how would you even know how would other teams no they're good if they can't even get on the field oh they can you can get 'em on a few how are they going to get five running about a good field but one why we're taking five ready but I'll give you in fact I'll give you an example of a running back that is\nExperiencing this right now are coming up next we'll keep this going Dodgers and brewers coming down the stretch Washington gets a field

hundred nine four seven out of the only hard part figuring out which way it's easier so I'm sitting there listening to Steve and I said there's been a top ten upset guess why there's actually been technically three um if you really want to go into what was an upset or Georgia last\nWashington last Penn State last oh and there was a nightmare developing oh for my favorite group of people the committee the college football playoff committee\nHey look what I thought he got told us he\nHe saw a passport or certainty he\nDid he did say that and I visited there well isn't there a lot of second because I still don't\nBelieve for a hot second that they'll do it but that's why this is a nightmare scenario the college football playoff committee will move heaven and earth to keep central Florida out or do they will move heaven and earth\nCan Rob so lonely there I said why would they wanna undefeated team in the play off because\nIt doesn't lead to dollars out of the group of five that's why central Florida would not be like a one last clams in or one last taxes or\nWhatever they're right in the mix them and now with Washington and Vincent losing their item ... there's no way and how they move Ga Don belong 'cause they don't have the guts to do it even though they got blown out today there in the mix but UCF is going to move to probably number eight in the country\nA man ... yeah they won't get them hire are in the mix because they have no choice but to let them into the mix but\nIf we're our assumption that Alabama Ohio State of Notre Dame all get it you're telling me that in Georgia or you know right now clubs in his ... undefeated if they run the table then fine there's your four I get it\nBut if Georgia or clams in West Virginia tax is for sure but if one of those teams all racked up more losses which seems likely while central Florida does not which also seems likely\nIf it's after three years and they win two or three championships [noise] yard with that you get my

okay what about coaxing cup\nWith the rams while I can but I think I think the thing about those guys Sean McVeigh scheming and everything I like their talent but I think you would probably say both
