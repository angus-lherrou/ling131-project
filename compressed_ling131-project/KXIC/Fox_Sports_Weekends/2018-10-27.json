World Series winning home run\nAs the Toronto blue jays win game six of the world series to beat the Philadelphia Phillies game to do\nAnd I can still remember every possible moment\nYeah I'm a Phillies fan that you're a high hard radio weekends boards time capsule\nYou deserve a better way to watch for ESPN what people live for and onto the show for\nThe new iPhone ... here AT T mobile and there's a whole lot to love like those corporate corporate most selfish you're going to share and I'm a ...\nI mean I see I always city sockeye sports station and know all the University of Iowa sports we Gary are available via streaming said kicks like ... dot com they got ...\n\n...\nSays in God you're still tight and one of the Syrian game three of the world series now in the bottom of the twelfth inning and the ... actually the series games to nine and other based on is Janie Martinez in Christian yell I share your Hank Aaron award winners for twenty eight teams that hitter\nAnd go all the way back to Don Larsen we get to use John Larson a lot of the game and he gave the trade it\nFor my son I say that somebody that all the time you know my dad yeah even if you had one good game Don Larsen and then I get a history of Don ... of course you had one good game come on just so happened to be in the world\nSee well let's white folks that when you get down and Roger Maris editor breaking down his career as well I get it it's it's\nThe way it works in Yankee lower but certainly for Walker Mueller\nEverybody's got their eyebrows raised because we know what's coming right we've been talking about Clinton corrosion his contract we've been talking about the opt out and you're wondering what the life would be now obviously you always loved to have the left hander sit there at the front end of things you look at Walker viewer and I think I'm okay with that\n[laughter] the other thing really quick forget to Katie is\nIntends lawyer who had one of the worst innings of a non pitcher you want to see in baseball uh got thrown out twice yeah running the bases and then did get thrown out trying to score from third in the sacrifice fly that ended the eleven singing\nThat song Cody Ballenger from\nNot deep probably probably mid range in center field right sacrifice fly he throws Ken's around at the plate and kids are is getting a lot of hate a lot of Kansas yeah he had a bad thing but you know what he actually wound up getting the third base on a base it and\nHe had to try to score I mean there's bad if anything is it was running the bases and it and it's like you can for looked like he was watching Mets videotapes to try to get some inspiration the thing is is that he had to try to score they're yeah they're seen as you're worrying unity the Tour de France third one out now there's two outs\nYou have to try to score because it wasn't so shallow that All right this is just a fool's errand but you had to make Ballenger make a good throat grand all had to catch the ball which you know ground has been really good at that the last few games so you had to make the Dodgers make a play\nAnd I'm fine with that because if they don't make that throw villages throws off line it's gifts\nThat's run by the end they over had to do that\nAnd he's the way Ballenger caught the ball drifting\nYou know and and it's not quite the quarterback throwing against his body but certainly as he's coming in momentum coming forward towards the the left field line and throws up the up the line grab all has to go make a play on it and then he's got a hold on to the ball after the collision that wasn't nearly as\nIntense a collision as one might have seen five to ten years ago but either way and and kids were in going towards the base does that actually touch the base either so that was the the end of his\nIs happening of folly on the base paths although I think we would have said he got over the pile on yeah he would have gotten byline hero there you go but\nDoes it get a John Ballenger who'd been picked off at the\nBottom half of the prior anything I mean it was a huge huge redemption moment for him because people have been calling for him and and here you go on and he's able to wipe out the base runners so just an amazing run and now\nOh my goodness Dodgers defense the red Sox have just pushed across the go ahead and run in the top of the thirteenth inning and this was just insane it's been a rough last couple of minutes for ...\nYeah he's been knocked down a couple of times why don't you get up again or a\n... no ... ... ... we're tub something so hope walks to lead off the top of the thirteenth standing for the red Sox and he steals second on the steel of second the ball gets away from ...\nMunoz is up and as granola goes to get the ball he kinda runs into ... yeah and lands on his back so hope steal second Munoz gets up has to walk around and make sure he's okay he is okay to get back in and that\nSo now here he is runner at second nobody out and Noone just just hits a ground or to the right of the pitcher's mound Alexander goes to retrieve it\nBut\nHe has to try to beat the play to first base which is almost impossible and in the end tries to toss the ball\n... Hernandez who was covering\nBecause you watch max months to come in to try to catch that ball as well it was a slow ground her hip between the pitcher's mound at first base months he comes into get it Alexander gets adjust to hit in the perfect spot and Alexander has to now trying to make his way to the base\nAnd we watched\nHer name is try to get there as fast as he could he couldn't the flip goes over his glove\nHold scores from third baseman scammers in noon Yaz is down because he gets tumbled over by Hernandez as he's trying to make the play right and now the red Sox have a two to one lead nobody out the top of the thirteenth inning after that\nConflicts of circumstances the past few minutes and already you're thinking here's Dave Roberts is going to get criticized city of walked a runner so for ... a play at first base all of these things are going to be on the table but this is where we sit right now\nTop of the thirteenth ending Dodgers\nTrail the red Sox two to one and so far in the theme of really what the World Series has been the red Sox have just had the brakes they've made a little bit more of a fifty fifty plays and that's why they sit with a to one lead top of the thirteenth ...\nNow the wide shot there as they closed it on Jackie Bradley junior showed a little bit of the advertising at Dodger Stadium a and it included forest lawn cemetery that's not good right or wrong scores year and a Thirteen\nTwitter out out of ...

agency looming over everything in the NBA this year there's been a lot of talk the last few months that Kevin Iran's gonna wind up signing with the Knicks when he is a free agent after this year we've gone over just why many times\nWhere he played the next tonight and in this game\nKevin Durant scored twenty five and the fourth quarter the Knicks were up three and they lost twenty twenty eight and ... had to play this game in the shadow of big billboard that was up outside Madison Square garden trying to lure Kevin Durant to New York\nAnd it was a Big Love fest Kevin Durant try out game I mean

hundred and Kevin Duran\nForty one for Golden State and of course are fun thanks for the night to mark his cousins who still hasn't played a minute for the warriors in the regular season 'cause he's recovering from that Achilles injury\nGot into an argument industry close\nWith referee Scott Foster assessed the technical foul and then he jak in from the bench area so before he even makes it seem debut this injection goes down as his first ever sat as a member of the Golden State warriors\nStereo getting thrown out of a game I wasn't even when it was pretty good [laughter] he'll face that British yet of course we're allies and the guy goes studios were Fifteen minutes because they'd be Fifteen Percent or more car insurance go to guy go dot com right now and see how much you can save

on first nobody out and many Machado up for the Dodgers on replay Alex Cora looked like he was really upset but the replay it looked like it was close but he held up that you didn't break the risk that didn't go far out over the plate what I've seen looks like that was a good call\nI like the way you're doing it demonstrative Lee here in the guy who goes to ... I'm into it arms going through like you're a reverse golf swing going on here now Machado with the opportunity to come up big here are you still being a eviscerated offered out running the ball\nOut earlier he hit one to the wall on ended up just being a very very long single or so he's one of the bullet points on this evening for the Dodgers in terms of where this played out one for five on the night\nYeah many Machado look he earlier in the game he hits a fly ball down the line and he Cadillacs at all the way to first base so we get ready yet that you got first case exactly he thought it was going out instead what happened\nIt went off the wall and instead of a double he wound up with a single Cody Ballenger did pop up to ... but it's a different\nIs that tuition right in front of him as you know they're worried about stealing signs Manny Machado at second base there was a big story this afternoon as many Machado stealing signed a second base it could be a different pitch in that situation earlier in the game from ...\nAnd instead many Machado looks like he's determined to ruin\nHis value in free agency by continuing to not hustle now maybe he's seen fourteen million combinations of him trying to get three hundred million dollars and this was the only one that's worked oh I'm going to not hustle during the off season and that's what I'm getting my three hundred million now he was wearing a tape that would have taken it next what\nI feel like watching him the last few weddings it's every swing is I'm swinging for the fences sure I feel like every year you got a runner at first no buddy out hey we can be here and I feel like he's I mean every every swing I feel like it's either going to be a home run or miss\nI mean that that's really where he's at right now it's all or nothing with a home run major league baseball twenty Eighteen\nThe outcome\nWill keep you updated on this right now many Machado again battle against Nathan evolving nobody out runner at first base gospel again let regularly let's hear from Kevin Durant your guy Kevin Durant who is going to wind up being in that for many reasons that have like I said it's not\nToo soon K v he's going to be a Nick he wants to follow the brawn James ...

big time Dodger fan or you stressed out in this game\nYeah the way I Would complain about so I really don't want to stay up past eleven to get on your\nShow but a ... than here I got nowhere to go but we're we're we've got we've gotten that that we need we need a ...\nYeah it's I I don't watch when you were playing bay and right now it is a there's a three to count on ... the bottom of the fifteenth no outs are tied to a piece of Dodger Stadium when you were a player what was the ... what was the game that you remember that went on and on\nThat after the game you are the most exhausted and just emotionally physically can you remember one in what that's like\nWe were down seven Mm could hunter um Akron quick like ... minutes could play\nA when I was with the Texan was scored a touchdown no one like half the fans left uh we got an aunt I got the ... ah we went green out oh no what do we do\nKnow we we score we went down scored again and then there was a we were down ... and at that point and then we got another on high tech I I got\nTwo in a row I still think that's an asshole record I Will search you on that one in ...\nTo fact check that and then we uh um we didn't we didn't we didn't go down the field we we had the client but there were two minutes like ten seconds left they get the ball they put it back to us when we go down and score and or we go down in ... so we come back from seven to eight minutes\nLeft we go to overtime um and then Vince Young on the first time runs it in for that sound like that long run\nA and throw the ball in the end zone and I was like man I was all that for nothing I never had like a triple overtime game games are never really that long the football but that that good that was a rollercoaster of emotion which is that what I think you're asking\nSchool they just had a roller coaster of emotion at Dodger Stadium ... months he looked like he just had to walk off a only to go ... like\nI think you're like ... seconds ahead of me so I can have you given the updates right now though at a three to ...\nYeah but you might just going to be in the rye for all we have a by being the eighth inning that that is as close as it gets to handling the that is brutal man that is absolutely brutal um yeah no ... in it and what's funny about like so when you were covered those do you want to say kicks by the way doesn't that hurt your career kick returned average\nNo it's it's a it's an entree cake onsite kicking\nOh OK you are on like okay so you're covering down Seventeen so does that count as to fumble recoveries for you\nI don't know Huh Interesting\nI was always really good at the intercepts and when we intercept when they intercept all ... the other team I think they're just like all the all white guy's not going to tackle anyone\nThat's that's very true and then they might they might have a point there but you were lightened guys up I mean you gotta you gotta anger issues now was more of a ...\n\nA grab hold on and and like judo chopped them down to the ground well like Austin Powers moves down\nSometimes that's will even the way you gotta do it man or because of un Roy Williams they eliminated the horse color All right David Anderson former NFL wide receiver joining us here on Fox Sports radio he is a\nHe is our Dodger fan of choice use our celebrity Dodger fan which is code for we don't know anybody else um and and the game was already was already going to come on anyways I ended up I was ready to go so we're trying to spin this like this was all pre planned do we know this game was going to still be on\nI'm sure so if you just like mentally though if you're if you're a team in this spot and and say you're\nYou're the red Sox the Dodgers and you lose this game\nYou got to imagine they've got to come back and play the very next day just psychologically what what do you like in the locker room I Know so I don't forget forget about it you got to come back and you get a rally in play the next game but isn't he a real thing at this point in the season\nI think this is actually if the doctors can pull this off I think this will be three hours to go to one but they ran through the red Sox pitcher thing that I have I have an awkward situation like who's going to be there starting next game\nUm they they put themselves back in the series it ... it's it's it's a big game it's a bigger hand for the red Sox in my opinion if they win that's out there who cares about the next game yeah um so do you know it's\nA wash for them but they're committed and now they have to all the way it is I'm sure if they would've known they would have gone fifty ... than a Red Sox and if they would last you know if they lose whatever three to two they would have said I Will will vote for it and the tenth inning which I don't even know you can do in baseball I guess you just walk 'em all until they score\nThat's a good idea but right now their pocket and they got one that's famous kind of not I mean you're looking at we're looking at their starting pitcher tomorrow picturing now he's on the fourth\nInning area or the or the red Sox crazy\nOr David Anderson former NFL wide receiver joining us here on Fox Sports radio Dodgers Red Sox still going on tied to a peace bottom of the fifteenth\nA one hour which I as the uh the Dodgers looking to remind God yes to figure out a way to to win this game or they were down to one uh in extra innings uh they they scored on a throwing air so here we are sitting at the edge to appease\nUm I Want to ask you about this is Derek car stuff going on in Oakland there's a lot of people that are talking about you know maybe he's\nYou know crying on the field when he's injured some people question just tough news some people have talked about whether or not Derek ... gets rid of the ball to quicken or if he if he if the players have lost respect for him because maybe he's not tough enough\nAs a former NFL player\nHow do you react when you hear media members or people around the world is sports call out NFL players for not being tough enough\nOr the ... um\nThink when people he worked so divided on the quarterback blows my mind right if it's like ... ... if if\nThey expect only calm and ready to you're allowed to take any like when he sees the rush coming like that guy fold up like a like a little girl when you see someone coming in tackling them and you know what we've learned not the right thing to do because if you're going to grapple and you're trying to be tough\nYou put your foot in the ground the robbers Tony Parker ACL your work with the forty niners\nEven if you do run that guy over with ... with the Koran ACLU or work with\nAnd so I Would rather my quarterback throw the ball faster than a quicker than slower and ... the more perfect we just gave him a a an ungodly amount of money like they did his job to be on the field I'm ... to push back I always say when tech\nFans I suppose I still do a lot of radio and they were they wanting to claim walk them like the greatest thing ever I was like that crime is good but it can't be injured\nNo good players you never you never look back on history and say oh these guys are great injured all the time like maybe ... got away with that a little bit but that was the end is career but a quarterback you have to be on the field\nYou know other than that you're the most important player on the field you have to be on the field to really affect the game and you GET requests in the NFL players stuff and I thought that joke but growing got voted off after ... ... that's the goal\nOr David Anderson former NFL really wide receiver would this year on Fox Sports radio Red Sox Dodgers tied at two now to out in the bottom of the fifteenth a as we continue to watch what is now it'd be like a fish ally this is the longest game\nIn major in Oregon and there'll be postseason history longest game and I will be postseason history I don't know how I don't know how people watch this stuff's sober if you're a fan how do you do I don't\nKnow how ... you know what's going to say that I Would only about ... if I had fifty names I have nothing to do reading I would've place they're gonna scored the winning they're going to score the city I work for it in a car that oh yeah hundred and fifty bucks or something\nAs in about twenty minutes from now this game will be seven hours long this is this just craziness when this game started it was a little after two PM in Hawaii [laughter]\nSo I ... I mean what's\nThe hell are you going to do how are these guys that exhausted man I think about like this is what ... and I know and I've talked to about this with Brady Quinn before uh my radio wife here on by the way it's ... birthday I'm I was going to call him and wish them happy birthday but then I just carried on living my life\nUm but uh I I've talked about this with Brady quaint and he says the travel and a lot of that stuff sort of goes unnoticed when it comes to athletes and going around the country and around the world and and getting the games and getting to places and then when you add in the actual amount of time that they're playing\nWe're approaching basically to baseball games in seven hours I'm tired that these guys are going to be playing to baseball games in seven hours with no rest in between ... was supposed to be the starter for Saturday's game\nHe didn't know he was going to still be pitching on Saturday in friday's game\nLike this is craziness just stop stop to stop and\nLook I'm not going to sit here and and rip Alex core offer for putting in Nathan of all the ... and going with the guy who is looked at and hit a ball at times in the postseason um because I think he realized if you win this game it's over because you'll take a shellacking\nIn game for and you'll let the Dodgers wouldn't one because you know you can close is that you got another three opportunities to witness but he did take a big chance by leaving of all the in there and then you get to the bottom of the ending I think of all these bad at at least a couple of times\nNathan of all these been up to up to play a couple of times in this game\nSo it's this is man I I just the the amount of fatigue that these guys must be feeling at this point and then to to think that they're going to come back Saturday and perform at a high level\nAnd you see so many of these players try and and the game on one on one swing a bat they're not thinking about moving guys over uh the red Sox tried to but they weren't able to do it you're also seeing a lot of fielding airs a lot of poor decisions uh mistakes on the\nBase paths like you have to think the tea plays into that\nI mean for us out there if you've ever worked at nine to five job if you look down at the clock and it says five thirty\nYou feel like you've just gone through hell and back you're staying an extra half hour these guys are staying an extra for hours and it's the same it's the same exact shift\nSo um we're approaching a ... week or just flight out on the infield um and a guy just tripped over the pitching mound I'm telling you these guys are exhausted absolutely exhausted yeah it's a this is\nMan they look tired All right so I won't let you know that we are brought to you by guy go what does it mean when Geico says just Fifteen minutes could save you Fifteen Percent or more on car insurance that means you probably should have gone to a guy go dot com stiff teen minutes ago\n[noise] um so we will wait to see how this game plays out uh the Dodgers have used everybody on their bench the Boston Red Sox have used everybody on their bench um if of all the\nAgain pitches another couple of innings what are we talking about a guy who was projected to be a starter on short rest to already pitch in this series and he's up to Seventy two pitch is\nThis is basically a start\nAnd I believe if I'm not mistaken nation of all the has had to Tommy John surgeries if I'm not mistaken might we're approaching a reckless or as as far as the handling of this game as going but they've got no other choice they've got no options\nThere there's there's nothing else they can do so now it's a ... a count a Red Sox and Dodgers tied at two a piece of one out as we're approaching it's a seven hour long baseball game so if you are Fox you are eating up the ratings you are shooting them up right\nNow if you're Fox so well ah we will keep you updated as we continue on here um who knows when we come back at the top and next hour about five\nMinutes from now maybe this game will still be going on probably or that's how this night is gone here on Fox Sports radio um by the way we do have a have word that if ... cannot pitch\nAny further in this game major league baseball has given the red Sox the okay to dig up Tim Wakefield and bring him in we'll be back next\n[noise]\nIf you suffer from E.

alive you are from the guy go Fox Sports radio studios where it's easy to say Fifteen Percent or more and car insurance with guy go go to guy goes ... eight hundred nine four seven out of the only hard part figuring out which ways easier\nOn believable max Muncie\nWhose heads up base running in the thirteenth aiming tied the game has now just hitting ... home run against Nathan of all the who I feel\nAwful [noise] that is incredible [noise] that absolutely\nIncredible and I I just felt like something had to give it some point the red Sox finally got somebody up in the bullpen and now this is a big swing game and if if your Boston [noise]\nIf you're in Boston now you're sitting realizing you just emptied the chamber to try and get this when [noise]\nNow the series is to one it's definitely a the Dodgers have are are going to come back we're going to be I Would assume the more fresh team Evan asleep at home\nAnd not having to go on the road or are not able to sleep a in a in a hotel room or have to deal with any of just the what the issues that come along with traveling or staying when you're not at home and now the Dodgers come back out and they're going to have all the momentum coming up on Saturday or so the game is final\nOr something close to seven and a half hours from first pitch to the walk off home run by max Monti and that's a rapid Dodger Stadium so\nAmazing\nAbsolutely amazing wow\nAnd you don't like gave Roberts you would assume that he'd be a just ecstatic coming out of the dugout because\nHe realized they just a huge win for the organization a huge win for the franchise and a huge win in the series because\nNow the Dodgers aren't down three oh you go down three oh\nClosed the coughing it's over the robbers looks exhausted they just looked like they want to go home just get the hell out of there and go home\nAnd ... as an athlete talk about the roller coaster of emotions have your Red Sox fan that the miserable off so you got ... imagine this is all as far as the Dodgers go\nThis is this is a huge huge turn of events\nFor that team yeah I think it ... the red Sox have depleted uh there there Saturday starter and Nathan a baldy Ninety plus pitches\nOn short rest after he just threw out of the bullpen he's brought in a new situation you assume they've got the game in control and then a throwing nearby cans or and\nMax Muncie scores in the thirteenth and here we are a few innings later and a couple of hours later and the Dodgers finally when it\nIncredible\nUh Joan his doctor your Fox Sports radio so the Dodgers are are now down or the red Sox still up two games to one in the world series but the Dodgers in Eighteenth ending walk off off for the win by ... odd David Anderson are former NFL wide receiver or be up on the show he joined us earlier in the program that he's a Dodger fan boy\nAnd so ... was already set to join us so majority majority of the interview Dave and I were talking about this game because we all assume like were exhausted if you're a fan of either of these teams your\nSpent at this point if you're a Red Sox fan and you're watching a back in Boston it's after three thirty in the morning where you are seeing are exhausted and now you're pissed off and now you're depressed\nAnd you're probably bombed and so\nIf you're a Dodger fan you're excited about it but this is exhausting and you realize yet we're still down to one of the series it's much better place to be an but we're still down to one in the series David Anderson former NFL wide receiver\nJoined us earlier and I always wonder what it's like for these guys after the game's over when these guys have been through a game where they are dealing with the roller coaster promotions we know what it's like as a fan if you're a broadcaster you know what it's like\nUm if you're calling some of these games and you're in the booth if you're covering some of these games and you and you're a reporter you know what it's like\nBut as as a former player when you're in these situations in your in the spotlight what is it like and how fast can you recover and how fast can you rebound\nAnd and it's just a ... this is a\nCrazy situation so Dave talked about as many yeah it's exhausting you you you go back um especially emotionally you feel like you're ... you feel like you you you did everything he could to try and win this game and unfortunately for the red Sox they emptied at all\nThey ... they took their shot they try their best to to\nLook it was a walk off home run and credit to max among the Nathan ... was dealing Lynch in his pitch cow I feel really bad for of all the\nAnd you're right with two Tommy John surgery and he really credited today the Tampa Bay rays people taking good care of him he was acquired in trade I also went through a press conference long ago before this game started today\nWith Hank Aaron if they gave out the Hank Aaron towards the night and somebody asked take one of the greatest of all time what about all the strike out and how the game has changed your comment on it and he said\nMe it was embarrassing to strike out I Try never to strike at a hundred times and the season and of course we've seen in back to back weeks with these long playoff games at Dodger Stadium that's all you're going to get because that's what the Dodgers are to simplify it I won't say home run or nothing but\nIt's almost that sometimes and yet when you have the Milwaukee match up for example you at the top two home run hitting teams and the national league so you went in after eating after reading with nobody bunk thing they'll basically you know getting the other way so what do you expect that goes a long time\nA now Steve ... is joining us here on Fox Sports radio

I Hope that you never get the and I'm not trying to to keep a man down I'm just hoping you'd never get the opportunity to run the ... so I understand but that being said\nIf if\nA team offers you for first round pets are taken that deal\n[noise] it depends because I\nI think those two diverging theories and that sort of rules front office right now you have Tom ... who wants isn't a win now mode and he feels he has got a car and he sounds and he's still as Jimmy right now when he has Andrew Wiggins if those two guys can never put it together them being cat in Wiggins\nBringing a guy like era Gore and along with them first round picks we're still going to be competitive now\nAs opposed the trading Jimmy Butler away for for a first round pigs and a couple of ... players who may have a little bit of upside but I have a lot less production an era Gordon will be less appealing to me so I can understand why it's on civil do would say I don't I Want a breeze is bringing somebody that I can still keep us\nAs a competitive team on the floor while also getting us assets for the future\nYeah I I I guess I don't I just I Wonder what other offers are out there right I mean it's ... because here's the problem when guys come out and they announced that they'll only go to a select\nNumber of teams if you're another team is trying to make a play on somebody yeah Paul George grade it worked out for the Oklahoma City thunder but that's that's really\nTaking the risk that guy is going to stick around long term and you traded away a lot to try and get them I just I don't know what other teams are going to be offering as much as what Houston is willing to offer I mean there are more aid\nI'll give them credit man that guy is doing whatever it takes to try and beat the Golden State warriors um I just if if I were the Minnesota timber wolves and I know Houston is a good team so those first round picks are going to be later in the round plane Chris ... getting older or who the hell knows how this team's gonna look moving forward I just I don't know that you're going to get a better off and then once they've gotten so far\nYeah and one key thing you mentioned first of all getting older injury issues throughout his career Jimmy ball or is that some indirect concerns about his career as well so if you're a future projecting you trade away those assets and let's say Jimmy does want to sign that extension which will be a mass extinction\nNow you're paying ... Jimmy ... fall and absorbing an amount of money no one of those guys fairly often get hurt yeah\nYeah it's ... and look at and at some point\nThere's always the team who didn't win at all but they were always sort of close to winning at all no doubt there there was always the team who's who is pretty good during that run\nBut they could just never quite get over the hump I'm ... I'm trying to think like if you look in the NFL like the patriots have been dominant for a long time and the Steelers do have\nThe one Super Bowl that they've gotten recently the one that we think it's recently but it's almost ten years ago now Jesus ...\nBut the Steelers are that team on the outside who just can't get past the patriots and the charges were like why one else he was still there example yeah perfect example and I just wonder if that's where Houston's at that they're just not there is a really good team\nBut they're just not good enough to get past Golden State and you can say well I mean come on they add a seven game and if Chris Paul wasn't injured they would have won that game in Houston okay but that's the problem Chris Paul is always injure right see if you can't depend on them sooner or later you just have to be resigned to the fact that people were just not ever going to get over the hump exactly\nSpeaking of injured to mark his cousins what the Golden State warriors now won't be back till sometime around the all star break as he recovers from his Achilles' injury but still have to stop them from getting beat up on the bench during their game against the New York Knicks he was actually seated traveling with the team on the bench and actually got ejected from the game\nI don't know if I've ever seen this happen before he he'd guy so basically I Believe in the Jackson equals too technical files so democracy because there's already has accumulated a couple of technical fouls and he hasn't even played yet\nThat's great but and so he got into it with was in his Canterbury what game yes but that is cancer likes to mix it up the dust character yeah he ah he's funny he's and he's a really really nice guy he was on um uh we had a chance to interview him on Fox Sports radio probably a couple of months ago and he was one of the most down\nTo earth athletes loves New York still loves being in New York Nick loves loves the just the spotlight and everything are are that comes along with being a Nick\nI'm but yet I saw that and then said the markets cousins get it gets ejected you gonna get fined I Would assume it gets fine I don't think so yeah oh I Believe so he's us [noise]\nGod they're good she stepped Steph Curry on Thursday ridiculously good and then they they go to New York and it's like you go on the road you travel all that way you get to Madison Square garden you've got an earlier or start time to a game that you're not used to get your goal is faith and they still wouldn't by almost thirty [laughter]\nWhen you're a smart but he lets you do oh no we we become years to see\nWhether you catch us live whether you need a pond yes we are getting millions of downloads for his face is right here with us this is a place you

to cheat on you it would make life a lot easier if you could see into the future a little bit it'd make things a hell of a lot easier while I was talking about the Houston Texans as they took care\nOr business on Thursday night and everybody is focusing on the five game winning streak instead of looking at all the things that had to happen in those games for them to get a win so many things had to go their way but as much as I'm doubting the Houston Texans as much as I don't buy into Houston as a legitimate team in the AFC\nI got to be honest with you All right and I'm saying this from a place to where I picked Houston to win the division\nI I I took Houston to win the AFC South\nSo they're approaching a couple of games up in the division on the rest of of the FCC south and it looks like Houston\nHas got a pretty easy path moving forward to try and win the division there in the AFC South and I pick them to win the division and and I'm doubting the Houston Texans but you are like just look at their schedule moving forward\nThe Houston Texans schedule moving forward they go on the road against the Broncos they've got a road game against the Redskins they get three consecutive home games against the ... against the titans\nAgainst the browns and the cold there road games include one ad Philadelphia but one of the jets and then they finish up with the Jacksonville Jaguars who have been a disappointment this season the Texans are five and three right now\nThey're probably going to win ten games\nFor ... for all the criticism I give the Houston Texans they're probably going to win ten games and ten games when did you the AFC South the last three seasons\nLike we can be critical all we want but if the brakes go your way take advantage of them and Houston denigrate spot a

I'm Sorry they're heavy hitters are JD Martinez or the ... was the over seven\nOn came three or whatever it was so it would and figure out where to save his life yeah he was right oh and that's what I'm saying that the crazy foreign link that kinda gets buried in all this that the Dodgers started a rookie Walker buell or\nWho this time last year was part of the what do they call it the suicide squad is part of the the minor league teams with the guys who sit way up in the top of the rafters or on the team but not on the roster would you if you don't use them all away tickets you can watch the game and now this year he's starting game three what the the banks against the wall\nAnd he goes seven shutout innings meaning of just two hits\nAnd it got to be too old for that for ... yeah three strike outs it's unreal and there were still in this game\nOr a celebrated our big who's was driving All right some training how about this\nAnd we haven't discussed it enough walk off victory in game three of the world series with the divers coming away with a three to a victory over the Boston Red Sox we heard the call from the Dodgers flagship aimed five Seventy LA sports how does sound with a guy Joe Buck on Fox TV [noise]\n... is right seems combined to throw five hundred and sixty seven pitches Eighteen total pitchers used in this game for both the Dodgers and the red Sox Dodgers get that victory after a game that lasted over seven hours seven hours in twenty minutes to be exact\nAnd now Boston's lead in the world series is cut to two games to one game for later tonight eight or nine first pitch on Fox all my car shopping can be confusing not anymore with surprise from true car\nNow you can do the exact price you pay for your next car so is it true guards who enjoy or coughing and car by experience game of note in college football in the past twelve twenty third ranked Utah once it's fourth straight game baby UCLA at the rose bowl forty one\nThat's in in the NBA raptors can prove to six you know they've all the mavericks won sixteen to one o seven clippers bought the rockets without James Harden one thirty three to one Thirteen\nPelicans bucks and the Golden State warriors with victories as well fellas\nAll right fig we are the ... with a guy go Fox Sports radio studios easy to say fifty seven more car insurance would guy go go to guy go dot com or going under nine four seven\nAuto the hard part to figure out which way is easier they'll tell you that Joe ... genius I Love these job up\nThat call was so good and link and maybe we should perfect call and like that now you know people will be saying that of course like that that's the mark of greatness of the great broadcaster that you captured a moment you're not over the\nTop ... you're trying too hard you know at the wall\nOne more time Ruy do me a favor one more time I mean you're Joe ... who is this just great in the summer break it down [noise]\n\nIt's awesome it in the ... the night night lake\nWhat's always difficult if you if you've never been in a situation is traumatic trying to be pointing trying to be concise trying to be articulate and and of course have that energy that the mood provides\n... we we've heard some great ones throughout history we heard some bad ones I mean there's and there's countless countless ones where you scratching has like how the hell does that ... how is that appropriate but it is what it is but those great moments like catch you meant in in in this is what announcers add to the to the moment\nYou know he he's he's remarkable leaders degree is great and I like that moment is a show catcher who's right he's excited you there's brevity who's think about it you know it's gone ...\nMonths she tie game ... a month cheat to win game three\nRight in the OED the night night\nLike that's the perfect script right there starts a perfect script ... baseball baseball\nBaseball it lends itself to that sort of thing like ...

[laughter] I look\nI was asked I was when when it was the brings up and then when it happened to you have this earlier this week when you mark Cooper trade went down and there's some some interviews with um some Dallas radio stations and they were talking about\nYou know what I thought of the job of Tony Romo was doing now you know there are people in Dallas who just idolize Romo easing\n... decided to do all you know I Love ...\nAnd and then there you know I was like you know they're the they were talking about my partner bread must burger was very critical of him and the and the interview and I said look here's\nWhen you called ... why well Britain where no Brent was critical of Tony Romo he\nWas a while I Do I remember that right and\nI said you know with what happens if and when you when you're in this business you're going to have criticism on both sides of matter how well loved you were there there are ... camps nam Roma a now than it probably\nCarries over to the carries over to the broadcasting both if they if they like them or not that's so it\nGoes both ways yeah try forgot to roll with a bunch of God's ... had a he criticized Tony ... recalling the plays right yeah yeah we're going out to a place that's interesting I like him what's a ... ... we hold All right you have a Joe's Twitter handle\nYeah yeah you just mentioned it's actually I Love all teams except yours is a lawyer and was\n\nSomebody ... yours that's awesome because she's dry wit yeah a a sarcasm is terrific um I like you it's time for the dish ... report\nYeah I'm Glad to get in the last last a little bit of this hour so it's not really much to ... usually audio rank your bank you know and that was on every week you know I was asked earlier this week would have ... we still don't know but the truth of the matter is that ah [noise] he's got five draft choices in the next two years [noise]\nA five number one and what matters the most in my opinion when especially when it comes to mark Cooper\nIs that they didn't want to pay a mark Cooper franchise money they didn't think that he separated himself as an an OB JR ... Jones or one of those top receivers in the national football league so they were prepared to move on now the bad part I Will say about this and what you hear about in the locker room [noise]\nThere are players out there that this roster has sixteen players thirty in over [noise]\nNow do you go into the locker room and say hey we're rebuilding for the future you'd just excluded happier

want because Jim Schwartz the eagles defensive coordinator\nStop playing press ... a press man with its course\nAnd he allowed Caroline and came to get into a rhythm off actually for the first time in the fourth quarter and they just went right down to feel\nAnd because she refuses to boil weights and he refuses to get out of its braking system that at this point every other opposition coordinator

reason that comes out in the studio and I started to tell everybody that and again if you want to check out mark on Twitter go at Mark Emmert and I'm David how are you can go at Dave O'Hare Hart Dave Ira ... red threads card co\nAnd it's interesting mark because of our audio is there and we'll be there and yeah we're updating it with you know so um our friends are taken care of that so we're we're we're fully operational mark look I don't know what we're doing now we're actually act like we're we've got a plan here but you and I talked last week an acronym and said he didn't mind if I broke this news he\nHad a try out a yet ... was in Baltimore yesterday when I talk to them on the phone he's in Baltimore today I talk to them early this morning and it's like a list there's no record this on on Thursday Afternoon and so obviously this airs on Saturdays but I just want you to be a time stamp is that I talked to ask them on Thursday\nAnd he ... he said it went well\nI think it's interesting for a lot of fans know Jamal Charles the former all pro right and\nJust been ravaged injuries many chiefs and the Broncos and he was briefly with um ... games Jacksonville thank God on him\nAnd now he's trying out so it was ... and Jamal trials Akron modeled Jamal Charles and ... and he will do him around here yeah ... years ago is sister is a ... plays basketball it in order to him all American but\nI Will joke with you and I can't wait to joke with them as you said he's one of your favorite interviews and I understand why after talking to him that he is lying personality yeah what a great and he goes yeah it was me and Jamal Charles went pretty well I got a call back and find out next week for sure what's going on\nUm you know they play it they're planning Carolina this week and he said I'm flying back and I'm going to drive down from the Cedar Rapids airport down in Fort Madison joined you guys and he said yeah it was me a Jamal Charles the number twenty three from Wisconsin I just started laughing I used to so I was gonna say what's his name say his name but I've had enough\nTrouble than has been and I didn't want to pronounce it yeah\nAnd I went into trouble trying to tackle that yeah they always have ... an Willie\nSo anyway he so we'll find out more from Akron while he might not be your next week if he gets the job no that's not what he said he said if if I can be in Studio I Will a worst case I'll be over the phone yeah so he probably correct you may not be in Studio city in Baltimore right correct so and that's where I've talked to in the last three days so he just I still Murphy's hero you'll be in a bad mood\nI find\nI I agree yeah yeah you don't see that's about ... just going to say you know better than I ever met them in person until Saturday\nTalk to him numerous times that he just seems like a rare that a lot of fun so let's do this I'm Johns giving us the highest sign that we better step aside ... well actually if I got about a man and a half let's do this let's let's broach the subject of last week's big homecoming Victor right\nTwenty three nothing hot guys uh put it to the ... yeah and you know domination ball controlling a lot of people look at needs Stanley's numbers and go geez eleven for twenty two one touched down one pick but\nIt was called the game manager but he did with the game dictated it was very windy day three when he needed the troop throw completed passes we need to but when you got three guys running for over two hundred plus yards or what's the what's the need to check the ball over the art\nThat that was the one complaint I got two and I just can't figure out why anyone would care about that one twenty three and nothing is first passes pact that's when he realized he probably shouldn't be asked them because you know when I was a game was for him to turn it over and run a game was going to defense of shutting 'em out he did what like gay managers find title when you win the game\nAnd a ... I'm actually in terms of maturity 'cause he he knew what the game plan was needed to be executed it and I got out of there with a third straight when and now they get to go a much bigger task kind of on the hand and more bad weather potentially\n... just just a bit more of a task as you mentioned the bad weather but you know got defensive touchdown and Matt Nelson and shut up first time in ten years and and you know I think that's the other thing was it a big tent record or close to a Big Ten record of on the hundred and sixteen totally our defense truck Iowa yeah under under her parents ... the lowest\nPoint to our yard several by an opponent also a ... he was placed run they only ran thirty nine plays which is amazing Maryland yeah because they were just not in the field now for for for\nWhat it was it wasn't as if the disparaged the difference the disparaging difference between often for hawks and plays and Marilyn and it was ...\nAnd yeah and that was that and all that stuff was historic\nYeah it really wasn't you know mark in the last minute or so where are the last ... seconds before the break here they just wanted to say to you too I feel really good when you mentioned about Nathan Stanley really glad you did I think he and the energy that you can see what the fence and their relationship you can start to see the maturity as you mentioned that he and Brian parents in the office of a crew really seem to have to get the coaches and players yep\nYeah it's fun to watch so hey let's run to a quick break and ah we don't want to go to long hair because we've got two more full uh segments of a hawk either more he's mark ... thanks again to Ashley Olsen from coaches for popping in Studio a greatly appreciated\n... joining us next week big Johns in the house with is our producer and good buddies so we got nothing but good times ahead right here on TALK I'd ... back in a few moments\nI heart radio goes one on one with Peter Gabriel to reflect on the ... festival evolution\nAnd we actually started this why my festival in Nineteen eighty one wasn't too and I was\nVery naive enthusiasm for some of these strands wonderful things with you I mean [noise] um\nA failed drama enormously grooves\nFell in love with the more lives from what I've seen it on the radio\nJust sing to you know it's wonderful voices and it still continues that way it's it's a lot more difficult you know because the demise of the music business and record stores has made it extremely difficult for any minority interest to\nFocus on line activities and\nThere is still I'm happy to see\nIs I think like a lot of life ... business actually ...\nKeep listening to hike heart radio for more Peter Gabriel in all your favorite artists\nWelcome back to talk more he's Mark Emmert I'm Dave O'Hara check mark stuff out or via Twitter\nAll his writings on his rambling Z all his eyes whatever's at Mark Emmert M. A. R. K. E. M. M. E. R. T. and again I'll say it before now said again he's not that Mark Emmert so take your issues up with the NCAA with the other Mark Emmert although this Mark Emmert should be ...\nThe president of the NCAA I'm Dave ... check all our stuff out Charles my business partner and I at red threads card co via Twitter\nSo mark we're talking about the twenty three nothing and it really was a dominating win the score wasn't forty six nothing but it doesn't have to be you know the old expression one or a hundred you one day dominated in every sense of the of the of the game every facet of the game twenty three nothing so\nTalking more about that now the interesting thing you and I talked last week and we joked about not being physics majors or science guys what difference did you see now with the north end zone project is still the structures up but it's still finalized did you did you see that is it not going to wind down a little bit nuts but part of the game or what were your thoughts\nI sure couldn't tell if it was I mean I'm sure it has some impact but the wind was are changing directions all the time and that's what we're seeing all set up for the game was at a quarter to quarter he didn't know which which direction you it'd be worried about the wind and\nHe had a great game I thought uh we haven't really talked to special teams much but um [noise]\nYou know that he kept a fair surprise a terms of how tough comfortably felt can feel goes drop the game from what distances and of course he ended up having to make three for three\nUh maples extra points uh it was a career high for him in field goals and points in that wind and uh I think he's got to get a lot of credit for what happened there because the first to feel goals are very crucial ... driven down an opposite ... know points there so much from ballgame than it must be an up six nothing so I thought he was like one of the stars of the game actually um because of what he did\nNow getting remember years brother as you correctly said a couple of weeks ago his brother was his high school\nIs a high school coach yeah and uh so that got a lot of attention of course the word got back to the parents occurred while both parents and and so now I got called the office\nWell they'll get back to ... and his brother no offense brother put at a red foot with a shout out to the Iowa football Twitter feed wasn't it yeah what about yeah about and I'm sure when it got back from anyway I'm joking and yet we diverted share to herd\nYeah and so I Know how to sit down with both trying to encourage parents and you know kind of explain what the situation was I mean parents all been swept under the rug and everything's fine but a perfect it was a it was a bull dicey situation usually don't see guys kind of gone on the attack on the coaching staff because obviously the cost of the other day when they record and they would know Chris than it's not like they don't know this guy\nAnd he's been very much quieter on Twitter now I've noticed 'cause I Do follow him on Twitter ... okay I think the message we'll just see but uh yeah I noticed said basically I Love my family and then you know I didn't take a downside big brother he can he can he has his opinion he's entitled to it\nNow wouldn't say that he agreed with the or disagree with it and he said my jobs is about that when they told me to go out there so I think that's a healthy thing to say but um I think we'll find out more at the end of the season when no of course the NFL Draft at this re services that says if they really were upset with the Iowa coaching staff or not because uh\nIf I think the rest of the season we want to hear more about this by ... and ... and every surface or has the NFL Draft nears\nBecause there's always been a lot of frankly criticism nationally for why didn't use George Gilmore yeah you know I mean we got a weapon like that and they just you got to be more aggressive so\nI think I was more grass in the last three games in the past game after that Wisconsin game mhm but are there still room for more they're under they've got they've got to unique talents there and I think there is no question that could use in Baltimore\nAnd let's take a look George kills had two very nice or a year and a half one half very nice years the NFL a more productive and he was an eye out is getting off our hand but\nYeah but in any rate 'em in and wide receiver wise we got about three minutes left this other show and I wanted to touch on uh the dismiss um ... you know I asked salmon ah and then also Brandon Smith and then you have\nA a Nikki usually play in well you you've got a lot of guys starting to really are up well at the right time so everybody's looking good and why receiving corps we're gonna have a chance or a mixed family has full power on on his side this week right\nYeah and I think that's really playing very well lately and yeah coming off the first touchdown which is just a\nA wonderful catching the when when one handed a multi being interfered with um a last Saturday So he's got a lot of confidence now they're sort of see the more what what he can do and why they liked him so so well a Penn State's quarterbacks a little ... I think one on one out there both those guys all have some mismatch is if if the ball up there I'm I'm a\nI this is talk like Penn State's lost two straight home games I just can't see and was in three straight in happy valley I think it's gonna be a close game I think Ayelet top to bottom is the more talented team\nBut that that venue that quarterback that weather strange things can happen so I'm sticking with my original production for summertime and going Penn State twenty eight twenty\nKay my ... deep inside of me I'm going to go Iowa Twenty one Seventeen OK okay and then as we wrap up the show here I Want to remind everybody please come out to Fort Madison Iowa this week it began a short hour and Fifteen\nMinute drive south of Iowa City ah acrimony movie there in person for and Penn State viewing party mark you're going to be in happy valley hopefully this happy valley for hockey fan of happy valley and I will be watching it on television with ... and hundreds of other people so looking forward athletes come out to buffalo sixty one on the corner of highway two in sixty one for Madison Iowa kickoff is a two thirty so acrimony\nThey're about to Fifteen be available to the public from two Fifteen till the end of the game to probably six forty five seven o'clock you know how those things run Marc let's do this in the last what about about a minute or so left John\n... and a half let's talk on the line with basketball I get a nice piece on Luca guards that ah you said he practiced looked healthy um you that's a nice covered Jeanette let's do a little bonus it is that time a season basketball is getting close to get ready let's talk about briefly pretend please yeah sure he is he started\nPractice again Monday a full go and uh looks looks really good I'm I'm going to talk to him the night\nAnd uh they expect him to play in not only in the ... and the opener on over right but also the ... mission given number four so he's obviously making really good progress they're\nAll right so uh as you're talking to him and that we'll look forward to a full report next week and I got a list as always want to let you know that we recorded this on Thursday Afternoon some are fucking to look at night and and then uh this airs on Saturday and other markets that we're in all the Hawkeye affiliated stations thanks for the end of Amman\nMark also thanks to you as always and thanks to John our producer and and mark pits even helping out today with a few things so thanks to Marc as well and also thanks to Ashley Olsen and coaches corner actually came in the studio with us today and\nUh took a throughout first segment part of our ... percent so thanks to her and I wonder if the crew at coach's corner on Mormon truck between Melrose and betting in Iowa City as we wrap up this program on a ship thanks again to all the aforementioned folks and for me to you the listeners thanks to you\nSo for Mark Emmert I'm Dave O'Hara and hug either Morgan mark ... it'd be a Twitter at Mark Emmert and me via Twitter at red threads cargo that's all from us thanks to all of you\nRight there is a threat targeting America [noise] one that's growing fast\nBut may still be hard to see [noise] Lyme disease [noise] read by tiny ticks off in smaller than the head of a pin this dangerous disease is now more widespread than West Nile tuberculosis and HIV aids combined [noise] and if left untreated it can lead to arthritis\nFacial paralysis and even memory and concentration problems often\nCalled brain fog [noise] is the threat of Lyme disease grossed more than three hundred thousand projected cases each year it's time for us to target Lyme disease that meets checking for ticks when you've been outside even in your own backyard [noise] it means seeing a doctor you experienced the symptoms of Lyme disease which can include joint pain flu\nLike symptoms fever fatigue or sometimes a bull's eye shape rash set your sights on stopping Lyme learn how you can target Lyme disease at target Lyme dot org\nGiven a ... year old from Baltimore member from\nHorrible proper harm tonight I\nAm a number ... ...

real there's something different here and I would totally agree I mean listen last year they started five and then they cratered in last six or seven before rebounding late to win four straight and\nI just wonder my only question I'm going to give the chiefs you know one of those spots that when the super bowl their team that can't but\nWe've seen pat ... homes you know baseball you go once through the order and your Motown everybody in your feeling good okay the the hitters they're picking up some things maybe second time through the order you give up a couple of hits and then the third time you get lit up\nI Do wonder and it starts this weekend have we seen enough I'm a homes can defenses adjust after seven weeks getting killed by pat ... homes are they going to adjust well we'll see what Andy Reid will do\nI think the chiefs of one of the four teams that can win the Superbowl now the other two the patriots ... don't argue with me folk we know in September they use it as kind of a pre season to fine tune things go wrong is going to bat return how he's going to get back\nMonday Night against the bills Julian Edelman healthy I\nThink they've scored over thirty points in each of the last like four games they're back so it's the patriots the chiefs the rams and the other team you know they didn't start out consistent\nMan right now they are mowing down people and that's\nThe New Orleans say uh I I thought last week's game if you guys watch that closely I thought Sean Payton coached the best game of the NFL season okay they didn't I don't think data point until late in the second quarter on the road against the best defense in the NFL he made adjustments made some tweaks\nAnd remember the ravens and not allow the fourth quarter I'm Sorry second half\nTouched down the season\nThe saints had two in the fourth quarter\nTo on the road now I Know Justin Tucker missed the extra point are we going to see in overtime but what I saw from the states was a consistent effort they didn't start out consistently auntie but now we've seen it the sample sizes bigger I think the same\nI think they can win the Superbowl I think they're right there with the chiefs the patriots and the rams now\nBefore I get to a and I want to I Want to play the walk off home run call here for a second uh for the Dodgers Red Sox game will play that on one second but I just want them I Know some people out there are going to be like well what does that Jason ... what about the chargers was LA Chargers come up well listen\nI haven't seen the consistency yet they beat up on a lot of bad teams\nWe saw an inconsistent effort last week in a London against Tennessee wait and see what the chargers still wait and see what the Houston Texans\nStill wait and see with Cam Newton and the Panthers and then the two teams that I think are closest to getting in that upper echelon or the Steelers who've been there before\nLet me see them put it on the browns beat them convincingly not another five turnovers big Ben\nAnd of course the Minnesota Vikings we we know they started slow starting to rebound but if you look at the injury report the Vikings are beat up this week oh if they're able to come out and pull off his victory against the saints\nThey'll get in that upper echelon so lot of interesting NFL stuff and just remember this you're not consistent until you're good

I Love it and I and when you brought up soon as he basketball it makes me happy 'cause you're a fellow degenerate like me I [laughter]\nI I enjoy all fantasy sports although I have I I might be doing with baseball for a little bit now because it's a little bit too long ago this season but um yes I Am absolutely all in on fantasy content and are interesting and maybe we can do something here as well\nUm yeah that's possible fantasy a fantasy updates we'll see yeah look let's put on the list of things to do um however I Want to give quickly to the uh Mari Cooper trade this week\nAnd I know people are out on the cowboys like the America's Team stuff that seems to be over right they're they're not America's he nobody really cares about the cowboys at this point they're just not as interesting as they used to be his IQ you'll Eliot his tone down his act a lot remember he was like\nMr up in the club all hanging out with ladies will once\nHe had that incident that he got suspended for and I should add that was such a terrible suspension by the NFL sorry it was just bad like when the NFL's lead investigator says yeah we shouldn't suspend them the evidence here is kinda flimsy and they suspend them anyway you know it's a bad suspension but I digress\nThe cowboys has gotten kind of boring good at home stink on the ... you're not good and the you're consistent well they're not consistent so what was interesting was after the eagles last Sunday\n\nAnd then the cowboys also blew a game in Washington it was still like well they didn't lose any ground and I feel like Jerry Jones kinda sorta panic because he pulled the trigger on a trade\nFor a Mari Cooper now in a top off the top you read like oh I'm Ari Cooper that's when it was the first round pick out Alabama great player pump the brakes\nThis is the guy who had a high dropout rate he's had dropped passes have been a major issue for a more Cooper he's very talented the highlight reel if you just go to YouTube and look up I'm Ari Cooper highlighted the raiders you're like wow this guy can play well there's no doubt\nHe can play he is just a drop machine and then the bigger picture emerges and I said\nThe cowboys made a short term gain and they're going to experience some long term pain here this is not in the big picture a good deal now the opposite is true\nFor the raiders and John good they're going to go through a lot of short term pain but in the long run trading ...\nTrading Omari Cooper long term gain now I Know you guys know about this in life you know I like to use just um analogy where you're getting an argument with your wife and you know you're right\nBut she's beginner hills in and there's a there's a point where you ... it just clicked you're like All right I gotta stop I got a letter had this round you win this round\nYou win the battle but I Want to win the war so I'm just going to concede and pull that you've got to play the I'm not saying he played games with your wife but this is real life like sometimes you got to just pull back because of the bigger picture and I think John ... well our team stinks\nWe need to get rid of some players were not going anywhere marsh on Lynch is now in the eye are by the way thank you to my fantasy team Marshall in Lynchburg nothing and if you look at the big picture they're not good now there probably won't be very good next year but at the three first round draft picks next\nJohn ... the ten year contract they're going to Las Vegas in two years this is clearly a tear down for John good and and I didn't love the ... trade\nBut I guarantee you and two years will be looking at just being like oh this is a good move for grown now on the flip side Jerry Jones I just think long term this is a disaster folks ... we talked about it all summer this is the year for jak Prescott\nIf jak press got good he gets a big contract\nBut\nHe gets a big contract how are you going to pay to Marcus Lauren how are you going to pay in a couple of years ... how are you going to pay a Mari Cooper he's done a rookie deal for now but he's going to want to get paid you can't franchise tag everybody\nAnd some of these bombs\nAnd at the beginning I didn't really notice it and then my wife's like yeah I'm\nEvery woman is trying to do the sexy thing here\nAre some of the interesting outfits I saw\nSomeone who is Ruth Bader Ginsburg obviously she wasn't sexy Ruth Bader Ginsburg Supreme Court and her husband dressed up as Brett Kavanaugh ah the guy got on the Supreme Court [noise]\nUm yeah I Know it was like he had like a hat with like beer and whatever it was the other day I Will he did have a gamble yeah there was a what else do we receive national there the hall of fame or he was dressed up as one of the cobra chi\nOr from karate kid it was a pretty good outfit a there was a guy who was dressed up as the new Jurassic Park here oh what's his name Chris oh All right Chris Pratt yes and then his partner was uh the group to read from that movie\nUm who's very attractive and of course she was the sex the Jurassic Park girl uh what else did I see I saw an up pretty woman Julia Roberts the one the hooker Julia Roberts from early in that movie where she was wearing nothing\nThere was a there was like well [laughter] the the sexy flight attendant was mentally popular um\nI think I felt like to want to be scarlet do Hansen's like where they got the wig\nAnd it was like the scarlet Johanson yoga teacher in that he's not that into you have you seen that movie did not know that one first of all it's showing on cable now and you've got to see a scarlet Johanson is ridiculously hot and then um so anyway great Halloween party the best Halloween party have been too\nI tried not to drink too much but uh well I I

gets your missing from the twenty something crowd or what does it mean one guy go says just\nFifteen minutes could save you fifty percent or more on car insurance means you probably should have gone to a guy go dot com Fifteen minutes ago right so quickly wanted to touch on\nThis Jimmy Butler situation in Minnesota so all of a sudden this week I don't know if you guys noticed it out of the blue because it had kind of died down over the last week or ten days rockets offering for first round\nAnd you're like well and that that can't be real the rockets are not that stupid\nYou know the last team that gave up that many pick was the net in that cagey a Paul Peirce steel and of course the nets are still paying the price for that and of course the Celtics potential dynasty that they have I mean it's being built on the back of one trait so there's no I just don't buy that deal but\nI Do wonder if one teen floated it and the team I'm guessing is the timber wolves because they got to get Jimmy Butler out of town I think they've got to get them ... Anthony town who looked like he was on the verge of stardom last is\nA train wreck your now of course there were rumors I don't want to dive too deep into this because it's unfounded that correlate the town's was dating a woman\nAnd then the woman allegedly broke up with them and then the woman was spotted like in Europe with Jimmy Butler so there there's something happened and a lot of challenges a train wreck Wiggins has mysteriously hurting now and they got smoked last night by thirty\nThirty by the book that we're not even competitive\nI actually wonder if the Houston Rockets ... you know they really wanted that or are they seeing whoa wait a second or ... thirty three he's always hurt James Orange already heard we don't have any defense the rockets or one in four people number I bachelor last summer I said they got worse\nCarmelo Anthony's just a bad everything\nThere one in four\nThere one in four we know windows shrink quickly and the NBA Derrick Rose is bowls window shrunk quickly uh Dwight Howard ... magic got to the finals that didn't last\nLong folks I'm telling you windows open and close and right now the rockets window looks like it's closing coming

heard radio [noise]\nTalk horse trend being\nThe wide receivers like Nico Collins down to the people's Jones in a more healthy and now on the field treat black I I think Michigan is the best team of the Big Ten in particular with the struggles Ohio State is that and here's the thing with Ohio State Jason is that it's not just one one off game with them that they've struggled we've seen the exact same areas\nOf failure and now for five straight games they have an inability to convert to read you know they can't run the ball and they give up far too many big place that's an issue and it's been an issue for about five games which is why I think it's more of an epidemic for them rather than a one off\nAnd nobody wants to talk about this a jolt\nI maybe I'm On an island you everybody's just endless use the best match up for Alabama I'm telling you Michigan has a better defense in LSU and I trusted quarterback more how come more people around Michigan\nCould could enter Jim horrible we know he's a great coach phenomenal regardless of what some hot take artist want to say about ...\nI think of any of the contenders they might have the best chance and again I'm not saying they're going to beat Alabama but in terms of slowing that juggernaut down why not Michigan\nI Would actually go the opposite way I don't think in the defense can slow down in Alabama or Oklahoma for that matter so\nTherefore I actually think it's Oklahoma in a weird way that would be the best matchup for Alabama and the reason is Jason adolescent everything he says ... you know everything and I think Michigan is a far better massive problem with the knowledge us because I think Michigan federal offensively but I think Michigan would freak out if they all of a sudden had to score thirty\nFive ... not going to sweltering defense in the country right like they they don't and can't\nGenerally when ball games like that and the differences over you if you said oh you like hey you're going to play Alabama first one to sixty when they'll be like yeah okay that's cool\nFor us [laughter] you know I mean I just don't think that they would be\nOut of their comfort zone and so that's why I actually looked at him like Oklahoma and and probably clumsy and what your their roster climb\nA at the teams that could potentially pose threats to Alabama I'm not saying either those but you know I think Obama's historic ... great this year but those are the ones that I'm not that that I think would be the most difficult match up for the ...\nOr ... now listen nobody in the country pushing back on Alabama's maintenance that's fine but I'm just going to say they haven't played any buddy OK yeah like nobody wants to talk about this I Know they're undefeated and to a is a machine he hasn't had back to back three announced it sees in ... when you look at that schedule\nWho they they played Texas a and M.\nThat that that's the best opponent they played an a and M. it's been up and down I share the same\nAbout climate then that's the thing you know I think all those schedules are horrendous could be quite honest with you and\nThe only schedule that were of of a pseudo top ten teams do you see a UCF says is worse by like a mile country mile you want to call it that but you're right\nYou're absolutely right they're getting a by before the biggest game then they're going to get that or offer schedule and they ask you a\nJoke and yet it's not their fault and I would do the same thing if I were rewarded for doing that that plane that schedule I continue to play that schedule not all of them as well that's I think the misconception in particular when guys like you and I knocked on a quite a lot when I rip on Alabama's schedule I'm not ripping on Alabama yeah\nAll I'm saying is that clearly the system is broken when we're honoring what they're doing over what the Big Ten in particular you know or even\nThe big twelve when you look at the big twelve flying and nine game round Robin and then having to rematch in the conference championship game for ... I mean that's incredibly difficult I think that the big twelve is actually the artist awkward to win because of that\nUm because of that rematch factor versus the incredibly imbalance a schedule I yes you see that it doesn't give you cross division games on any sort of regular basis uh and and the fact that they can play those games in November it's a joke but\nIt works for them and their schedule for championships it's a far cry from what the pact well does when they put Washington on back back road games\nYou know at Oregon Oregon occupied in Oregon's got to go back to back to Washington state out off by now Washington state's got to go down to Stanford awful by\nI mean the pact twelve it seems like actively schedules against champ yeah that conference office is brutal against their own teams there's no way that they're trying to win championships if that's the way they're going to go for that\nI liked I liked what you said schedule a championship just to remind people were not slamming Alabama but Michigan gone to Notre Dame\nAnd they went to Michigan State and the Michigan State game was after a game against Wisconsin they've played three ranked teams Alabama played one and it was at home I mean that's Joel I'm just just me a new cars I see it sometimes it as one I'm telling you I Will take the points in Michigan in the playoff game against Alabama that's all I'm going to\nSay well taking the points and call in the winter to different\nYeah like I said well okay so so you're in on the defensive the great Joel Klein everybody Joel thank you very much well listen to you on Kansas State Oklahoma today\nGus Johnson Jenny ... brother having to go into that was Joe ...\nListen he makes some great points I I don't want to go on social media now I'm sure there's going to be some mouse reserves were say you back you know ... it's\nJust their me at that site full stuff from Joel Klein coming up next year on the big lead Fox Sports radio I'm giving away free money my college football pick super hot the last two weeks for one against the spread back to back\nWe'll talk about those next year on the big lead Fox Sports radio [noise]\nDoes analytics and shovel I didn't think of Dodgers games\nAre fans rejoice does your team is that when it\nComes to the world series your coverage is right here on walking Morse radio\nEven if you're a big time basketball fan there might be a few facts about the game you don't know why did you know that the first scoops were actually peach baskets or that a war basketball's bounce the nickels one or the players could run as much as four miles or get a game\nWell here's another factor you might not know that's actually really helpful if you need to buy a car\nThrough ... also helps people get used cars that's right to car isn't just for buying new cars where there are certified dealer network at nationwide inventory of nearly one million used cars you'll enjoy real pricing on actual inventory and a simple or buying experience whether you buy newer used\nAnd withdrew car uses can see what others paid so they know if they're getting a good deal before buying they're also more likely to enjoy faster buying experience by connecting with drew car certified dealers when you're ready to buy a new or used car\nCheckout true car and enjoy more confident car buying experience some features not available at all states\nHomes and I know start with low because it loews proceeds every day on the materials supplies they use most when they buy in Boston now get twenty percent off all in song Owens Corning or G.

auto the only hard part figuring out which way is easier to game of the weekend in the NFL I I'm Sorry it has to get that ... not just because it's the Fox game but\nI actually think it's better than Vikings saying the rams Packers you get the best team in the NFL the undefeated rain\nComing home for the first time in months hosting and I know people aren't going to like this but I think the best quarterback the most talented quarterback in the NFL in Aaron Rodgers I Know greedy or has one more and he's the greatest quarterback of all time but on a talent level gimme Aaron Rodgers an incredible\nThat's the game Saturday afternoon now I may be in the building for that we'll see uh my son actually has to go to a birthday party\nAnd it's like a friend you know we're we're friends with the family so are there going golfing and my son's like fan I stinking goals you got to come with me so I may have to go to that I'll have a game on my phone don't worry but you talk about\nRams Packers were bringing in the rams beat writer for the athletic he also is on AM five Seventy LA sports Vinnie bunch in your joining the show Vinnie good morning how are you\nI'm good how are you guys are out on top of that you have two former Cal quarterbacks away at the coliseum of all places in the last time Aaron Rogers was at the coliseum\nThe almost took a number nine cow or to an upset over ... number one USC I completed twenty three straight path that game so he's coming back to er to maybe ... dragons on his own uh try to get it right at that at that stadium\nThat's wild a great point Vinnie I actually remember watching the game on TV and I was like this guy is good yeah I Know you remember that I think twenty ... twenty three straight pass as you said\nYeah twenty three straight passages or ah and then they they fell short as a ... yard line or for the go had touched on one level I added notes without a ten year old Jared golf\nWas watching that game or a northern California and his favorite team\nWas in San Francisco forty niners they have the number one pick and he told us this week that he was really the ten year old Jared was really mad when the forty niners didn't take iron Rogers also good for ... or more pick of the draft that year so a lot of connections are in this jam on top of the fact that\nThey're really good rams team and I agree with you the best quarterback or get a phone or Rogers\nWhat now that was the drastic took Alex Smith and a right of Utah and I think Aaron Rodgers just he sat in the green room forever and I write some of it was what ego like people thought he was just like to cool or he ... rubs some people the wrong ways that why you fell in the draft\nUm there there are a lot of uh I'm sure that that was part of it you know people sometimes don't need a quarter back you know so there were so there were a team that that came up\nBetween one and twenty four which where he ended up going to need a quarterback but that trip that you saw on his shoulder he's been carrying his whole life um you know even have to go to the junior college route before going Nick how\nAre obviously slipped in the in the draft out behind a Brett Farr for for many years so that ship is still there and that's one of the reasons why I think the rams\nYou'll have to be on their ... to to deal with in our audience who still to this day all these years later the best quarterback in the NFL but play like he's underwriter which a lot of ways he is\nWhich was Vinny bunch and your rams beat writer for the athletic Vinnie let me ask you is there some doubters this week believe it or not on the rams I'm actually seeing a lot of people say well who the rams beat you know they beat the cardinals and the raiders at some stinky teams\nAnd I just I don't understand where this is coming from I mean do why do you think there is a little bit of doubt about the rams at this\nPoint um well\nI still think there's some lingering from twenty sixteen than the\nTen years or so before that when they were one of the worst team ... for the longest period of time and then they were just so bad in twenty sixteen but you know I I flip it on uh the people who say they haven't got beaten anybody York at Seattle and they're getting it together that the peak Carol\nType of a team and and I had somebody from ... told me this week you know you go back to when Pete\nYou know the region of ... nobody's before they became the leader of doing these kind of re casting that are up in Seattle I Would say that they're going to knock on the door of the wild card before it's done and the Vikings are good team and they're getting it together to defeat the Vikings\nAre they went on the road to Seattle they went on the road to beat that run back to back weeks I'd like to find out the last time somebody did that a ... you know whether kind of conditions to Seattle in Seattle Denver in Denver back to back week so they've played team they've played some good teams they've handled their teams you know or who they have played\n'em they're seven and oh there's a reason for that but one of the best off as monolithic they've got one of the best you can leave the MVP caliber running back and talk girl you're great quarterback jerk off at a destructive force\nDefensively I'm Aaron ... flex his muscles are on Sunday with force forced action against the forty niners so they have star power they have a coach at Dr believe on both sides of the Baltimore for a special teams in there as well so to me it's a complete dream I don't know why people were doubting um but I think when it's awesome gun or they're going to make even without her school leaders\nUh Vinnie now the Packers coming off a by before ... when we last saw the Packers they gave him thirty points to CJ bastard\nA and a forty now I mean I was I Am watching the game I'm like how bad it just Packers deep and they stopped the run like not at all this is a we're talking about a team right now I think football outsiders has them twenty nine in the lead against Iran you're telling me ... not going to eat these guys up\nWell you know and the rams are the best running team in the NFL and if you look at the stats um you know the ratio they're fifty one forty nine path Russia which is in today's NFL\nYou know a pretty darn good balance the only the only thing that's that's more about their mother or the Seattle Seahawks but but what were the rams are different is that there are the top three scoring or just a ... while having that kind of a balance and I agree with you this is a recipe for disaster\nFor the Packers when you talk about having a child girlie going against one of a worst run defenses in the NFL and if you might get run the ball on their own\nSo I'm you know I I kind of see that the rams are gonna make this a one dimensional game put it in their ... their writers had which is not a bad thing if you're a Packers fan but his lack of mobility right now with the ... century or I think you're going to hinder him a little bit and I think that I I I'm not saying the ... but\nI don't think that this is going to be a one of the ... I think we're going to have a pretty good\nDidn't let me get you out of here with this one when you look at the situation with the Packers are not the NFC loaded they had the patriots next week I mean is there any chance Mike mccarthy fired you think if they really look embarrassing here in the rams will now\nYou have to try to keep it lively and fun but while you're also educating and so I've been I've been doing that each week on Tuesday that goes out and that's probably my favorite thing I'm doing right now to be honest\nBut of course people want picks above all given the fact you're the recommendations otherwise there's no point in reading and I I don't know you'll do like what you do a lean ... if you don't love a pick you guys will go with a lean so I had you know every week\nWe have um th joining the show I don't know if you do in order so uh yeah I saw I found him on Twitter like three years ago so he does NFL picks every week he couldn't join us this week\nI joke to MIU dodging us because you've had two straight rough weeks in the super contest I had my worst week last week I Want one in four I'm officially out of the money super pissed about it we won't get intended\nAmazing real quickly you can have one one and for a week after the start you had I didn't know you were and you're out of the money\nYeah it is right now I'm a I'm a devastating and it's so hot it's so hard to stay hot so are we going to have trust in we're going to give our super contest picks year at nine o'clock or Pacific time so about ten minutes but I wanted to bring you impressed and I said earlier in the show I only think there are four consistent good teams in the\nNFL that can win the Superbowl now I'm going to give you the fourteen you tell me if I'm missing any or you would drop any out obviously the rams I think in when the super bowl no doubt no disagree and I think the patriots can win the super bowl there now healthy and in the defense of spotty\nBut they're obviously there the other two teams I haven't you know against feel free to disagree\nI think the Kansas City chiefs and we've seen this with Andy Reid before the hot starts and then they said\nI don't know something feels different I feel like this team can win the Superbowl would you agree or disagree\nTheir defense isn't very good yeah I think it's still the third or fourth worst in front of yours for a play I I Would say that their downfall but if they're able to just score that much more than everyone else for an entire season rather than just you know six weeks seven weeks the maybe I'm not I would definitely not count them out so they are definitely in the top\n... and then the other fourteen would be the same suit started in consistently\nUh you know again gave a forty eight to the bucks at home in the open air really struggled against the browns who we now see are a bit of a fraud but I think the states are in that class they played well the the performance I thought last week against the ravens and yes I had Baltimore in the contest\nI thought that was one of the best coached games by Sean Payton he was aggressive on Fort down I think they were four for five on fourth\nAnd scoring two TVs in the fourth quarter against a team that had not allowed any second quarter the second half touchdowns all season I was impressed\nHe generally makes it sound good adjustments that ... had seven points a half so yeah that was I was one of the better coach game they'd be my top for as well and then like fringe teams I think you can't really count the eagles out yet we know who they are I mean it's tough and then the other one would probably\nWait wait wait let me let me challenge you on the eagles a beat up right no running aim whatsoever or the secondaries in shambles they got guys in ... off the street they're they're putting it in the second they were to start now you know took Cam Newton three quarters to find that out but I don't know that they're there yet they're not\nThere yet but if you end up winning a division that's pretty bad right on it and they're they're and they're more healthy and two months I mean I don't think you can count them out for making Iran they did it last year when the calls this is true I I I ... I think they are like that Fifteen minutes probably borderline in the in the semi contender list\nAnd then I had the Vikings Steelers yeah we'll find out a lot about them this weekend like Mike Tomlin better come off all by and show up and really pound the browns and prove hey we're ... we're back yeah that's actually one of my super contest ... yes and they have to you know they have to go out and being I'm good\nI'm who were not the Vikings I feel like the defense is bad now I don't know if you see the injury report for this guy just like twelve guys do they're going to be down like six starters yeah it's\nThere'd be seven just because and I think there are better with her cousins offensively I Love it or put defensively yeah they've dropped off if they had the same defense they did this last year this past year\nI mean they would be right there I think in that top for conversation the factor dog it home to St is that like the the revenge of the year because of that last second play in the playoffs at the buzzer on your bed Minnesota Minnesota's never be a dog home even to the same place I think that they should be like a to point favorite there to point dog now\nInteresting I Wonder if we'll find out that you wouldn't against me and I\nI'm all in on the states as we get to the left side of the Vikings line couldn't miss the game I mean that's not good news against or maybe it's the right side but they're going to have a garden tackled potentially out for this one\nI I I like to thank alright so coming up next year on the big lead Fox Sports radio we're going to give out our super contest takes me do it every week\nPreston Johnson the in the studio sports Gita and your boy J Mak I'm struggling folks I I'm In a funk I promise to snap out of it that's next year on the big league Fox Sports radio\n[noise]\nMessaging data rates may apply guys isn't the time you stepped up your game in the gym in the boardroom and especially in the bedroom\nAmerican men are getting saw we have left to have Dr on that our fathers maybe even less than our grandfathers we owe it to them and ourselves to fight back\nWith alpha king from forest factor it's never been easier just one small pill a day for a serious boost in total testosterone alpha king is on the rise of GNC but you can claim a complementary bottle by texting rave to eight or nine eight or nine\nMore lean muscle from your workout more energy to power through the day and more passionate drives you can rule the bedroom it's no wonder thousands of men across America trust alpha king to fuel their performance\nJust text rave to eight or nine eight or nine for your complimentary bottle of thirty five dollar value respond and the next ten minutes for your chance to also smack bottles score our number one performance will be the one answer that's R E V E to eight or nine eight or nine\nIf your skin time with your son or your son forget\nAre ... and ... when I broke out at fourteen I forgive\nA whole new matched me when you were\nYou for ... before ...

so anyway he's got jags I've got eagles what's your next play\nUh I went with the raiders so we're talking about that that's just such an ugly when they should be a favor to home and get colds but off they traded MRI Cooper and I'm not anti colds I I actually I I like the ultimate against your last one of the more impactful quarterbacks in the NFL he gets overlooked at the you know he didn't play last night and they're not grade the culture and a great team but this is a bad number I just had to take it a\nFilibuster how on earth based on what the raiders have done which is like nothing to see\nYou know they still have a good thought set off as an off its efficiency ... or ... yards per boy they aren't converting into points as often as they are they going to have the Atlanta Falcons syndrome from last year where they get into the red zone a lot more that gray area and just stall for whatever reason but a lot of that's just variance and kind of bad luck\nDefensively they're really bad especially against the fast so I mean they're not going to really be stopping the cold side I mean I actually looked at me over to either a to point discrepancy in the total number for the super contests I use plus three and and I bet like a half unit or half size wager on the raiders of plus three with natural money's just\nOkay so when I look at the raiders schedule and you know\nSome of these games are crazy they actually had like three huge plays against the dolphins Doherty Nelson yeah I had a big it are the numbers skew when you say they have a good often I mean they could not move the ball against the chargers\nThey could not move the ball against Seattle in London and uh other than a couple lucky Jared Cook at a good start in that ramp skates [noise] I don't know where these all kinds of numbers come from a day inflated because of that Cleveland Browns fifth forty five forty two she'll probably slightly\nInsulated from the ground game uh they're obviously they're really they're only extremely bad game was that Seattle one which is I think why the line is where it's at now is that just happened last week and people the public you know the market\nThey'll react to what happened most recently and so I got to kind of stuff to throw that out the window plus it was in London I think those games are just funky anyway okay so I I trust the raiders more than what I saw last week\nOh let me I Know you said you are that a masters in sports psychology sure when you see this offensive line Garret are crying allegedly whatever it does that play and can you put that you can't quantify it so how do you you know records\nAre really good question I don't we don't have a ton of time probably for the same with the ... when you see something like that so for me I kinda look for that stuff just because I'm I'm doing it anyway and I worked with a lot of athletes and coaches you know when I was in college\nAnd I saw it showed me a couple of things one he's obviously frustrated by the way the season's going they're not playing great but he cares a lot like their car cares I think he's you're you're not crying and you're out of that like that if you don't want to win and you're not putting as much work and they beat up anyways so that it told me that they are trying in the dark are probably\nHas what it takes at least emotionally to be a good quarterback in a winning quarterback and he's putting in the work they just haven't gone right for him yet and he's obviously upset about it so I think it's a positive a sentiment coming from that does survive I got it [noise]\nSo I met at fast one and I'm walking the halls and there's former coaches and GM overweight\nAnd one mentioned to me and the off season the thing to keep an eye on his like John ... and it's like a ... do you know he's cursing like a sailor Carver religion you know he's the guy who doesn't say bad words they're just totally different people\nSo it can be some sort of an income for there to for darker yeah I think that there's an underlying tone it because you know there are car like he's super duper religious like you go into social media and I I\nMean I'm kind of religious myself not as much as car and I just wonder if there is just a a level of comfort that doesn't exist that's a good point yeah I had heard that that could be All right anyway let's move on to the next one I I'll give you when I got the sea hawk on the road [noise]\nGetting three in Detroit where are you on the lion so last week Miami's\nMiami and broke off will actually played pretty well he did he kept a minute but they I think it was two hundred and forty eight rushing to the lions and like a hundred and forty nine or carry on Johnson yeah I'm only Eighteen Carrie did have like a Seventy orders that excuse some ... but\nIf this is a really big swing game for me on the lions perception because of Matthew Stafford actually has a running game of legitimate running ... never had it and he still kind of keeps them in games anyways\nVines could end up being a a playoff they're going to probably be a playoff game actually I I Would probably best them at some ridiculous number if I could find them if you're sixty to wonder when at all if they're able to get past the sea hawks and they're able to duplicate the runway more more time I didn't but the game running the lines pretty fair three\nC I F you say that but look at the defense Preston is fixed in rush yards allowed for like thirty second didn't run yards per plate thirtieth in rushing yards allowed ... now some of that skewed by the jets opener right they they couldn't tackle real well like but I you know the\nThe chiefs are down there in the same category that's what I Want to write us in this day and age the teams if you have a better off and\nThat's more predicted of of wins and success than defenses now and the way it's called and the way the game is Chuck so maybe I don't like that the whole ... I don't know I don't hate I think it's actually pretty close to ... get easily you know cover or lose a close game I just think that this is the swing game for Detroit's for real or not so I'm just kind of sitting back and was\nA division is kind of up for grabs right I made with you you know the Packers down Vikings will see bears stuff over the last two weeks I wanted to take the bears are you on bears are you at\nAre you a jets fan right I Am yeah I think it's the first time in like three weeks that by jets number is an off where I bet against the jets the last two weeks I posted or you had Viking and and so if I can tease me at three yeah so I I I bet the Vikings and then I actually saw plus eight in the real market or the super kinds of seven but I I I kinda like plus eight actually\nI mean their their injury report their that's another team no depth yeah it seemed Arnold against confident defenses in favor of that I saw your great no on that I Am\nA so okay so you have jags Steelers raiders give me your last two\nOr this is actually my favorite better the week so Bengals I ... oh my real money and mine is three and a half but it's for half of the contests I still like it should be around six\nAnd I think we're just getting some extra love for two reasons for some reason the market keeps counting the buccaneers every week I'm not really sure why they didn't get to the early they were only plus three at the falcons on the road two weeks ago and granted the fog and tried to blow the game played that was one and ended up kicking it went by five of the falcons covered but uh I I Love the bangles here off of that ... they got crushed by the\nSea is that a psychological thing like the ... the general public sees a Sunday night blowout they quit watching an app and then he said that you know next week everybody's going to go against that\nTeam so you want to be on yeah I'm not necessarily trying to do that automatically right if it winds up with my numbers I think that's why that's one of the potential reason that the market is too low on his ankles game they the the couple of times they play the team that so I'm like the the buccaneers were second to last in defense of past the\nThe falcons were down there they played out of the ... thirty four in the ravens with a number one defensive pass a fish and sea and the entire league but the the fish were thirty seven on the falcons I mean they should be able to score a ton of points over twenty eight and a half of the Bengals is also a\nBank so my problem with that is some of those all sense of numbers were when Tyler iceberg was healthy that's been out the officers struggled they should have lost the Miami that was one of the worst beat to the to defensive touchdowns in the fourth\nBut uh the bangles injury report okay starting quarterback ... out starting linebacker Nick ... vigil out perfect out John Ross out Bernard out or you know you were going to come we're gonna we got to go to break here\nBut let's come back and finish it because it's just fun I don't I don't know if the listeners love it but I Love diving into it I wouldn't want to ask you pressed it how much do injuries play a part in your handicapping I mean you can't really quantify them but how much do they matter so we'll talk more NFL after\n\nCollege [laughter]\n... hammering touched down\nWhen

towards a trip to eating out west\nThere on Saturday October twenty seven days a week number eight spry will be number nine of the college football season but we gate for Iowa with the ... week\nAnd a happy valley a place that has been with where things have gone well for Iowa at times members six to for a several years back I think that was for the remember quite born walk into a kick out there under the lights\nBut it's at a place that things haven't gone so well for Iowa at times also Justice Roberts\nHeller I mean it's easy to go back three minutes in ten seconds ago and you said Hi cotton I did have you been listening to Alabama on the combine kept last couple of days or listening to you I gold called me\nAt all a roll tide and the way they are just waking up by game three of the world series just ended ten minutes of good it was just break it up well maybe you stayed up late or more hours off it's eleven thirty four in the morning not eleven thirty for an evening although it's kind of dark in here isn't it I don't know what is that what's up with that\nAt least it's not the window last week we're not worried about equipment wind blowing around running oil at least a quite to the extent as it was a week ago we do you think about the weather a little bit with the the rain the ...\nYear old out there I Would play much on grass\nA couple of different kinds of shoes as got Donahue him and just posted it said if you like pouring rain it's a beautiful day and a half mile posted a picture and it just looks miserable uh they'll there'll be a hundred and eleven thousand cheering fans so although you know a help Iowa out\nIt's a team that crowd a little bit maybe\nSlow down the Penn State passing game a little bit this is and I have a team though that is that is very balanced scoring forty points or more in the last two big giant road games Minnesota and Indiana first time in school history that's happened in back to back Big Ten road games in the ... and\nAnd I was twelve and do since the start of the twenty seven teams use them in scoring ... points or more\nContracts that are I guess compare that to the total defensive effort leading the Big Ten fifth in the country in scoring defund and holding for opponents to a season a low um if those numbers continue to get today just in\nLike be a prospect\nTony man crumbled picture looking better and better by the way are we really what we need you know and we have no control over it is Wisconsin to get another lawsuit\nWell since you mentioned I mentioned that a little bit earlier a status update on Alex ...\nNot good not in the game is out today so that's good for Iowa dry or Iowa I Hope it's okay for him I mean we don't want you certainly don't want wish him well but\nIt it could be an interesting match up with I mean he's either their old are you know work horse depends on your ... he'll sometimes they'll probably get through the field sometimes he just stands on the side and get\nWhatever you know\nThat when they're playing Michigan why not much going on an airplane I all of a sudden he looked like a call American law and order with um maybe a collapse perhaps the way to describe what happened to Iowa last week um as far as the balance that we're talking about both off into believing defensively and running in passing\nYou have to recognize what a mate Stanley is done and hope that continues\nUh you know that shows that worked\nThe other some good prices [noise]\nAnd he hasn't one of the things that are that have been night is she hasn't been on the ground very much a six sac is all this offensive line of has handled its been traveling Lou and I were talking\nAnd about this a little bit too it's been an interesting combination because usually people think about an offensive unit of into blind unit is five guys my guys talk about\nMore experience they have the more cohesive ... together everything except this offensive line he isn't now Ross Reynolds is kind of nailed down to one guard stopped at the other one's still rotate the tackles are young sophomores alert Jackson and\nOne of the big thing\nIn any of the one that you know [noise]\nYou want to be on your guys going to do his part and you're going to hear parts I think that's that's a big\nYeah so they develop that trust with six guys didn't wind up or seven guys in the lineup\nAnd really across this team you see I'm having fun you see I'm joking with each other you heard them talking about how tight knit they've become Parker has the of course and others have talked about that on the defensive line just how good a friends they are how much enjoyment they take from being around each other and whatever you have a team that develops like that we've seen what happened\nAnd happens when teens don't remember twenty twelve for example bad skirt there's rightly points out here it's got to do\nTheir leaders are doing a great job about a large senior class but they're doing a great job of providing leadership and we've got a lot of young guys are joining right in with them so far for them to get the younger guys on orders certainly a helpful I guess out of the car\nPractices better preparation and better deemed came discipline so those are things are going to have to continue if we're going to be successful this week certainly\nPuts a lot of the credit on getting things turned around leadership comes from Egypt has been given that twenty Fifteen undefeated team but this is a talented group or perhaps the most talented I was seen in quite a while looking for maybe a breaker too but you know make your own today on the road against Penn State a top twenty college football match up\nIn ah hopefully if some things fall right particularly with Wisconsin wins and losses you take care of business yourself there is a bright future ahead there's a lot for us to talk about ... over the course of the next forty five minutes or so as we get ready for Iowa and Penn State we're going to head out to a bigger stadium here just didn't have all year\nRound I Am a ...\nMember that band\nYeah only time that is the first time they've been referenced on radio in seven years you're going to enjoy all the other idea I just got to have in the center for the cup of coffee and drink and nine out of the old W. M. D. copy bubble or no checking with geared up and here in a matter of months they'll set the scene we hope is nice and dry where he is we'll find out in a matter of moments young bumper brigade\nYellow ... well let's start with the atmosphere in many animals who ... there was more black and gold seemingly then there was a home school colors well today a hundred and seven thousand a Ninety nine percent of those folks will be a blue and white\nAnd they've talked a lot about that this week uh they've practiced with a ton of crowd noise deafening crowd noise\nBecause you think about Riley moss and Julie is much too pure freshman at cornerback playing their first game against all by the way trace mix shortly who is a process of rewriting the offensive passing\nA an rushing by a quarterback record book you're at a at a mountain it\nAh it it's going to be a whole lot different than Bloomington or or Minneapolis I'd I'd take a I'd take twenty five points in a heartbeat or today and I think they're capable of scoring that uh Penn State's a you know everybody's got injuries this time of the Penn State seems to have more than their fair share\nA especially defensively they're missing some secondary people uh their their defense of ants which I think is the strength of their ... their beat up a fact they're out there all star\nSharif Miller there's some talk about whether or not he'll play today a\nWorkplace sparingly and then they have a a safety that has to miss the first half because we're targeting call a\nLast week one of their better defenders or will not play on the first thirty minutes hopefully dogs can choke a you know ... to get a lead a and then hang onto it and and steadily building cars that defense has been so good all year long giving up fourteen points a game I I think twenty five points today when's it\nWell that's what happened last time I have a one in this series and a twenty ten twenty four points ironically that was the last time both Iowa and Penn State were ranked in the top twenty also and was that the ... and\nSandwich and right yeah the ... blocked by Adrian for a touchdown and the like that today I went oh you'd rather take six to order today too and yeah you know there is no pat angers running around\nOut there for the auction linebacker today at least not yet but uh you look at age ... and what\nHe added Iowa and that's the strength of this ... now so you know wouldn't be surprising if a Anthony Elsinore or\nA partner has to do I think is playing it as a high a level is anybody in the league defensively wouldn't surprise me at all in one of those guys are ... the ball loose from Mick shortly but primarily they've got to keep them inside the hash mark ... mother tackle box because he is so lethal ... escapes to the boundary line either side and I obviously I was aware of that\nA lot of talk here as we wrap up golf about uh if Wisconsin would lose the potential for this Hawkeye football team in the future is this a signature type when is this a turning point aimed here for this team I think\nNext two weeks or at at Penn State at Purdue Andy defined Iowa's season at a different level and I mean they've beaten the teams they're supposed to beat Wisconsin they could have easily won that game or shape for a few mistakes\nBut it didn't happen so now the badgers have a game and hand because they beat your head to head but to me I I'm not even worried about that I mean there there's half the Big Ten season to go yet yeah Wisconsin has to go to a\nA Penn State at Purdue just like the hot guys Wisconsin has got to win a tough environment today I Know they've got an early turnover and scored against the Wildcats but uh I'd almost rather see Wisconsin one today because of what they have a head of the because north western has to come to Iowa City\nAnd so I uh you know what whether we pull for this team or that team the bottom line is there's still a months to go\nA month in ... in a in a week and so so much is going to happen I can promise you end up both divisions between now and the other November hopefully some of that we're talking about is ... is there for the ... well I guess I should have said you just gotta take care of your own business and getting up and these next two weeks I think defined Iowa\nAs to what heading toward the top ten ranking or maybe settling in where they are you know there are a lot of the well gee we just get a split or if we can\nWhen they used to buy some rhyme or reason let me tell you this defense is legit this defense Israel this defense will keep you in ...\nSome of the road a tough it very much like this this these special when you football games if you don't turn it over there were brought\nTo you by friday is frozen custard and steak

right with the challenge of Brandon Smith with the talent to Mickey easily with the challenge of a mere Smith more set out there it's the too tight and just to get it done\nAnd of course the defense or D for defense so it's all it's a ... or what was his well you're on a a to point seven yards per carry six in the country that's pretty awesome like offset that defense will keep me in the game you know it depends where when your games\nAnd I think uh they're going to be called upon to day because I mean Penn State is no scrub team\nAlmost evenly matched you you look at uh I like to I'm a numbers guy I like to break things down at last check up Thursday when I kind of broke this down a ... a Penn State still six and a half point favorite as of today you know here we are uh two hours in fourteen minutes away from kick off\nAnd it is still that needle has not moved other than maybe down a point now Penn State is a five point favor out of course they're getting three and a half for the for me in the home team yeah to point game pretty uh pretty close pretty well evenly matched though I mean you look at it Nate Stanley sixteen touchdown six interceptions a ... eleven touchdowns three interceptions\nRushing Yard's not too far away I mean um it it's almost you could almost draw a line right down the middle and haven't evenly spaced out\nYou know so then it's going to be about coaching game planning it'll be about execution course turnovers though probably once again and we heard from Kurt ferrets earlier on the uh incredible senior leadership that we've seen from the sting part of it comes on the offensive line with the center senior ...\nDirector a lot of factors I'm\nOne of them's or just a continuing heard of a bar or experience level rather than it was was two years [noise] uh let's see last year or so young all skill positions in an office tackled position so that makes a tougher to be successful on third now um\nBut you know we've talked about that I think beyond that I think our coach says it's not a good job come\nMost importantly our upwards of executed ... what the you know have a success first and second down so you're probably thirty seven or greater those types of situations you know if you can control the ... uh\nYou know obviously your purse proficiency goes up as about this since ... fed her fourth\nAnd we talked about that quite a bit on huddled with Lou in Trevor part of what is allowed for this often soup success is the first down ... because if you come up second it to her second and three jobs can you can really call in either yeah\nI mean and I hope we go to the playbook today I Hope we throw a little ... law\nBecause it kind of surprises everybody at this point in the season place in style points you know who you're thinking a little um take the gold and maybe a couple of field goals maybe a couple of months I get on the way I was not kick in any way to arrest that are out there called not calling for another you know\nThe touchdown I saw it in the end zone why not [laughter] style points man though this is all sprinkles on top of the donut now you know\nUm how about that whole ugly when versus pretty last

last year produce that stood in Iowa yeah to the higher the Ohio State game so schemes don't really\nYou know players maybe don't get into the bench factor as much as you know learning a from a mistakes feeling their way to success and if you believe what Trevor has been saying on the post game show the last year was about learning with a very young team that coach perish just reference there are a lot of an experience\nFor you guys that a year prior we're starting in high school and now here they are on college football's biggest stage not the case as much anymore for Iowa now so they they spent that you're learning now they're putting it into practice putting it into play and we're seeing some evidence of that success\nCould see a lot more of a here today to triple the pull

have\nUm you know like the systems that they do now back then and all those things so it was kinda like they're they're all and they have like a premier back um so that sounds like another saying we we didn't really get to you know like the drawbacks system so I was kind of you know like a a\nJunior or so in Frederick was a senior I'm so a lot of lot of things that I Believe that you know like we

that but hopefully the rain will subside it's supposed to and the corps so this is one of the best care field sitting in the country are taught gaming Indiana last week and never\nEasy to it on the

said the sherbet rubbish he's carry the ball\nThe two times the last four games to Eighteen ties how obviously some of them are maybe a broken past player or whatever but still at Eighteen times a game for a guy that you would prefer not that good ...\nA ... and ... miles Sanders I think he I think he's earned more touches because Sanders was really good last week out of the backfield he had a career high and receiving with fifty three yards\nTargeted six times last week made all six sketches and between that and the running game standards is going to be a thousand yard Russia or this year for them [noise] he's a guy that can take some pressure off and the biggest problem I have had this year offensively that's released all them as they've had\nTwenty five drop passes this year\nI mean that just crushes an office or something like that happened the thing is one thing you know as with Iowa they convert their third downs forty nine percent forty two percent on third and for better but when they have to make a pass play their guys are making catches and making ...\nSanders what has impressed shoe and kind of described his style obviously sake warms a generational player a ... mile Sanders is a one cut ... guy who really fits the offensive line and they all sense of wanting to good straight ahead blocking offensive line they give them a crease he goes\nHe's not a guy that messes around and dances or anything like that he can get to the edge he's got good speed but he also has the ability to get to the whole quickly and then get rolling and I think kids where he's really been a plus he's become a better blocker he's become a better receiver\nAs we're Barclay really excel the last couple of years great receiver\nWell Sanders has become a good receiver which is what they needed\n[noise] he talked about the drops and this wide receiver group as it got better as the season is rolling\nAlong and it's a funny thing is I watch them and practice Robin they catch everything right and they get in the game they got a drop here and a drop their joint Johnson's been getting better as the seasons gone along that's fine\nRandom Polk has struggled a bit the last couple of weeks with hanging on the football ham or catches ever there are a catchy he's been fined that he's the big play guy in this law fence I don't think that there's enough ways to get him touches because he's about as exciting players or they've had in a while and they've had some exciting players or\nHow is the fence up front because they're obviously going to go against one of the better defensive line so see\nYeah they're going to have their work cut out today because I mean this this defense of front I mean I looked at Ohio State obviously and then I went to the tape of Iowa in Iowa was every bit

the library of Charlotte in that case the main thing is that Iowa defense and made Stanley keep doing what you're doing\nWell yeah and this was the type a day that you're gonna have to really concentrate on the handling the ball holding on to the ball and this was a regular\nGrass fields were born in a little money to down there something that doesn't happen on synthetic turf so uh yeah it's it's just not going to be at all since the\nExplosion idle twenty five points by what I think so yeah yeah I I Would agree with you or it we're we're we're\nWatching a heavy drizzle or a missed call it what you want it rained hard all night long off and on and throughout the morning or as a great running back not return or kick return or what are the little new watched as you look for going from field turf to natural grass on a day like today\nWell one of the things that that will happen it is I think a slows down the pass rush 'em because this is a big effect July ... there are few slip\nOr when they're on our natural grass fields so when it if it's soggy or one of our principal arm and make contact with them and stuff for and they get their feet back up ... and ...\nAnd [noise] Penn State is trying to do fifty sacks this year that's sort of deal or are there almost twenty six or seven now then that was their goal to get fifty for the season so let's hope they get some zeroed today\nAnd that's been a pretty good number for the Iowa offensive line so let me reverse the lines of scrimmage or and ask you about the old line leads the big tent with only ... shacks allowed water their issues on a turf like today\nWell we're a little better off I think because I'm are all kinds of linemen are are built to run or they're not heavy weights is that in there and slug we pull them a lot we expect to unveil to get on the outside and walk or and so I think they're probably impacted the least or anybody\nA on a day like this in fact a lot of a Pepsi Bhutto's like days like this so\nWell and that's why it's a it's encouraging to see that Iowa Ron game come on like it has the last two weeks ...\nWell yeah and and a talking to jak cam ... my counterpart here at Penn State this morning he said Indiana last week was second by second and for all day they ran for two hundred and twenty five yards so let's hope that are over ... can put that kind of a running game dinner together today if\nThe guys can run Ninety nine plays like Indiana did last week they should get out of here\nWith their church straight road victory ... he'll be back a little bit later on your knees

Gary bar to Penn State\nNow twenty five years of member of the Big Ten they'd been a great ambassador like all of our institutions very uh\nUh yeah they had the situation and twenty of Lebanon twenty twelve with Sandusky that ah really turn the entire university upside down not just the football program but they seem to have emerged from that ... that you know the the effects are long standing we get that\nBut uh when you look at it as as a ... an athletic director in this league ...\nWhat do you think about when you you're able to promote the effect of Penn State is in the Big Ten conference\nWell first of all I was in Italy at the time but I've had conversations with the commissioner Delaney and others about how when we first added Penn State there was a lot of consternation a lot of concern that they weren't going a bit but if you think about it they do fit the profile academically\nOr the size of the institution public research or certainly their fan base in their stadiums there a broad based program they offer a lot of sports so uh they they really are the issues that you mentioned not withstanding they really are a terrific a member of the Big Ten for so many reasons\nWonderful academic institution to an no thankfully a greater ... school and you know you being in Iraq when you look at a soggy turf like today natural grass how's your quarterback were you able to you know when you've got to block it out of your mind you've got to play a game but how did you always approach a day like today\nThe biggest issue you have to get out of your head and just a you know if you have big hands as a quarterback it's an advantage on a day like today because\nThe ball is slippery but the ball is built in such a way or the you know the middle of the ball is built such way if you have large hands you can handle that so [noise] ah actually this week compared to last week I Would much rather play in a drizzle as a quarterback and play and forty mile an hour gusts so assuming that\nThe voting is good and and as you mentioned they have a they have a reputation for having a great ... I was down there\nEarlier it does look solid um you know I think it's going to come down to who execute as as a ... he said it takes a little bit extra concentration\nAnd it would be really nice to have a running game today you know you're sounding like coach ... now a\nTakes a quarterback with big hands Nathan Stanley has huge clauses he calls it so that should bode well for our quarter back\nToday and he prefers wet over windy I like that I like that term uh uh ... let's switch sports here because they see the Hawkeye the outstanding Iowa Hawkeye women's field hockey team is here in state college and they play Penn State tomorrow the opening round of the big tent tournament\nThe fall season is starting to wind down and a lot of sports in to a cross country team is it Big Ten championships the men in Nebraska this weekend and\nInterestingly a we played Penn State here tomorrow in field hockey I think it's two top team top ten teams\nI think we're nine and they're seven uh we we were able to beat them two to one in a close game at home so uh they'll they'll be watching and and cheering on the ... a two day Hawkeye swing through through happy valley\nIndeed despite the elements and good luck to the men's and women's cross country teams at Lincoln, Nebraska tomorrow for the across country but cross country championships it is that time of year isn't it\nIt is in a it's a fun time of year and you know clearly with football we're six in one and and I've been asked several times of the the comment is made a big game isn't it this week and I said you know when you're six one every games\nAnd I've noticed you've taken a peek at the Wisconsin north western Michigan state Purdue as somebody said earlier you know how do you see this race there are so many so much football left the next as another month of there's\nThere's a reason to college football playoff doesn't come out with its first poll until this week and there's a reason for that early on it's fun to talk about who's ranked where but this is about the week where a separation begins to occur and clearly ah we're in a situation where we want to separate ourselves the right way to day\nIndeed thanks for coming by very good to see you guys very barter Hawkeye athletic director uh stopping by and our whistles hybrids pre game show right now it's time for today's Hawkeye historical winning moment presented by riverside casino\nAnd golf resort stopped by the all new draft days sports lounge at riverside casino engulfed where you'll find great food beverages and the top golf swing sweet ready to play they're going through an incredible remodeling down their riverside ten plus years old now and to\nThe stretch you've often said this season uh your your football team this tradition preparers are focused his game where you can practice about as good as any team you've had a what's the what's the story there I think\nLeadership and uh you know it really kind of began in the summer I think an earnest and and uh you know it's not just or or Thirteen seniors are all doing a great job then we've got a lot of guys that are sophomores in juniors that are doing the same thing the juniors are pretty obvious but even as off more like a tour and young\nWho's a you know split in time and ... but he just does everything the way it's supposed to be done so we got a lot of guys really showing the younger players in in its own usual as many younger young players is we have planned but the older guys are showing those guys how to do things on a day to day basis not just at\nThe end of the week well let's talk about prepping for the ... today Hoosier your scout team here all this week that took a trace mix surely Israel\nYeah good luck on that one uh you know it's just a it's not something and duplicate he's a really good football player\nAnd and clearly the biggest challenge we face to the deposition this season um probably will be the entire season he's used as a really good football player and you know he throws the ball pretty well runs that well he's heady you know it's tough to get a shot on as much as he runs you know he's good at getting down are getting out of bounds um\nYou know but I think the biggest attribute is that he's just a guy not only are all sorts of guys leaving with their entire team believes in them so if he's on the field I think they they have a belief that they can win the football game and you know we we um had a good opportunity to get him last year we couldn't do it and so are we going to try today\nEleven touchdowns throwing a rushing he he's the complete package she might be the most complete quarterback you see this year\nThe earliest I mean I'm In their back up as a good player too but he's he's clearly the leader of the football team last year you had him in Berkeley together is is really a dynamic combination but you know Berkeley's gone but they've got they've always had good players here and has the same story you know a good running backs and and good receivers\nThat we've got a freshman tight and who's really good players so yeah we're at the played just good team defense because you can't load up in any one area\nIs your first sustained look at miles or ... or Sanders said I'm not Chinese declined Barkley but but he's he's very gifted ... what do you like about him\nI mean really outside of Randall well nobody's Barkley in my opinion a rental oh is that just a\nTotal a challenge to to uh prepare for and and uh Barclay was the same thing he was just a great great impactful player\nSo you know but that those guys are good back in ... as they just go back in history and I my my history has back to the sixties or with Penn State I Can't remember last time they don't have a good running back a guy that you really have to respect them if you don't tackle and defend them\nOh he's going to hurt you and those guys the same way\nAt Minnesota at Indiana a convincing wins but more Iowa fans there than than home fans to be a little bit different here today or this team is really supported by the fan base with a hundred and ten thousand whatever have you talk to your kids about handling the environment the emotional yeah tried\nTo explain that Julie sprints this morning that\nThis is just kind of like the Indiana trip and the you know it's a small town you know you'll end in in the airport and you know nine ten minute ride over I said the only difference is in the hills\nTrees and we get in a state of ... a lot of fans and they're not going to insurance for us so a little contrast there uh to to what we've experienced that you know all that being said I you know it's a great college environment just like ... and if if you really like college football you know you love being in those environments and it just adds to the challenge is always a challenge to play Penn State\nLaws has been they've always had really good players are and when you come here that's always a great environment so to me if you if you really enjoy this that it's just one more thing that just kinda\nReally shouldn't take it out as a challenge a coach versus just like the Indiana trip accepted by nine percent of the people the road stadium will be rooting for you or against you and that for you or his point was I had great crowds ...
