Association\nWe bring chaos icy Iowa city's news sports they shouldn't available on your Amazon smart speaker Jesse Alexa play eight ... heart radio\nBasically basically a Spiro Agnew or or or kind of coming down in a in a direction with or download angle and all that so that's part of the reason I think the other thing is you're paying a running back now for most of these teams I mean ... money as much as you're paying a quarterback he's there to throw the football not run it\nBut doesn't it feels like the shortest distance though to get to the to the line as to the line you need to get you to get a first down would just be that quarterback sneak\nNow you're saying that they just the certain ways that they game plan it like the thing that kills me is when tea and I'm sure you see discovering college football as much as you do it will be forced into fourth in one third and one and a quarter backs in shock on\nI mean I it just it feels counterproductive to me and again I'm throwing at you because you've forgotten more about football than anybody listening to the show is except for me you forgotten more about football than anybody listening to show even as ever known it just feels counterproductive and I don't know if that's\nMe just still reeling from James Franklin decision or are looking at the patriots always up success with it or seeing the rams you know seal a game up against the Seattle Seahawks in Seattle by using a quarterback snake\nI I don't know I Can't explain it to you because it's no different than it being you know force in one or thirty one and then being in shock and wanting to play\nBut also at the end the games I mean teams just silly again will stay in shot gun\nFive yards back in the middle of football and that has everything to do with the fact that they just haven't taken a lot of snaps from under center and that is something that can be risky if you don't do it um so it you know there there's a risk reward there especially when you just try to steal the game so that's some of the logic to it\nBecause especially in the goal line and when you know you're going to run a quarterback sneak\nThe centers going to kind of position himself a little bit lower like his parents are going to be even lower from that standpoint\nAnd when he snaps the football he's you know really lunging out it's so it becomes a different snapped in what you're normally accustomed to the ball handling\nIt'd be an issue when you've been in victory formation did you ever almost normal the ball or actually fumbled the bond victory formation I Would be paranoid as hell about doing that\nNo but what you do is you basically just take the snap or your need out as fast as possible and then that way it kind of eliminates any hesitation of of whether or not you did 'cause everyone's just looking for your need out okay good\nAnd then what are the line when trying to slap the ball out of the centers hand trying to\nMake him yeah they'll do things that kind of distract them a lot of times what you see at that point the game is a opponents wore bark out your cadence and try to get you to jump or\nThey'll try to you know swipe at a face try to swipe at the hands snapping the football or those sorts of things\nThat this might be the most informative segment we've ever done to open up the show got to help me a little too informative I ... I think it's gonna look man I it's not every day you can turn on a sports radio show and you can hear about how long the in seem as for the center of the Seattle Seahawks like that is informative by the way thirty inches theme that's that's not very long\nNo I mean no no but I think a lot of us deal with that especially when it gets colder [laughter]\n...

sports talk radio going man we love Jonas and radiate so safe\nBut I Do think it is time to uh but\nYou know it is [noise] when I found out\nAnd around and high above\nMe twenty Eighteen Atlanta Falcons because it has over it is over ... by by sigh in our uh\nAdios peace or as my friends would say do says that's a wrap on this he's already [laughter]\nI don't see anybody says do this anymore Joe no no no no ... trust me people still say\nDo they do they say ... what about this they say who knows our trade say trays anymore either do that\nYou had to be here with a joke okay but anyway um let's just move on because I don't think anyone would just\nYou know find a way it's not that this is a bad start to the show it's just sort of all over the place have you noticed that not only are best half hour but\nThat's kind of how we are that's how we operate something tells me you're um you you got out of gas gone out in the parking lot or something [laughter]\nSomebody tells me that you might have cop a doubling flew last night or that one went down with the doctors are doctors pat ... yeah the doubling flu no doctors pat and Jake or over and that's\nThat's a well we'll save that for Rick I'm\nBack to where we had the Atlanta Falcons their season is over they stink done\nUh I I'm not going to say they stink can be one half their football team is actually pretty good that they're often ... um but it's sort of defense or they're just so bad and I think in that division when you look at Carolina now who won today you look at New Orleans they they seem they are having you know getting things together again playing better defense we all know\nHow good breezes and everything else like I just I look at them and say I\nI just I don't think the students going to work out too well for them because the un Jones got O'Neill Ricardo and those guys are coming back which is not coming back anytime soon and they probably need all three of them to come back at at this point so it's really going to rely heavily on the fence from that we're witnessing a right now\nYeah ... it's ...\nIt's like they're off at can't overcome what they're missing on defense\nAnd I think that they end up until this game on Sunday where Pittsburg just put it on them up until this game they were in every single game or probably should have won every single game I mean if you look at the the close call against the saints if you look at uh Cincinnati coming back and beating among the last second if you look at that final\nDriving and red zone sequence against the eagles in week one like you can make a case that Atlanta should be undefeated\nYou see the stat and it was before this past week's lawsuit Pittsburgh they were the first well I should say first and so teams that score thirty six plus points okay at home and didn't turn the football over in NFL history of four hundred and two and four and the Atlanta Falcons are two of those for\nI ... I was on in my life and somehow they lost both those\nAnd so again it's it's not like they're off at this point that they're not you know they're playing pretty well they just can't put good enough to overcome how poorly their defenses playing and you know I\nGet asked a question like is the window closing for this falcons team that was up twenty eight to three and a Super Bowl and let that game go and they let Tom Britain when patriots come back and win the football game but I don't know that they're ever going to be able to get back to another one\nUm I actually and I was talking about this on my highly rated weekend overnight show that you don't listen to nor participate in well I have other stuff going on I I I Do recall college football yeah I'll be a gecko yeah I I Know but not with Joe Davis because he didn't show up for work I'm All right so um this is a at look at it if it's there are going to take it\nBut I was saying this and I actually genuinely feel bad for falcon sense I really do and it's not because\nA chick fillet is an open in the stadium on Sundays cars that place stinks the reason I feel bad for falcon spans because to your point\nYou were so close to winning a Super Bowl you add Tom Brady and the patriots on the ropes and there were so many things in that game that went wrong in that second half Julian Edelman catch only gets talked about enough\nBecause if he doesn't make that catch Atlanta it's going to win that game and then you get to overtime\nThe strength of your team is the fence and you're often doesn't even get a chance to get the football Tom Brady and the patriots go down the field and they rip your beating heart out of your chest on national TV you come back the next year\nAnd to their credit they go on the road they beat the rams and they beat him decisively in LA in the playoffs\nAnd then they probably should have beat Philadelphia and they lose that game but didn't ... I Know but it but and then if you look at just the injuries there is a metrics that they use like it's it's some sort of is that you know like one of these like real inside a like I think they call analytics or whatever or whatever it is\nAnd it's called like the uh injury\nTo significant player stat\nThe falcons over the past three years ranked second six than the NFL and second again they've been primarily healthy throughout the course of ... time there\nAll of that a slip this year and you're in these close games stuff that never happens is happening and now you find yourself in dead last and and to your point key players aren't coming back I I feel bad for man yet I met Ryan's not getting any younger\nUh he seems like mobility ... so down now the red\nZone and ... what are your what you mean what what what what was really fast or well I'm just I mean like you get it over there I Would probably should have thought that one out yet doesn't make any kind of thinking about it slowed down yeah it doesn't make any so what are what are you all for five to ... he had his leg amputated in between games I have no idea what I was thinking\nThere but um they just in the red zone has gotten better the office has gotten better but yeah it's not like they can just go out there and win games on their own ... being a defensive guy\nYou would think he'd have them prepare but when you lose that many players to injury and you've never dealt with that over the past three years since you've been there I feel bad for minutes over you're not getting back into that division and now what do you do you just go out there and try and win shootouts every game\nUh yeah and it's got up to whoever Jones by the way it still does have a customers that's weird is that crazy weird weird and Calvin Ridley scoring every week it seems like yeah yeah except for this week but\nPolitical building that dream home\nNow the perfect time to talk with us about a mortgage loan\nMany options to consider find you a loan them he writes for\nCall today and good story\nHim eight on strike up a van\nAnd let your school colors why I\nWant falling through your speaker [noise]\nThe blaze lay down I'm telling you my bold predictions for college football this year I had all the action may scream [noise]\nYour teams are covered right here on Fox Sports radio\nFox is the new one Thursday Night Football this Thursday the reigning Super Bowl champion Philadelphia Eagles take on the line many new the New York giants\nThose giant Thursday on by [noise]\nThere's a better way to buy a home insurance with progressive new home\nCome in at great great poll on line for yourself how much you could say progressive Don ...\nHe is ready quaint I'm Jonas not this is Fox Sports radio I coming up here momentarily we aren't going to talk about what a liar rainy Quinn is [noise]\nI'll explain here I was confirmed after a game on Sunday so we'll get to that here momentarily doing updates you on the Sunday night\nFootball game of the week it is the Dallas Cowboys are the six nothing lead over the Houston Texans first quarter winding down a ... it should probably be a little bit worse than this when you say Brady jak Prescott looks like they're at least finding some success or down the field but then they get close and they just can't figure it out in the red zone\nRight uh and that's you know kind of how it affects that's out of college football is cut out the NFL's becoming a little bit\nWith these ... put so many points and the advantage of uh the officers have with a legal contact the points of emphasis and then the uh you know the rule changes and all that but\nYou know it's it's funny like this is a private she probably should be fourteen nothing right now but uh you know at this large part due to the fact that the red zone we talked about what the Texans just don't want to point man defense or they don't wanna play mandolin which is kind of a kind of interesting because it used to be a lot better than the secondary\nAnd then they've just somehow gotten got off all over the past uh last four games so what do you mean they have the honey badger now\nRight that's done nothing for the last three years ago it was all about the fact they didn't have a quarterback but everything else was there yeah they had a piece and every bad timing man right at the end the ... literally they were one of the best past defense is Jay Jay ... have you on cloudy and back\nWith a ... and and all that and now it's like they cannot stop anyone jak Prescott he was he was the average like a hundred and eighty a hundred and Seventy or the game do he'll probably throw for like three hundred yards tonight\nYeah it's uh so I mean the early on at least a we've got a good football game or at least we're getting a good one you know it's not like that that crummy game we got last week where Pittsburg no showed especially in the second half\nAnd it was awful football so at least we got a good one so we'll be monitoring that throughout the course of the show are Brady Quinn 'em by the way real quick so you've got a somebody recognize you I'm I'm here reports already recognized you this past week or your brand and they ... they recognize you for a specific reason\nDo hell Brady Quinn what how will\nI Will so I I took my whole family up to do a new house did Indiana game and so I'm I'm at the airport with my wife\nAnd our two daughters which was chaotic right so all I'm thinking is get to the plane get on the plane don't piss that he went off on the plane and then get off and get your destination like that's all I care about and then hopefully no one gets crap Donald tree now and then which is very high possibility so we're going through security we're about ready to walk the line\nAnd I I think I was grabbing something or I was like picking up slowing our oldest daughter\nAnd um I'd noticed someone talked to Alicia and then a guy approaches me says hey\nYou're British Clinton right I guess yeah he goes I Love you and Joe ... that's what I heard right and so I'm thinking like oh OK thanks she's like yeah it was you guys every Sunday night and I

[laughter]\nGuess the whole I doubt that can melt down if you will a man um I I think we're [noise]\nWithin a week [laughter] I'm almost ... option I'm almost Seventy ... opposite because I think the primetime game is a great opportunity this happened it big ashore [noise]\nAlthough that present the chance for them to kind of put this past them and they are playing at home\nWe talked about that the whole vantage workers and their football so I\nI'll put it this way [noise] I don't think we get past October twenty second and it laid out for that [laughter] it's\nFootball Monday Night football at some point he's going to go off if you live man and can't pick up a ... is play and just to go back to kind of a\nDown feel drawing look it's hard to do when you don't have good protection and that has been the case and now they in protection I mean the David Rush for over six yards today and I look I don't care a lot of defense is good\nBut come on man I mean at some point this season you've got to be able to put up you know better numbers running the football at least more consistent numbers I'll put it that way\nBecause they've had you know times and they've been over a hundred yards and then they've had thirty five yards and then over a hundred yards and sixty five yards like it's just it's constantly back and forth back and forth\nAnd and today now I Want to say it's like the second time second week in a row they've been well below a hundred yards it just goes back to the initial conversation of you took say call Berkeley He was supposed to solve all your problems if that's what you thought that you were sorely mistaken the first place\nUm patch Irma right now is probably thinking oh so yeah a little different than coach in ah in Cleveland\nIs this a lot different like he's going to get hammered by the media I mean there's no money to cover man if you look if you're covering sports you don't want ate and ate and boring you want one and fire you want a diaper fire or you want a Super Bowl contender those are the ones you want to cover that's the most fun\nBut uh yeah yeah I mean like the fact that was in New York's probably the best part I bet they took this job though with the thought and by the U.S got a year\nAnd then after a year they got to figure out what they want to do the problem is is the quarterback class for next year if they're going to pick a guy there is some options we can talk about it but I don't know if it's going to be what we saw from this year's draft class\n...

Fox portray I Do want to ask you are coming up next year and just a moment because I think that there's a a bad situation and I'm going to throw a theory that you're not really a conspiracy theory but just a theory that I have\nRegarding a quarterback and somebody who's a future hall of famer so we're going to have that for you next year on Fox Sports radio but for all the latest from around the world of sports including an update on Sunday Night Football in Texas it's either going ...\nDonors in Brady in game three of the LDS the Atlanta Braves have a five to two lead over the Dodgers and the bottom of the fourth inning with the Dodgers leading the series two games to none the Braves relating one nothing in the second inning with the bases loaded and is Ronald ... came to the plate a Braves fan named Caitlin tweeted quote\nIf a ... slams this I Will tattoo is face on my forearm no lie unquote well sure enough it did just that\nBecoming the youngest player to ever hit a grand slam home run in the post season and for the record Caitlin subsequently tweeted quote\nTake your pick at Ronald ... junior twenty four let's get cat it unquote\nThat's a bad idea to throw that out at an amateur regret that ah ... you'll get a Snapchat in a hurry [laughter] can't take some things that could also media as Jonah speaks authoritative Lee I presume\nIn game three of the other LDS the brewers completed asleep at the Rockies were the six nothing victory of Colorado Milwaukee ... one\nOf the and I'll see us on friday on Sunday Night Football the Houston Texans within ten six lead over the cowboys are committed in thirty one seconds remaining in the second quarter\nThe Texans have a first than ten at their thirty one yard line in the late games the rams won in Seattle thirty three thirty one for the rams first dive into start since two thousand one of\nThe Vikings with a twenty three Twenty one victory in Philadelphia chargers over the raiders twenty six to ten cardinals get their first wind beating the forty niners twenty eight eight teams in the early games the Panthers trail the giants thirty one to thirty in the final seconds as gram granola lined up a field goal from Winston Salem\nSixty three are the way\nYou know kick his law\n[laughter] [noise]\nMixing the call on WB T chiefs improved to five and I was a Thirteen or fourteen victory over the jaguars lions over the Packers thirty one twenty three Green Bay kicker Mason Crosby missed four field goals plus an extra point\nThe browns have proved to two two and a woman with a twelve nine overtime win over the ravens Isaiah ... ran for a franchise record to Nineteen and the jets thirty for sixteen whatever the Broncos\nThe bangles defeated the dolphins twenty seven to Seventeen to move to foreign one Steelers over the falcons forty one to Seventeen Atlanta now one and four and Steven house get kicked a forty six yard field goal at the gun to give the Buffalo Bills are Thirteen twelve victory over the Tennessee Titans ... back to you thanks ILO\nCompany alive you are from the guy go Fox Sports radio studios where it's easy to say Fifteen Percent or more and car insurance with the guy go get a guy could comical eight hundred nine four seven auto you only hard part figuring out which way is easier I'm I'm a little uncomfortable right now with something ready\nOr what was that just something that that I'm so we've got a tweet [noise]\nUm I don't know if you've seen this but I have seen it um and uh and it's a tweet from our friend lived that Jesus\nUm I think I I think I may have [laughter] he is I think I may have seen\nNow I just so people out there understand why this is a character on our show who started showing up a couple of years ago it was a loser and\nMaking picks on the air or a live bats on actual sporting events we've never seen him we don't know what he looks like we don't even know if it's a he or she or both we have no idea\nA piece of paper falls out of the sky it lands on the desk and there's a bat inside the paper and I read it on the air\nHe's been atrocious lately he went up [laughter] you win anything nothing cannot win a damn bet but he is just sent out a tweet um and it it's it's the undertaker rising from the dead so I Believe that that is an indication that he should be coming up here um\nI I Am assuming within the next ten minutes or so that usually when he shows\nUp so I Hope not what they asked us one thing if I'm sure you know if he is going to bed on one thing tonight please don't be playoff baseball like I just hope ... Sunday Night Football it's Texans cowboys making about football you know all of us have a little bit of fun and make it about the football game\nI just I I don't want to have to switch over watch baseball game\n... and now is it because I'm maybe it it hurts a little bit to see your broadcast partner Joe Davis calling the game with John ... right now\nAnd you want to be blunt I just I Do appreciate plow baseball now I just it it's boring to me football I'm Sorry if you're a baseball fan but I grew up playing baseball I Love baseball or nothing like you know hitting ... nothing like any of that stuff I did it I played it for a long time warfare to my life\nAre still football's better yeah by\nThe way if you want to watch Braves Dodgers just tuned in to Fox Sports one where you can find that game\n...\nStuff or any way to wipe out the network All right um so let's get you on this year on Fox Sports radio so I Want to show some football man that's why look I'd be the ...\nI Love the honesty I just\nDon't do what do\nYou like it's like at telling your wife God I hate brunette [laughter] excuse me I'm\nLike look there are two separate audiences people want to watch football players are like oh gosh well baseball's on like they're not sworn they're going to watch football and people were in our space we're going to watch baseball I I don't know why you feel like it's the same body look I watch it all man I watch it all\nI Do so I mean you're degenerate gamblers okay\nYou know what that that is offensive and its factual I'm sick of it All right so let me ask you this question\nSo I end this is not a conspiracy theory but I Do wonder there's cause I Love picking your brain when it comes to the psychology of quarterback ... last week Brady broke down with the quarterback walk is one of the most bizarre descriptions I've ever heard of my life I felt like you were describing Encino Man like somebody waking up in a block of ice\nIn which raises the Bible is not that great a Brendan Frasier under their actors so far it's it's not that great of a tacit guitars and it was he was in ... poly shoring him eating microwave ... seven eleven and it's not that good of a ... stinks I'm Sorry [laughter] stuff again\nThere's a man like really watch that movie and then come ballad really watch the tape and then tell me how good that was it was awful\nBut if it's on right now and watch it um and you would probably watch it over baseball but [laughter] so let me so let me just say this so Aaron Rodgers when I'm when I'm watching the Packers\nAnd you're seeing them compared to Kansas City and the rams or even the bears a week ago or even some of these raider games um that that we've seen not the one that we saw earlier but you're just looking at other teams the Steelers and you're watching these other teams and they're putting up these huge point totals\nAnd they're they're doing these these Rasul dazzle plays and they're sending a mismatch isn't all the play calling all of that\nYou didn't Rogers looks at that\nAnd says why can't we do some of that because he's kind of hinted at it being very passive aggressive ... almost ... at taking a shot at Mike mccarthy and it feels like ... what they're doing there is almost outdated\nLike it feels like something about it doesn't work and and I know Aaron Rodgers is fantastic and he's a first ballot hall of famer and probably a top five guy in the history of the league\nBut just outside perspective it feels outdated and I wonder if he looks around and goes man I'm just better off when I get in to hurry up because when they got back into that game it was all passing it was free up often go down the field quick strikes try and get to the end zone and let me figure it out from there\nSo a few things um I I wasn't in many systems where they did this but some west coast systems and ... is a west coast system they have in the two minute drills that hurry up off in the quarterback will call it\nSo for a couple of things one it helps the quarterback get into a rhythm better because your point at a faster pace it's almost like playing basketball right and distributing the basketball round applying at a faster pace like the the other thing is he's got control he's the one out they're calling the plays that he wants to run based on what he's saying\nSo that might be a reason as to why he's better off in those scenarios or when they play in the know how to him and pick up the ... um the other thing is of course Aaron Rodgers is aware of what are the teams are doing and what's going on in the NFL every single week as a quarterback\nYou go and you watch other teams and you kinda go through their system who had a big performance you didn't like I can guarantee you this\nEvery single team every quarter back room on their off they on Monday or a doctor often but the day after the game they're going to come and they're gonna wash Kansas City they would've what Andy Reid joined watch this patch homeless guy I can guarantee you that", "show_name": "Fox Sports Weekends", "year": "2018", "city": "Iowa City", "day": "08"}
