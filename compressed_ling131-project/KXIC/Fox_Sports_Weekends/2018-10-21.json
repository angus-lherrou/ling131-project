Milwaukee fortunately they have Josh hater you mentioned a little tidbits instead how 'bout this one for the all star and left the seems to strike out\nEvery other bad or he's ever faced in his life\nHe's gone at least two innings this year twenty three times for the brewers Milwaukee's record is twenty three and oh when he pitches at least to an age and in fact he set an all time major league record for most strike out by a lefty reliever this year for one season is over half\nThe bats against him ended in strike out this year\nAnd he's been dominant in the postseason as well have threes nasty man it's like Randy Johnson coming out of the bullpen and the early anyway\nBut on the sloppy hair going ... got the floppy do\nCan't see the ball coming out of his hands and they blew me away on its by\nLA to one and the top of the fifth at Milwaukee and the good news for the brewers fan says that hate her through under twenty pitches and his first two wedding so he's certainly going more than two weddings and this one\nWe mentioned last a hour on the show about Manny Machado was bon single which is the play of the game so far on a three to pitch a ... single safe at first and the next batter homers\nThat's why the Dodgers are up to one and this game\nAnd we I think all concluded that there is no way that's happening unless the crowd wasn't writing them so badly with all the booing last night and tonight in fact much autos ... single tonight\nWas the first bond hit in the majors on a three to pitch in four years\nAnd then his home to first time was under four seconds\nWhich is his fast is reading to first base of the entire year so you can call him Johnny hassle when he's actually motivated by the visiting fans I guess Alex ... has been throwing in the bullpen for LA\nClinton ... is in the bullpen and expected to come on in relief for the Dodgers at some point tonight he has come on the last two postseason in deciding game series so looking ahead the game's only top of the fifth right now\nTo one LA advantage and as far as the college football and progress that game on Fox TV has started the second half of twenty fifth rank Washington state\nIt is twenty seven to nothing cougars over twelfth ranked Oregon at one point late for a staff guys it was about a three hundred yards to ten advantage for in Washington state Vanderbilt mid

out there this wasn't like somebody else am any Machado he's not exactly Johnny hostile and he would just not take exception to it he's the one who said that about themselves the\nGuys I'm lazy so hey you know I'm not going to just give it is only a limited time did your expectations up by a sometimes that that plays off [laughter]\nIt's a hard thing to me it's hard to take\nPlace in baseball because it's so less so few action points in a game where were you when do they play golf you mean yeah between not having to do anything anyway\nRight [laughter] that's right like of all sports you write great point of all sports to take some plays off or not give maximum effort you have no excuse for the sports be baseball done none\nVisit football where you're a defensive linemen and it was a fourteen play drive and on second in seven you kind of took the play off the euro shortstop okay\nLike you weren't huffing and puffing you didn't run a mile when you were on the field and now you gonna run to first base and you're not going to do that come on come on\nYou because then it ought to haul game [laughter] do enough to know all about like when you have a chance to do something you should go crazy like usually so hell bent on any type of action that you put in maximum effort over effort\nRight yeah\nTotally that should be the case by the way speaking of putting an effort how about Michigan linebacker Devon Bush before the game against Michigan State did you see that reaches carving\nUp the logo at midfield hurt just didn't like the Michigan State\nThey were about ten minutes late in pre game warm ups the tradition they have they lock arms and they walk across the entire field as a team and Michigan was out there they're warming up\nAt Michigan State just walking through these Michigan players and so ... Bush had an issue with it and he's taking his cleats and just absolutely\nYou know and you say replace your David they Morales right he was creating dip it's at midfield [laughter] it's tough but all over the sporty logo I got to admit I kinda liked it\nI I Know it was Bush no pun intended it was Bush league Bush I like that as long as you back it up\nBan all good back it up what did you think about that\nAbout ... midfield rounding up the hell of a rivalry\nKnow what that means yeah you know you view late where out who warming up you want to walk through us okay I've got something for you\nYeah and I like I always say this it was before the game\nThere were sixteen minutes we're Michigan State could've taken out their frustration right on Devon Bush in Michigan it's a lot different than Baker Mayfield planting a flag it midfield after the game I just wasn't my cup of tea because there's nothing the other team could do All right do they\nTo find out fast one on your TV show to Fox Sports dot com Bert detail pass pass why\nThey didn't even have been [noise]\nGraham's everybody went way you can save money just switch the guy go go to guy could I comment the deed and if you could say Fifteen Years is that a more on car insurance and let's check you would just take it to sink or however my Lakers looked at my friends\nAt least not getting on every team's bandwagon wow your mind and Drake assigned to every team great intro music\nBy the worst and drank all my good you are yeah sure you're wearing a you're probably wearing a producer Jersey at home right now I'm not sure what that\nFor one day to it's under to eight minutes to go and the Lakers home opener the rockets leading one oh six one or two\nWe all know the Lakers don't have shooters on this year's roster in fact from three point range in the open or a couple of nights ago they missed their first Fifteen tries from long distance see three points shooting tonight Alonzo Ball Four of seven and I saw the rest of the Lakers for for twenty two from long distance so they're down by four\nAnd a for Houston Chris Paul twenty eight points James Harden with twenty five that's the late game yeah buddy and hard and shot like a hundred shot so far\nWell that's par for the courses now they both have about Seventeen shot today you know in this game and more to come down of course uh the open or by the way that the Lakers had on TNT Thursday night nationally NBA got killed by baseball playoffs in ratings this week however\nIn LA it got great ratings it's he is he's best writing in LA in like four years and in fact\nIt's the best national Laker rating for any channels since Kobe retired so that's something and it did start at ten forty five eastern time\nThe Lakers game at Portland on Thursday nationally got three point three million viewers the red Sox Clinton got about six point three million just for the record today in college football we had Clemson dominating its top twenty match up against NC State forty one to seven last year and see states head coach a complained to the rest\nFollowing last year's loss to Clemson saying he even wanted the Clemson team to be investigated for having a laptop on the sideline\nClemson said it belonged to the member of the social media team anyway you know how they hold up the cards on the sidelines right leg calls either ... one of them was a laptop oh they were only NC State to no end during that game today [noise]\nMeanwhile we had a division three records set in college football fifty first consecutive loss for Earl I'm In Indiana oh no team that hasn't won a football game in five years they were playing their conference champ of almost every year the last decade and\nGave up about five hundred yards and the first half in wound up

oh and Seventeen defiance of Ohio so okay now upset special and our for now is division three early like going the upset Earl him\nEarlier than I Do know defiance I mean the last couple of games that then I feel like they're getting better over the course yeah yeah they've looked good their their games are a lot of TV\nBy the way apparently it's uh eighty straight to the NCAA record for any division prairie view football yes Twenty years ago had lost eighty straight games\nThere was an article about a guy that went the prairie viewing the Columbia grad school that and see them much more than eight years old [laughter]\nAnd unknown about northern Illinois football you know there's a minimum attendance standard to be an FBI says so called division one football team yeah you gotta have at least Fifteen thousand average will northern Illinois listed there attendance for last year at a certain amount that would have been over the average\nHowever the student newspaper got a hold of an audit that said nope the actual tickets that they uh you know not tour these days but they they scan for entering the stadium last season actually fell short and the animal yeah yeah he has made northern Illinois\nBuy tickets enough to bring them up to standard northern Illinois had to buy back nearly two hundred Seventy five thousand dollars worth of football tickets from last season to make them still an F. B. S. program and reached the tendency minimum\nI liked that All right to say thank you very much to ours are written the books were cruises along tonight the power our covered up next we'll get an a week seven of the NFL wrap everything else up get you're ready for the world series here on Fox Sports radio [noise]\nMy name is Preston James I've been a stock options trader for twenty three years I used to be an active swing trader but that all changed once I discovered my money press weekly paycheck method these days I'm a passive trader hauling in more cash well being able to sleep at night than I ever dream possible\nI'm passionate about the market and I like to keep it simple\nMy methods are changing thousands of lives and I'm confident it can change yours\nBut let the proof do the talking by going to pay check prove dot com that's paycheck proof dot com you'll see a seven minute video revealing how my money press method grew a fifty four thousand dollar couch to one hundred and Seventy four thousand in less than nine months that works out to five point eight percent per week you'll see the proof right inside my real brokerage account\nThis isn't about overnight riches but once you discovered this for yourself you can start on the same path overnight you're seven minutes away from changing everything you thought you knew about trading and investing go paycheck proof dot com that's paycheck proof dot com\n\nI heard radio goes one on one with rod Stewart to discuss how different his reporting process has become over the years\nOr was it was a home protests was absolutely\nYou know 'cause ... yeah he's he's in the middle of the problem for about three hours to find jobs just to try and make it can mean when you come back to his next time he says\nHe just took up so much time and being studio you know my family and everything and the way we can live with moms from wouldn't see Kevin and we just two computers and many of you know\nThe coach sequins on trying to get back to him and he sent it back to me than we only went in to to to a few times was real drums on into the vote otherwise was moved down to Kevin house my house which is wonderful Pro Tools [noise]\nKeep listening to my heart radio for more rod Stewart and all your favorite [noise]\nYou deserve a better way to watch for ESPN by force and onto the show roaming\nWith the with the original and the entire thirty preserve\nAre often go fast hurtful here on the phone and I don't register\nOnline at home with\nMy family county board of elections by phone from pat on the phone [noise] performer I covered [laughter] mine's warm [noise] hope I ... off of hormone seven\nThree six PM weekdays starting Monday Anita were to actually see your ... jingle station\n\n[noise] Fox Sports trend being\nIn the late NBA game Lakers home opener Houston only leading one oh nine one oh wait at LA which just over four minutes to go there's a pause in the game after a scuffle on the court right now the NFL Championship series went to a game seven tonight and the Dodgers wanted five to one at top seeded Milwaukee\nI'm so here's what happened apparently there is an alleged spit on the part of ... Rondo writing at Chris Paul\nRight so that's why that whole thing transpires away did still no excuse\n... well ... it was it a purpose spit or did it just because he was talking in something came out you know what I mean there's it's a good question too\nI'm that's why cause you saw Chris Paul uh was all upset got bent out of shape you were wondering why he was all upset well now we do know why so um jeeze I I Wonder what the NBA how they're going to straighten this out the certainly going to be a lot of a\nLot of people shorts money uh and find after this route no doubt about\nThat yeah it was going to say too is that in the NBA I mean we've seen guys suspended this that and the other thing rarely do we actually see literal punches thrown we see shoves we ... we see the fake hold me back this and that you know a little slap here and there I mean these were full\nFisted punches by Ruy John Rondo by Brennan Ingram and who else Chris Paul I don't know who else I'm trying to think of who who happened with the rockets but does that often you see actual punches thrown that was different\n[noise] All right um let me get to some stuff on Twitter one next says really now you're going to blame LeBron James for breaking up a fight the wrong way\nThis is athletes think that the media is nothing but a bunch of want to be ...\nBy the way brothers don't use words like week sauce go sit down somewhere I'm yeah I'm going to blame a project for breaking up the the fight that way for putting his hands around Chris Paul and I said and and you know a sympathizing with him instead of sympathizing with your own teammates\nThat's what I'm saying I mean yeah and and so you want to talk about I forget what this guy said exactly as far as what's week sauce and what's not\nOr what what I Would say is you want to talk about someone that you know if you've actually played athletics and I don't know if this listener has so I Apologize if he hasn't\nUm but you know when you're in the the heat of competition\nThe one thing you don't do is have a friend I was with the other team and so I had no problem with the brown breaking up the fight as I said exactly but well yeah well if you're right John Rondo and Chris Paul just shove you in the face and now you turn around and you see LeBron with his arm around Christmas\nI I Want to be very happy about that I totally agree one hundred percent um groves says obviously you weren't watching the game with the sound ... started shaking my head well first of all we can't have this out loud we're doing the radio show so yeah you're not allowed to hear the game in the background that's against my waist and Joe you'll get shorter for that so I mean ... but\nI did hear what was said and that was well a crisp fall when he put his finger into hand in the run of space you said you listen to already Spaniard\n[laughter] yeah and it ... it with a heated\nMan it got very heated like that by the way by the way just one thing that stuck out to me out of all the punches being thrown the guy behaving the most normal in this whole situation was William Stevenson I saw Lance Stevenson was the peacemaker in the situation why what what the world are we in one's playing Stephen since playing\nThese the play maker or a peace maker\nThat's so funny because I just assumed that was him throwing punches I I had no idea my God that's probably Stevenson ... out there\nI was going to say by the way according to Adrian ... uh I guess keep Evander way who's the NBA's yes executive VP of basketball operates yeah he's demand that ultimately makes the decision on suspension finds whatever apparently he's in the building tonight staple center so we might get it\nGets kind of an interesting little ... there were no I got a better

off a World Series games that easy or do we know you walk tile no certain though oh\nI I I I remember two thousand eight and the last time I don't remember Philadelphia where we may postponed again and that would cause the infield was a lake yeah it was legitimately like a lake yeah it was it had to add on\nPoor for World Series there's too much on the line as far as who might the Dodgers pitching this yeah the games one and two on the road yes Clinton curse show I got the last three outs but it only took him Fifteen pitches to thrive night setting and Richfield did throw in relief of course the night before\nNot Walker buell or he pitched in to the fifth inning as two days starter and really just pitch last night so the ability of hill and Kirsch on one and two\n... by the way or the who's at the disadvantage if there's bad weather or cold weather I got to assume the Dodgers were the disadvantage\nYeah I Would assume so sure well wait a minute the red Sox hit with a lot of home runs also though\nThey would affect them but there are a little used to New England whether they ... the Dodgers when we got to the post season last year member again one of the world series at Dodger Stadium it was a hundred degrees the ball was flying out so Cory Seeger and the rest of the Dodgers had their home or is in the postseason last year and that wouldn't be the case in cold weather\nJust so you know Tuesday night partly cloudy skies early would give away the occasional showers later\nAnd it's all night games all eight pm eastern all the games of the world series and all on Fox TV\nRight ... thanks a lot to say or so we'll see what happens there I Love how you call in every one other than your radio partner to tell what you're ... you're in LA you know the good weather you know you're not a bad weather guy you know what I mean towards even though you went to Connecticut you don't know anything about bad weather anymore\nUh that's true but you can live in a middle aged horrible seem head yeah here seem\nAt all you can you drive and the snow or you a bad driver in this though\nI'm a great driver in the snow because I go like eight miles an hour yes let's say why yeah I drive the way you probably drive all the time or any or up to no no I actually always say I'm the one I actually don't mind driving in the snow cause people actually smart and cautious\nUm I don't like driving in the rain because people think that they can still drive ... miles an hour right at least when there's snow on the ground people are like you know what I should probably just just take it easy here\nAre you to try to go to a a World Series game out in Los Angeles if you had the chance\nUnless unless you can talk to bosses in a given me a re only the ... done done deal OK okay well look I look forward to my next paycheck and then I'll buy some tickets for game three\nPanthers eagles though or another month the game was eagles come into three and three ... a three and two in this one\nThe eagles have not looked all that great is I'm not going to say is Carson when's fault that's going to be ridiculous for me to say that they're not as good of a team and all that baloney\nThey've moved the ball it just hasn't resulted in so many points are Panthers Lucio they'll get back on the five hundred eagles can't go ... five hundred over the last year at home or a five point favorite a monster game and this would also I kind of like the eagles\nSo I went on the odd couple with Chris Broussard and Rob Parker earlier this week and we argued about\nThen if the east and I said I haven't seen a sequel\nIs life listen to the eagles since we can at Bernie's too so that's how I feel about the eagles I just think for whatever reason it's not clicking Carson whites is not back to a hundred percent miss some practice this week I Know the games in Philly but\nYou look at this Philly team and I mean not only are they sit in at at at three and three but a couple of those wins or on inspired with the falcons and and uh with the colds a few weeks ago actually like the Panthers I just I just I'm there's something wrong with this legal team it's just not clicking\nI Know we're on in LA now so obviously the people in LA very happy you're Dodgers are going to the world series of Christian Bale will get the first start for the red Sox and I want you to know something because I live out here on the east coast and we carry the Boston Red Sox at the local stations and I met in Vermont the Boston fans\nRed Sox fans or perhaps the most\nOh my goodness they are the most in title fans I've ever seen them my wife the fact that they've won a couple of a World Series now they feel like they're entitled to go every year it's like they forgot about that long drought that they went through and that accent would just kill you I Want to take\nA knife and just plug it into my ear drums every time I get a call going hey hey hey I Want to I I parked the car so I can I can talk to you about other ... how the red Sox didn't win every game should be for nothing against the Dodgers it's it's amazing\nAmazing no matter what happens bad cell gets hurt or no matter what it's the red Sox will go for no against the Dodgers I think the Dodgers got better starting pitcher right now especially because I'm not so sure how sales going to react you know yeah\nAnd I just think the Dodgers had that experience from last year I mean they were one game away from winning the world series last year I just think being there it means something I mean obviously I Know some of the red Sox have have been a plate at this level and you know a back in twenty Thirteen\nGive you something a little different put me in the mode we got a couple of picks you want to get to before\nWe get out of your eyes start with this uh Aaron I'm all over ... over\nI Love the way ... candidates brought over book the way by the way it last week [noise] getting victory over the bears the defense where he's not going to be nearly as Miami playing at home\nThis time us while we're at a whole week to get ready for this one I Want to jump on the dolphins plus three\nAt home and get a [noise]\nAll right my first pick you asked me earlier if I'm going to get up for the six thirty Pacific time kick off in London I Am not and here's why aren't you because I already know what's going to [noise] oh wow yeah you see the thing with the chargers is there the better team\nThere the more talented teams are you I just got a first came over [noise]\nUCLA UCLA was ... and ... oh oh oh chargers titans right right now so look everyone's going to point the titans eleven sex last week everyone's going to assume the chargers that great defensive line that they're going to dominate I completely disagree I think tightens bounce back my concern with the chargers they left\nLA ... weeks ago they stayed in Cleveland then went to London and they've been gone for a long time a lot of travel a lot of time away from home because of it I liked the titans getting six to that [noise]\nAlright Chicago Bears or at home coming off that was the opposite way in the patriots ten

but you know Archie you had an interesting take this past week about perhaps\nAnother agenda involving the raiders\nLet's take a listen I don't think they're trying to lose I think they love to make the playoffs the raiders\nSo it's not quite tanking here's what I think it is if the rumors are true and again calling talked about this on the heard this week that it that the Mac situation clearly Matt was about money there is a little known fact that\nAnd I don't have all the details on this to the decimal point but when you sign a big contract and there's a guarantee a portion of that needs to go and ask grow you got to have that money to put in the bank\nAnd let's just say and we'll say hypothetically allegedly if you don't\nNow you got to trade Mac\nAnd all of a sudden now the raiders aren't near as good as they would be with them so it's not so much you want to lose that you can't win because of your financial situation\nBut you got to get the Vegas where the financial situation gets cleared up how do you get there well you get there through distracting attention away from the wins and losses\nAnd it feels like if you like to me that's very possible\nRaiders will play a game next week at home versus Indianapolis haven't seen a look ahead line but I think what you just said is is right there are a lot of moving parts here [noise] yeah and you know it was fascinating\nSo listen we picked up three top twenty markets in the last month we've been on the air ... during the week just suck eastern so almost two hundred stations now\nAnd the day after we said that and just to paraphrase raiders want to win\nBut the fact they're losing maybe it's being driven by some financial trouble and if there is financial trouble what is the solution to that it's getting to Las Vegas because the raiders gonna be worth a lot more at that point\nAnd how do you get there if you're losing with the least amount of\nTurmoil least amount of distraction is you distract you created distraction where the coach that's bombastic that a media figure so in a in a weird way we're all saying oh my gosh I Can't believe Kearns doing so badly and what's going to be the consequences I think if anything\nThe possibility of this is why they hired grew into start with and the very next day Bernie the very next day\nGrooming went in the press conference and so that we're not tanking no

God Bless him he's argued bill I'm Bernie Fratto\nThere is a straight out of Vegas when we come and do you live from the guy go Fox Sports radio studios and I'll tell you a game I'm looking forward to tomorrow a lot Noonan visits\nA Chicago the past year either on two on the road they lost that Jacksonville at Detroit but they didn't have Julian Edelman those games didn't have\nJosh board and yet by the way a lot happening around this game tomorrow Gronkowski didn't make the trip you won't play obviously I understand ... is horrible dealing with an ankle situation\nBut we all know that when the parents go on the road historically they've had a lot of success and R. J. chronicle that earlier in the week let's take a listen\nI liked the pat Pat's are so good as wrote favors what's the danger of being a road favor you overlook\nYour opponent 'cause you're clearly better than the opponent that's why your favorite on the road right well the patch when they're favored by a field goal for more on the road\nOr Seventy eight percent straight up they win the game Seventy eight percent of the time\nGoing back almost Seventy games fifty three winners Fifteen loser straight up [noise] no team in the NFL is even close to that good as a road favor as the patriots as a real favorite why ballot check a lot of answers and with valid check\nAnd it makes sense why he's meticulous they won't let the team look ahead\nHas one of the reasons the patch or the right side against the bears\nAnd I brought what's your guys pretty good by the way if you're a ... fan you have to be happy that Julian Edelman is back I said two weeks ago on this show\nThe patch we're struggling on third on efficiency twenty five percent since ... element returned their third on efficiency is now almost fifty percent third twelve a twenty five but interestingly enough now ... there's an old saying if you had to agree only ... heads doing all the thinking\nAnd you're not going to get to better mine's RJ and ... the only two time champion hill now west gate super contest they had an interesting set of Ted on this patch\nBears game earlier in the week several listen\nI'm taking the bears what two and a half in this game RJ is all about the bears lost in the Miami Heat in my opinion being forgivable last week the bears were dominating that game until the fourth quarter and then the defense got gas and they absolutely got blitz and the fourth quarter and overtime\nI said what you're saying is everyone saying all the bears last we're going to undervalue them you're saying there's a reason the bears lost because of the heat in Miami and the fourth quarter\nIt did seem like the heat affected them that's you're saying okay the marketplace most people are overreacting to a lost that wasn't the barest fall which means there's value on the ... correct okay now I don't want to play Perry Mason but I'm going to play Perry Mason\nThere's such a thing called the look a headline we talk about that a good bet the look ahead line is you can bet next week's games now what's the point of that you can see what the games that happened this weekend how they affect the lines\nIf you would have looked at the bears and the patriots last week\nWhat was the lie New England was minus three New England was minus three okay interesting now you're saying okay everyone's going to undervalue the bears cause of this performance but the line has improved further the bears\nAre now only getting two and a half so if anything the bears have been upgraded not downgraded\nHey listen we're back live you might say why that tape cut off it didn't\n... I had no answer [laughter] okay I Will do answer and you're in no position that challenge my expertise but we'll see because the line has kept going down obviously ... new news right now it's patriots two favorite only by to one and a half and some spot\nBy the way this is and I'm going to be honest this is a prose versus Joes and here's how you can tell\nVoter pre game dot com click the game\nCenter tab and for free you get to see the ticket counter splits and the cash splits so right now live eighty percent of the tickets on the patch\nJust barely over fifty percent of the cash on the patch so think about it it's eighty percent of the tickets are one way but only half the cash and means the big bats are the other way so ... is with the other sharks here I'm with Freddie fanny pack\nBut I'm feeling pretty comfortable and I think the bears are bears are like that actor that was in a sitcom he's in one movie he looks pretty good now everyone's excited about 'em out take George Clooney patriots I I think the\nBears got exposed last week in Miami but to be fair the parents are probably not a deserving favorite Sunday is Bill Bill ... team their dream nine and one against the spread when favored on the road after going forty or more points and their previous home ...\nI hear yeah it's just a number is just not big enough burning I mean it it it's twelve games\nBut in in all fairness I'm with you or Jay I'm never going against Bill Belichick especially when you only have to weigh less than a fuel\nAnd I'll tell you this the patriots won that game\nBut they still have multiple losses this season as you said they haven't won on the road going to die\nYou lose a third game out of a you know your foreign three at that point I if the patch undefeated or if the paths only had one last I think maybe it could be a flat spot they don't want to lose they lose in Kansas City went what happened last week just disappears\nThis guy's pretty good but now they got 'em on film RJ and so the browns will it take a trip down to Tampa Bay and now that they've got this gentleman on film the question is might he gets them looks that he's not used to argue your belt talked about this earlier in the week if I were you I'd take a listen\nBiggest question to me and I've got the answer to this one has the defenses caught up to a Baker Mayfield I say yes get magically oftentimes a rookie quarterback will come in the defensive coordinators we'll get some tape on him as they like to say and once they do they say he can do this but he can't do that\nAnd they start making them do that may be may feel it's going to be able to pass the test but I think we're at that point where there's potential problems due to the way the defenses are learning how to defend Mayfield\nAnd I'm very worried about the browns and their energy level all those close games in overtime games early in the gear and now they play\nAn eighty two degrees well the beauty of it is though they get to go against Tampa Bay with Tampa Bay quarterback Jim is Winston and\nYou know he may be the NFL's next you're Marcus Rosa for all learn all the way he's going to you just want to hold on a second\nIf you start if you play even for one year fairly effectively you're way\nPast your mortgage dry might've overstep my phone [laughter] I keep a lid on it I mean I'm not aware that and fan and there\nAnd I do think there's some real skepticism or or rightful skepticism about how he played last week because the the falcons who the bucks played last week might have the worst defense and the NFL right now and because of that the stats the point total look good for Tampa\nBut boy I'm not sure if against a pretty good grounds de it's going to be the same though Tampa Bay open minus three favorite by three ... it's now three and a half at the big half point\nInteresting you're burning up I'm Glad you brought up the point about Tampa Bay defence because they were the worst in the lead giving up thirty four points to a game going into Atlanta last week and what do they do to give up thirty for once again they're defensive coordinator gets fired\nYeah but which is actually if you think about it going into Atlanta they've scored over thirty every game at home this entire season the falcon ... that probably exceeded expectations for ...\nLet me ask you a question because just to finish my point Jamie ... is one in ten straight up and his last eleven starts okay so this is not a stellar guy you didn't have brown and plus three and a half\nTalk about that argument we listen on our super contests we got Tampa and some some of it is driven by the half point remember guys it's all about the humiliation of half points is how you win at sports betting and there is no half point more valuable than three\nIf a spread is around three\nIf a spread it around three huh it's gonna fall exactly three with the favorite winning by that amount almost ten percent of the time you cannot underestimate how important that is\nAbout a minute to go in the show I'm going to throw in some quick bonus coverage the rams visited San Francisco their third straight road game RJ by the way NFL favorites and the third game of with three game away road trip through just foreign ten straight up\nTo and twelve against the spread particularly in division games if they were favored in the first two legs or their prior to games by the way the rams on\nThat next week [noise] against Green Bay I'm really not sure if the rams would find themselves looking ahead\nTo the Green Bay Packers next week I don't know if they do that in the NFL weather's another thing is the teens is not used to be in a jumbo road favor [noise] can struggle because they don't know how much they can take off their hundred percent of effort and the when the experience seems like the patch\nOr able to do that [noise] and [noise] to me I think the rams are in a real danger spot here I Do like San Francisco thank you I'm a ... that makes me feel good you agree with me because that's my favorite player today right now I Believe the rams are catching nine you could have got it at ten [noise]

I haven't seen any NBA stuff uh like I said I see a few Yankee hats which I thought was interesting but\nBut other than that you know not not really much else other than the people that you see here that are from either Tennessee here or you know Southern California\nNow you are a season ticket holder to the chargers is there a ... and are there are a lot of chargers fans out there I Know that's been an issue trying to get them to go to the games in Carson is are there chargers fans that that actually made the trip to London to go check this out and then you guys\nYeah we've had we've had a few on our on our flight over and we went to a\nA NFL slash chargers sanctioned a party last night like a ... party a and I would say there were probably maybe three hundred people there and they were from all over the place I mean there were people certainly from Southern California but we met some people from Germany\nWere charger fan and I say I want some\nBird you know there was a guy from walks in Bergen I did ask him how he said well he's originally from Australia and he grew up when Darren Bennett was hunting for the chargers [laughter] and and that apparently that was a huge deal in Australia and there are a lot of charges that Australia because the air and pet it\nAnd now there's like I mean Australian ... and then if I think the Steelers even have a Australia ... it's not that big of a deal you see 'em ... around a college football a little bit because they know to get scholarship but ah yeah it it is weird to figure out how someone becomes fat absurd gee\nThat's amazing I now have you run into clay Travis I knew clay Travis is out there you're also a part of clay travesty show here on Fox Sports radio uh he's out there with the titans have you run into luckily Travis\nNo I've got is I've got his number I'm going to text and when we get to the game because I Know ... ... and the stadium at the same time so it's kind of seemed like laws logical place to to meet up I've never met him in person so it will be kind of interesting to finally be someone\nThat you work with in London so uh yeah we'll see we'll see if that happens I'm guessing these sitting in a nicer place that but uh\nNow he makes a little bit more money than me so I get it\nNow and they already started to pre game is there a tailgate going on our people already ... drinking like bonding tens or like a ringing out ... in their mouth with booze and um you know I got\nI got the first pub we went to the guy gave ... why\nIs there [laughter] that's the only way you\nAre yeah I I was like are you trying to like is not going to react or what but no I guess not that's what he wanted to give me I can be whatever you want to give you a bug was amazing no I I think there are I think there is something starting up here in a couple of hours and the\nI at the time I said that's impressive a lot of people fold up a lot of people can't handle that I'm In the Atlanta falcon falcons figured it out give credit to the LA Dodgers they could have easily just said All right we got all that way we got to a game\nSeven and we we weren't able to make it happen [noise] and it said their back and so on and it's and it's good for major league baseball and that's not a shot at at that the city of Milwaukee [noise] but\nMajor league baseball's got LA and they got Boston that's going to do big business and it's a it's a big win for major league baseball uh what does it mean one guy go says just Fifteen minutes 'cause they'd be Fifteen Percent or more and car insurance beach probably should have gone to a guy go dot com\nFifth gene minutes ago so we're talking about the brawl between the Lakers and the rockets if you're just tuning in um\n... Brandon Ingram shoved James Harden he was bothered by what had happened or in a play maybe felt like James Harden was taunting or whatnot or trying to say that he was they count the basket on an end one\nI shoved them or they separated him then Chris Paul and Rondo started talking Chris Paul puts his finger Enron does face or they're claiming that Rondo spit name but nobody can find proof of that ... Rondo popped in with just a clean\nPerfect jab perfect left jab\nA couple of punches thrown but actual punches and Brandon Ingram came over the top and he popped Chris Paul while the fight was going on\nAnd I said to start off the show I I Know that it's not a good look I'm not condoning Brandon Ingram pop and a guy who's engaged in an altercation with somebody else but I'm telling you in a weird way he's gonna get respect\nThe knock on Brandon Ingram was always I\nSoft he doesn't have a dog in him he doesn't he doesn't have that that bike to um eyes a little raw he needs to bulk up\nNow you know he will throw punches now you know he is capable of it it's like it in in baseball you throw\nBehind the guy not not because you're trying to hit him what you're trying to let him know that you\nCould hit him that that's a possibility\nAnd when you get them thinking about that then you throw 'em off their game and I'm telling you and you can think I'm Crazy but I worked with and talked with enough athletes throughout the course of time if\nYou see something and somebody you just have to see a just a small you have to see for one split second if you see it you know also he's like that and um\nTelling you players around the NBA or going to look at random Ingram differently after something like this\nBecause that was always the knock on him he saw he doesn't have a dog in him he's not like other players he's not capable of this and now you saw on a big time stage not only will we get into a physical altercation but he will pursue the physical altercation and he will throw hands\nAnd you can call them a coward all you want and I get all that but my point is sometimes stuff like that actually ended up working out in your favor and the example that I gave you a ... metal door ... metal door nobody had ever heard of and then he\nCracked Jose but these are where they clean right hand a couple of years ago nobody's ever messed with drew metal door sense nobody\nKyle Farnsworth of the cubs relief pitcher years and years ago slammed Kevin Wilson down on the ground a guy for the reds who charged the mound and bloody to space nobody ever stepped Farnsworth afterwards\nLike there's you can change your reputation it doesn't have to always be by the book\nBut you know it's like bon temps perfect you can call them dirty all you want tell me receivers aren't thinking twice when they go over the middle and a game against the bangles\nAnd I'm not saying it's okay to do but but tell me receivers are thinking OK worst perfect at at least in the back of your mind a perfect just got to find like a hundred thousand dollars or something like that and I remember having a conversation with a guy who played in the NFL for about ten years and he told me man\nYou don't you're not thinking about when you take a helmet to the rib cage when you go over the middle you're not thinking about how much money you're going to make that game\n... guys minds now and I'm telling you Brandon Ingram changed his reputation you made a lot of like how he did it but he did changes reputation on Saturday Night she only stocks Fox Sports radio coming up next knocks locks

this ... and be and be honest about what you're watching nobody saw Nebraska being this bad\nNobody saw Nebraska being as bad\nIf they're terrible\nAnd Scott Ross comes up a week ago and basically blames the defensive coordinator or blames one of his assistance for what happened I I just\nLike people to attach themselves selves to to certain coaches and certain people get free passes and I don't understand why there was nothing wrong with bringing up the idea that a guy who was hired and brought in\nTo be the savior of reprogram who is totally under wound and under performed at his job\nThe idea that he might be out of that job after a year I don't think that that's unreasonable and and you know if you listen to the show at all I hate\nAnd I will never say that a guy should be fired I Will never do that because I noticed like to lose your job and it sucks so I I never played that game on the air and I never will but there are certain situations where I wouldn't be surprised if something like that were to happen and this would be one of them I don't think it's outside the realm of possibility\nBut because you grew up watching the guy and you saw him play football\nLike you don't want to say that he's he's bad at his job or that there might be potential that he could be in trouble and he might lose his job but come on man\nI mean Jesus I look huge fan of the Easter

S. in Milwaukee Cody Ballenger what they to run home run in the top of the second she was named MVP of the series while yourself we collected three hits and hit a rerun home run of his own\nIt's the same people the same place the same smell we continue to to think there's going to be a different outcome and they're never is why are we here that's the feeling when you pick against the patriots why you're doing it\nAnd it partly the reason I'm doing it is because I think what we saw last week in Miami is a game that we rarely see not only in Miami but\nRarely see in the world of sports or anything that could happen did happen in one football game and there were a lot of circumstances in that game that led to what went down and why the bears fell apart down the stretch\nBecause they go to Miami dealing with that humidity dealing with that heat dealing with that exhaustion and when did the bears start to get burned in that game by a backup quarterback\nThey started to get burned late in the game when they were gassed that they were a little bit fatigue and they were running out\nAnd still even in that game the bears had an opportunity to win it but it was again conservative play calling vitamin Maggie questionable decisions down the stretch and I miss field goal in overtime still they could have won that game so I think it's\nGoing to be a good one ah the bears are not fared well historically gets New England patriots but I also and something that was brought up and it was a brilliant point of this week on straight out to Vegas I heard on Fox Sports radio three to four Pacific time six to seven eastern time somebody brought\nThis up who to build ballot check just play a week ago\nJust play the Kansas City chiefs worded Maggie come from Kansas City a lot of what the bears do is remnants of what they do in Kansas City and if there's anybody that can take advantage of something like that it's Bill Belichick\nAnd I thought it was a great point that was brought up this week on straight out of Vegas Jonah stocks here Fox Sports radio\nSeven seven Ninety nine on Fox the phone number or you can also get me on Twitter at ... the Jonas knocks so it is Mike mayor our

job you can hear my car men are Fox Sports radio fantasy football insider with Dan ... every Sunday nine to eleven am eastern time [noise] you guys are going to get a football game while you're on the air how fun is that none none of frequent occurrence\nNormally you're on the other pitch so it's kind of exciting the chargers would some some opportunity here Tennessee like\nRebel was one of those guys you'd put up as possible coach of the year candidate all their lab we happened there last week happening as anything you've done to get any goodwill for a hard fought wins went out the window look I Know\nHe's a nice guy and all I Know a lotta nice guys uh Marcus Mario to stinks oh he was sorry and beard yeah whatever Laura a couple of years ago\nUh we we all drank a some kind of tonic yeah our wake it up with the the walk of shame and in London right now\nIs there okay the ... in Tennessee has been bad for games is there anybody worth a play that that's going to be kicking off here in less than four hours\nI think I'd put Dionne Lewis in as a back and number two or ... see the ball is a receiver out of the backfield beyond that I wouldn't judge with a ten foot pole now\nI'm chargers wise what are we got your office has been rolling but Melvin Ingram\nA there are a Melvin Gordon so I get the mail but that's all right we've got a couple of Melvin works well it's because I'm not sure what I covered Melba ... eh Melvin uh is it in ... in college in South Carolina so I get that confused I I have a soft spot in my heart to Melbourne Ingram who was the best\nPlayer on that South Carolina defense but it was ... he got all the pub and it pissed me off but never mind the way it works yeah everybody finds the favor of Israel do a little bit deeper that very ... very frustrating Melvin Gordon\nAnd what's what's the status of the plan is he not planning was banged up a questionable now what's going on\n... last reports still going to give it a go obviously will be monitoring that and we'll have all your last second uh updates as Dan and I get things going a little bit later but right now uh if you haven't uh Austin heckler was available and an awful lot of leagues for a guy that touches the ball as frequently as he does and it's been so integral to what they do\nA you're looking at him as a back and number two and if he gets a chance to play it is a fulltime role maybe that's the guy with top ten potential if he's the man so Gordon expected to go but this could also get lopsided to where he's sitting and and chill and having a nice you know lukewarm a Guinness before it's all done\nAnd then are they going to I Would think it probably maybe a bonding tens or any gross he I I Do like a body on Eddie Garcia got beer shame so Andy Garcia is a Fox Sports radio um\nAnchor here at office or you hear him every single week or on the bed Mahler show Monday through friday Eddie is in London because him his wife has a diehard charger fan\nAnd so

he doesn't play yeah who sees the uptick alright if he doesn't doesn't play I think based on what you saw last week and and I heard your reference a little bit a Bill Belichick effusive with praise for everything the bears did last week\nWhich leads me a little nervous yeah and that's usually when he bus yeah a weapon stick yeah uh but I have to believe that you saw with Albert Wilson was doing down field uh and they should be an investigation as to what the dolphins did with the injury report but we'll get into that another\nTime bald guy I mean that that was\nPatriots' Jew on steroids away

to one after both teams struggled hitting the long ball all series every single run in this game came via the long ball yes yeah we had it reruns shot well Cody Ballenger hit a two run blast\nAndy I'll just say real real quick 'cause I Know you want to move forward but I think it's I think it's a good trade off to\nGo through the motions I don't think he's taken like advanced like Stanford classes where and you know a combination of chemistry and ... ... we're talking like basic stuff here I think it's ... it's probably wiser\nTo stay in school go through the motions of school work right for the time being\nInstead of dealing with all of this stuff about leaving early and maybe not being a teen guy maybe being a me guide people understand it more so at the end of the season if you aren't in contention for a playoff spot as opposed to right here right now and just saying I'm Out of here I think it's worth going through the motions at school work to avoid that\nThat perception of your just to me\nHe's one of the worst rated starting quarterback in the NFL and because he plays for the Tennessee Titans a lot of it goes unnoticed ... there was a star\nOn the side of his helmet you realize what people what\nSay about his plate at this point Andy he will be getting crushed he's got more picks than touchdowns this year so far he had more picks them touchdowns last season what Thirteen to Fifteen touchdowns depicts it's just not acceptable in today's day and age of football\nHe's lucky place in Tennessee have you played at the age of marketing be crushed he's place will be\nGetting absolutely lambasted but nationally it's he goes virtually unnoticed nationally\n... you're exactly right and both teams I mean these two teams are going to different directions ties to straight they ... they were shut out by the way against the ravens the charges that won three straight and they obviously don't know if you want to count the Cleveland when but Lee was decent okay they be Cleveland last week so charges at one three straight ties laws to straight I think the charges roll them today I really do\nThey charge put up a lot of points today\nOkay so ah Andy ferman were just what a half hour in today like this you're going chargers minus six and a half in London lay the points you say no doubt no\nDoubt about that not not a\nBad you're proud of me maybe a mensch you made I mentioned I mean that's what you did and I appreciate that wasn't\nThe only thing I Wonder I real quickly the only thing I Wonder the chargers you know Andy\nWe saw it a couple of weeks ago they're hosting the forty niners first game without Jimmy ... ... steps in CJ bath third and they barely wins twenty nine to twenty seven so every now and then the chargers just absolutely sleep walk through a game\nSo I think it's more to do with that if they come out and they are focused yeah there are the better team they should beat the titans comfortably but if it's one of these ethics chargers hey we can show up and we'll be fine and they just aren't sloppy it yeah the titans can keep it within six I think so\nNo hope they don't have ... we'll see about that Brian ... from my life with a guy called Fox Sports radio studios now he's the first to do this and Ninety nine years and will tell you who is this the first of all guy Kevin favors for the latest\nHurt any Dodgers

R. I missed it and I are ready for this one because\nWe've got I I Know this game right now if I'm a betting man I'm staying away it Patriot's at the bears and ... obviously did make the trip but he's not really ruled out yet maybe is that a show up later I don't know but I got the line for you right here Chicago getting two and a half Chicago getting two and a half or you're with me on that\nYeah it varies from place to place if it's a half point I'm not gonna you know go crazy on yeah Andy I see it's plus years who again it depends on where you're looking at it exactly but\nChronic is not going to play man what is it going to do hop a private jet and be there for game time they have a rule them out yet but I honestly ... these tree it's he's not gonna play now\nAbout who the man is going to play as Tom Brady and why is the goat he became the first quarter back in the NFL is Ninety nine years to went to a regular season games last week when they beat the cheese and that was a pretty good game\nCloser than I thought it would be but there was a good game today the patch and bears baseless and overtime list with to your dolphins I was shot they're thirty one twenty eight\nAnd then this could be a good one you know without chronicles so this could be a very good game and you know what\nI'm looking I'm leaning towards the bears how's that\nWow look at that dogs are barking at Holmes as Andy for him and I don't see at the same way [laughter] I'm going to go on the opposite side\nBecause the patriots they're one of these teams that\nThey don't come out completely flat I realize Sunday Night Football game that was nice when at home against the cheap you know and there's a lot of attention and all that stuff but I just don't see them even without grants just showing up against the bears and\nCompletely laying an egg I don't see that because they finally got that often going there averaging just under forty points per game over the last three wins they're gaining four hundred and sixty two yards of total off cents each game in that span\nAnd I know how much you do Andy how much Rob Gronkowski means to that off sense but I don't think they're going to completely fall off I expect them especially with ... ankle injury he's ...\nI don't think that bears defense is going to just shut down the patriots\nTo the tune where the bears when this game I think the patriots the events has a lot to prove after laying Patrick ... and company last week and I think playing Michel ... in company is going to be a significant notch below what they face last week and that patriots defense is going to rebound\nThe question today I think it has to be the patriots offensive line I Know ... got a bad will\nBut I still believe that the offensive line is going to put so much pressure on Tom Brady who's going to be running all day long and\nI think that's not going to be a good thing for Tom Brady yeah he's got the received his back is that as a woman that just cause is doing a pretty good job taking some pressure off the running game as well and as far as ... concerned this guy's got nine touchdown passes and his last two games he had nine in his previous Fifteen he's come of age a little bit Michel ... I\nI like the ... at home if the game was in New England and I have a different opinion but yes ... and the bad we'll we'll see how bad it is today but they are going to put a lot of pressure and that's the game plan I gotta believe put pressure on Tom Brady get him out of the pocket and they come rush that she's got to do\nWell the patriots you know the Sandy they're so smart you saw him last week Rob ... was a block or most of the game it was amazing because\nHe had three catches for just under a hundred yards but he had one catch for sixteen yards until the very end of the game because he was in there helping to pass protect for Tom Brady keep them keep them clean you know so if you look at today's game I\nWould expect them to do something similar here you're they're going to use Dwayne Allen or they're tied and filling in for Rob Gronkowski either at either as a block or or what you're going to see you're going to see a heavy dose of James White catching the ball out of the backfield\nRight because they understand what it deemed present they understand what the ... defense\nPresent to them and they're going to counter it they're not going to sit there and play into their hand and say All right let's just do a bunch of seven step drops leave a let's go a empty backfield let's go five white out we'll just have Tom Brady fend for himself back there they're going to be smart about that\nSo I think you're going to see a lot of quick stuff a lot of passes to James White and you're going to see the patriots by design and by scheme\nHelp keep Tom Brady clean instead of playing into the bears Hans\n... and what you're basically saying right now you're talking about the experience against the novice that's basically what we're going to see today you'll get a C.

I mean they're supposed to be ... even if they don't\nIf that a woman coaching if they had no one coaching there's supposed to Michigan State Estelle arch rival school on their schedule right agree on that ah no\nOhio State is their arch rival but listening to Michigan State is a big time rival they've got a couple you can have a couple but I Would have Ohio State above the Michigan State\nRivalry is going to be a brawl on the twenty fourth and all that but\nI oh yeah but here's the thing man with with Jim horrible even if you run the table if they win eleven straight games if they beat Ohio State that would be a big time accomplishment but that's what Jim Harbaugh was brought to Michigan to do\nYou know there's no I I don't think that you can go over the top throwing rose petals at its feet\nJust because the critics in the naysayers have had a field day crushing Jim Harbaugh for not doing what he was brought to Michigan\nAnd the motel yeah it's too early to to give them the rose petals you're exactly right let's see November twenty fifth I might do it if he beats Ohio State and runs the table then\nWe'll see what happens in terms of the college football playoff where\nIf they win the Big Ten championship if they just run the table from here on out there going to have a really strong resume to overlook so we'll see if we can do it but make no mistake Andy that's what he was brought to Michigan to do and it shouldn't just be a love fest because they beat Michigan State who is not a good foot none\nNo I couldn't agree more and you know what that's what I remind was brought to Ohio State to do when he's on his face yesterday at Purdue right that's what it was bought for so and and I don't know how much money or am I ... I don't think there's economic ... but he's a good point about seven right\nHow are the ... ... ... ... right\nAnd that's why he's got a national championship in his back pocket that helps right Jim ... has been no work most of that at Michigan so we'll see we'll see it could be two schools heading in opposite directions so that that's finale at the end of the season man with Michigan\nAt Ohio State and they've had some close games in the past ... right there\nBut he's got to jump over that hurdle to get to anywhere significant there's no doubt about that\nRight and and if he doesn't get into the final four this year then I got to leave the heat will get even hotter\nIt really well because that's what they expect and certainly that's when he expects for whatever the reason I mean as I say that there was how much money they made that that was my point I mean money is a factor and\nThe more money you make the more pressure is on you not from you internally but from you because of the outside sources like the media the the alumni and the fans that's where it comes from\nWell yeah I mean sure but it's too it's twofold it's the success that he's had Jim or a bus had a lot of success we know what he did at Stanford got the three straight NFC titled games with the forty niners was a whisker away from winning the super bowl so when you bring bring Jim horrible back to his alma mater\nPeople expect big things to happen especially Michigan fans\nAnd then when you couple that with his paycheck yeah the expectations should be high and he hasn't met those yet so I don't I don't think we should get get after a Michigan State when that's all I'm saying\nBut I did I'm Sorry did you did a guy 'cause people ...\nWhat I like what do I think these people that are saying get rid of them get them out of there you are out of your mind like that is with us and knee jerk reaction where keep them worries that\nLet him keep building it he is good for that school and all the results have been bad where the you know the the fans want them he is still a fantastic head coach just kick 'em to the curb because you've been disappointed that's going way too far with the man\nPeople are crazy that's what it's going to say that if that's what they are Brian no Andy from will live with a guy go Fox Sports radio studios didn't get to us on Twitter at the no show and ... show at ... or if you choose eight seven seven Ninety nine on Fox that translates to eight seven seven nine nine six\nSix three six nine bought a barrel betting later this hour and of course in our number three the Sheikh themself Alex more of as far as sports radio is that if I live side or am I guy Brian no one knows picks these other than a firecracker\nBut that road to the playoffs starts today that's ...\n[noise] [noise]\nGoing on how big the to play one hundred sixty three\nNow waiting for in your city is a world champion [laughter]\nWe live the Boston Red Sox the Los Angeles Dodgers World Series coverage right here\nEven if you're a big time basketball fan there might be a few facts about the game you don't know why did you know that the first hoops were actually peach baskets or is that a war basketball is bouncy cold one or that players can run as much as four miles during the game\nWell here's another fact you might not know that's actually really helpful if you need to buy a car\nThrough ... also helps people get used cars that's right ... isn't just for buying new cars with their or certify dealer network nationwide inventory of nearly one million used cars you'll enjoy real pricing on actual inventory and a simple or buying experience whether you're buying new or use\nAnd withdrew car uses can see what others paid so they know if they're getting a good deal before buying they're also more likely to enjoy faster buying experience by connecting with drew car certify dealers\nWhen you're ready to buy a new or used car check out through car and enjoy a more confident car by experience some features that available at all states\nThe seventh Daniel full floor yard sales going on now with incredible deals and lumber liquidators we've got hundreds of floors on sale up to fifty\nPercent off in stock and ready to go save big on waterproof floors all on sale from just thirty nine cents get bored look laminate flooring all on sale up to forty percent off refinished hardwood and bamboo starting at Ninety nine cents plus special\nFinancing stop by your local lumber liquidators store or visit lumber liquidators dot com today\n[noise] and if there's some evidence from Medicare open enrollment than so now from time to reopen might look at everything prescription drug crimes and Medicare Advantage plans that insurers why because ... so ...

beat in the Detroit Lions lions play the dolphins thousands of foreign to line two and three list with the lions beat those Packers thirty one twenty three and you called it be no you called it I I I I thought that was a guinea I thought that game was it gave me but\nIt's not it's not Green Bay and it certainly is not Aaron Rodgers a full strays but still an old Detroit beat him last week you adopt as beat the bears and O T thirty one twenty eight and today the line on that game I have Miami plus three Miami plus three against alliance\nYeah and it's [noise] I mean really for a foreign ... dolphins team you still have to wonder which team is going to show up you know because they had absolutely crushed\nAgainst the uh the patriots that was ugly and then they followed it up again you're bangles and that was an ugly ugly second half particularly the fourth quarter to seven touchdowns given up yeah that was ugly so yeah it was a great\nJust a a unforeseen win against the bears with rock and roll Las ... back there\nBut they call a thirty one point man in overtime and he's back today against the lions\nAnd I always say I'm brought up an interesting point earlier uh we were talking and he's like why why are the dolphins underdogs here you've got a dome seen going out to just the the elements we always talk about the elements being the the wind in the snow and rain and all that how about the heat\nThat has a home field advantage big time the first couple of months in Miami and for a dome seemed to go there from Detroit also I Want to see how the lions what they're terrible run defense handled the heat in Miami Today\nYeah you're exactly right but I tell you what this one thing on the dolphins right now you could do about brought us well literally one he's replacing the edge of dry tannahill\nAnd uh it's funny because Saddam was put up their best off as a performance of the season last week with them yeah I'm not giving them any credit for that but they did but the one thing that office had the future hall of fame when they're running that Frank or I don't know how this guy does it he's averaging almost five yards a game I mean\nHow many years has he been in the league\nBut really I mean the guy it's like a machine he's on his way to the hall of fame and he's been on so many different teams but\nIt was San Francisco Indianapolis now Miami I'm sure he's still has it he still has it I mean I I'm impressed I don't think the guy gets\nThe the accolades that he deserves every once in a while you watch a game you hear in announcing but owner Frank or what he has done and the punishment that he has had to overcome all these years and he's still he's still pointed out he's still give the arch every game it's it's amazing\nI couldn't agree more you're right he was a third round pick in two thousand five\nThat's unheard of for a running back to duty as productive as he's Ben you're talking about\nIt just the running style really Andy is he's between the tackles he's no nonsense he's like the running back version of Tim Duncan you know\nYeah no ... you know Barry Sanders cuts but just productive man she went up yard age throughout his entire career and yeah he's under sold these still not among you know name recognition why look at the company he's around\nIn terms of career rushing\nAnd look at where his name's slots among the bigger names you you've got names like Eric Dickerson is a much bigger name than Frank Gore in ... didn't gain as many yards\nI think he's very similar to Curtis Martin you know in terms of name recognition Curtis Martin never got the accolades that would be on the same level as his career rushing total would you know it really wasn't there\nAnd it's amazing it really is and in the same the same token the less is less a degree of course under the alliance side of things golden Tate\nIs burning up the league and no one knows about golden tape and I know that doctors could stop and today he's had five receptions and every game thirty three on the year and I want to see if the dolphins deepest could stop golden tape because Matthew Stafford could have a field day today 'cause these ...

I think we're looking at the super bowl preview I I think things I had the last year the eagles the dark horse Super Bowl team I have the ravens this year I Love the ravens today and I think New Orleans is going to come out of the NFC and ended up in the super bowl the reason I like the Redskins or the the ravens today\nWe're all on to their defense number one there are top five reds zone often they can run the ball John Brown over the top Baltimore is surprisingly making good haven't been home in three weeks is going to be a big game surprisingly good over the top and in the red zone I think they control the same so\nThat yeah and that's a secondary for the St they're like mid range against the path\nThat right but I tell you I I like ... I'm with you at the end of the year I was like this is a dark horse Superbowl type to come out and see what the states I got that straight through what look at what you just\nDo an office of legal but I think they're going to do get that great deeper into the bar in the bottom of the hands of course they're not going to have eleventh act like they had last week and they're going to get a lot of the court screen filled with ... an interim hitting the ball very very quickly Andrew raises 'cause it was one about the whole time you're going to have a game plan to go get that DC\nIs one of the best of all kinds of fun fact he's he's oh and forget the ravens and the only team in the edit out he's never be he'd be the ... when he was what\nSo if you get the win today that he will be all thirty two\nTeams yeah I I agree I think I Would call and I I Believe the ravens when today you know ... you mentioned the secondary for the saints being average\nTheir entire defense and all the numbers are on the bottom half of the NFL right now and the other thing to keep in mind Drew Brees and and the whole team they've got to walk when they've got to play on the road they got to play outdoors I got to play on grass I think that will have a little bit of fact on this game Baltimore\nAdvantage or another team in the NFC ... focus on cabinet and Panthers are\nSafe in the south and they were all drinking the Carolina white coach pull a it last week lay off some of us came in Washington Ken what trade celebrates are telling you the Panthers trending in the long\nI'm a little bit of everything you know because I think they they need to run the football\nAnd I'm not just talking about with Cam Newton or ... and they have the wrote about she got McCaffrey vinegar on ten twelve terrorists but they ever gonna be the end a student who when he gets going down either bowling ball a butcher knives I mean he has topped the taco I think they need to use it more that would make can better just like Jonathan Stewart\nAnd Angela Williams did a couple of years ago when he got that it'd be P now you know but\nThere's a big ...

was the last year and the chargers in theory will play this year without Joey both so they gotta buy next week\nThe announcement this morning the boats and we'll be back the week after that that will change their defense second late I've been hearing the whispers all you know you and I've talked about it you know\nGosh I Love the yard for Kerry of this Austin that color guy\nMaybe they should let off color being the running back and use Melvin Gordon as the change of pace guy\nDid anybody noticed the difference today when Melvin Gordon is not in their heckler tries to take the lead role it doesn't quite stack up the same I thought Melvin Gordon lack of presence today was very clear and you see a difference the office look\nYou know I completely disagree really yeah because here's the thing Melvin Gordon would have had a rough day out there and probably would've netted about the same as us in Ecuador and here's the reason why\n... falls off the Patriot coaching tree the patriots take away your best game changer and so Melvin Gordon they prepared from all week\nHe was questionable all week long with this him each week it didn't sound as serious and then that picked up speed towards the end the week so the game plan was to shut down the run against chargers\nIf they're going to beat us we're gonna make Philip Rivers beat us and so that's why all those big score opportunities came off those play action passed the bombs because they were playing their inside line backers were two yards from the line of scrimmage and they were filming fast in heart\nI I I guess my point is not even necessarily in the yard for Kerry run game thing Melvin Gordon as we know a lot of what he does you could even make the case more than fifty percent of the damage is done this year has been in the passing game\nAnd it just felt different colors really good in the passing game too I get that but by the same token I it just did not look as dynamic the two guys they're both good they feed off each other only\nHaving one of 'em I might say the same thing if it was only Gordon without act color like that's been a really dynamic duo and it just doesn't look the same when they're not both there\nI just think when you have a team that's willing to commit so much to the line of scrimmage even allowed those short passes that typically Gordon will have an opportunity exploit or or Austin Eichler for that matter or we're just not available the tightened said if you're going to\nYou know you're going to be this with eight in the box and so that meant man coverage that meant stretching the secondary so\nI'm telling you if Melvin Gordon all it's not clear I mean if Walter paint and came back and play day the titans would have shut them down now you don't know that they're short they committed everything to the line of scrimmage and they gave up a lot of big plate okay the buccaneers at a certain time like at their own inch\nUh James [laughter] like the entire marketers even in the end zone right now burning down this\nWall is not the one this ball is well short of the one yard line\nAnd I think we're gonna have to say yeah that was just like you knew\nWhat they are going to try to run the ball off the lifeguard and the browser like not enough not to not been Brown's\nThere you go so they're on the board first there but lions get a touchdown Matt Stafford throws do is tight and Michael Roberts to get the first or the game they're the lions lead in Miami Today is that enough I think it'll be another ... games they'll know Ryan tannahill

right up by the way a way while you were you work for us\nWhy didn't the Panthers out the ball the eagles were in the red zone and then all of a sudden the Panthers off the ball and I'm looking at turnovers and there aren't any so what's happened\nDid they go for it on fourth again it's a field goal I owe it\nIs a field goal here it is a come on the way I said lack of can give us earlier why did the eagles go for it out from the fringe range where field goal might be acceptable you now have your answer\nFor whatever reason this year above all years I watch professional football the kicking game as struggled across all teams\nI Do not know why the the Fifteen yard extra point try cannot possibly be impacting the field goal percentage or there's gotta be something in the water I there was no other excuse\nYeah I actually had a feeling I was thinking about it because on our way into that\nOffer a period of time on in the car listening to the chargers and uh and titans on the radio yeah and the titans go in and score on the last play you know as for the goal they get the touchdown and your thought process as an NFL fan when you see that is okay tie get\nOvertime and the thought in my head I'm like well\nI don't know I don't know if he's going to make the extra point or not and the titans do you have a really good kicker but there's just one of those gut feelings for a second I'm like I Wonder if they're gonna if they're going to make this or not and then ... just like hell we're not even gonna try it\nLet's go for two and I'm not saying that the reason why you'd go for two is the kicking issues 'cause the titans haven't really had that\nBut I Do wonder if it's a piece of the consideration where you're like hey we're playing for overtime and we're not the better team so it's like Mario to versus rivers in overtime right hey being we might miss the extra point anyway hell let's just try to win it like the more you think it out\nI'm not saying you have to agree with it but I understand what my rebel was doing\nWell and also what was their hallmark when the seasons so foreign they dropped a three and four after the loss inland into the chargers they could've been foreign three\nIt was against the eagles it was overtime victory three times during that game they went forward on fourth down they went for the fourth time with ... minutes waning off the clock in time and that was that was really\nA turning point moment for the titans early season so I think they were trying to replicate the magic that they have they had\nA a couple of weeks ago against the eagles knocking off the world champs\nBut here's the deal are there are gamble as you can make and you can roll and you can continue with the hot hand like you mentioned jak Del Rio couple of years ago with the raiders bad that miracle sees them where they went to the playoffs start car breaks his leg the rest is history\nBut that's the deal you have to know when the hot hand ends and stop rolling maybe it's time for able to rethink some of these four down calls especially matters it moments that matter the way they did today\nAll right big third down an aid for the browns and look at that David in Joe coup perfect pass from Baker Mayfield enter into the hands yeah right through their hands and so the browser potted away and the baseball score continues three to to the box lead the browns\nAbout a minute forty to go in the first quarter there the bears kicked one that went through the up rights yeah so they got that go far so good at seven to three the patriots lead the bears and the bears are so interesting you and I've had conversations about their off that\nI'm Still not a hundred percent sure if it's a good all fits about offing somewhere in between siblings consistent they have three points on the board for basically has completed one pass\nI mean who's doing that in the NFL today knowing the ball down the field and getting points by completing one pass\nWell here's the deal also when you're going against this you know matinee you who falls off Sandy Reid tree and there's such a diverse a fence with so many weapons Howard Colin Burton ah Robin ... like they have guys everywhere who can do great things and now they have a second chance\nTo turn the page treasure it's fumbled the kickoff return and so the bears will take over at the twenty four\nYeah but leaning on the run game I it doesn't it doesn't completely makes sense these days but in a game where you're trying to control the clock to keep it away from a an ... and the patriots who put up forty to get out the chiefs\nAnd injured ... Mac on your side of the ball after that loss on the road to Miami I don't hate the decision time a possession sometimes your best off the roads are should say your best defense is a time of possession often than I think that's why the bears are trying to slow this game down\nJoined our for six yards on first down setting up second and for from the Eighteen were ... well again have the ball off to go right up the metal five yards first down\nI saw the bears knock it on the door just outside the tent yard line we will keep a good eye on that we have not said much about Sam Donald yet today are trailing against the Vikings seven and nothing right now and the jets have not been able to get much going off instantly until we bring it up\nBoom there was a long pass right down field that's got to move things into a Vikings territory somebody named cannon\nCaught that I always always my favorite one hour and half way through the season and someone who have never heard of who wears number forty or comes out and that makes along catch\nYeah reserve roll a backup running back could just rent a wheel round again man coverage of our sideline was able to come down with the long ball by Donald perfectly plays a a over the top of the man coverage linebacker before the the single high safety could get over there and make a play on him\nOr the jets and one in the old green today from head to toe and I I I don't hate it you know I don't in a row they look\nLike again I never ooh we got to buy coverage by the Viking got Robin ... and inside the Fifteen yeah just a just an out route that nobody was covering eleven comes into the red zone there for the jets and the Vikings are looking at each other like hey who had him yeah that's a problem\nHere's your busy rolling out and pass will be complete for a loss of one that's a very bears past play\nAnd so they'll be facing a third insects again they're inside the Fifteen yard line trailing the patriots seven to three um and also as you mentioned that Viking effects everybody looking at each other there isn't a group in the NFL\nI I think with with the Roman ... he'll be patient more patient given the way that the ravens often controls the ball and he'll make the most of the possessions that they have\nAnd hopefully be able to a score enough against these that's the parts of the league right now allowing only Thirteen points a game and the other side of that is the saints have the highest average points per game all kinds of like\nA show that that'll be the interesting matchup clash of those two teams but I I got the sense from talk of the Sean tightened up and they're not going to go crazy about they're going to be a little bit more conservative maybe more cautious on the road\nBreeze can't change things that

I I trust the decision making their\nBig third intend for Philadelphia once throws incomplete\nIncomplete there are no flags and that means that with two twenty eight to go but Panthers did not even have to use any of their time outs route this is what happens when Doug Peterson says oh yeah like I'm not conservative\nAnd an almost goes through a detriment they're wanting to run the clock they're wanting to South Carolina's time outs they do not have that they throw three times all of it goes for a net total of nothing\nPhiladelphia is kicking it away their up Seventeen and dumping eight game minutes ago it's about Seventy fourteen ... going to get the ball was to time I was in a two minute warning and plenty of\nTime and we got another scoring the Vikings jets game Vikings with TV is Marie from way out they just crossed over midfield that was about thirty four yard and uh you might have been longer than that he uh he rushed it in from from just beyond the fifty yard line they they were encroaching on jets territory\nAnd the jets random boundary blitz they were on one of the ... march to the left side of the field and\nThey just ran in inside zone playing that nobody left for contain Murray breaks it to the outside and nobody could catch him after he broke for it\nFor anyone to be exact yeah forty one yard touchdown run for the ... Murray they now lead the jets twenty seven to ten as we've learned this year don't give up on the Miami Dolphins\nThey just scored again this one is going to go from ... any air Mandela extra point makes it twenty nine Twenty one an eight point game lions about to get the ball back dolphins still in it six minutes to go in Miami\nNow it's shocking and and here's the other shocking piece of evidence from that game\nIs ... going Eighteen of twenty six one hundred and Ninety five through the air and two touchdowns no pigs she's been sacked three times so he's been under some dressed as he should be map Patricia old defensive coordinator from New England is the head coach there are now calling that defense and ...\nUh all of a sudden looks like he did when he was vying for a big contract with Denver didn't get it and got traded over the Houston and signed that big old extension there and then it was you know a game of musical chairs from there is traded to the browns to get rid of the contract and\nAnd so on and so forth he is now the backup in Miami do nice things in place of tannahill who's out with injuries are\nSo let's get eyes back on Cam Newton now who by the way after getting the ball what's gone incomplete incomplete and so briefly it has quickly become\nThird and tend to tend to go still out to time out so ineffective three because they've got the two minute warning only ten seconds away but if you can't get it first out it doesn't matter they're out there on thirty one down by three eagles up Seventeen fourteen here's Cam Newton out of the shotgun\nHe'll drop back throw deep over the middle and it is incomplete an almost intercepted\nAnd so they may not even get to the two minute warning or because it is now for us in ten and I'll ask you Richard this is interesting\nThe two minute warning sort of becomes insignificant here because if you put it away the two minute warning will hit ... and then you have to time outs you could think about putting here I don't think you will I think you'll go for it\nEven if you don't get it technically game is not completely over still three stoppage is of the clock are available but let's stay in the moment first jam note and out of the shotgun\nFrom his own thirty one fourth in ten steps up in the pocket hit his he throws bud completes for first out and now more down the right side line and in the eagles territory to the thirty for your line is Torrey Smith\nYeah you know it's interesting here the the NFL is trying to clean up two things one\nThey don't want their stars John off to each other taunting has been one of these things are basically ruling out of the game altogether and so now it's huge actions asking questions saying hey we're trying to protect these quarterbacks what he joined a little bit and you're saying these are equivalent penalties you doesn't like the offset their\nPatriots have a second goal meantime doubted the two yard line James why it's going to take the direct snap run that in touchdown patriots they're up to scores I mean time I Do think everything got wiped out flag wise is the browns did not move forward any however they will hear from another really good run\nThis one from next job who's really running while you're in that second half\nThe browns are moving into scoring territory first down inside the Tampa Bay thirty yard line\nAnd yeah that patriot score on the two yard line was a fly sweep Tom Brady actually took the snap was able to toss it directly in front of his body to white who is coming across the formation just will miss direction there for the score against the bears\nOkay there was a pie I call in Philadelphia that got Philadelphia way down the field and ready to attack to try to win the game but I Believe that get this let's look at the replay you tell me\nI think it's good I mean Carson went says been picked off by guess sue Eric greed and that's going to close the game out if indeed this dance and it looks to me like he's got body parts underneath the ball down\nYeah that's clean or it hit him in the vibe board and he was able to trap it between his wrist and his size as you is rolling over\nWhat to believe it was in his left shoulder and yeah no no point did the ball actually touched the grass there in uh in Philadelphia So I think the Carolina Panthers after trailing Seventeen nothing in the fourth quarter now have stormed all the way back and will tap this one off with three nice\nRight so Philadelphia one Seventeen to go now trailing Twenty one to Seventeen what I don't know is how many of their time outs they use they did not use any of them in that drive so they do have to time out up or whatever that's worth\nA you imagine here a Carolina is going to be able to then\nTake talk at least one snap away which would get the clock down do something like thirty thirty five seconds right so you got to get it first out yeah Philadelphia yeah yeah Philadelphia needs a touchdown a field goal won't do it\nSo ah so they're still going to be the first album is it's not a booth review minute for to go or keep you up to date meantime big pals from Baker may be able to David in joke who has got it down inside the ten but to play\nAnd they're still short of the goal line up for the brown so your columns third down I think that was Antonio Callaway the got down to about the two yard line checked out it was drivers Landry so juice landers out a lot of catches today not a lot of yard\nHere comes second go check that that was first out it was just to start your second goal as the browns try to tie it there at the two yard line next job in the backfield by himself now and joker will join them as the fall back play action Baker looking right now throws laughed and that's going to be over everybody's head out of bounds\nSo third down coming up\nDolphins in the desperation situation ... while they're trying to move the ball down the field but they're running a little bit short on time minute fourteen to go second and twelve now for the dolphins and they are just across midfield still awaiting for boots review answer\nOfficially in Philadelphia where the Panthers lead Twenty one Seventeen and we believe they've just picked off Carson went right in front of the goal white\nYeah they're they're taking their time on this this is playing what are you in a high school yeah but I I think read had the interception\nNext job gets the ball on Thirteen goal in his short short by half yard okay five Eighteen to go twenty three sixteen fourth and go from ... are lined you got to go for\nIt yeah you go you're not going to feel the wind the game no knowledge of deeds\nIf he was down and he was it was a ... yards short so here comes the force and go for the browns Baker may feel to get a sneak it they got to push 'em in rich I don't think he got a whole whole my God the\nBuccaneers hold the buccaneers have planted the flag right back acre may

today the angels named Brad Osman says their new manager succeeding makes social fellows\nI Love great stop let me tell you something about this Tampa Bay Cleveland game the buck stalled they punted the browns we're going to get the ball back they received the part and on the return they fumbled\nThe return that's why the buccaneers how the ball at the forty eight yard line it was going to be Brown's ball at midfield they fumble the park return with just over three minutes to go\nImages over time period and so it's a box that will get it around midfield they've got a second and then at the browns forty eight yard lied but keep in mind as James Winston does complete ... for about seven\nI'm Out to the sideline that to my ... third and two coming up keep in mind both of these squads have had all kinds of problems in the kicking gaming especially Tampa Bay today so I got\nCaught and sorrows missed two already that reason why they're in this mess to begin with the twenty three twenty three it would've been over and done with earlier how'd he converted on the last second kick\n'em means I'm the Redskins are going to strike first against the cowboys today after three it out\nFor the cowboys here come the Washington Redskins\nAnd I think it was to pre bibs was it ... it was a twenty three yards screen passed a capri believes he scores extra point guard Washington up seven to

service to snap set to throw why\nThey lose a thirty eight thirty one but you're being ski with a huge day three hundred and thirty three yards through the air to touch downs to pick anyone yards rushing out a touchdown run as well bears radio network\nJim shares the last name with the physicist Isaac but guess what he doesn't believe in gravity at least not today he applied high in Philadelphia\nDown and do the one yard line and her we most of those in those hot also touched down at the top of the ... all\nThe time we go motion and yeah and so the fact is we all know that they just want a football game how about a little exercise Nunes twenty five thirty nine to sixty nine through their two touchdowns and also you know he's dead and then with his legs as well average seven yards a carry seven charities for forty nine yards\nGuy might end up being the value pick all the entire fantasy season partially because all the way the patriots using but also because if injuries around him James White\nHe's got a second\nTrip to expand their lead\nBack to ... by the way for Cleveland pushing the boxes back out of Cleveland territory approaching the two minute warning there James wide forty yards on the grounds fifty seven through the air to touchdowns through the air as well patriots radio network\nEverybody was talking about the quarterbacks walking into this game bills at Indianapolis to play the\nColds for Bill lack of a quarterback in the cold or knew he recovered quarterback Andrew Luck but it was the ... out all the attention\nOf Marlin ... and he's\nOut\nPercent got in their little garbage time action he went for over a hundred yards Marla Mac it on the ground one twenty six one touchdown rushing through reception is one of those whip first tour as well big day from the second year man no\nDoubt about it while we're on the running backs rain a lot of frustration because Galvin cook just can't get healthy however the Vikings running game

right now ... those are\nThat's [noise]\nGreat news good way somebody switch the guy the guy could I comment and Fifteen minutes you said ... percent or more coming down on the car insurance [noise]\nAll right the buccaneers just want a miracle a Baker Mayfield is they are is a gift for the uh the wealth odd jobs like him standing on the line with his mouth just gaping open cannot believe about bill go went through\nThat's gonna be the viral clip of the day the Washington got a bumble from jak press got they've got the ball\nAt midfield already leaning seven to nothing at right now the ravens habit football still in their own territory I guess the thing is it a scoreless game but I have a feeling of is is that what things fantasy owners want to hear I have a feeling there's going\nTo be a slog today in Baltimore\nYeah oh yeah you know and and you could tell that John pain is gearing up for that all of their plays including they're passing plays were close to the line of scrimmage they're trying to neutralize vote rushed by getting out of drew San fast and emphasize the run game and so when you do that\nYou go a long drive their opening Dr went for twenty please they couldn't convert at the end they get stuff done for them to or actually they get stuff they fumbled on a pitch where that tastes in hell in there\nAnd tried to pitch to Mars so did not work out for them Baltimore's in suing drive a year in action now since the fence on the field and Washington getting going early against Dallas and that's exactly what they need to do Alex Smith\nPart of the reason why he's in Washington instead of cheese quote still is because he's not that type of quarterback who can play come from behind football right and so when you have a lead and you have Alex Smith quarterback everything's going well when you're playing from behind\nThings get off the rails quick and so seven nothing at home against the Dallas Cowboys division rival really good start for the steam\nYou're so right you can even just see it you look at the Washington team on television\nAnd from what a week and that's\nThe whole energy the body language everything about them is so different like uh I I remember seeing them are in the money that game against New Orleans where you know it was ... celebration and I and so that was just set up to not be there at night\nUh but from the get go you're like my gosh Alex Smith cannot complain to pass\nThis is this whole thing has just drab ... and there's nothing going on everybody shoulders are slop will go away they started this game against Dallas you got an early touched out everybody's hopping around everybody jumping around Dallas looks like they're completely out of sorts even though they absolutely crushed Jacksonville\nAll last week this is a great example of how momentum in the NFL regenerate every Sunday Morning\nWell and it's funny you mentioned Jacksonville that's another team that has to be a front runner or just teams where you have limitations with orange strength that quarterback like Blake portals hot like Alex Smith hot you absolutely need to play with the lead and you always play your best football with a weed whereas Drew Brees Aaron Rodgers Tom Brady\nPut them behind the eight ball in the fourth quarter they still have a chance guys like Alex Smith like for those you have to give them a comfy read and then all of a sudden the whole team looks better they looked like an incredible football team but as soon as they get behind things dragon so that lack of dynamic quarterback\nIs something that the Washington Redskins are going to have to protect if they're going to have success of the season in division\nAlso haven't mentioned the forty niners and rams are underway the rams in all yellows today and the forty niners all whites today so that traditional\nRed versus the blue and yellow that's all out the window and it looks like a color rush game a versus the opposite of color Ross it's all yellow versus all white or the rams lead this wide\nScreen it out thing and the forty niners looked like they did with that sort of last year which is good enough to stay in games but not good enough to win game\nYeah I agree with you about third again is one of those guys who is a really talented backup when he comes in the wheels definitely don't come along and you can keep the train car on the tracks it's just not it's missing the magic that Jimmy gee gave the bay area and they're missing him a lot out there\nAre brother great stuff as always week seven

nothing lead over the forty niners wanted to go in the first quarter\nWow what was the fourth quarter it was a seven in the late for the eagles\nIt felt like it was you know Twenty one or twenty or nothing at that point the way the eagles were dominating\nJohn laid out on the first five possessions through three quarters part though are thought they were interested twice for the call I don't think it's something that if you don't go rent both sides so an eleven minutes left to seven in ... and all of a sudden it was like a\nA you know the look of a switch and Carolina winds up scoring three touchdowns in the last ten forty one and it is the fourth quarter back in franchise history it was an incredible\nA front and Carolina wants or one of the game in Philadelphia Ross the three or four now they have to travel but was it on Thursday to play the jaguars next Sunday\n... let's talk about Philadelphia I'm a raining Superbowl champs a lot of high expectations coming in Carson when coming back from injury and there are three and four under five hundred at this point in the season what\nWhat is it did you see that they need to do to be able to finish these games being up Seventy nothing in the second half\nRight you know it's funny I mean three quarters they dominated on both sides of the fall\nOff instantly once was having a terrific day they are let's say a couple of running a giant Doris older course but uh you know once an jak or it's a big day all Sean Jeffrey has some great players just for the first touchdown some really nice cat just to extend drives\nAnd defensively they were getting the job done ... a couple of times in the first out than\nIt was smooth sailing for the eagles really three three quarters and then\nAll of a sudden the Panthers\nTurned out of the more than a couple of long drives and then um there was an interception at one point or create you know they called it back when the eagles were driving towards the end of the game but the charge a lot of the fence wound up doing a terrific job on the next couple of players and kept the eagles out of the end zone\nPick any you know when I look on the other side with the Panthers in one of the things that I don't know if\nI'm concerned or I don't know if this is just the way they are and that's the way the amount of Russia's even I've talked about this really the last few weeks and we said that\nCam Newton shouldn't lead your team in Russia is not as if this is college where the quarterback interest Fifteen twenty times he leaves I'm at today again was seven McCaffrey at seven as well attempt I mean is this recipe to win for them or can they finally get some more rushing attempts more rushing guard some someone else\nRight you're right and I know are we supposed to interrupt her yesterday it like to have a nice balance um that aren't that that's the case you know last week the cap rate\nWent through all four times I think on the first Rodriguez watch that have been able to carry the ball or it's on the rest of the game not to use them in a lot of different ways they're leading receiver catches passes out of the bill are they doing like also backed down three games this was just getting back and\nYou store the gambling touched down so that certainly um you know at at other terrific player for the afternoon game but\nAre they wouldn't like that or the bigger balance did have some nice runs today\nAt one point it actually had more\n... yards um than than passing yards was thirty eight rushing you charge for new one point\nIt only twenty yards through the air but um it was a profit on the fourth quarter you know up until that not much but I think the biggest playing the game was ten ... like three or four compared with the three and a half minutes while a completion for Torrey Smith a former eagle\nThat cup search warrant drive a lot for\nThe [noise] going forward um what\nIs it did you think the Carolina needs to do to ride the wave of success continue not playing from behind like they did today but\nNot only do defensively but alternatively\nYou know hitting on to the fact that they don't have a lean rush or do they need more balance or is it going to be moving forward the same thing you do you know passing earlier about running early been passing late to me it seems like a great balance moving forward is the way for them to continue to have success\nRight and this is actually the second story we're all five seven did nothing their throat Washington Seventeen out\nLast week but that was for a couple of turnovers straight or turned it over twice last week or their return over as the first out now in today's case it was just not a out whatever that drives up during the first five times but\nThey probably would like for that uh you know dollars with the running can\nShatter severely planted a you know here's the backup running back to the Katherine I'm Out of the yeah the ... all get along he was in on one of their touch downs but uh the fault and go this way\nThey ask us ever so they're starting to develop Kurdish Daniels a second you're out of Ohio State yeah the Russian touched down today a DJ more

Brees right\nI think it's a little different when the guy who comes in he ain't you people want to replace you with him right it is it different when you know it was the first round draft pick and

Jackson is Scott I'm going in the right direction they get they got to be tough on them though they've got a you know buckle down and realize that they've gotta they've gotta play as clean a game\nThen there's a lot of positives today's game I thought breaker may feel I\nBetter as the game went along I started to connect with Jarvis Landry that was a great sign I saw on the job of a second round draft pick and at a rookie running back\nHave a strong game so that's a bright future there so a lot of good things for the brown but they're not there yet they're still young and they're making a mistake and unfortunately they're paying for some of those are the stakes\nSam Rosen is our guest of course was on the call for ... bucks and just listening to me feel like a game is about to happen right now just listen to his voice said let me let me go to the other side of the winning side which the buccaneers this has been an interesting team I started off hot and\nRyan's fitzpatrick became fits magic and then all of a sudden it goes downhill and now you got\nJames Winston back and he didn't have a great game but he made some place down the stretch and they also are was able to run the ball a lot fifty five yard touchdown when you watch this team what do you see do you see the team that's maybe closest to the first ... team that's just struggling and it just may end up being five hundred this year\nI think probably close to five hundred because they've ads for the fences side of the ball which could hurt a looks like a journal McCoy might be out for a couple of weeks\nA quantum Alexander got hurt in today's game they'll know how how long he might be out but if it's a knee they\nCould be a while so they've lost the guy's a joy injury but they've got some good things going forward Jane rush\nOr started off the game he looked great he was hitting a every receiver it connected with ten different receivers in the game he passed for over three hundred yards\nBut he's got this little ... uh sometimes you make a couple of bad passes\nA cost of last week against Atlanta with two interceptions and it hurt the team this week at almost was devastating study true true interceptions today but uh they were able overcome it so\nAnd they still got to figure out what they want to do with the character at times cat zero wins the game with a fifty nine yard field goal it's incredible but he also just an extra point that story and then they miss a game winning field goal from forty yards out so they got to figure out what they want to do with him\nAnd speaking of James the the the thing we know yes the town that we ... we saw it in college and he's been in the pros\nBut the one thing and the one thing that can really do real talent in a quarterback in the national football league decision making with the football especially in the red zone like you said today he do for a bunch of yards but he had those two interceptions it put his team in terrible positions\nAnd they've been trying to work on this with this has been the ... the the point of emphasis for all of the coaches that he's had what\n... pregnant that'd be I Would have indications of the nation from Sherry than ours in ... school probably meal in a clean environment to learn\nTo take a moment cafe thank you to the E.

welcome and Chris building\nHad him in last week I happen to have him again Vikings that jets big win for the Vikings Chris how are you man\nI'm well how are you doing well on the Vikings we we were talking about this last week or with someone we were talking about the the Vikings being I think at that time it was ah was it three two in one way out of these teams that were that the four teams with that record and we said who you believe in\nAnd they were saying that the Vikings they'll they'll be able to right the ship that defense will get it right and they were able to do that this week for the most part talk about the defense and what you saw from them\nYeah they planned better they actually had a couple of late Anthony par every road guys are playing pretty well when you look at Minnesota oh they haven't talked about both thought\nIn his point was that it maybe it was this fall a little bit of much too late to deal with five things a little bit and they're playing a lot faster and play in a lot smarter than that given up as many chunk place\nOr so or alternatively for the Vikings Kirk ... seems to be the real deal or that team of galvanized in in in and just I Am he galvanized the team and brings them together tell me the importance of having you know a prolific parents are like him in that office to complement that defense\nOr a million dollars hoping it real real real [laughter]\nAnd I think he's pretty well obviously you have two guys like you and say that I'm feeling a for seven straight games over a hundred yards today that's a tough match up for everybody else that do that but\nUh they were able to get let's have a very ... a very narrow from Oakland is going to\nBe any nice game with a with a couple of long run and so they're getting a little bit more balanced early on in this guy's remember ... skin problems you know what I felt he wants to throw it down to a game\nOr what you're talking about the running game looking at la tape is Marie is he is he the answer moving forward or is this a matter of we can't wait until we get down and cook back I mean obviously the merrier\nYeah well go ahead opting out of the cook guy I mean he ... he can be a lot of the fact real soon this week though right you need a one day and I want to be and I think with caveats Marie ... than that perfect one be obviously stepped up late\nLast year is playing pretty well now they're a little bit more committed to run in football but I think when you talk about the album cook I just probably a little bit more explosive gave us a little bit more of a threat out of the ... as far as catching a ball\nLet's let's talk about ah the jets and the uh trials and tribulations of of one Sam ... ah he had the turnover problems in college you put a lot of balls in in the hands of other teams we're seeing the same thing happened to him right now in the rose through the ball\nYou attempted to throw at forty four times today is this a recipe for disaster is this putting him in position to develop bad habits\nWell well know there are playing with backups that receiver right ... percent only healthy guy at last prior I fell off in law\nAre they really are starting to get some type of threat is tied in with Herndon get out of Miami they can stretch it feel a little bit but when you're when you're moving a lot of law or even a nice red zone particularly for the past few weeks\nOr just couldn't get the ball out today you know when played ... book store on the football but I think Sam Donaldson perfectly fine\nBut they're also trying to finish the game with guys that were just brought up a crack squatters she works at the time and stuff that they're so\nSome of those interceptions aren't on sale because if you're a receiver rather to twelve ball's going to be high assigned a receiver some ... quarterback so\nI I think when you look at Sam's on on the east coast all the sides and the good quarterback and plus I think we've got three or four Keith drops in this game today but also hurting\nWell Hey Chris we're up against it so we got to let you go but we appreciate it and safe travels out there thank you you got it bankers and up next for the Vikings is going to be the same schools will get a a great ... of a last year\nPlayoff wherever war stuff on digs makes that he was boy that'll be a good when it you know what the

northern California the rams won at San Francisco thirty nine to tend to go to seven and oh Todd girlie to touchdown runs one touchdown reception for the rams guys back to you mad goodness\nGracious pickers are not a you know I don't want to be right now ... disease really distraught right now and I feel you I feel I'm just\nNow sort of kind of sort of move back out of the closet ... or ... with

going to get to get what you were just discussing and ... because I Do want to tell the people that we are coming to you live from the Geico Fox Sports radio studios it's easy to say Fifteen Percent or more car insurance visit with with a guy go\nGo to guy go dark comical eight hundred nine four seven auto the only hard part figuring out which way is easier you guys want to discuss I I guess going for the way it was what you wanted to talk\nAbout yeah I Do uh you you you brought up a good point mobile and you said you know you go for the tie or you go for the win right and not try to settle for the time you still\nHad a timeout laugh right what come on seriously go\nFor the win so I'm not sure how many people saw the\nEarly early game oh I Know what you're talking about yeah\nWith Tennessee and the Los Angeles chargers\nIn London across the pond but Tennessee drives down the feel they scored a touchdown there within one point of time the game kicking the extra point time again similar to this situation\nJason a ... a migraine my ... my rival\nThis as the head coach of the titans decides he's going to go for two he's not gonna kick the extra points for the tie he's going to run a to point play and win the game out right they did not\nThey failed they lose the game Tennessee Titans also game Nineteen twenty so I ask you in that moment do you think might very well made the right call for his team\nYes when before that specific team for this yes yes what about you a league\nKnow you got to tie it up you got to go to overtime there give a London fans a little more action\nOkay so okay speaking to hold on leaf speaking not as a sports guy as a fan and let's say that's your team what are you what do you want to uh overtime where you can possibly blow the game any way or just winning right now I\nI say go to overtime you guys to force that overtime see what you could do there you don't want to lose it on one play like that\nSo what you got to realize is let me set this up a little bit for you\nSo the second half of the game Tennessee Titans dominated right\nThey dominated they were able to move the ball at will they gave the chargers ... you know a trouble moving the ball so they were in in in farm control of the situation\nSo instead of tying the ball a tiny ball game up and going\nInto overtime with the momentum you've built in the second half especially in the fourth quarter they decide hey look we're going to go for the win right now on a to point play\nInstead of putting the hands of the game in the hands of our defense you know in the overtime\nI'm Matt instant I'm thinking\nI'm On the fence right because if we just this is a great conversation because we just got both parallels that the same time right right we got one\nInstance where they're going for two to win the game and then we have this incidents where they're going to try to tie to game instead of going for the win\nRight ... and\nThey both failed [laughter] they will vote failed but it's all about what\nSide of the coin ... my reasoning okay go ahead here's my reasoning why if I were in the locker room or mobile as he said a fan I feel like my ...\nHe kind of a can say that term he was a gutsy\nAnd he went out there and said let's go when is he a big role is they're scared money don't make no money right and I feel like the cowboys were playing\nScared to do this I didn't even get into the middle ... that was horrified [laughter]\nOkay who had or out left and steal twelve seconds on a client and you just saw and I have to keep bringing this up but you saw a guy was beating you before you saw a guy who's been held as maybe the greatest quarterback of all time last week Aaron Rodgers\nTo the right side still looking I was just rose up we'll\nLions that
