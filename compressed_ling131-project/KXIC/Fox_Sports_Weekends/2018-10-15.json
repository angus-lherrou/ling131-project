Peterson looked at ... he's he's got a great head of hair on top of the visor\nYeah he looks like a pineapple who who\nSome time [laughter] he looks like a pineapple\nWho's got a horse she'll Copenhagen and it's not out\nSince we're talking about is jobs modeling good job and I was sixteen worked at subway and there's you know sub where you have to wear a visor right okay my I had right here and the time but I'm not always the bread and our ... going hard left [laughter]\nYeah that's what I saw you know I I was I was a professional that was the rise of the team that was our job titles and I had visors and\nI Would obviously prefer to wear one ball then we're they're All right I think real quick what an artist is I mean that's what they go to our job title was sandwich sandwich artist [noise] that's what they do it on a job honestly feel like you're an artist beyond us a hundred percent no just felt like I was ...

bar after one of these games take pictures and send it to us so I can prove Brady wrong right\nWhat what is your expectation like what what do you expect to see if you're walking down the Newbury Street even though it's kind of a nicer area [noise] um\n... what would you expect to see people's stumbling out of the barge\nHall or not a lot of guys um who got so hot because the booze makes you a makes you overheat and they took off their cardigans they're wearing ... top siders and they're walking down the street in a V. neck and the top of the neck\nCaught ... caught portions of their bar

powerful the great to end the returning yes Steve in Maine to\nSay well you're correct it on the on the last one thank you and by the way Jonas does think everybody walks around Boston saying your job [laughter]\nNot actually I'm going to try [laughter]\nThe red Sox by the way at Fenway of just at a three run double off the green wants to in left field and so it's a five for Boston lead over the Astros in the bottom of the third inning it's five for in this game I'm not sure these two are ending at the same time and the red Sox game started earlier David Price the starting pitcher for Boston\nAnd it hadn't career post season starts yeah ray over six coming in but they scored five early runs for them and the red Sox down one oh in this ALCOA actually leading early against Garrett\nCoal online car shopping can be confusing not anymore with troop price from drew car now you can do the exact price you pay for your next cars to visit your guard who enjoy a more confident

four seven auto the only hard part figuring out which way is easier\nOr coming up in about ten to twelve minutes from now here on Fox Sports radio something you never see happen in the NFL involving a quarterback will tell you what that is here on earth I saw in twelve minutes from now\nSo they're going to be people who are going to spread lives they're going to feed you with crap they're going to feed you with garbage NBS over the next twenty four hours in sports talk radio and they're going to lie to you by saying\nThat the bears dolphins game was a great game [laughter]\nNo one was not [laughter]\nIt was a weird game it was one of the weirdest football games I've ever seen in my life but it was not a great football game that was a couple of mediocre football teams and nobody could figure out whether or not they want to do when\nThat's how that uh that was exactly what I feel like boats fan bases deserved\n... can I explain myself and fleas do for all the Chicago Bears fans and and you may be included in this I'm watching the hot star and all of a sudden was like no no the bears is this their year you know ... is the second coming of eighty five bears with Dick or\nIt all the ... um there was some thought that that that may be what this team was\nI think those came to a screeching halt watching how just inept at times they're often was uh the stress on the struggles that they had\nUm and and then for the dolphins fans you know they're kind of here's the thing that that are I struggle with with the dolphins fans there are some people and there's a there's a small select amount or die hard and they stick with them thicker than\nBut then there's the others who are just straight bandwagon and when they were three of those are like this is it this year we're going to win the apes he's were on top or number one right now ahead of the New England patriots\nAnd and that was kind of their approach then after the last two weeks rather like same old dolphins team you know throw throw in the towel season's over with right so they just have this like complete polarizing volatile relationship right\nSo this is what they deserve you deserve to watch that'd be drug through a terrible football game or honestly no one's deserved to win that game to search ended its high now you know I mean I'm Glad to the park he was able to uh was part was a party that was the other kid\nOut of another to Sanders editor who care centers of ... will calm Finkel re think will cause actually you know as much as why don't we just if we're going to get throwback to kick hers I'm Pete story on a bitch or who won the game for the\nLittle ... that is just a about that yeah that's pulling one from deep inside of family and\nIt said rented in the editing at a cab and it's not often I go that deep\nNo no [laughter] you're getting ... up a little bit but ah [noise] that ah yeah that no one to serve to win that game that was to hum average football teams [noise] but it does make the question what did you see ... what I saw I loved it I loved every bit of a man\nWell he owns the bears three and oh yeah you just read them now but he's three and three different teams like it's not like Aaron Rodgers owning the bears and he's always been with the Packers and he's a great quarterback\n... while there's not a great quarterback and he goes to three different teams any beat some every time and he was announced the starter like what an hour before kickoff\nMe no I I think he had a pretty good idea of it when they started sue ... report late in the week I think they started to prepare us while at that point they just didn't let the media and all that\nUm it did seem like a ... like he suffered a little bit of an ankle injury in that game and it seemed like it and you can speak to this because you live in South Florida playing football as a down linemen in that heat and it goes to overtime how much of a disadvantages that for you and you're not used to it\n[noise] it's a pretty big disadvantage I think it's not so much the seat that gets you it's just the humidity um and and the only reason I can kind of see the differences you know\nImmunity is what you feel you're suffocating like I always used to explain to people I Love training in Florida in the off season because when you go up somewhere I'm doors there's not as quiet as quite as high as the humidity and when you know you're in South Florida or your\nUm you know in one of those more human environments it feels like it's hard to breathe light like you're breathing and ... house to describe it almost as if if you've ever been an altitude and you've got upstairs or um you know you you had to you know climbs something and and you're all of a sudden like extremely outta breath\nIt it's kind of like that but you just you labor more to breathe in that environment so that's\nUsually the toughest part I but I actually kind of like the humidity because I always feel like it helped you um get warm and then stay warm yeah it wasn't as difficult to get your body warmed up to play um it just you know you get exhausted man if you don't stay hydrated that's when you can end up getting you know those little injury is here and there what they looked at it played an impact on them for sure\nOne of the oldest tricks and you've seen you know fighters do this and some people that try and get in shape is that do work out at altitude like they'll go to big bear um you know the train at altitude and the idea is you know it helps with the thin air it it'll help you get into better condition but what it also they're finding is that you don't recover as fast\nBut so I Wonder if being in the humidity\nIf you are able to recover faster and the recovery is such an important part of being in shape if maybe that just plays to the advantage I think everybody has an advantage you know the dolphins go play in Chicago in January ... or December rather\nUm you know the bears what happened at a disadvantage in that climate I just think this is a built in advantage for the dolphins and I wonder if we look into it may be similar to how we look at Denver when Denver plays early home games if you've got to start factoring that anymore because I think the adult industry you know at home right\nAnd in that case once heights are kind of dropped I think there was a bit of a mess caught up in front of the pocket and he just through the kind of a spot where Travers tells was gone and never saw it's our\nUm so this is now a touchdown for the New England patriots Sony Michel into the end zone and the patriots will capitalize on the turnover by Patrick homes but the homes last week was his worst game of the season they had a couple of interceptions now he's got an early interception here\nI I I look I Know that we always we tell ourselves this you know don't jump the gun you know let everything play out don't hype everything up too much don't be such a knee jerk reactor kind of person on radio don't do\nWhat we all did it we saw with the guy pulled off on Monday Night football a couple of weeks ago in Denver he was phenomenal was outstanding and it was really fun to watch I\nTo me the patriots having this extra time to prepare when you talk to guys in and around the NFL or guys that have played for the patriots what is it the ballot check does with that extra time that other coaches don't seem to do\n[noise] I I don't know if there's anything that he does that that different I I just think his attention to detail and how it goes about preparing you for these different situations um and and really attacking\nYou know one of the things you have to respect about New England that they do we can and week out is it's an entirely different game plan you know there's games with the run the ball fifty times there's the following week I'll throw the ball fifty times and it's all predicated on what they feel like your weaknesses are at odds exploit them\nSo to be flexible enough to do that and to be able to be um\nYou know kind of not running put yourself in a box you know it's tough to do some times that people want to talk about an identity um your identity wants to ... wants to be a football team that's able to take advantage of whatever the weaknesses of your opponent you don't need it necessarily just over a great running football team okay may become becomes predictable to stop right\nSo I think that's the thing that they do better than anyone else's every single week there's always gonna be some new wrinkle you didn't see it or you weren't prepared for that you have to make in game adjustments for\nAnd then they're really good at doing that you know it it's almost like a a fight you come out the first few rounds you're trying to kind of feel some things out based on what you saw before you went into a match\nAnd then all of a sudden the fourth fifth sixth around there there's something else has been thrown your way so that's kind of how their games typically go and their judgments are every single drive every single series there's gonna be some little wrinkles some little adjustment\nYou know Brady what I think of the uh the Oakland Raiders\n[noise]\nI think of a I think the autumn wind is a pirate\nI think of Savage joins during in from see\nI think of ... an organization with a rebellious owner winery I think of\nPlayers up and down the roster that may or may not have been on performance enhancing drugs\nI think of the violence and I think a full contact I think of broken bones I think of bruises I think of blood sweat [noise] the one thing I don't think of the operating Clinton [noise] it's I don't think of tears\nAnd there's some images going around on social media and I know we're going to get into the John ... aspect of the raiders and where this team is but there's some stuff\nGoing around on social media of their car who appears to be crying\nAfter he goes down with the injury on Sunday so it begs the question Brady Quinn you bring the quarterback who is played for many organizations and it's played for the powerful playoff bound Notre Dame fighting Irish I might add you Brady coin have you ever cried during the game\nUm I don't know if I've ever cried during a game um I Do remember I played three a broken ... foot one time in high school that was really really painful um and that one was probably hard to kind of hold back some of those emotions are but I don't think I've ever cried during a game no\nUm so what do you make of their car is he trying\nTo have you seen the image have you seen the video going around it appears that he's an old guy can be ... you know some guys handle stuff differently I'm not criticizing I'm just saying that's sounds like you're being critic I look I'm not criticizing it sounds like it'd be a bad look\nRight or just have been critical right well we're going to make everybody cry when we come back next has that [noise]\n\nOkay

radio\n[noise]\nFox Sports trending\nThe browns a year ago when he more than two games with Carson when's it doesn't happen\nAnd by the way how's that working out for ... yeah one on Thursday night but we don't know how he's going to be over the next five years when that's going to look right\nAnd so but but you have to call it what it is and the browns were way too hyped going into this game on Sunday but they've been too hyped and you can look at a just look at the team record and then we'll get Mayfield numbers they are average to below average all across the board and that's fine\nBut don't tell me and try and sell me on there the next best best thing we love the browns the browns are back no it's not that the browns are good they are just better than they were\nLike you you don't want a hotdog tastes great right after you've been eating dog food for three weeks All right it doesn't mean you're eating good you're just eating better than you were okay\nThat's actually kind of a lie I I don't know that a hotdog ever does good okay\nWell you had a dice it up a little bit you got to put a peppers and stuff like that on it but the point being I put some pretend like all of a sudden they've gone from there they are now flame and you don't know they're just to step up from spam it's it's what they are now that that's that's who the browns are and that's not to knock him at all and Baker Mayfield it's not to knock him\nLike I think they did the right thing in taking him number one I liked Baker Mayfield but if we're going to be honest here and and if we are going to call it like it is Sam Donald is playing the best of any rookie quarterback in the NFL I'm\nSorry if you look at may fields performances compared to Sam Donaldson Donald's plane better than Baker Mayfield\nAnd I think you could make the case that same don't has less yes they are made for a hundred percent so he's even statistically if at some point doesn't compare I think him even being close to a bigger\nGiven what each of those two teams has on the roster it's night and day um as far as that's how the browns have versus other New York jets so there there's no doubt about that and and and look Josh Allen who's going to have a hard time of the surviving without offensive line\nI'm just the fact that they've won some games is miraculous to be quite honest with you\nOr by the would you like to hear Baker Mayfield going on here here's old here's old bake after the game\nI'm at fault for the majority of the you know I'm going to be very hard on myself but we have to be able to look at this and learn from it has to be more prepared coming into next week it doesn't matter what's happened the matter the buzz you have to do your job each week or else I'm that's just the the nature of this game I'll be the first to tell you I'm going to go to work and I'm gonna get it fixed\n'em by the way out of the reason also why like the chargers to win this game a lot of people pointed out nah nah nah nah come on travel and all that way and they're the road team I got news for you to the row team at home to okay there used to being on the road\nThe ultra back baby they both are back Brady five sacks of Baker may feel they don't even have Joey boso yet this season the bullets are back\nOnce they get boso back I I think they're going to have a much much much better chance to make that statement my concern is\nUm they were they beat a team with a five hundred record ride the browns are two two and one coming into those yeah but they were on hard knocks right but my whole point is like tell me the last time the chargers had beat a playoff team\nLike honestly tell me the last time they've had success first teams with winning records I just until the chargers are able to be better opponents\nI just can't buy into that team because we've seen them be able to be five hundred teams are teams of losing records we've we've seen that from them if the teams that they have to contend with that are going to be the teams that they may see again\nIn the playoffs those are the ones that they tend to struggle with the regular season or they have those those God awful games again so I ah like I think it's difficult the situation there are there you know and having to place actually\nYou know sixteen away games but the bottom line is they just haven't really beat some of the the toughest opponents in so I'm I'm kind of waiting and be a patient so I see that\nSo basically what you're saying is that the chargers are fifty three Matthew Stafford [noise] that's what you're saying I mean they they're not being good teams that's what you're saying I\nAm just I'm I'm going by or a man that is a I I don't even know what to make it that's all right\nHave you I don't either I don't even know where it came from All right so ah ...

[laughter]\nOn TV in front of him and this these were in the days before the the score was always in the corner of the screen\nHe did exactly what you're saying for I'm not kidding three minutes he went on waiting for that channel nine to the Lakers score on the TV and they never did he had to end his update he turned the Mike off and just started screaming\nAll because it was on TV back in the day when it wasn't a when they didn't have the scoreboard up on the screen as a commercial right now he's\nGiving his Lakers were for he's telling everything about the game and in three minutes not

quite here on Fox Sports radio um so we're talking about this or John Gurdon situation in Oakland um do you want to hear a little John Gurdon post game and yeah you want to hear some of some good stuff from John Gurdon post game ... so we're dialing up a little John crude and post game\nI'm here on Fox Sports radio so we were able to get a hold of John ... or we will happen to make an appearance here on the show\nHere's what I Want to say about ... I I think that we over hyped the raiders\nAnd I think that we over hyped the raiders similar to what we did with the browns because they had been so bad for so long that when they finally had that one pretty good year and made it to the playoffs we assume that this was a team that was back and they were on the right track but let's be honest if you go back to that year\nA lot of things went there way they had the last place schedule there were a lot of flu the games I can remember the season opener at New Orleans a bunch of crazy place at the raiders one there were a lot of things that bounce the way of the Oakland Raiders and it was nothing that you look at it and go oh that's probably sustainable\nI Wonder if we overhyped Garrett car\nI Wonder if we overhyped I'm Ari Cooper I Wonder if we uh overhyped everybody on that team outside of ... Mac\nAnd I think that we went into this season assuming\nThat the Oakland Raiders last year was an anomaly they'll figure it all out and I think that we assume that this team was better than it was and maybe grew in is it wrong and walking in there and going yeah I don't like what I see here I've got a ten year contract give me some room to work and some time to work and I'm going to try and turn the franchise around right or wrong I think that's what he looked at\nI uh I don't necessarily feel the same I feel like this roster does a lot of talent and I think it's been a combination of things um between coaching turnover changes scheme um I think that's been a product of it they got some injuries to I mean obviously the you're on the lost their car kind of hurt 'em or do you they're going in the playoffs I knew who knows how to finish his out\nHow he comes back to the next year I mean you you'd never know um but I I don't necessarily see the same way I I think this is a good team I just think they've kind of been mismanaged missed handled in some ways to [noise]", "show_name": "Fox Sports Weekends", "year": "2018", "city": "Iowa City", "day": "15"}
