H. B. up in in the quad cities there's the play being set the field judges right in front of a sixes whistle his mouth is arms are out to his shoulder [noise] [noise]\nYeah [noise] wow [noise] yeah I can think of no reason why he aboard that at\nPoint that these Asian he's late he's standing in the back corner the end zone if somebody down they're calling time oh no no he's looking on the line he's looking at the ... yeah but the thing is is look at his motion oh by the time he gets his whistling realize what's going on in his arms flinch\nPlay started yeah but if he looks up the sideline we see we basketball officials have this conversation\nAbout time all it's all so OK okay\nBecause by the time somebody hollers time out [noise]\nFor signals to hand the official notices [noise]\nParticularly if there's a loose ball that's just been gathered in for example so there's a timeout call [noise] okay I see time out let me make sure their possession there is possession inevitably between the time you know second or two that all takes place in the ... loose again but you go you know time out in the granite and everybody's mad [noise]\nSo if he had time to see it and get a whistle up in his mouth [noise] supply hadn't started yet you have to call time out you have to follow through on that notion [noise]\nThis is a good official question for you officials had guys because I don't know I'm the guy that definitely yeah [noise] [laughter]\nI'm either on the sideline [laughter]\nWho stars [laughter]\nI\nOkay if you see the time out and realize that they're talking about regardless of wage started you serve the action so does that mean that regardless of whatever happened you know it was time out and you can blow your whistle and say hey they're already called time out several times you'll have to\nHave a bunch and like I said that trip says that translates on to the basketball court in my experience in that time out with the help ball situation for Lucille Ball situation where time out time out to sea monsters and you think okay he's calling time out that's whites you look back\nThe white boy or has secured position on the court [noise]\n... you know you get your hand to blow the whistle which inevitably takes a second tour to Yes sir and then somebody the opposing team goes in their knocked the ball Lucille by the time to get ahead of their blow the whistle it's moved out there which is that everybody sees it turns into happens after but I'm Still kind of looks like there should have been a time out called there now after Rick question Lou\n... Stanley was checking out of it that point that's a that's a tough question are there\nAny way you would have checked out of that full back are you guys are [noise]\nI don't know why would um [noise] 'cause that's like the most bona fides late in ... in in any play book nomad you're getting in getting in man that's what we do but um no I I take it back by the way I'm Sorry I asked that question I knew the answer before I say you\nKnow I I don't check out of I guess it would be a better question to me it had to be running late [noise]\n'cause he saw something going on with ... in a one on one scenario there I don't know if he's done it than on a quick slant or some kind of [noise] you know some kind of quick turnaround pass or something but I think he checked out of a running clay\nI don't know I didn't get paid [noise] to fans [laughter] this is just complete speculation on my part of that but yeah there's there's no food no way for us to know the way the\nDefense was lined up to me it looks like they had outside leverage [noise] my limited go way debate going to work no because they're they're covering outside lovers so you saw it over\nThe top there's going to be a guy over the top and then on the inside those slant without having outside leverage you're in [noise] except except when the guy throwing it you don't realize the tone [laughter]\nAnd then the guy that's covering in was trying to cover the slant and ends up being in the spot the through it\n[laughter] and then everybody just kind of knives their head as something now and\nMiscommunication [laughter] and then we move on\nSee I thought the reason why I thought he checked out of that is because I thought there was some you know they they screwed some people down in the bucks there okay and okay and that was when he saw that\nYou say okay we can't run the football you're 'cause they they they got something going on at random blitz as one guy's uncovered or something like that [noise] so I'm I'm a hot\nI hear you and we did not have enough when you kind of look at personnel and say okay do we have enough to block display affected me right you know what I mean and that's one of the things that quarterbacks are are supposed to do they're supposed to look at it and say hey do we have enough to run the play effectively right or did they stack that side\nAnd it could very well been that he saw that they stack that side it was not going to be effective we didn't have enough bodies to match their body\nAnd rather than take a timeout he killed the first plane go into the ... by running\nHot that didn't work out either well no because you know people just\nBecause people didn't communicate see there you go [laughter]\n[laughter]\nSay talk to me [laughter] and it's kinda hard [laughter]\nHey I got when you want\nWhen you want to blue flowers I just told me I guess that you want to tell them [laughter]\nYou should do I want [laughter]\n\nOh\n[laughter] oh boy [laughter]

the end ... analytically correct answer for him to say I'm sure he looked in his binder before he decided to respond voyeur really anti day Robert's not really are I Am but I Will say this\nListen the president in ... or the president in ... ball went back and forth there for a solid like two weeks\nI really hope the president ... because of the thing because that might be the only saving grace ... from this World Series is say what you want about the president but I Do think there's probably a lot of a Dodgers fans who agree with him on this particular evening\nRide or if you want to get an era of the score tourism ads thinking genius one I'm obviously Dodger fans are going to have to put this behind them and get ready for a game five tomorrow I'm no time to you know cry over spilled milk as they say because you got to bounce back in ... and you got to worry about the next game and and of course\nI'm you know you're ... you can now there's no wiggle room and this one you have to come back and unfortunately they have to go up against Chris Sale that is going to be a tough one to get on by he has been lights out for most of uh\nYou know the playoffs now he has had some injuries\nOr during the last month or so and ... and ... saw or is it going to be a good match up even though both those are coming with good erase what what was that injury that he had over\nThe last month [noise] um well one of them had to do with his shoulder and I think what'd you say not know the the the belly button ... I I heard that that wasn't a true story\nI I have to imagine it wasn't true oh yeah say though I I was assuming that uh everyone was on high alert for the belly button over the last week in Boston\nYeah no that that's not a true story but either way um I have to figure that the obviously now Red Sox are the big favorites to win this thing and I think there should be the favorite game five also though probably the better going well beyond that I'll see if I could find that when it comes up one thing I wanted to bring up to you and I'm not going to mention\nThe young man's name I guess I own a as a football team it would have thought about that\nAnd who would have thought we'd be talking about I own a football which we kind of are there was a young man on the I own a football team that's\nBeen suspended because he physically punched his coach\nNow we don't know the whole story he's saying that his coach\nTried to rest of them to the ground and they got to the ground he wasn't going to let a grown man or throw punches on him and hit him so he defended himself up surprised this doesn't that put a lot more considering the stuff we've seen the going on you know especially in Maryland and stuff like that\nYeah it up it was a basketball player and a basketball coach but I think the the the point still stands it's\nRight I eat it but I I'll say this army I don't know man I've seen too many of these stories where a kid claims he was done wrong by the the school the university whatever a coach whatever\nAnd we never get the other side and then when we do get the other side it isn't quite exactly the way that the kid made it out to be and what I found interesting about this was that I guess the kid\nWent before a school kind of judiciary board and they basically said that he was going to be suspended from school and he's not allowed on campus or through to\nThrough two thousand twenty so because of that somebody at the school found him to be in the wrong but I I'm just I I I'll hold opinion until we get the other side of the story\nAll right so that's the way so I didn't know I I I thought it was a football so I didn't even know if I I'm like I didn't even though they had a football team or my Arizona Wildcats scored they're not what they got on the ball team\nSyrup thirty eight\nOver Oregon right now ten thirty left in the third who would have seen this coming Aaron unbelievable uh that they're doing this to a top twenty team right now\nUh you would've seen it coming you have ... state in the wild cats I give you credit because uh I I Would not have had the same thing\nAll right two hours or in the books the power hours covered up next a and we'll start getting a two week eight of the fell off who passed away the Web their backs against the wall will get into all that a little bit of Lakers a little abroad coming up next year on Fox Sports radio\n[noise]\nBen Mather here this is a thirty second commercial and I'm going to throw a lot of numbers that you would please stay with me and just Fifteen minutes you could say Fifteen Percent or more uncommon\nInsurance this company has been offering great rates in great service rover Seventy five years and any time you need help you can speak to one of their train special is twenty four seven the company is guy go go to guy code dot com today\nSorry for all the numbers in five four three two one I Am out of time\nThat's when the Michelin Man is on your side helping you see veterans rights they remain wiper\nDesigned with exclusive smart like signaling must be Michelin leave much of a group\nGiving you a ... long lasting only\nSo when the going\nThe difference you can see bill ... when I was on another\nPhone which of these items would you want to consume on a daily basis anti freeze for ... house paint\nYou're kidding right there I think it's something that humans should not be eating or drinking the truth is sixty two percent\nOf medications purchased online are fake and many can be harmful ingredients so these are just frauds\nPretty dirty trick to lay on somebody you're taking their money and giving them as I Want to stay healthy not making a lot thicker\nAnd what do you think about this that is a big bowl of nothing many roadside so prescriptions with little to no medication that all the good news is you can find legitimate online pharmacies by looking for Don pharmacy in\nWebsites address I have got pharmacy legit visit they\nGot pharmacy to learn how to you and your loved ones can be certain medications you buy online course and [noise] a public service from the national association of boards of pharmacy\nYou deserve a better way to watch for ESPN by force and onto the show for\nJerry lower end you weekday mornings from six to nine one eight hundred K.

I mean if I had a couple of beers I feel lousy the next day for the show for crying out loud no\nI'm with you and that was the first thing that stood out to me it was not that they were arrested that not that they skipped that on the bill what are you doing out at four AM right there's only so many things you could be doing it for\nA year to make your a big part of senator up if you're a big part of the seasons across roads are now you're fighting for your playoff life your quarterbacks been bench you went to the AFC Championship last year what the hell are you doing\nI totally agree and I'll be curious to see when the names do come out who it is and if these guys assuming it's not a big\nName but we just gave it to read it to me it was on ... they released a they really stuff for the names\nOkay 'cause I was gonna say I mean there's some guys that I Would think\nThey they they should it be feeling too comfortable yeah you're right to bury church running Harrison DJ Hidden in Gerald Gerald Wilson but yeah\n[noise] I don't know man I I just think I Am with you is that it's such a bad look on so many levels and the fact that the team is playing so poorly makes it even worse by the way I Would say this last in the shuffle of this jags mess the eagles are a mess to\nMan right and and no doubt about that yeah I was going to say but obviously the focus right now is on the jags and\nYeah it it feels like I hate to use the cliche that dumb ruined his last that locker room but man oh man there's a lotta knuckleheads doing dumb stuff\nRight and what else to job on that store yeah I mean you just mentioned you know big big name players are guy you know it's not obviously not a good look what are you doing out for him or Ronnie Harrison ... like I just mentioned he was one of the guys he was actually their third round pick of this year's draft out of Alabama so you know you don't really have that much of rope as a rookie anyway and you're you're out doing

don't disagree that Detroit is probably better than people realize ... but are you sure that they're definitively better than the Seahawks I mean sea hawks that won three out of four now and that one loss was the game against the rams when they rice sickly had control that game\nI think it's a little bit more even than you're given credit for now the game is in Detroit but Seattle is coming off of by and I'll tell you this Seattle talk about it seem I Know this seems to be a theme with everything I'm saying talking about a team that needs a win already have you seen Seattle's schedule\n... from the rest out no okay so first of all the next five games are all against teams winning records they don't play a team with losing record of getting the lions charges rams Packers Panthers lions chargers rams Packers Panthers\nThat is a gauntlet and so again I think Seattle needs a when I don't know that they'll get it but I Do think they're playing better than people are giving them credit

yeah\nWell you guys there's a lot of good parties to get dressed up and go to a let's get back to the NFL because the Broncos are taking the chiefs\nWow uh the chiefs are ten point favorite in this one at home ... and a half\nThe Broncos we've already seen the problems they they've had\nI don't think Patrick homes as the next coming of bread far and Dan Marino all roads in the one I just think he's a very very good quarterback with a lot of great weapons around them all that being said I don't see the Broncos coming close to slowing down the chiefs in this one I think the chiefs just route them era\nI agree we saw this a few weeks ago in Denver on a Monday Night Broncos had him on the ropes and if you can't close them out at home night crowd all the things that went into that game when you completely controlled the game I find it hard to believe you're going to go to arrowhead and get a win them or\nA or a couple of other games I Want to get to a if you want to get involved it's real simple Aaron on this score tour as I'm at stinking genius one so we'll get to those are going to see a lot of people are are are ... ah let's get to the Redskins and the giants\nBecause the giants are pretty much a trading everybody off yep snacks Harrison is gone now I'm the one in six\nIt's hard to see the skull up at all over again after what happened last year the Redskins actually in first place and that division and foreign to\nThis is a perfect situation for the Redskins come up get a victory get out of town is a start off five and two and get a get a hold of that the first place so that ended up see if I liked the way the Redskins are playing um the giants at home\nWill they put up their best effort will they be able to score against the Redskins defense said quants Barclay has been good but not as great as I expected he'll have one or two long runs and then they'll have like eight or ten short ones so I'm Still waiting for that more consistency out of him but this is a perfect situation for the Redskins era\nI don't disagree by the way a your giants it's funny because it's all coming full circle now as Arizona plays Oregon\nSo many giants fans asking me about Justin Herbert in Oregon\nThat's the scary thing to me if I'm a giants fan\nI don't see that can't miss quarterback in this draft that I Know right it's yeah I Know it's early and and things will sort themselves out but there isn't and Andrew Luck or\nOr maybe a two and a couple of years from now that guy isn't there and so I think this thing with the with the giants I get what they did this week get rid of some uh uh some guys and get some draft picks and try to rebuild through the draft\nBut even if even if a you know you think you're not that far away and a lot of other positions running back wide receiver et cetera I just don't see who that quarterback is it's going to be able to come in and contribute next year\nYou got to draft one but I'm not feeling good if I'm a giants fan based on what a scene\nLet's get to the browns and the Steelers I'm proud to foreign one that's still not good enough for the brown fat they feel they should be like seven to know if you ask them Steelers kind of back on track still waiting to see how this whole uh situation is going to be with the running back with a James Connor and I'm\nLiving on bell I'm Still shocked the guy's not backing here I don't think it was going to go this long if I'm the Steelers I don't want them back I don't want to pay him any money I'm fine with Conor who's out almost five hundred yards rushing said someone costly ... one of them cause them in a tie against the browns\nNiners [noise] look biggest runner laid it out for us the public likes the Packers\nThe sharpest like the Packers there's too much money coming in on the Packers I think the rams I think that defensive line against Aaron Rodgers she's still battling that knee injury I think they get after him I think it gets ugly I don't think they can keep up with when there\nAre nine\nPlayers on the New England patriots that are going to be questioned vote for the game against the Buffalo Bills now granted buffalo is a abysmal team but\nI Want to get fourteen points with a home team in a bank the Patriot team that they're going to be pumped up the way I must be crazy give me buffalo plus the ... wow\nDerrick Anderson huh yeah

team can get what more than halfway through moving towards two thirds of the way through the season\nWithout necessarily playing more than a hand for meaningful gangs\nAnd obviously if the teams I lead almost every games meaning for eight they're going to try to win but these packed twelve teams you look at it in Oregon and said well we thought they were good 'cause out one game\nAnd now they're getting crashed and I don't think there's any sport\nWhere our biases are some ... or just more plain wrong then in college football another reason about under dogs that you think oh this one team is so much better than the other team often times we have no real idea and that's why the dogs I think in all sports\nAre best but especially college football\nSpeaking of dogs are home dog the Carolina Panthers this game started RJ the Panthers is a short favorite in the line has flipped but be aware\nCam Newton and company well they're pretty tough at home and earlier in the week you touched on that let's take a listen\nPeople don't realize how good Carolina is at home [noise] they've won eight straight games at home [noise] twenty six and six straight up at home so to me when you think about the great home field it's not often Carolina being discussed [noise] twenty six and six straight up is mighty good for the Panthers at home\nWhere they get it done last week baby in the Carolina Panthers Donald Seventeen to the super bowl champions beat them and we all know the week after you beat the super bowl champs RJ\nNot necessarily strong meanwhile Baltimore smarting after last week what are your thoughts so do you do have a specific training on the week after you beat the Superbowl champs we talked about it a couple of well yeah I think he was like Thirteen and forty one something like that again against the number\nYeah and I think especially if you beat them as an underdog which Carolina was in that game just they were I I like Caroline a good bit mhm but I'm not baton it\nAnd here's why and this is such an important point and I don't think I've ever made this point I straight out of Vegas is a ... like a world premier I don't think we've ever done that before the idea of a concept [noise]\nMore valuable than any video on MTV here's the concept\nIf you like a game it's really tantamount to saying the line is wrong\nBut if you say I want to bet who do you like best Sunday burn you Seattle I sew lines plus three is in a line drawn I where do you think the last ... I that's it in the actions of a handicap is a line drawn\nHere's the second part of it though you have to be able to explain why the line is wrong and there's two possible reasons or at least buckets of reasons one you know something the market doesn't\nLet's use an example oh this uh quarterbacks really hurt but I've got an inside info that he's heard a lot worse than people think oh they know he's questionable they think he's fine but he's not OK\nThat happens very rarely another way that you trapped you insight into another way you can be wrong\nOr the like can be wrong is you think there is a factor that's being ignored so it's kinda like something the market started counting for and I think in this case it's true Detroit is horrible against Iran Seattle has run for a hundred and fifty five yards are more the last three games each of the last three\nSo I think the matchups favor set okay there's one other reason bucket of reasons\nThat all I can be wrong which is there's public bias they love the patriots they loved team X Y Z so if you can say oh I get it this team just one on Monday Night football other team just lost there's reasons he buys that's why I'm getting value\nBut if you can't explain the line be afraid so to me why and I asked this rhetorically Bernie but you can answer if you'd like why the heck with Baltimore be\nTwo and a half obviously the markets have spoken I think they're more common rotted say that about any line that's ... that that as let's try it doesn't mean context of this I go in Baltimore smarting coming off all home loss\nPanthers coming home off a road when okay I think oh it's I'm speculating though because I'm not on the game\nYeah but what you're saying doesn't make any sense I mean you could make the case Baltimore losing makes them more motivated here but they have a perception\nBy the markets is that they are more motivated\nBut I'm saying I'm not sure that that's not a standard thing a team loses now if it's a great team they're rarely loses dollar check off of by or I'm Sorry awful lot you're right but that's not the case with Baltimore they're not a great team no but\nHow often do they lose at home not often they like to take\nThat was a rose or Ray Lewis now they're on the road so list and there was no ... no pro I've talked to can make sense of this long hair and that's why and here's the thing we know cam Newton's questionable\nWe know camp let's slow it way down we know cam Newton's questionable and to me I think what we're going to find out\nIs that come game day tomorrow they're going to say man camps does can we heard he was fine but he looks like he's not near a hundred percent that's my guess there's no other reason is line is Baltimore moving towards three\nA

to come you live your knuckle heads a gotten a little trouble um and and I understand they tried to skip out on a bill for players for the Jagger jaguars we don't know the players who they are\nThey been released as our best understanding that they're now in the confines of the team and the team will handle it internally the line is not the four and a half just line open modest three modest one twenty really smelly and four and a half but again\nBefore any of this happened or did you have some perspective on the jaguars in general earlier in the week let's take a listen\nJak last three games everyone knows they haven't played wow but think about how poorly the jags have played\nAge he asked means against the spread\nThe ATF margin is how far you either exceeded the spread or fell short if you add up to the last three ATS margins for the jags that tells you how much have fallen short it's by sixty five points combined against the spread in the last ...\nYears there's been only twenty four teams that fall on that short against the spread so this is a less than once a season of current that any team is this bad relative to the Vegas spread over three games you add in our borders and the discontent in the locker room\nI think it's something more than all the jobs are on ... street [noise] I\nI actually looked for really to bounce back strong here uh they're angry they blew a Seventeen point lead last week delusional mirror the super bowl defending champ slipping person wants to getting healthier and I would say that in my opinion the super bowl champs they lose it all in the following week eighty one sixty five against the spread the following week\nThat's fairly significant final thoughts are gee\nYeah you know I think you're right on Bernie Franco when it comes to when he came back a little early maybe not earlier than he shouldn't have but he wasn't a hundred percent psychologically a minimum\nAnd what we've seen what happened yet conservative if you're not a hundred percent you throw the ball way you don't run in certain spots all the things that differentiate when he's not a\nPure pocket passer he's fine as a pocket passer but if you look at the yards per attempt which is how far how much a quarterbacks going down field and how successfully\nBest game of the year\nWas the last game yeah Carolina came back\nSo you really lost really tightened mighty good last week now you got ... now you have Jacksonville distracted I like Billy though it's getting expensive\nIt is getting your friends do but I think you can lay the woods years first of all

the only hard parts figuring out which way it's easier uh so we do a a a a segment on the show called the care because I think that you were sort of fed a lot of stories\nFrom different media outlets throughout the course of the week that\nWill try and get you to care about stuff that really isn't a big deal\nAnd I have no issue column that stuff out and calling out the garbage when I see it I I honest to God do not care if it offends anybody it doesn't bother me for one second\nI'm just going to be honest about it and so we started doing this several weeks ago you're on the show it is fast they become one of my favorite segments here on the show where we just cut loose we normally do this\nOn friday night and the Saturday morning but with the the baseball game going on\nA yesterday that was seven hours long and all the craziness that was happening we have to juggle some things and move some stuff around because when something like that happens and we don't get a whole lot of lives sporting events at this time you got to cash in while you got it and so we tried to do as much of that is possible but would that being said\nDo you care is something we normally do then\nWithout further ado we're doing it now [noise]\nSo many stories in the world of sports than most of them are a complete\nWaste the DMZ reports [noise] let's get kinky here's\nSome of the big stories from the last week but Jonas the real question\n[noise] do you care [noise] so we turn it over to our executive producer Ryan then it's just going to fire these off and I'm going to fire him\nBack and we'll just see how we do\nAll right yeah you sent out a tweet a little but a little while ago us and you know right when the football season started he was an NBA headline you said I don't care it's football season and that's kinda that's kinda how this is going here\nIt's all started off earlier this week there were reports that the rockets offered for future first round picks for Jimmy Butler do you care [noise]\nJust I Love it you know surprisingly I actually do care a little bit and and only because\nI Am [laughter] I don't understand what's happening in Minnesota I don't understand what they're doing I get the team's offering you for first round picks why are you keep holding on it it feels like Tom ... widow can't let it go\nHe really thinks that he can mend fences and he really thinks he can get through to Jimmy Butler but if you have an opportunity to trade a guy and get that many assets I just think it's a no brainer why they haven't why it hasn't been done I'm I'm interested in seeing how it plays out whether it's a trade deadline deal and what not but yeah I mean this\nThis is so chaotic there in Minnesota and there's been so many rumors\nAnd reports that have come out of there so I'm a little bit interested so yes yes believe it or not I do care [noise]\nAll right for the next one here former Miami Hurricanes coach the golden boy our golden sues the school for three million dollars in what he contends it's unpaid settlement money do you care\nI don't I don't care about that\nI [noise] it is like why why is that even a story it could take care of that in court what does that TMZ like it that it doesn't the St Petersburg times have a section you could put that in who gives a rip whether or not al golden gets his settlement money doesn't have enough money\nWhen you go like I just I don't ... that the whole experiment was a disaster ... out golden salt at the University of Miami and the fan base has an unrealistic expectation about their team just move along I Do not care about that story next\nAll right hey speaking of fire is for the first time in the super bowl era the NFL has fired a referee in the middle of the season after missing with the week called a quote unquote blatant false start the league fire to Hugo cruise do you care [noise]\nI I actually do care about that story only because\nIt feels like that's the NFL trying to to set the tone that nobody's nobody's safe here man if you don't perform you're going to be out of here you're going to get ousted if you don't perform in our league and it just feels like ... if that's the case\nThen why wouldn't you done that with the other officials at other points that have also made mistakes like if it was that egregious of an air there had to have been something else going on a waiting to see what else happens from that story\n'cause there's also remember the same league who lost like twenty five percent of their officiating Cruz this off season who just decided to go take other jobs because they didn't want to deal with the hassle anymore [noise] see I Do care 'cause I think there's more to that story that's being let on next\nAll right so the U.S see trades dimitrius Johnson to one and I think for a while dimitrius Johnson was was it a pound for pound contender yeah yes so do you care Jonah\nI Do ... yeah I Do care and here's why this has never been done in the history of ... to where you've had to promotions trade fighters never been done now the two fighters dimitrius Johnson was number one pound for pound to your point in the world is one of the all time great fighters these and believe it will but he's really tough to sell\nBecause he's a smaller fighter and he's been so dominant that they couldn't really make a whole lot of money off and\nThen ask her and the guy UFC is getting in return is undefeated at as dominated his weight class for a long time and other promotions and he's already started calling guys out on Twitter I already started picking fights with guys and he's really funny he's a goofy dude\nAnd he's willing to fight anybody at any time and he's a really really really good fighters so I Do care because\nThese are two promotions trading with each other it would be like if the CFL and the NFL made a traitor or if there was an equivalent to somewhere they decided to make a trade it's a big deal it hasn't gotten talked about a lot but it could be the start of something major down the road for mixed martial arts snacks\nThe Portland TrailBlazers earlier this week they played their final home game before Halloween on Monday and many members of the team showed up to the facility decked out on their Halloween costumes several highlights includes some dinosaurs dead pool stone cold Steve Austin in my

twelve\nPosition and her cousins we celebrate her cousins around here oh he gets she's a punching bag for everybody\nHad a great year man he's looking at numbers Kurt cousins that a damn good year I mean he I don't know his fumbling issues are weird though it's a strange thing you have a question about what like who is the guy the old the old ... there was a Roman Gabriel used a level on and I remember hearing that like a kid who told me that yeah ... yeah but\nHe it's it's weird thing her cousin's just always fumble football like he's got an abnormal number of fumble Z\nBut if you look at his numbers he's played really well yeah like good for for Minnesota\nYeah both for fantasy and for real purposes looked at defense it's been a shell\nOf what was the right and he's had to carry this team throughout the season but as far the big question for for a lot of fantasy owners and wringing their hands over some smaller shepherds from stuff on digs over he'll five major today oh yeah\nThat was going to my next question for you my comment Fox Sports radio fantasy football inside of you've got Adam ...\nWho is the talk of of every NFL receiver discussion of both in fantasy and in real life because he's going for a record seven straight a hundred yard receiving games I Believe he's been six in a row are looking for a seventh or maybe that's what he's looking for eight yeah I'm so he's he's going for the record and he's been unbelievable\nWhen you have somebody like that who's got a record on the line how do you how to react to that as a fantasy owner because I can understand to two thoughts thoughts here you could say okay I I definitely have to uh play Adam stealing because I Know they're going to try and\nGet him the record but also wouldn't you think that would open up opportunities for somebody else if the saints also know they're going to try and get them the ball\nWell that that's just it right you're looking at the number of targets rolling through and for her cousins he's at that point where he's got to be careful 'cause he's tried to force it into the on a few times the last couple of weeks and and not for record purposes just when you got a guy that you know is going to catch anything are out there which kinda funny 'cause the objects as a national commercial\nWhere he's got stuff sticking to his hands and people commenting on it or so maybe you'll look his way and so he's a top twelve play again this week so I Would expect to see some fireworks to the guy that's been the forgotten men and all this\nThat Rudolph needs a little bit of love too he's gone under fed through the first half of the season so look for him to get right against the saints or the middle that defense\nMike harm and Fox Sports radio fantasy football inside of you can get him on Twitter at swollen dome harass him yeah other hammering it bugged the bleep out of him if you've got a fantasy football question at swollen dome is joining us here on Fox Sports radio I'm Aaron Rodgers has never been this big of an underdog\nIn his career at the rams I I think\nThat this is look I I have to bet the Packers just because the value is so great that you can't turn something like that down for last as\nWhat eight and a half I think it was right and eight and a half nine\nYeah ... is it is it nine points but even with that rams defense I mean from a fantasy perspective who you plan on the Packers outside of Rogers well you get\nRogers and you keep wishing and are you talking about play calling you just keep wondering at some point when Aaron Jones is going to get the ball yeah which I'm regular and and I look I I wouldn't you like there's a lot smarter guys that had been out of football forever so you know we we can laugh about Jeff Fisher he's forgotten more than any of it all Cornell\nBut the record is what it is a by ... you look at it a Packers team where time Montgomery was it a running back and make him the number one erasures that are Aaron Jones is averaging six yards carries since coming off suspension yet he's still in the doghouse\nStill gets only a handful of touches a game seems like you'd give him a little more of a push so I think this is a game where you you might have to do that to try to\nTry to keep pace and trying to keep\nOn Jared golf and company on this island do Cooper cup once again so you're looking at your job receivers is always cook some woods of feeling good ... dance to his two to three touchdowns an end Jared ... off\nOf fur on fire but for Green Bay Jimmy Graham still rates apply but you're nervous they're not getting the predominant week to week devolved a Adams is still a number two\nBut for fantasy purposes you not that lock step guide depending on your roster you might be shuffled down far enough to where he is the number three receiver for you or it might be a a decision to where you leave him out altogether but yeah it's it's Aaron Rodgers and pretty much a bunch of ...\nEvery week at this time we played a profit monster it's where random bats are presented to us involving the Sunday night and the Monday Night game it's a way for you to follow along because everybody watches these games at home so without further ado it is time\n[noise] so the show to generate gambling so [noise]\n\nThe [noise]\nFirst flash back to the Minneapolis Miracle shown during

the easy choice there Ryan Dennis fame here before Raul bourbon leave for next\nWhich do we see first in the game is to bond digs touched out a mark is William Smith tackle Kirk Cousins fumble or Drew

we're going to see a Drew Brees birth mark\n... going to be there to try to wipe it off I Want to go with the markets Williams miss ... [laughter] I was them\nThey're going to show breeze on the sideline before the game even starts therefore you will see the birth of our\nThat strategy maybe ... maybe I'm going to go a little different goes to fund digs touched it\nOh wow that's interesting a route bourbon Drew Brees next up\nA tree at bill [noise]\nNumber of bills quarterbacks to take a snap and the game over under one and a half\nI'm going the over man there's no way Derek Anderson finishes that game you know at the same way I'm taking the ...

C. S. opponent South Carolina state\nThey beat Florida Atlantic they rolled pit which is that the teams that win but it's nothing special the ride home about\nThat here Don conference schedule it can't be that bad when you play in that bad of a conference so I look at teams that are in the eight people ranked under them I Would have floored seems when the playoffs committee unveils the first poll of the season on\nTuesday I Would have Ohio State Kentucky whose beat in Florida on the road I Would have West Virginia I Would also have Washington state all ranked ahead of UCF\nOf them I Would actually ... even though Texas and Florida lost and they will be below UCF I Would have four teams that are currently under UCF ahead of them when the playoffs committee ... releases the first ball\nYeah and what a win for Kentucky is they beat the Missouri on the road Fifteen fourteen of combat when I mean right now Kentucky\nTo control their destiny and the SEC east they've got a big game this we played Georgia next week I mean there's a chance right now Kentucky could roll I mean I I don't see them beating Georgia especially I I just I just don't think they have the manpower especially with Georgia did the Florida yesterday but I I'm I'm very impressed with the ... Kentucky has done thus far this year\nYeah that's the biggest football game in Kentucky history next week hosting Georgia but yeah they've had a good season seven in one so far and a tougher road a much tougher road than what we've seen from UCF I Know people think it's personal it's not personal it's just I hate bad logic I hate how it\nTurns into this World Cup on let's grade on a curve and the bleeding hearts Sally Struthers tell us on you know where Sally Struthers dislike for Fifteen cents a day you can help these poor unfortunate kids that's how people act when it comes to UCS to joke\nIt is ridiculous looking Alabama people crack on their schedule they are at number now for LSU next week do you realize what people would be saying if UCF was at LSU and played that game they wouldn't\nStop talking about that game but it's cost over when it's Alabama it's just ridiculous you know one yeah\nI I've always believed that people should always stay in their lane and that means teams as well and I think that college football as well served back in the day when they had that one double A.\nAnd keep it that way you know there are certain teams that don't belong in the big leagues and the confidence of ACT American athletic conference would UCF in South Florida and Houston in Cincinnati Tulane east Carolina they do not belong in the same breath\nAs the SEC or the big twelve of the pack twelve there's just off but I made have let them in there\nIf there are four seats at the playoff table\nYou got to have a legitimate resume\nYou got to have a tough road you gotta have at least an impressive when you got to go outside of the conference and schedule a big boy Boise State did it for years in years and years I so this idea of all no one wants to lose to use the F 'cause it's gonna be embarrassing will Boise State found a way year after year after year to schedule an impressive opponent\nIn the non conference schedule and they don't Oklahoma ... UCF can do it they just haven't and I'm not going to great on a curve because they haven't\nSaid of course they don't have that hanging down to do it that is [laughter] I'd rather be on their own little way and say they want and then they'll start crying that they deserve more but you don't want to prove it that's what they got to do that to be an advocate\nAndy I Would be the biggest advocate\nIf they had a couple of big time when if they scheduled up in the non conference I Would be saying that it'd be like hey look the schedule in the conference is what it is but they went out and they beat insert this team and they went out and beat this ranked team that's impressive they deserve it they ran the table again I Would be campaigning for him\nBut they don't have that non conference when that's impressive they don't like\nTo see someone who has the the hanging down to defend them I'm here with the phone call at eight seven seven Ninety nine on Fox as you mentioned the number eight seven seven nine nine six sixty three sixty nine oil is\nAt they know show and we should act Andy for a minute or so I Will do that it's Bryan Noah's Sandy from all my life and the guy go Fox Sports radio studios in of course the lineup today Bronx talk radio at the end of this hour our number two bottom barrel betting on of course in a third of our\nAllies more of as AKA he's the Sheikh bucks plus radios NFL insider and Brian no it knows picks but\nThis is exactly what they waited for that next\n[noise] everything in the right so we've condensed it for you just walk fast walk sports radio dot com\nDo come on interviews with queen ... podcast at rock sports radio dot com\nRather here even if you're a big time basketball\nFan there might be a few facts about the game you don't know like then you know that the first hoops were actually peach baskets or the war in basketball is bouncy than a cold one or the players can run as much as four miles during a game we're than other fact\nYou might not know that's actually really helpful if you need to buy a car Trump Card also helps people get used cars that's right true car isn't just for buying new cars\nWere they're certified dealer networking nationwide average tore of nearly one million used cars you'll enjoy real pricing on actual inventory and a simpler buying experience what do you buy new or use and were true car users can see what others paid so they know if they're getting a good deal before by\nThere also more likely to enjoy a faster buying experience by connecting with ... car certified dealers when you're ready to buy a new or used car checkout true car and enjoy it more confident card by experience some features not available\nAugust they offer from E.

hours before the game against Philadelphia\nI Know it's amazing isn't it\nThe hype of letters for net being out Blake borders has been hideous they've been one dimensional not being able to run the football consistently they had all these injuries on the defensive side of the football he cut half of their secondary getting detained by clubs security is a mess over here\nAnd they do have a lot of those side they traded for Carlos ... running back\n[laughter] you know this Carlos Hyde mail is all that other stuff out no no no here [laughter]\nFirst of all I Would think that the night before I gained is somewhat of a curfew maybe I'm mistaken but I think that most of these clubs have curfews so why they were out is beyond me okay let's just give them the benefit of the doubt that the coach treats them as professionals or say get the better the normal hours so they went out okay\nWhy were you not want to pay the bill\nAnd I don't understand how you could run up a bill sixty four thousand dollars anyway what do you what are you spending it on ... that's\nThe thing that's maybe why the altercation happened maybe they're disputing what they actually\nBought you know\nWhere all the it happens where you have this club bill and it's outrageous and what are you going to do you just going to say no that's not mine and they don't believe you and it turns into this whole thing but never should have ...\nA lead up to a physical altercation right we've got to get the details but your initial point why are you out at that time this close to a game time\nYou know is that right but in any event\nThis does not look good for the Jacksonville Jaguars they've been out scored Ninety to twenty eight over the last three games and they're not trending up I'll say that and they're playing a desperate Philadelphia Eagles team that three in for the same record as the jags\nAnd they're going to be that much tougher to beat today because Jacksonville has made this came tougher on themselves\nOr I'll give Jackson but a lot of credit they did not released and they have no one knows who these players wore which to me I give them a lot of credit maybe if the game was stateside we know the names and maybe well it was in England I don't know yeah I didn't\nName it hadn't been released I don't know if these are the exact names but the names that were released those cornerback DJ Hayden safety Ronnie Harris and safety dried Wilson safety Barry Church um so that's what you have reportedly yeah those players were arrested for players you know for players were arrested\nAmazing

in total defense they've only given up about two hundred and eighty yards per game\nTo eighty point six if you want to be precise that's really good they leave the league insects with twenty seven so

opportunity there's\nAnd you also look at the weapons that he won't have he's not going to have Quincy a new law that can have Robbie Anderson so you combine all this stuff together as it got to be tough for the jets to keep this one close\nYeah and I tell you what last week the ... to the Vikings thirty seven Seventy and what's up with the Vikings later on but I think the Vikings have found their way right now they're starting to get on a little bit of a role and the bears gave the patriots everything they had but it was thirty eight thirty one but that was a pretty good game against the patriots last week\nRight and I also look at man you think about all the points that the patriots scored gained a lot of yards but a lot of that goes to gain planning and the patriots you know this and they just have a really really smart approach they're going to go up tempo\nThey're going to use that to their advantage to try to neutralize that pass rush to the bears we knew that James White was going to be heavily targeted out of the backfield\nAnd he had a lot of catches almost double digit catches against the bears last week you just don't have the same\nImagination offensively in terms of play calling with the jets and Sam Donald comparing him to Tom Brady right now is apples to oranges so it's a much different opponent this week and what the bears didn't do defensively last week I think they have a lot more advantages this week against gain grain\nNo doubt about that and I look at the jet schedule and the free ones are at Detroit Denver at home in Indianapolis at home so one of those teams have uncommon those teams will have bad defense is they really do and they're just rebel too exploiting those ... I'll tell you right now the bears defense is it a differently than opposed the apparently those teams are and I don't think the the kids are going to have\nAny chance of winning this game and you know you talk about what nine and a half points that's a lot of points right there I think the parents would be I think the best put up a lot of points to the against the jets\nYeah I agree with you I don't know if it's going to be what was it forty eight to ten [laughter] against Tampa remember that show lacking I may be that bad but I think Andy again you go back to what was it just last week against the Patriots' mark game plant\nThey gave up a lot of yard a lot of points to Brock ... and the dolphins and so we know that was in Miami the heat contributed for sure I think this is one of these games where you've got to see it before it happens you got to be proactive not reactive\nAnd what the bears defense giving up thirty one so the dolphins thirty eight so the patriots and I know there's a special team score with Kyle van knowing the black pond but still a lot of points given up I think that the bears the fence\nThey get a lot to prove today and when you're facing the undermanned due to injury jak undermanned dude roster anyway I think the ... defense rebounds and a big way today\nYeah I'm with your idea but I Do want to see some more Mitchell trip escape because several several weeks ago they were saying he's an ex Johnny United and uh he's come down to earth a little bit I Want to see a big game out of him if in fact he has a big game left of them that that's the question with him you know on a weekly basis you don't know whether you get an attribute ski\nYeah he's up and down he certainly is he's not a consistent quarterback he had that aberration game against Tampa\nBut he's just got to find more consistency you see the play making ability you see it almost every week\nAnd his numbers are bad on the season Thirteen touchdowns six picks past reading right at Ninety seven I liked the pairing with him and Matt Maggie\nThis is a game though where ... it should be like a given that he shrines and you can't say it's a stone cold lock heading in he should but he just has an earned the benefit of the doubt in terms of consistency the expectations are quite there because the consistency isn't it got started with just your performance against the jets for sure\nRight so we both agree is a bears game today no doubt about yeah probably I Know I Do live from that guy called Fox Sports radio studios let me set up what's going on here because

Seattle don't want to say it is it's a rebuild on the first two weeks\nThat certainly looked like the case I I think the carols done a remarkable job over the last four weeks and I think a lot of it can be attributed to the rebirth of that run game Luke are getting back four weeks ago has been a huge kick kick sweetie overlap guard and Chris Carson has been dynamic it running back and that's opened up a big place down the field\nPete Carroll's and a final year of his contract I kicked Pete Carroll side of the car wants to coach the\nDetroit when talking about the NFC East because of the game has done over in London Philadelphia one they got their fourth one of the season Washington the first place it forward to right now so this is an important game against the giants today\nYeah it is and I do like the Washington Redskins I think when you look at them and and how they've been able to play they've had a lot of injuries on the opposite side of the ball some really key skilled players they have not been able to score many points to beat Dallas simply scorn Thirteen points but that defense has been outstanding keeping score is now\nThey have enough I think when you look at the end of the east than and where that might go\nAnd what it will take the wind that they could do that but I I worry about when you consider the other contenders within the ... are within the conference or the rams the saint\nAmong those two candidates for the kind of point that it takes to really win if you want are able to get into the postseason I I'm not so sure they're gonna have enough\n... you look at their own and you look at the giants and Michael no offense but they have a couple of players as good as anybody in the league\nBut you look at their team you know the opposite you line it was horrible and it still horrible airline manning he's taking tax on dos now I mean they'll come close to him and there's a breeze and he goes down and and so they're having a problem they trade away one of the best\nStuff first in the entire league with snacks Harrison and\nThat sends a message to the players\nPlayers are saying now hey we're not run away with right away one of our best players so it's all about stats and my future rather than winning games\nI'm Glad choice between us today [laughter]\nWere reading through it\nBut I I I really I Can't argue with you and and the difference is Kurt in an hour you're talking about Seattle been rebuilding phase the giants and a lot of weight had enough town of what they said they weren't quite rebuilding but with these trains it seems like they're going that route especially when you get ... to one of the best one stop and then the league for fifth round ... yeah I don't understand\nAt a loss for that anytime you have a new coach or when you're moving game but at the drive to want to fix now\nAt least be competitive I think that the disturbing thing this lifting with talent ... is a competitive on Sunday which team they should be that's more concerning to me than than anything with her after he line just give it some time he doesn't have time but that up and throw one\nMore game but it's a pretty big win

everyone is now still struggling to exactly get\nA get put a finger on exactly what it is we know he brings great energy yes we know he's incredibly watch a ball and tell them sort of finger on it a

Lindsey TD yeah sorry to interrupt\nThere going forward on fourth and going from a woman fumbled the snap but of flags first so I now probably a field goal for the cheese but go ahead if\nKansas City chiefs for the moment score lesson down close you mentioned the Redskins tedious seven nothing at the giants with under three minutes to go in the first quarter Alex Smith seven of eight passing fifty four yards and the touchdown\nBrown still three nothing leaders that Pittsburgh and the first end of the first quarter already at Detroit Lions seven nothing over the Seahawks Matthew Stafford TD pass to Marvin Jones\nIs box at bangles scoreless late first game is Winston an interception into the end zone bears with that said nothing lead over the jets late first Mitchell Trybulski what the long touchdown pass on the catch in around Seventy yards to recall on ravens with seven nothing lead at Carolina late first Alex calling the touchdown\nAnd yes the new college football pools do come out today the first college football rankings are released on Tuesday the Cleveland Cavaliers fire coach to run Lou after it oh insect start assistant Larry Drew reportedly takes over for NBA games today Golden State at five and one will be at Brooklyn five pm eastern time\nDon't forget it's not only game five of the world series tonight if necessary a game six at Boston on Tuesday and then Chris Sale will start but its price tonight guys\nAll right ... thanks so much we're going to keep it NFL but can I this viral thirty second please falling thirty seconds here senator yeah the floor I I for anybody and I'm pretty much done with it I think most people are but if anybody out there is still haven't go abroad and M. J. conversation\nCan we add this aspect into it\nWhat what happens to franchise when LeBron just leaves they can't win a game of coaches fired in five games yeah oh I Know it's just said a six games Alex just said they're trying to sell tickets for two dollars in Cleveland and people are buying them I mean if you go from NBA Finals\nTo the ... yeah I I mean because one guy switch cities it is on being leave all his foot read his footprint is larger than any athlete in history period\nWell look I mean he beat the raptors in four games and I say he because as long as there was a rag tag good around them and then he won the eastern conference finals uh after battling through the Pacers ... and I really I I feel like it was him he was the driving force he was the wrecking ball and he goes five games with the warriors\nLook what Brian is this league right now the MBA goes as he does and the super team idea works with the warriors but they're getting older to anybody who's saying that this is a lopsided we again you you know it's it's it's easy to forecast is going to be in the finals every year and that's bad for the sport\nI mean it nobody was complaining about Lakers boss and nobody was complaining about Jordan or in his heyday ratings\nDon't tell that story you raise is going up you know\nLeBron's good for the sport it's just he's he's not good for the team he leave about what that is\nVery true All right we're alive and the guy from Fox Sports radio studios it's easy to say Fifteen Percent or more on car insurance with guy go get a guy could dot com or call eight or nine four seven out of the only hard part figuring out which was easier the chiefs did go for a field goal Harrison button gr\nPuts it through its now seven to three Denver in front of Kansas City the browns a short time ago picking off Ben Roethlisberger\nOr any leads ... to nothing and now Nick Chubb with a nice run into Pittsburgh territory so Baker may feel that in the browns all off to a good start in Pittsburgh today although if I'm going to look at these two teams this fits their MO which is Pittsburgh sort of like\nWhat are we doing here in the first quarter and then the second half robbers burger I'll throw four touchdown passes and the browns by virtue very often in the first three quarters are like hey what Casey yeah we're born at a felt team get us look it up like an office in the fourth quarter comes on like well yeah I mean that's that's kind of what we do here isn't it\nIt will look at this is all belief right or the Steelers believe there in every game they play regardless of their down to score or three come the fourth quarter\nThe browns do not the browns have done a lot of losing over the past two years in plus let's be honest\nBut this team they have to develop that identity that winning culture and it has been gone it has been vacant for so long that it's going to have to take beating some of these great teams enclosed games before they start believing they can do it on a consistent\nBasis I Will say this or early on in this game we're getting a little bit of a look at why the brown said oh hey Jacksonville here or you could out Carlos Hyde a Knicks job on five carries is close to fifty yards already ah they're using them in the passing game\nWe don't see a whole lot of three down backs anymore in the NFL but next job has the look of a guy who is going to be I'm going to make this early statement Nick Chubb is an early fantasy pick next year\nOkay so ... much like a a Korean hunt from a year ago\nThese guys that you know whether they're high draft picks are not rookies they typically at that position can go one of two ways they can either be an absolute horse or everybody's last scratching their head going he was so good in college what ever happened to him\nAnd in this case it looks like those skills translate they wouldn't have made a move on Carlos Hyde who is a dependable back unless they knew what that job\nLet's take a look at apply that just happened in New York and we will describe it to you watch Eli Manning throw this ball out back them just always just pass interference that does get called but watch oh del\nJust go out and touch the ball anyway with only his left hand I mean the classic old elf thing that you watch kids on the school yards try to emulate over and over this one was right up there with all of\nA tell you back in the junior one of the most talented football players and I do mean football players in the NFL you saw that pass through cross feel to sake while I'm Barkley just a couple of games that go on a trip play so that pitch out past that he threw back over the across the field to get\nCompleted for a touchdown he's an athlete he's just a football playing Jesse as they call them the problem is he's got a real big mouth and he is a bit of a poison pill in the locker room and he's been given Ninety five million dollars worth of attitude to backup\nThat that resume of speaking out against his ... against his quarterback\nAnd so expect more of that this isn't going to quiet down if Eli Manning doesn't find him a lot if they don't start winning a lot this is going to continue being a problem because Thirteen has been empowered\nJoel mix in a touchdown run for the bangles they strike first over Tampa seven nothing and the Panthers even things up with the ravens seven seven on a Christian McCaffrey touchdown run so that one is all locked up in a big game we're both teams have a winning record and then Eli Manning followed up the long played oh back in by getting sucked because\nThat's what you do I I just don't know if in New York you can get back to back passes off and now all the time you drop by you get one off and then you get a ... it's kind of what the giants look like this\nLook they're right guard just got absolutely obese it as they say in the business or was it was caught on his heels\nAnd and that's the place in the pocket where the tackles did a nice job creating the width of the pocket you need to create the depth of your center or one of the two guards and he had no place to step up and he's not the type of guy who's going to ...\nThings that we learn more about sports science\nOr the bears try to move into jets territory they have by a couple of yards but now facing a third\nInsects the browns miss a field goal dry which is not unfamiliar territory all down this year so they maintain a six to nothing lead on the Steelers right now but miss an opportunity there great news quick way you can save some money\nSo what's the guy got a guy could are common in Fifteen minutes you can say Fifteen Percent or more on car insurance the Panthers back in front now fourteen to seven on the Baltimore Ravens Cam Newton hitting Greg Olson for a touchdown\nCarolina back in front by a score and Greg Olson who I feel like for three years now every year I look at a major injury and go man is this guy just kind of is it just kind of wrap it up\nBut he keeps on common keeps on working to get himself back out onto the field and now I maybe for the first time this year starting to look healthy for Caroline again today\nYeah you Greg Olson also one of the favorite targets of Cam Newton over his career so that that work that they've put in together\nThere is some unfinished business uh they've got so close yeah their game away your Super Bowl contender and you don't get it this is the reason why guys I mean same tight in like an Antonio Gates will hold on for just one more year\nDespite injury despite failure because when when you can just when you can just taste it when you know that you have an elite quarterback or who you presumed can bring you to the promised land you'll hang on\nProbably a couple more years then you should whether it be due to talent or health concerns uh and that's exactly what Greg's doing he he has the talent and he thinks he has the quarterback so he's hoping for that ring\nAlright she saw fence back out on the field but on first down a pass out to Karim hot is going to go for no gain eleven thirty to go second quarter Broncos lead the chiefs seven to three\nAnd so far Patrick homes and company I have a hard time getting a little bit of a rhythm I Denver's\nDefense is done a good job of holding them down also let's spotlight the Steelers all fenced today early second quarter and we talked about an earlier it's a theme that often\nI make some halftime adjustments comes out looks like a completely different group but you want to talk about out of sync\nI mean so far the Steelers have run a total of eight plays out off at that's it rothfus burgers three of five for Thirteen yards has been picked one James cone or with his three carries has got seven yards they have not gotten anything going against Cleveland today in their home\nThis grounds defense tremendous as far as the ball hawking aspect go the interception he threw first was the twenty first take away of this Brown's defensive unit they do a tremendous job\nOf of getting in front of balls that are you know intended for for some of these close coverage plays and Ben Roethlisberger this season as six turnovers against Cleveland I\nMean now they played five quarters and and then whatever that action is out today are already they played that overtime game but still\nBig Ben has this penchant for throwing the ball away he has a little bit more of that Brett Farr vibe than anybody who's willing to ever admit he was more of the dice thrower Brett was but Big Bend he takes gamble as he takes risks and oftentimes one of these great receivers Smith Schuster brown come down with it\nBut then on the other hand the flip side is the risk you take your going to throw in the defense do\nAll right Tom Ridge ill with another nice cat she's got\nTwo balls for sixty two yards today and he's got the cheese down in the red zone they're going to be facing a second in five just shy of the tent yard line the giants are also on the move\nOn a big white was that Barclay sure was sick one Barkley is going to get the ball down toward the thirty yard line of Washington Let's watch ... all over the middle boom Travis Kelsey touched down that guy is such a big target once you get down to about Fifteen ten yard line seems like it's almost impossible to stop\nWell andme homes does such a tremendous job throwing running away from his throwing arm side there's a lot of quarterbacks you cannot do that or he's ranging left though and he's a ... a right handed thrower and he's able to connect\nLike very few quarterbacks able to you you can throw Aaron Rodgers in that group and uh that time cui pocket was able to deliver had a nice passing window and not a lot of contention on the coverage side yeah that was easy but uh but red zone homes I'll take him in almost every Sunday over most of these guys in this\nLeague alright extra point is right down Broadway from ... so that seems to have their first lead of the game tend to step in there the bears Dr has stalled they kick it back to the jets bears up seven to three Pittsburgh on the field right now ball at their own forty five facing a second intent\nBut let's take a look at the giants are on a second in five now about the eight minute mark of the second in court a second quarter there at the Washington twenty seven yard line\nManning out of the shotgun actually have some time how about that for a change he will throw and complete the ball to Barclay down to the eleven so first down there are coming up with the giants\nFor the first time the day manning uncovered and getting a little bit of rhythm as Barkley is getting involved in the passing game oh they'll back them now three catches for fifty nine yards or you know the giants the way we talk about it they're actually the one in six but somehow\nFeels like everybody is still alive and the NFC each so we'll get to that coming up\nBecause Washington is the first place club\nGay but idea on this game all we got to touch down to tell you about coming up\n[noise]\nWhich is building a better bank look like it starts

this week for the New York Mets they're hiring an agent to be their GM\nBrody bandwagon and whose clients include Jacob ... un assessment as Tim TiVo and others obviously it'll\nHave to sever ties with CIA but in the NBA who's the Lakers GM Kobe Bryant agent ... who runs the warriors Bob Myers was an age and so the Mets are going to make news this week\nAbsolutely and you're going to see a lot more there's there's even a little bit of this with what the forty niners have done I Know John Lynch wasn't an agent but Richard I've talked a lot about this it seems like a time or mines are opening a little bit to people who are in and around the game but just not necessarily in that\nRole like my resume doesn't have that role but my resume knows about that role cause I deal with those guys all the time I mean\nThink about lead Jenkins Sports Illustrated for how long I enjoyed I write every single feature PC road\nAnd he goes from being a writer to a front office type with the clippers and Jerry West brings them on board and he has this long absurd titled that they created forum and it'll be interesting how he effects change in that organization or what he's\nAsked to do these are outside the box decisions that have been made I mean you look at Sean McVeigh he got that job when he was thirty one\nYears old and he is now being taught is one of the great minds in the sport of football I think there's been a paradigm shift I think everybody's looking at things differently than they ever have\nAcross all sports and it's very interesting time\nI think you use is a weapon in the minds of people who are hiring you look at even someone like Aaron Boone taking over a managerial job with the Yankees I don't necessarily know or at least trust team to team what a manager even really does anymore other than keep the clubhouse together which is a big part of the job\nBut I even you know I Know Dave Roberts uh he uh probably didn't work but he a tough night on social media last night and I just threw out there simply breathe and ask yourself are you sure he's the one making all these decisions you don't like are you sure\nAnd very few people waited back and said Oh yes I'm sure we don't know we don't know so use is not only um maybe bringing new ideas but uses also maybe controllable\nMultiple malleable ally of the people who are hiring people I mean I Know how I was ten years ago\nI was I was a lot more bending that I Am now it just it's at that age brings a bit more sturdy opinion selfishness uh and and maybe some inability to change where's use\nAll those things are available and and another rookie manager having success ... Cora ... he's been managing his tail off for the Boston Red Sox and here he is on the door steps of winning a World Series in his first year doing the job\nThat's unbelievable to think about two guys managing back and forth at one another in the world series and you're like I just saw those guys play each other in the world series [laughter] I felt like only about six or seven years ago might have been a little bit more but\nAnyway All right it's red zone radio Fox Sports radio and were alive and the guy go far sports radio studios easy to say Fifteen Percent or more car insurance would guy go go to guy go dot com or call eight hundred nine four seven out of the only hard parts figuring out which way\nIs easier let's go to that bears jets game which is rich the half at seven to three yeah two games in fact right now in the NFL that are out to half with seven to three scores Washington in front of the giants by that score as well\nAnd it's almost jarring and twenty Eighteen I Know as you said we're starting to smell Thanksgiving when the weather just a little bit tougher scores will go down so no not in every fantasy league is not going to be over a hundred points every day for the rest of our lives so we're gonna have to deal with that\nBut at the same time it's almost jarring to see this apparently the jets seven to three there are a total about Lebanon completed passes in this game ... you'll see days like this very much anymore\nWell no but you do as as we approach late October early November into those months where we are nearing the holiday season because the weather starts to take a turn\nAnd other factors mightily in these games game planning when you have high when when you have rain when you have snow when it's cold it just changes the way you shape a game plan so offensively\nThis is the time of the ... business when you really have to rely on some of the old tenets of football let's play great defense let's have a reliable run game yet I'm all blocked up on up front when half our games on the road when the majority of our games at home and let's go play some playoff football\nThere's only one game that is still in action right now everything else is at half time but the Bengals mainly because they've been scoring so much are taking their sweet time and getting their half time of the buccaneers are trying to make this a game before our time it's twenty seven is sick\nCincinnati all over Tampa Bay but with seven ten seconds to go to Evan Bayh is threatening and currently has a fourth and goal at the seven and they just said three tries to get in didn't do it\nWould you kick a field goal down by a twenty points a Twenty one points right now or would you take a shot\nOut on fourth and go with the seven yard\nLine I mean it always goes based off two things one I'm quite frankly when you're down that much you have to you have to consider absolutely going for it but you it's the feel you feel like you're a fence is going to convert because even three points on the other side of this half\nAn actual such now now the fantasy one air reality\nSammy Watkins where the touch down I think maybe a second of the day the chiefs are back up okay hit the music again let's go back to Detroit where Russell Wilson is enjoying some time in the motor city\nAddict in with his debut today and it's gone well the ... radio network and robs a well then one hundred Ninety three yards through the air and three such down throws these up over twenty points already\nWere just talking about this guy has become an adult and they were targeted to board F.

Jacksonville twenty four to eight team these games are in the third quarter at Pittsburgh and still Steelers fourteen six over the browns Antonio Brown of Pittsburgh with two touchdowns catches Seahawks quarterback Russell Wilson through three touchdown pass the second quarter\nOr at least as the Steelers yeah they interfered on the past but still a they will turn that down obviously and take the six point\nAll right so a touchdown Brown's makes it sixteen to twelve extra point on the way is there any doubt that this game's going the overtime\nNo they're not no doubt I doubt that's the Cleveland Browns and that's what they've done it five times the season\n... brown meantime the bears but of course of course the extra point that's OK the Steelers will get a field goal to browse we'll talk with the thoughts don't worry it's going to ask them extra time there's no doubt no mine\nAre the browns have needed a kicker all year long and they haven't gotten one hears trip is running potentially I'm thirty seven for first down is right near the sticks we'll see where they market but the browns I'm Sorry the bears on the move again\nFourteen to three two and a half ago third quarter may move this one well into field goal range but they're going to be looking for more here ... we'll see what kind of spot he gets you went down to write out the\nMarket and that was the same zone read we saw earlier where you can handle up inside but at the end collapsed on the run so it's the quarterbacks responsibility to pull the ball taking himself and he went outside contained players waiting but he's big he's mobile in the open field any push forward it will be forced to do the bears go for\nIt I was there was a ah their head by eleven and their infield go arrange a navy he's going to take a timeout talk it over they've already missed a field goal today that's right it is a little bit of a windy day it's soldier field force in one Mr been skiing I let him\nDo it maybe sneak if I let him do it I also want to a direct our attention to Kansas City where Emanuel standards just made a cat and on the run after a word\nI landed in and just reacted very strangely as he held his right leg up in the air while he laid on his back\nFor a period of time and it's now limping off of the field and Grimm missing in some pain for sure so Emanuel Sanders leaving the field for Denver who is that the Kansas City thirty yard line right now with the first in ten trailing thirty to fourteen\nYeah you know they can't afford to lose too many weapons but all the while throughout this season the consistency has been filled Lindsey everybody thought that case keen them coming off the season the ad would be somewhat of an answer but yeah let's direct their attention back to the bears going forward on fourth one and\nThey they are and here's Devinsky on the rollout and he is going to I think the first down outlooks good [laughter] boy he stuck his body in there and throw the ball out there along the sideline and I think he's got enough to move the stakes ought to be first intend for the bears out about the jets Twenty one yard line\nWill play here so it's a running played the left side left tackle pulls out in front leading the convoy Jordan Howard in the backfield what's your ... he runs the bones up this looks like a Cam Newton design because he's so big and he's so fast that you can trust them as long as the years the football surrounded himself\nAnd so Jordan Howard is the ad blockers there so that\nEveryone blocked up and he was a little tentative already made contact you out on the sideline there but he converts it's a first down in Chicago\nAll right so the bears on the raid option will head to Jordan Howard he'll lose a yard\nAnd that gives us an opportunity to talk about Jordan Howard who I'm sure\nThan a year where there is a lot of fantasy frustration in certain facts that I'd been leading that way with the lady on bell who hasn't even played I bet at the same time Jordan Howard just an odd year because the bears are good and he's there and he's healthy\nThey're just not quite using in the same way but even when they are they the dynamic flare of Jordan Howard for whatever reason is just gone\nIt's it's slowed down and you know some players react extremely well when they're sharing the football with other players I mean we see this in basketball sometimes with the super teams some\nPlayers can do it some players can I don't know if it's an ego thing or I don't know if he's the type of back\nWho needs a ton of touches to get it really rolling\nIt's limited now so he's going to get maybe seven to ten touches a game in the receiving game as well as the rush game that you have to make the most of those touches because matinee is going to do the best he can to put you in favorable opportunity you need to make at least one men miss and then you're off to the racism I haven't seen that is out of him that\nHe's alive and carries twenty nine yards for Jordan Howard that's what he's got today Trump is getting the bears come into the line where the third and one there at the Thirteen of the jets are the leading fourteen to three Broncos threatening with a third end goal is well we'll get back to that in a second\nBut here are the bears and I've got to run it off the battle with Jordan out and guess what nothing there well I tell you what the bears there's a lot working for them this year off ... one plane consistently doesn't work is the traditional running play I Know\nI Know they they've been so good varying dolphins but when they just need a hard yard they struggle to find it\nAll right the Broncos on Thirteen goal\nAre going to run the ball and they'll come up short and that's going to be

I I I picture people showing up dress like Conor McGregor and everybody says where are you McGregor and then all of a sudden they break out like a job out of their pocket and they're like oh no I get at your fits that stood\nWell no this is going to be the classic because you know the dichotomy between men and women on Halloween yeah men usually either don't want to dress up at all\nOr they're going to maybe do something in the sports or like action round yeah women of course like to maybe just get a little suggestive with whatever the heck they want to do and so Ryan Fitzpatrick will be the costume that every dude gets and no women get\nThere'll be like who who's that yeah no it it right ... and then they'll be like who is that is she getting Brittany spears [laughter] no I don't know but it could be I suppose the man and he throws in the end zone for Barclay incomplete knocked up in the air third down that\nWas it so now I think we go to force and go do you kick the field goal to get within a touchdown or maybe that was second goal I got to wait and see what was that certain goal was out for a single a bark no ... cut out ordered and gold they're going to kick a field goal and the New York's parents\nJust love it look at it oh yeah they're asked well when you settle for three and New York\nNow I'll tell ya I Would go for this happen because this is just in my personality it takes it's hard to get down there maybe I I Know and then that's the part of this that his Law Center and that lack of confidence in Europe and I'd rather lose the game within the five yard line four minutes earlier then the end of the game\nThen can see three points when you could have had\nSaid okay but I'm going to take a page out of conversation we had earlier in the week with regard to the New York giants going for two on Monday Night in a traditional strange spot\nAnd now we're told all analytic say when you're down fourteen and he scored a touchdown you should go for two that's what the ... out of the news conferences that that's what the math that\nMy response that was well that's the mouth of all football games you can't tell me it's an equal scenario when you're sending you I mean are you going to pour off ants onto the field to go get that to where other teams might be sharing sending erasures you Tom Brady onto the field to go get to that is not equal so you don't get to use that analytic\nWell look what they do from the three yard line in a situation where they need a touchdown now patch drummers got no confidence all of a sudden to get those three yarn\nAlso this or roads trust because patch Irma was brought in as an offensive brilliant mind out of Minnesota and the magical year that they had right so when when you're out you know first single thirty second goal Thirteen Gulf War thing goal whatever it may be but you write down there you're getting ready to score\nAnd you can't and you're an off into minded coach what ... what is what are you saying that the team well I just I don't I don't have the play I don't have the play we can run you can't execute the play we need when we absolutely have to have it so you're you're ruining the

the other end of the field plenty of time on the clock they will give him a first out so it is a first intent right now at the Cincinnati twenty five don't get one playoff it appears before the two minute warning here it is fitzpatrick will throw\nComplete out to the flat bats Godwin who's going to go out of bounds inside the twentieth tonight teen\nSecond down and for coming up anybody have any questions about how this is going to add [laughter]\nOh I Love it [laughter] minute of this I look I I don't know how to describe it but every time\nHe gets into the game he appears to bring a different the paradigm shifts ... it's just a different look it looks faster looks CRISPR\nIt looks driven and and Jim is Winston for all that that he was earlier in his career it's faded some recently and I I don't know I mean to my eyes if you tell me a thirty five year old should beat out quarterback in his fourth year who is taken with the first overall pick I'd say yeah probably not out\nUnless you've made up their mind the gym is Winston is not your future if he's not your future then go with the guy that's going to do better now\n... human needed here I've been nothing but impressed that I Can't wait to see them story points to tie this thing\nWhere I live in the guy Fox Sports radio studios\nFifteen minutes can save your Fifteen Percent or more on car insurance guy go dot com for free re quote while they're at the two minute warning you're on the giants facing a thirty six from the Washington Fifteen are they still do have a miracle prayer I guess manning will throw at one half of this one\nOut to sterling Sheppard ah no need to kick a field goal here got to go for it down twenty to six only twenty nine seconds to go\nUp but in theory if the giants can get a touchdown here then go for the un sidekick they could throw a Hail Mary Broncos in the midst of throwing the ball over the field and there are a little cow lateral play that's not going to work its official and find all that seems to beat the Broncos Thirteen to twenty three and the chiefs go to seven in one\nYeah she's ... screech to somewhat of a hole in the second half they started off real hot and then I don't know if they got conservative more trying to possess the ball but it slowed down\nHe lie manning on fourth in six will throw complete first down down to the to yard line\nAnd that one is they do have a time out there might be well served to use it here and they will\nAbout his Fowler that got the cat and down to the to yard line so now\nYou're at the two you've got Barkley but you can't really run the ball you got no time outs you probably need to keep the ball in the air this is the exact same scenario where they started going for the back to back manning sneak a Monday Night against the falcons which of course just took a ton of time off the clock so hopefully they learned their lesson\nAnd you start to question the decision making now because ah you know you look at that last for things goal and they kicked the field goal this can be ten points on the board right now for the giants down by ten instead of down by fourteen\nWhere you could win the game on a field goal a few ... converted to point conversion I didn't like the fact that they laid up for the field goal last drive\nThey will throw it will be a touchdown to Evan Ingram and so the giants do get to within one score with an opportunity Seventeen Seconds to go to go for non sidekick and see if they can ... the other one I\nUh yeah yeah I Want a game again then again at home this is the best situation you can ask for as far as the end of game or they do have to convert downside kick if they're going to have a shot\nMeantime back to Cincinnati where Ryan Fitzpatrick on the second downplay or the pocket collapsed he was able to fall forward to not lose more than a yard but here comes the third in free\nFrom Cincinnati Eighteen yard line minute Seventeen and counting left to go fitzpatrick I'll take the shot gun snap and he will overthrow everybody nobody was open so he stops the clock but now he's facing a fourth and free gotta have it down by a deep and the Cincinnati is out\nYeah Cincinnati they showed blitz they only rush for they played coverage behind it and so that was the only choice she could make aside from trying to run at himself which there weren't lanes they were containing him well so smart choice surviving for fourth down fourth in three coming up All right uh game\nYeah this is Erin Ryan Fitzpatrick if you are truly magic you will get at least three yards right here right I mean from the Eighteen and now\nFirst the bangles will call a timeout so we will as well the conclusion of Tampa Bay in Cincinnati coming up next on red zone

Fox Sports radio studios easy to say Fifteen Percent or more on car insurance with Geico go to guy so dot com recall eight hundred nine four seven out of\nThe only hard part figuring out which way is easier fantasy took her in just a second\nBut I Want spotlight something that's happening in the Packers rams game you've heard me wind about it mostly off air all year as a guy who's got Aaron Jones on both of his time okay that I brought up earlier today um when we were joined by Tom Brennan hey\nWhat are the Packers coach is saying about the run game because you've got a bunch of talented guys there seemingly not letting any of them get a flow\nAnd I know they don't trust Aaron Jones and the passing game but you talk to me understand for instance\nMelvin Gordon with the chargers I'm like why is the old ways so wide open for twelve catches a game\nAnd you've talked about how the coaching staff sees him as a liability as a pass blocker\nBut they've been creative in how to go ahead and get the ball out of filled rivers hands quickly and make that really worked and turn them into an office of weapons that have been thinking all year so why don't the Packers do that with Aaron Jones because this guy is clearly there most talented dynamic guy\nAnd he's gotten double digit carries one time this year and they won't start him well today you know what\nHe got the start he stayed in for all passing down all downs of the opening Dr\nRogers took us back in the end and they were not able they had to pump the ball away but he got three carries it already has twenty yards he took the ball for a minimum of eight or nine yards on all three carries I Wonder if it isn't Aaron Jones time for green back\nThere probably is if they are giving them the start it means that they have confidence in him from the standpoint of yeah your best back you're going to lead the way and we're going to roll with you as long as you remain as hot as you've been\nHe he runs violent you know time girl is on the opposite side of the field and this is a guy who was decisive downhill I could say all the same things about Jones he\nGets the snap and he closed his to that line of scrimmage really quickly he's on the defense fast and they're they're forced to make arm tacos because he's running by them if they don't attempt that we've got strong legs she often falls forward so he generates that positive yards per carry that you're looking for\nI really believe in him as a running back and I have not deceived us he's been the best out of their bacterial does\nYou know a lot of the fantasy guys on sweater I've been starting a house tax free Aaron Jones and I'm Wondering if today and joins hasn't been free so we'll see\nIran's now with the ball and they're going to convert on a third in short for a first down so they're approaching midfield keep you up to date on that game but right now get out your fantasy lineups and let's take a look [laughter]\nFox Sports fantasy ticket [noise]\nAll right we're going to start in Carolina where the Panthers out of tall task today of defeating the Baltimore Ravens luckily they also have a tall quarterback\nBack farm officer the near side effects of a half\n... out there it is Panthers radio network tempted to want to nine yards through the air to touch down throws also at fifty one yard on the ground and a touchdown there over twenty seven fantasy points today for him to\nSay what the quarterbacks the bronco beat her mom and my home three\n\n\nI Love that called jeeze radio network there ... doing a lot of work on that one but busy day for mobile homes you through for two hundred and Ninety three four touchdown and he's leading the way for the chiefs to a really unstoppable season so far\nWe love to use the word in sports efficiency you know who is a great example about a guy in Detroit who only attempted seven genes passes but three of them went for a touchdown\nSecond now with all the\nRussell Wilson right there with two hundred and forty ... yards through the air free touchdown throws on the sea hawks radio network they get a big road when in Detroit\nBack to the cheese radio network you may be driving around right now saying hey\nWalk ins on my fantasy team what's up with walking while the answers a lot\nGround was oh wow that was one of his\nDu da da da da da de a receipt for over a hundred yards one has that been through the air eight reception big day for walking them to choose\nThis guy left with a late knee injury we're awaiting word on that but before the injury fireworks\nWires to fix the capital of suffer you protect people feel\nOh it was the ball game All right on the marks radio network in my job and the judge is one hundred Seventy nine yards at a touchdown and anybody in a buccaneer uniform gets a fantasy world\nIf they go back to its magic\nWhile we all know was\nMr Jones on this day\nStafford on second and then now work it out of the yard he's got Sherry and Josh is likely block if I got a fake one\nOn the whole Glenn raiders take on that San Francisco forty niners\nReaders neither Thursday at seven thirty Easter non by now\n\nKnow what's voice I could take last but I Would [noise] I Would like to see a little bit more Mr Jones in Green Bay and\nWrite as you play it all while the other ... Williams right through the suit touchdown Green Bay there on the board first in LA sick about\nThe rams great news quick way to save some money\nWhich the guy go go to guy could I comment as if the minute you could say Fifteen Percent or more [laughter]\nCar insurance point\nGuard do we need\nWherever the in Arizona the forty niners the liberation bonus Josh Rose in its\nAct in the end zone officials talking it over thinking about it checking it out the niners defense thinks they know Solomon Thomas the first round draft pick of last year with his back in the end zone here come the explanation from the rough\nAnd that's going to be grounding in the end zone out to be so go ahead and give that already niners a two point lead\nA in Arizona Yahoo is it okay so I'm not as often interesting started their Green Bay scores in an end zone and did you take note of the ...\nAh ... yeah it's it's a it's a painted all sorts of different colors\nSo and I think a piece of artistry bet probably encompasses the day in LA more than anything else where for the first time ever\nAn American city will host all five major sports that's football basketball baseball hockey and soccer galaxy or home kings are home clippers are home rams are home Dodgers are home has never happened in the history of American sports\nAnd the end zone is at the coliseum\nYou've got the blue rams colors and the yellow Los Angeles\nOver writing the red of yesterday's game\nAnd it's turned into a a color that I don't know if I can describe you can even see the USC under the rams o blend of all things LA sport it's uh it's ... it is\nIt's kind of ... yeah the the issue of the red underneath the blue us see underneath Los Angeles or anyway kind of cool\nAll but the rams need to get things going seven nothing Packers in that game um so yeah interesting day stay away from downtown Los Angeles ... the kings are playing now the Dodgers play in that court or a later on in either that's right where the rams are playing right now as well in fact\nThis football games should be letting out\nRight about as everything's filing into Dodger Stadium there about three miles apart holy smoke I'm guessing everybody attending\nThe rams game is just going to walk out of that game and then just just walk on over the Dodgers stadium\nI'd rather stay in my seat if I went to the rams backers game today I Would just bring a snack and hang\nOut you know what I heard they're gonna be five games so my guess is there'll be another ... played here fighting weight Hong double header true and could it not\nBe more appropriate bet all day Los Angeles sports equinox that they're calling it the rams and the Dodgers with the world series in town and the kings are plan on ice and they'll put an NBA floor on top of it later on tonight for the clippers the galaxy playing as well\nIt's the chargers pie week is there any\nCharge more appropriate\nThan relocating to not having much bugs in Iran's really feeling the thunder and I'm sure you know their social media can I have not kept up today is ... like\nThe guy [laughter] good luck to LA teams out there that have been friends for at least three weeks how I'd still All right [laughter] what is what is\nWhere we were there but we're now maybe\nWe should just moved to London [laughter] well I Want the money you mentioned because the reports are out and that was the best fan crowd that they had since they relocate in and even quite quite honestly prior to that because just the\nMere fact that they were contemplating this relocation they were overthrown by visiting fans in San Diego that final season\nI tell you what I Will I'll protect the names of the innocence but it's not just a report I spoke directly to someone who was out the game in London who works as a sideline reporter for a one of the teams involved and uh I was told by far and away the largest and most chargers partisan\nCrowd that they have seen\nIn years certainly since they moved to LA and having the roots that we do in San Diego we can pass along because of dean Spanish rumors over the years the crowds in San Diego were at times not that charger partners then in the final few years in San Diego so that crowd they had in London last week probably the best crowd they've had in seven years\nYeah it'll be interesting to see how this pans out in Los Angeles but in the interim\nOr the rams are absolutely wrong thing people ah this this team is as strong as we've seen a ... and as complete as we've seen a football game in a long time it's a great defense by weight Philips in some of the\nSome of the players out there they improved obviously within dynamic ensue Aaron Donald's been great for wild adding a key to lead the markets Peters the off season\nAnd then this rams op and everywhere you look they have a weapon on the field and golf is is right at the center of it him and Sean McVeigh has grown have grown over the year and a half that they work together\nAll right good thing I warned everybody that Matt reader would be limited today ah he's getting absolutely a ton of war Arizona right he's taking all that carries seven carries thirty four yards although that may pass along he did just leave after ... yard run\nAnd seemed to be favoring one of the legs and that's been the issue that's been the issue a with Matt Brita and the forty niners gets socked on thirty two so are there going to put the ball the way back to Arizona in what has been a thrilling two to nothing game so far\nUh yeah this has not been a great start to see them for the forty niners and it it's really it's not going to improve anytime soon here on the road and allowed\nYou did this by the way I mean\nYou got Adam ...\nLocal cow joy to commemorate the first ever count on cow quarterback match up in the history the NFL Aaron Rodgers versus golf Mr Jones areas in the village was [laughter]\nHey it's been Mather here everybody's got to do list drop off the

available on your Amazon smart speaker just say Alexa play eight Hubbard tax icy and I heard radio\n[noise] Fox Sports trendy and\nThe NFL's three late afternoon games already underway Packers leading the undefeated LA ran seven nothing late first quarter late first forty nine or ... to nothing lead at Arizona is they're ending the first quarter now\nAnd we've seen a Aaron Rodgers frying finally you know utilize Jimmy Graham early in his game which I think there's a difference maker in the middle of the feel\nUm if the rams do have a weak spot it would be that area so I mean they come out with the next game ... plan a in terms of Green Bay and we see the rams kind of sitting on their laurels a little bit more than a you know\nWell I tell you what the big played it set up the Packers first touchdown a pass to divide the Adams forty are beautifully was I mean markets Peters is all over him and\nI again there are passes where you're saying there is no way that could be that\nAccurate from that distance it literally went right to mark his Peter's right into the hands of divide it in the book non verbal labels will pass by Aaron Rodgers so we got a ten nothing Packer labored watching right now now another game that flip that's on right now\nThe raiders at home against the colds this game open as up pick 'em by kicked off any was anywhere from a three and a half to four point favor but right now the raiders who have to work ... tackles no Marcia and let you know I'm Ari Cooper are leading the colds fourteen to ten\nMaybe it to your quarterback crying last week for for you to do their own or allegedly crying last week for you guys get on the same page I Love their early energy let's see if they can sustain this you know the the raiders this season have\nAre very collapsible so we'll we'll see if they can sustain this four point lead and continue to put pressure on Oakland Raiders I mean on the uh\nUh no uh Indiana Indianapolis\n... Indianapolis goal in the Annapolis coke or the raiders made apparently a message today that Derrick car is safe now we know that doesn't mean anything right off or get on the table we've also heard\nThat it Derrick car is not traded that he's going to be flat out released before next season to save a bunch of cabs space\nThis is an absolute do over for John grew into right now\nAnd this was a shock to Derrick car who thought we were just real loading not rebuilding after uh down here just two years removed from a twelve and four seasons so what do you make so far of the uh grew in an experiment with the silver and black\nWell the thing is when you sign a coach to that type of job security with a hundred and you're a hundred million dollar guarantee a deal\nThen this is what you get he gets to make decisions from the ... with\nAbsolutely no record he doesn't he's not on the hot seat he can lose every game from now for the next three years and still wouldn't be fired he still wouldn't be on the hockey\nFights so you might as well take advantage of the new job Julie\nWhile he was going to do what he wants to do if he doesn't like the makeup of the team now we all thought that their car with his guy he raved about him when he had him when he was a brutal grinder and he had them into the quarterback bus or whatever that is and now all of a sudden\nA report coming out that he may be job or you're not happy with them so you know looking at the quarterback landscape out there who would they if they traded him I mean who's going to be well\nHere's the thing about the raiders and and ... grew in particular he's not a guy who knows how to groom a young quarterback rally talked a lot of young quarterbacks or a member of the criticisms ... down in Tampa Bay and they went fishing resigned Jeff Garcia\nTo save the day so um my guess is I mean they got five number one picks over the next two years already what is he going to do with those picture and the guy go Fox Sports radio studios will get to that plus\nAll ready some interesting games in the books in the NFL ... kept coming up next\nWe'll [noise]\nThey're making them play\nWe're breaking it all yeah there's really only one came in the NFL and its on watch buffalo\nRadio\nEven if you're a big time basketball fan there might be a few facts about the game you don't know why did you know that the first hoops were actually peach baskets or that a war basketball is about the cold one or the players could run as much as four miles during the game\nWell here's another fact you might not know that's actually really helpful if you need to buy a car\nThrough car also helps people get used cars that's right ... isn't just for buying new cars with their or certify dealer network nationwide inventory of nearly one million used cars you'll enjoy real pricing on actual inventory and a simpler buying experience when you buy newer used\nAnd withdrew car uses can see what others paid so they know if they're getting a good deal before buying they're also more likely to enjoy faster buying experience by connecting with two cars certify dealers when you're ready to buy a new or used car\nCheck out through car and enjoy more confident car by experience some features that available all states\nHigh blood pressure anxiety med everyone's on them if you're in a fifty year old male maybe a bit porky and you may even have type two diabetes a million dollars of term insurance may only cost you about two hundred bucks a month\nCalled term providers speak with big Lou and eight hundred five six eight twenty seven Ninety big Lew will find a term life policy for you even if you have type two diabetes are overweight or have high blood pressure\nTerm providers helped thousands of people like you think they can afford term life insurance to buy a million dollars of affordable term life for you all you need to do is call big Lou and eight hundred five six eight twenty seven Ninety Lew will make sure the scale they're tipped in your favor\nCall eight hundred and five six eight twenty seven Ninety big little we'll answer your call and worked to fit you went to a term life policy that you can afford remember big lose like whew he's on meds to call eight hundred five say say twenty seven Ninety eight hundred and five six eight twenty seven\nCan we walk\nA rock and roll lovers is Danny west let's take a trip back\nTo this week in rock 'n' roll history\nThis week in Nineteen Seventy five Paul Simon issues his for solo album still crazy after all these years gone it last ditch the ways to leave your lover and the title track all reached the U.

two years in a row and falling short of a title two years in a row it seems so will they actually wake up and trying to assemble a different team that's a serious question to management\nStrategy maybe instead of actually trying to swing\nFor a home run you go how about just getting the ban on the ball now that you feel all rally it play out and make\nThem pay for the shift about advancing runners how about not like we saw last night Justin Turner laid off single stands at first\nThey not only in the script Mr to say you got to follow the\nWhich is not working anyway game five on Fox TV tonight Cleveland Cavaliers fire coach to run loose today after and oh and six start assistant Larry Drew takes over the NFL game tonight is New Orleans at Minnesota as for the game's going on right now Adam military has become\nThe top points score in NFL history skate to feel go over twenty five hundred points he scored in his career and a half time in Oakland Raiders lead fourteen Thirteen over the colds\nAnd the rams falling behind ten nothing at home against the Packers at the coliseum about five minutes to go first half this is the first time the rams had been down by double digits the season\nThey enter with a seven and record\nIt oh we've had more scoring and the niners game it's now five three niners leading at the cardinals with about four and a half minutes to go\nIn the first half of that one among the earlier games Philadelphia one in London twenty four to Eighteen over Jacksonville Kansas City seven and one of the season after beating Denver thirty to twenty three\nPatrick my home's four touchdown passes over three hundred yards passing Washington beat the giants twenty to Thirteen Adrian Peterson a hundred and forty nine yards rushing into total scores Chicago over the jets twenty four to tend the jets offense eleven drives just well first announced today jets running backs Nineteen carries only thirty five yards\nCincinnati wins on a forty four yard field goal final play thirty seven thirty four against Tampa Bay and Randy Bullock had missed an extra point in the first half\nThat's why it was only thirty four all going into the final two minutes James' Winston through for interception was pulled late third quarter and then some fits magic Ryan Fitzpatrick\nOff the Ben thank you on the news and he's non union my goodness Seventy two yard touchdown pass in the fourth quarter surface Patrick Adelaide duty and to point conversion to try and instill Cincinnati gets the home when\nBy the way or the forty niners of them did three lead over Arizona [noise] they just run handling Jansen into said we\nDon't want him to the last ... their big ass but I don't think it's going to happen not a good move there I'm Mr to say good thank you so much and good time at the game tonight\nWe're coming alive and the guy go Fox Sports radio studios easy to say fifty percent or more in the car insurance we guy go go to guy got ... eight hundred and four seven out of the only ... which way it's easier joining us right now\nHe was at that Redskins a giants game when Kennedy Albert I'm Pam Oliver oh dear friend Charles Davis and Charles ...\nAnd I were just talking about Adrian Peterson ... hundred and forty nine yards\nTwenty six carries an angels won or or ... what do you make of this man still putting up these kind of yards\nWell it's it's really one of the things we haven't seen very often you know we just go ahead and make it historical this is John Regan's if Gore territory because no one else is doing you know has done that and now remember Adrian has to get to a thousand yards or for him to get on that list with those guys\nBut he's well on his way this season and when he plays like this and when they're able to create space for them that he created his own space as you guys well though Washington becomes a better football team and when I mean we we've graphically showed it today\nIn the law says you remember the New Orleans get what he ... when he got hurt and then the other lost to a Indianapolis and get like twenty yards or something like that so and the other games he's averaging well over a hundred yards per game now\nThat tells you how Washington Place which may be a little bit different than you would expect from a J curtain team\nBut he's riding a wave right now and Adrian Peterson leading it I I\nYou know and I think that's the formula for my son Alex Smith is a a leader that team and we were talking about him he's not going to burn up the ... going to be extremely accurate with the oh he's not going to turn it on or turn it over but when you give them a dynamic running back\nAdrian Peterson it takes a lot of pressure on them trying to stretch the field all the time and we see you know him twenty for a thirty two hundred and Seventy yard touchdown ... interceptions\nThat's what you look at that would you like from him being able to him the ball off thirty three times to a bevy of running backs mostly Adrian Peterson\nThey relies ruined his ... that's going to be our recipe for success because when Adrian has Nineteen and more carries he gets up close to the ... century mark\nYeah and and the one thing that\nI'm looking at it [noise] ... [noise]\nIs just to stand up for a Washington now this formula worked well for a number of other teams the one thing I I'm going to keep an eye on and I see them again next week against that lab and they end up in a game where let's say Atlanta's cranky they've been playing much better off than you guys know recently\nWhat if it turned into a little bit more of a we have to keep up [noise] that's where I Want to see what Washington going to do because what Alex had last year in Kansas City member of al ... came rarely get rushing also can catch it out of the backfield but he also throw it out of the retail and and and ...\nSo when you're talking about two guys who could trade you down field who's doing that for Washington Jordan read is a terrific receivers a tight in I have not seen the bigger place from him this year and and who is doing it outside\nThey haven't had that guy so far that's going to be the interesting thing with their formula what happens if someone stretches them and make them have to do a little bit of chasing and in a dynamic fashion Atlanta could be that team to test them that way next week it that'll be fun to see how they play\nCharles Davis is joining us on the flip side the giants are now one in seven manning was a seven times he's real couple of picks are they threw the ball Barclay only thirty ... yards on the ground and he had Seventy three yards receiving\nYour evaluation Charles where are we with the giants now [noise]\nWell that off into line unfortunately is is not getting better you know they kept hoping to get some type of hay in the middle of the season these guys have come together and get better I don't know that that's going to happen\nIt's a makeshift line to begin with I'm older who they put all the money into is not in the rock that they've ... they they expected or now this is going to be good at guard but he's a rocky and ill I got sacked seven times and I've watched it it felt like more guys\nUsually ... pressure\nHe was knocked out a bunch there was a lot of times when he got rid of it but you got to understand so that's a problem for them\nYou mentioned say quants rushing totals they can't run the ball they can't move people and the Washington ... ... those young those young babble voice ... they get a lot of attention in Iran paying job that Alan but the guy who showed up today in addition because those guys were great was it was a I and I just met either as bad as simple\nActually had two and a half stack and without the run games so if you can't run the ball Washington makes it hard for you to run it\nNow you gotta go deal with the deal with a secondary but a lot better door with so I'll meet you to see what's going to have dealt with that but with the giants have an open week and then I Believe their game is on the road I don't have the schedule in front of me but I Believe they're on the road\nYeah they are going to be at the yeah\nIf they're going to test the young quarterback while at a time when I think they have to do\nYour optimum time but they also could elect to go who would you say the ... image to Seattle\nNo at the forty niners said the forty niners to me that's optimal and I'm not saying that the advocate bench Eli Manning is not my point which is just\nThat they're there one in seven they messed up last year because they didn't look at Davis Web that look the Gina Smith would pay zero that's what you had tape on ... Web could do so they blew that PR wise football wise everything this is a new regime\nI think that they will do it much better this time and I think they'll actually have discussions with the you lie to discuss what's going to happen how you want to handle it and they have a little bit of time to get that done but I think it has to start happening that discussion has to be in play unfortunately and it might be the best ... says right now is getting beat up [noise]\nBlase blase doubt I'm telling you my bold predictions for college football this year I had all the action that may scream

Peterson got a a MVP ... years ago last time I would have\nGirly sets the NFL record for touchdowns he's on pace\nYou need to set the record for yards to really I mean it's crazy man look a bedroom home or if he continues on the clip he's going it's no watched in\nAll ... hold on now here's the thing about the NFL awards and a lot of people have always questioned like baseball you know how do you judge most valuable but in the NFL it's different\nBecause they have separate awards they have it off ... player the air right and the defense of play year and then they have a lower or higher ballplayer known in early last year was the often so player of the year\nBut Tom Brady was the MVP rarely seen that many ... uh Drew Brees is twice spin off in support of the year he's never won MVP award\nOr they basically been distributed to the ... the ... the Aaron Rodgers of the world um but you're saying the ... Peterson wandering MBP ... Thomas's Sean Alexander in the two thousand times you know but the ... year they set the record for all of that ... and the seasons\nYeah it's not even that anymore can't just be more most touchdowns I Can't even that no because if you have Patrick my own finish out like he's finishing right\nFive thousand yards and they throw for may have twenty five touchdowns yes at the halfway mark [laughter] okay right so record pay but if he stays on this clip and he had a fifth the touchdown right with and they go fourteen into with six interceptions ...\nIs ... ... ... I don't care what time girlie does those numbers will never\nBe a girl who lives the NFL rush in and scores thirty touchdowns\n... thirty is Patrick my home has fifty they're going with the fifty\nFifty touchdown passes as opposed to storing thirty touchdowns\nAnytime a quarterback has thrown fifty touchdown passes easy on the MVP ... period\nAll right well let's ask you as a Thirteen year veteran of the national football league is that fair that only quarterbacks being considered for\nThe you know of course not but that it's a quarterback sleek\nAll the hoopla and in in our conversations are there are about running back there about quarterbacks we just had a whole segment on you can't turn your team back over to the gym is Winston because he is a ... garbage fire\nRight I mean you can't do it then we're not talking about the running back we're talking about the quarterback position in in order for you to be successful in today's NFL you need some semblance of a dynamic quarterback\nThat's just what it is All right well\nTiger early to me is someone that could still be in the conversation of course you'll be in a conversation who come in second in your Jay Jay why everyone thought he was going to win the ... year an air Roger still won and run away of\nCourse but he still ... I mean when you look at that I mean he had he had more touchdowns in some receivers that year\nNo more past the fences bats break up then the top corner back and let the league effects so when you when you look at someone who was a game changer in that year for Jay Jay what no one affected the outcome of a game more than he did\nHow do we get here you know I have the rabbit hole I call that the rabbit hole enough to remember we're running backs dominated this ... I mean there was a time\nWhere the Heisman Trophy was one eleven years in a row by a running back ... ... he broke that string ... years in a row and now you know even this year my Heisman up there and he he got by the way I found\nSomething out Alabama quarterback too now I thought you look at his last name and it's spelled tackled by law it's not I've been saying tackled by law because it's T. A. G. O. V. A. I. L. away right tiger by law\nHe goes Congo in fact he actually got ... they said well how do you pronounce your name and he goes Congo by law hunger by ...\n... you know right now luger linebacker no no re Mao Luna is the proper pronunciation now this blows me away are you into ...\nWell yeah there are people who have been ms ... pronouncing my name is Dr head coach of calling me from I'd be like hey nice to meet them ... hey here from I'm like okay [laughter]\nThat was less than a second but I'll tell you why so Thirteen Years only how many people are still calling you from ...\nYeah all the time I I just ignored it just I'm only incorrect we don't have I have [laughter] whatever\nWell my attitude about tongues by law is if he walks away with a Heisman Trophy which I Would imagine he's going to consider he has talked about the record is twenty five touchdown\nAnd by the way down to the game was nine and ...\n... probably a twenty five yard touchdown pass scores currently twenty two Thirteen pending\nThe extra point right and if they do and by the way I mentioned at the top of the show even there were like five games this week we're the lines really\nMoved one of them was this game people were hounding the Packers as a nine and a half point dog in fact the line went down to seven and a half or seven points and now they're down ten as the rams attack on the extra points so\nAnother game was the colds and the raiders game this game started as a pick an suddenly all the money one on the colds as maybe a three and a half point favorite the Colts have now taken a seven point lead so this could be a very tough week for Vegas\nI mean the raiders\n[laughter] by the way speaking of come back we're talking earlier about comebacks J. G. Y. Adrian Peterson ... what about Andrew Luck I mean today and oh yeah absolutely but who at thirty one three touchdowns Romanian play last\nYear and um you know four hundred and sixty ... and they're losing a lot of games but at the same time he is putting up the kind of numbers that we expect a healthy Andrew Luck to put up and he's doing it right now and I called the there's not very good\nYeah he he's definitely I'm putting them great numbers in the fingers hoping that the him and the coats is the emergence of a running game from Marlon Mac they've never had a running game right with Andrew Luck and\nDoing what I got drafted Trent abroad and Trent Richard semi right yeah it's got oh\nGoodness but it's taken a lot of pressure off ... off of him and he's not having to throw the ball forty five sixty forty five fifty sixty times the game he's right at you know thirty one or temps twenty to completion two thirty nine three touchdowns\nBuddies him the ball off thirty four times with two hundred and twelve yard\nThat's the recipe that they need to take some of the pressure off and look and now they're ... they're just got to turn over in town and the raiders getting ready to go in and score again already of thirty five to twenty eight with\nFor Nineteen left in the fourth quarter\nA in Oakland so it looks like the fourth quarter walls for Oakland continues I think they've been out scored Seventy eight to thirty two and the fourth quarter and that's the worst point differential in the NFL\nAll right so a again a balance of games right now if you decided to go all in on the colds and the Packers the Colts are looking good they're about to up their lead but the Packers seemingly in control and that ran defense has really shut down the Green Bay attack I I think that\nIf you are looking at the rams right now uh as they are more money at forty to go in the third quarter so it's not over yet because we seen Aaron Rodgers a wait to have games we over the years but if they do at the rams do prevail in this game eight and ... at the halfway point\nAre you still are they the best team are they better than the ... are they better than the patriots are they are better than the saints are certainly can't wait for that gave a preview that the Vikings saints game a little bit later on but are they the best team in ...\nI Would I Would say so because when you talking about the best team not the best off into the best defense but the best team you see what\nThe rams have in terms of our fence of ...\nBeen with you know would cooks\nGirlie [laughter] everyone a bigger bigger weapons everywhere but then when you talk about defensive well\nYou know you gotta remember oh keep believe he's out he's not even he and I went right now but you got Peters you guys do you got Donald or you have there and Donald you exactly and so when you stack them up against another team they can do it on both sides of the ball and they're one of the few teams in the NFL they're going to make that assertion\nBy we mentioned we have a a Sunday night game that could well determine who the second best team in the NFC is right now the Vikings hosting the saints saints have not lost censor opening game what's gonna transpire in that game plus a little thing called the world series\nWe'll cursed shark keep the Dodgers all live from the guy go Fox Sports radio studios yeah so we got all

All right\nMan someone's going to say something about Patrick ... but ah right now yeah the LA rounds around them move there are only down by one point earlier on today you have the eagles job but on the jaguars twenty four to Eighteen Panthers by Fifteen over the ravens\nAnd we've covered the bangles debacle but they go away and beat the buccaneers by three Seahawks on the road with the lines twenty eight to four team Pittsburgh comes from ought to be the browns thirty three and Eighteen gyms car two hundred and twelve total yards\nAnd also a pair of scores and Patrick ... for total touchdowns missed one three hundred three yards passing Kansas City thirty Denver twenty three guys got some major league baseball in about\nThirty five forty minutes from now from Los Angeles Dodgers looking a void elimination Red Sox and Dodgers David Price versus Clayton cursed shah\nThe pitching match up scheduled for eight Fifteen eastern only on Fox where of course the Fox sports app as well\nTalk girlie by the way scored a touchdown and his eleventh straight game lemon straight game I got one\nBetter for you yeah every picture that pitch yesterday on the Dodgers gave up and run yes every single one and there were seven pictures you voted out now but here's the amazing thing you're starting pitcher only gave up I hit yeah but at least three Ninety One pitch is yeah but that's a good thing they\nPulled him out because he said keep an eye on me All right I'll keep an eye on him [noise] I don't get me started don't get me started over focus right now I thank you very much mustard gas kind of a company alive and the guy go Fox Sports radio studios eases eight fifty percent or more on your car insurance guy go go to guy got calmer coal\nEight hundred for seven on all the hard part figuring out which way is easier I so we got three\nForeign aid to go the rams\nAre in great position a nice run by Todd girlie as idiot yards rushing eighty one yards receiving that's a hundred and sixty nine yards from scrimmage in his second intent and again the rams are trailing twenty seven twenty six you know part of what's going on and if you're the rams right now I ended up pretty good position but you\nYou got to run some clock right All right and\nYou don't want to give the ball back to Aaron Rodgers so ah God scrambles she slides there's a flag could be a whole on the rams\nLet's see if this one's coming back a little scramble or inside the tent yard line for golf or waiting for the flag and they're going there it is pretty much\nObvious when you have the quarterback suddenly scramble and the flag drops that's probably a whole probably already All right so that's\nGoing to move the rams back but that's not necessarily bad for the rams again there are only download point obviously in the old gold position that means they'll probably run a little more clock right now the only thing that would make me feel good about running clock as if it has zero\nOr with Aaron Rodgers [laughter] I mean yeah I mean how many hail man he's the king of the Hail Mary king of the hill I mean nobody throws the better Hail Mary I so will the rats are back up to the twenty three yard line second in twenty\nThree and a half minutes to go in this game and the rams are trailing by one and they are running as no surprise that all round the clock down some more ... Gurley continued to pile up the yards um\nSo when I when I get back to the saints Vikings game anybody in the ... or a bar in the injuries or anything else is this team basically take it into the super bowl there not ticket but they have a good shot they um\nIs there an or late last year they lost at home in their first playoff game rise chalk that up to inexperience in but is there anything you could see they could ... I mean look potentially they might have to face a\nAn Aaron Rodgers or you know uh Drew Brees or\nSomething like that in the first round again the games will be at the coliseum most likely I third in sixteen or right now\nAnd they're running the ball so that's what they're doing they're killing clock or just a part of a game I don't like but again there's two forty to go I mean I don't I don't know that I knew I don't my plan for field goals\nAnd especially when you're going to give two minutes of the very least I'm Aaron Rodgers and ... says oh man I'm like that what happened what happened ... I mean does he understand that Aaron Rodgers on the other team\nYou're going to give Aaron Rodgers at least two minutes or wouldn't do this for all he needs is a field goal to win the game I wouldn't do it I would've gone for the end zone All right so\nThe rams are attempting a forty three yard field goal again the clock is ticking out of the two minute warning to kick is good so the rams take eight twenty nine twenty seven laid there is to all five which is even better for the Packer who is going to get a added\nA bonus of the time and it was happening with the forty niners oh my goodness\nThey're they over\nBad snap [laughter] it is over so the Arizona Cardinals are too and I asked the forty niners\nAnd oh it's six against everyone else good graces so good for Larry Fitzgerald like they just won the super bowl yeah that's what it feels like so Josh Rosen or that that was an impressive come from behind when\nThe touchdown pass was right on the money so the Arizona Cardinals there was another game the forty niners we mentioned\nUh were favored on the road is a one and sixteen did not look at that now are you\nKidding me what the heck is that CJ better running for his life and just threw it away [laughter] um\n... if you have a center that football is what people don't understand see we we watch these bad plays and you know guys making mistakes and everything else but you spent Thirteen Years in the NFL in the film room with your coaches reviewing bad place\nHow's the play like that covered by the offensive line cook goes crazy [laughter]\nI mean what is it I mean what are you how to curse words curse words and and you have to just sit and take it\nOr ... to ... ... oh on the kickoff return growing that devolve all Green Bay fumble the ball on the kick off or\nThey're looking right now to see it and their their rooms ball on believable\n... fifty six seconds left on your on oh\nMy oh my\nSo let's watch this play again or issues ball is\nNot much doubt that is clearly now out of his hand he basically\nWell now\nYou would have had two minutes with Aaron Rodgers just again a goal or no he is going crazy over there and now he was going to win the game\nAaron Rodgers knew who did not believe a lookout Lucy is carrying that\nBall wrap it up are you kidding me\nFirst of all I Would have just let the ball go out of the end zone why return it right where it all\nYou didn't look at look look going crazy looking at Rogers going crazy absolutely losing his mind he knew\nHe was going to win that game\nSo the rams look like they're going to skate barring some\nDisaster a leading twenty nine twenty seven and Aaron ... that was his job security right now among ... yeah [laughter] ... pretty much the only running back to him\nAnd his ... el ... so are there you go to Montgomery fumbling\nRight away how how does the ... ...
