more you realize they got the goods on the field you give them credit for figuring out how to win games like this that's a good teams do special teams do they figure out ways to win games that they probably shouldn't win but if I'm an opposing team nothing scares me about the rams and the coliseum Jonah socks Fox Sports radio\nUh you can get me on Twitter at the Jonah stocks go ahead and hit me up I Want to hear a best guess as to what you think Brady Quinn is doing right now since he decided to give us a giant F you and not show up to the show so if you want to ah send those in at the ... we're looking for the whereabouts of ...\nAt the Jonah snacks and will read the most offensive throughout the course of the show I'm All right as we come to live here from the guy go Fox Sports radio studios coming up next\nYou're watching something in the NFL right now you can see it\nYou know what's happening\nAnd I've got proof that a major change could be coming for an organization and you know what his well to tell you what that is next year in office are however\nThere is a real [noise]\nThey're making them play\nWe're breaking it all yeah there's really only one team in the NFL and its on watch buffalo\n... live here [laughter]\nRadio even if you're a big time basketball fan there might be a few facts about the game you don't know why did you know that the first hoops were actually peach baskets or that a war basket\nBad David gas gone with the later [noise]\nBy your your executive producer ed Roberts\nThat are supposed to me off\nI mean luggage that this is just the way it goes around here man like the respect comes and goes it's like a turnstile I hear on the show and it it's bothersome to me but I mean it could be worse Dave\n... yeah he's here at least he's you know there's certainly ... who is calling me at a very stressful moment of dodge again last night I just got a new phone didn't want to start across the room so I chose to let it go to voice and I'm Sorry my ... just as you know ah air could actually texted me two hours before your show to ask for Steve ... number ... do you want me to write the chauffeur Jonas do and book the guess\nI Would look a ... it's what I've always said it could be worse you can be a Dodger fan so that's speaking of which\nJust lie but Jesus going to make an appearance that Chavez Ravine and I I have no idea reason why I'm asking is because we're only in the first inning and keep in mind the over under on this ball game between the red Sox and the Dodgers that seven and a half will post these incursions showed up Steve Pearce with a two run shot in the top of the first inning\nDid the red Sox it's you nothing advantage but David freezing the bottom of the first\nFirst pitch you saw you what the opposite field it's true one Boston right now just in terms of just walk\nOne on it and nobody out in the bottom of the first Dodgers again down to one they're down to the series three games to one and of course National Football league action all across the south by Los Angeles rams there now eight noticed season thinks it is\nGoing to grab the favorite bring it out the Fifteen any\n[noise] shards of all time I got my\nYeah rams when it twenty nine twenty seven to kick the ball up after a field goal\nAnd it was about ... fun to play in the fourth quarter Aaron Rodgers doesn't even get a shot to win the ballgame for Green Bay\nColds go on the road and beat the raiders forty two twenty ... twenty five cares for a buck thirty two and two scores\nAnd the Arizona Cardinals have Chu wins this season and they both came at the hands of the efforts this go forty niners Eighteen fifty and with the final score Josh Rosen with a game winning touchdown path ... eight grams for a hundred yards and also one TV Sunday Night Football from Minnesota\nSaints right the ball right now they're inside the five your line knocking on the door there is no score again it's the games opening position\nAnd we got all of a sea or to the games around National Football league from this morning eagles over the jaguars twenty four to Eighteen Bengals beat the bucks thirty seven thirty for\nKansas City chiefs continue to dominate Patrick my home's twenty four thirty four three ... three through the air force CDs chiefs of or the Broncos thirty to twenty three genes Connor two hundred and twelve yards total and to Judy Steelers thirty three Brown's Eighteen\nJoin us back to you thanks Dave by the way did you know the last ... can you guess the last quarter back to ever beat the Steelers in Pittsburgh last Brown's quarterback to ever be the Steve I'm going to take a guess and said Derek Anderson ooh\nGood guess above what would you like a shot at this last round quarterback to beat\nThe Steelers in Pittsburgh\nWhere are you going [laughter] that's a very good guess Eric Robert you want to take a stab at this as a year or a Johnny Manziel all ... in debt that also is a good guess all of those are incorrect though\nTim Couch would be the correct answer and watch a few thousand three\nTwo thousand three well Iran has been at that yeah that was a three I Believe [laughter] I Believe Abe Lincoln was celebrating his ... and yet at that time but that's the last time the browns won in Pittsburgh total dominance\nA but we got more than the browns later on because that's getting real fun\nAt is getting real fun there and Cleveland All right thanks Dave uh we're coming to life and the guy go Fox Sports radio studios it's easy to say Fifteen Percent or more on car insurance would guy go go to guy could comical eight under nine four seven out of the only heard part figuring out which way is easier by the way did Abe Lincoln actually have a ... that I just\nRecklessly said on the air you just regular says I don't hear well don't tell them I said okay now I don't wanna piss them off course courts I just go get a lot of scores were you okay um so are we are uh so uh coming up in about ten minutes from now here on Fox Sports radio I think\nI think somebody misty op missed an opportunity to do one of the all time great things in a recent broadcasting history okay one of the all time great things I think they missed an opportunity in that and I'll explain what that is about ten minutes from now here on Fox Sports radio so we have got\nSaints Vikings and one of the match ups that I've been looking forward to um\nAs much as any game all year long saints in Vikings the saints have actually scored a so we're early in the first quarter a New Orleans where they seven nothing lead over the Minnesota Vikings\nTouchdown for New Orleans was I Believe Alvin Kamara a album Kamara on a toss from\nDrew Brees I Believe they're counting that as a touchdown pass for you fantasy football players out there who have been job to buy ladder roles and flips and tosses and all of that but the New Orleans saints heavy seven nothing lead over the Minnesota Vikings and we will keep you up to date on that moving through out but\nI look at the saints\nAnd the saints have won five in a row outside of the first loss of the season and everybody gets tripped up the first last of the CDC great teams lose the first week of the season all the time you know ... you don't know what the game plan for you don't know anything the saints have won every single game sense and so New Orleans has almost quietly\nBecome one of the better teams not only in the NFC but in the NFL and Minnesota and you give them all the credit in the world after that Thursday night game against the rams a few weeks back Minnesota\nHas rallied strung together some wins they're starting to get a little bit healthier Everson Griffin are dealing with his a mental health issues is coming back\nAdam stealing or maybe the best receiver and football he's been dominant um they still are dealing with some injuries often supplying a running back down and cooks been banged up a couple of the injuries on defense but you can't deny Kirk Cousins up to this point has lived up to his contract\nYou cannot like the guy you can think that uh you can hate to use like that crap or you can think that the Redskins made a a great decision by letting him go you can think he's overpaid you could think he's not an elite quarterback doesn't deserve that kind of guaranteed money no doubt about it ... cousins has been\nA fantastic addition to the Minnesota Vikings and if they don't advance or don't get it done this season in the NFL it's not going to be because of her cousins he's been awesome\nBut the reason that this game as sentimental to this show is because we were on the air when one of the all time great plays an NFL playoff history went down ... and I were doing the show last January\nAnd while we were on the air the game was happening and so of course it's a live game and it's a playoff game when we've got to pay our respects to it and so we're doing we can't really do play by play 'cause that's not legal\nAnd we can't really you know delve into broadcast on the radio side of things so that's not legal so we did our best to kind of paint the picture for ya I feel like I did a a pretty good job as a professional broadcaster I feel like I did\nI assumed Brady could hold up his end of the bargain since the guy does college football and the NFL for Fox I just\nOh man that Brady Quinn a broadcasting professional part of one of the top teams with Fox you see every single weekend on your TV I assumed that he can handle the responsibility as well to oh here's how it sounded last January\nAs a warning to time element you know ten seconds but through the pass rush right now I mean the saints are really getting after this off as a wife or the Vikings\nThat's too bad I mean the the the crummy part about all this has Minnesota and we're just going to crack jokes and bus balls while there's a team was playoff fate is on the line as case it was back to throw going deep right side and uh oh my God he caught it Stefan\nDigs [laughter] and the game is over Stefan gigs just scored on ... on bully [laughter]\n\nAnd the Vikings just won the game ...\nIt's like somebody like somebody\nGave their ... I got ... kilos of math and told him to bark at the neighbors that you're a mini sub you played it that laugh but I think that in mind that the guy who's never smoked a cigarette in his life breeding I've joked about him and I have never smoked a cigarette in our life\nNever never ... ... and I asked myself okay if you never smoked a cigarette when how do you sound like that and and I would I Would get if he's in the elements you know if he's like in and I did a rod race and he's in Alaska hanging out and some ... doing the show or\nHe's on the side of the movie alive trying to decide which one of the victims in the plane crash he wants to eat I get it look to your voice is hoarse I understand it the guy who lives in ... South Florida how was that voice I don't understand it do they say I don't\nGet it and we're really looking forward to reliving that moment with Brady clean air but he decided to stick you as a listener and say I'm not coming in so unfortunately he's not going to be here\nAre Jonah stocks Fox Sports radio the Vikings out the ball back or ... minutes to go first quarter the saint of the seven nothing lead read Scott Red Sox are leading the Dodgers two to one end of the first inning at Dodger Stadium hum as we come to your life and the guy go Fox Sports radio studios\nWhen we come back somebody missed an opportunity\nTo pull off one of the all time great stunts in broadcasting history I'll tell you who that is next year and if as our\nCase Fox Sports radio and this is where you get\nIt's MORNING I'm going to run through all of my stories in the NFL\nLate now and they're too big takeaways from this game is your\nAge ... mother here everybody's got to do is drop off the dry cleaning pickups to melt here's an idea let's that saved hundreds of dollars on car insurance and the good thing is you don't have to drop off or pick up anything\nDave at that guy first okay that's out of line first of all Dave\nCould you pull that off as a broadcaster yes okay but what a pain in the ass right\nIt is and fat distance from the coliseum Chavez Ravine is six point three miles and normally if you're like in the Midwest or maybe down south it'll take ten Fifteen minutes yeah\nRight now according to map quest it'll take you thirty five minutes of all evil that six point three miles from the coliseum to Chavez Ravine knows that taking the streets or the freeway at the freeway\nThat still wrong that's probably taken a helicopter at the door on um yeah yeah it's it's a it's a brutal man and look there are people that work here that will leave games at the coliseum and how how far away the Fox sports radio studios so the coliseum or how far how like no traffic what's the drive\nNo traffic if I leave my house and make it hearing about\nMaybe twenty eight thirty two minutes yeah I've heard Ninety minutes following games that's how long following ... Ninety minutes to get hit depends on which way you go if you take the day and you can kind of get here a little quicker and they'll get many details for the national audience ...\nPoint nine miles it'll take you thirty minutes from where we're at right now\nAs no traffic it's unbelievable yeah we get plenty agree and going from before all five of the wall okay\nBecause today isn't a today in LA is a nightmare for people listening around the country today in LA is a nightmare all the sporting events that have gone on let me get this correct so the kings played a day game right by the rangers right\nThe clippers are playing tonight correct\nThe Dodgers are playing right now correct the rams played earlier\nAnd isn't there like some a crummy soccer team\nThat plays MLS and in Kansas City to gun LA or [laughter]\nYou know what I can imagine if you're just a die hard LA sports fan you've been drunk for ten hours I get you just watching every single game ending anybody attempted to go to every\nSingle game yes Sports Illustrated has a couple of guys that were doing it and ah they've been chronicling the entire journey but just to ... that's the other thing too you're mentioning it your soccer and you got baseball that's a lot of non activity that's going on you're just sitting around you better be drinking then\nDid you hear Bob Costas his criticism of ah did you guys hear this one this is great Bob Costas I heard was on a one of the local shows that here in LA and he was upset that Joe Buck was calling Thursday Night Football\nAnd then going to call the next game of the world series and he was upset because it was like Fox trying to indicate that the NFL and they Thursday night game between the Texans and dolphins was just as worthy to have Joe Buck as the world series was on um hey Bob\nClue man it's cold hey we'll\nGive you the rights to the NFL on Thursdays but we need your number one guy's [laughter] now do they not get this and I got news for you have you seen the ratings [laughter] why did I wasn't happening here\nBetween between the end all cs the world series Thursday Night Football I've had so much Joe Buck on in my front room and I love a week do you like it's ridiculous he he buys will be like a fourth roommate oh it's kind of insane I mean I Can't get I think Joe\nBuck's fantastic and for all your twelve year old out there who are you are you from the mid thirties early forties um broadcast professionals who go dressed as twelve year olds when your teams in a big game crying because Joe Buck and John smokes aren't saying a\nKnife not nice things about Japan ... they're not paying nice to my team they want the other team to what they wanted Milwaukee to when they were saying nothing but nice things yeah 'cause Joe Buck and John smells would rather stay in Milwaukee and extra three days in LA\nHappening here matter trigger law current and former boys oh it's really\nOdd ran the palm palms down stop being ball washers just call it what you see that's it Joe puck and John ... aren't rooting for the Dodgers to lose okay the Dodgers are going to lose because the red Sox are better\nIf we can ... because right match and maybe on the take All right and and again I'm not here to make any reckless claims up but it but it does appear to be a little bit fishy and what we're watching All right uh\nJonah stocks Fox Sports

books you Jackson and they're going to part ways with Todd Haley\nIf they decide to part ways with Hugh Jackson and promote Todd Haley to interim coach that will tell you everything you need to know\nThe thought and opinion on Hugh Jackson\nIn that organization because they're not a good football team it's going to be a little while they're better than they were\nBut you watch Baker Mayfield he's supposed to be an accurate pastor that was one of his strengths coming out of college Baker Mayfield always accurate with the football he's under sixty percent completion percentage\nOne of the knocks on I'm coming out he's a little too small all of a sudden the weather's starting to change he's starting to play and difficult environments and he's hobbling and talking openly about how he took a beating in that game and that his body seen better days\nSays stuff like that I get ten or twelve year veteran Kris Chandler was saying stuff like that towards the end of his career Steve to ... stay in saying stuff like that towards the end of his career when he had a splint on his hand it looked like a Nintendo Power glove\nBaker Mayfield already saying that and he's like seven games into his career so you're the organization you've got to look at this and say All right we're ... we're invested in Baker may feel that's going to be the guy that's who we're that tour with here he's the one that's got first priority\nOur head coach has got an awful historically bad win loss record\nAre offensive coordinator apparently doesn't like taking orders from the head coach and apparently doesn't know how to handle\nOr young rookie quarterback and then we've got a quarterback that we've invested in Hussein and who's going it's going to be Baker Mayfield I\nI Would I highly doubt they would make a move in season if they do I think that just illustrates at what you watched on hard knocks the sort of a friction you saw early on there and training camp between Haley and Hugh Jackson what you saw there was a ...\nYour deal then we realized and it's only deteriorated since\nSo it's like ... that's but that's part of the reason why people don't want to be on hard knocks\nPeople don't want to play on Thursday Night Football I don't want all my flaws exposed\nI I don't I don't want to do I mean have you ever had a fight with your better half your at home you guys have a fight
