crediting the home crowd at Miller Park is\nTo making your plans that night you got a buddy who never shows up sometimes or or doesn't show up some times where you get a buddy that's never on time or

knows what will be nine thirty or he won't show up at all\nBut it's the dependable ones the ones that you don't expect\nThat gets you the most disappointed\nOur assumption was the raiders were the next big thing the next great franchise they were it and it was all based on one year because of one season\nWhen a lot of things went there a way that year outside of the day or car injury every bounce went there way this schedule was set up perfectly close games in which they won two point conversion Les Mis field goals laid a lot of things when the Oakland Raiders way that season\nAnd because of that we all assumed that it was a sign of the times it wasn't\nWe overrated that team\nThe disappointment that everybody's feeling about the Oakland Raiders now world poking fun at John grew in oh it's still a hundred percent John ... no it's not\nIt's our fault as well too because our expectations were completely out of whack\nJust go take a closer look at that season I just broke it down for you think about that year and then think about you know really were they not good\nBecause if you look at those games and you take a closer look there's a lot of laws on that team of all playoff teams they had the second lowest point differential all season long but we were so enamored with twelve in for and the idea that the raiders were back that we overlook that and now we blame John Gurdon like he's the reason the franchises\nIs where they're at no no we're the reason the expectations for the franchise or where they're at we got this wrong and if you're a raiders fan you can think back to that season you know a lot of that twelve and for was an illusion you know it if you're honest with yourself\nDeep down you understand going back a couple of years\nYeah there were a

Fifteen minutes from now here on Fox Sports radio\nWill have a conversation about some very very be bizarre behavior here in the world of sports and stuff that needs to be discussed right it doesn't make a whole lot of sense and it needs to be talked about I Will be the one to do so that's coming up here in about Fifteen minutes from now\nHere on Fox Sports radio so every single week here on the show we started doing this a couple of weeks ago um there's look\nYou you were infiltrated your brain is infiltrated with stories and narratives and reports and sources and everything else that goes on and sports talk radio all throughout the week\nBut there is one man who can clear it all up there as one man who can let you know whether or not\nTheir actual stories of importance or whether or not you should take 'em all with a grain of salt and that man is me [noise]\nSo many stories in the world of sports than most of them are a complete waste the time she um she reports [noise] let's get kinky here some of the big stories from the last week but Joan is the real question [noise] do you\nCare [noise]\nWe turn it over to our executive producer Mike mayor [noise]\nWho if he doesn't pull this segment off\nIt's going to be the last time he does it I'm Serious it's going to be over for for my ... doesn't pull this off here it's and that's a wrap attracted to the show doesn't go well for my marriage the last one of these friday and Saturday shows he's ever going to do here with me\nI'll put my foot down on the ground on not messing around our walks when that joke later on aren't so Mike mayor or what do we got as far as stories in the world of sports in the past week\nAll right so let's start off with one that happened actually today out of the NFL or my Cleveland Browns the Cleveland Browns traded Carlos Hyde to the Jacksonville Jaguars for a fifth round pick joined us do care\nI don't I don't give him about Carlo side to the Jacksonville Jaguars I mean look at letter for nuts banged up um there's it clearly there's something more going on with Leonard and for that but I don't think Carlos Hyde makes a difference in Jacksonville I don't think it does anything to to Cleveland or there was a log jam their running back so to me\nKind of a non story in the NFL next\nAll right let's start off oh what's it continue with this one a Jimmy Butler home debuted at night are not home debut home a first game since all the chaos in Minnesota for for some gives so he was booed and then got envy peach ... do you care [noise]\nYeah I yeah I actually do care um and I actually want to get into this a little bit later on because I'm really really confused as to what the plan was there like I think\nI make up your mind man what like let me well what happened there were they silver when the game started and then bombed when the game was over and they forgot everything that happened in the off season it just I don't I don't I don't I don't get it I Do want to get into it later on because it just doesn't make a whole lot of sense to me that's\nAll right uh this is an interesting one I Would of major league baseball former New York Yankees manager Joe Jr already was in contention for the reds manager job but to yet today or yesterday he pulled out of the managerial search joined us do you care\nDon't you know I come on man reds managerial jobs I mean come on [noise]\nYou know this I mean this brings me up to a funny story Andy ferman who's a Fox Sports radio legendary Fox Sports radio host you hear him every Sunday Morning after I go off the air ... for bag is one of my good friends in the ... in in the business one of my good friends period\nHe went on the air with a story a couple of years so funny [noise] we're doing a morning show together and he goes on the air\nBecause one of his neighbors because Andy lives near Cincinnati and he's really connected he's alleging there Chris Collins worth his first radio partner his first partner in sports media period was Andy from\nSo and ... gives Andy from an a shout out in his book and says anti taught me everything I wanted to know about uh sports media and so they're ... you know to this day Chris Hondros still gives them credits and he's really connected in Cincinnati and he comes out with this report and says by the all star break the\nReds are going to fire their manager and they're going to hire I I Believe it was they're hitting coach or the or somebody from the front office is going to come back [noise] that guy was there another two years\nI was like he went on the air force had everything going with it he went on the air that after that I just couldn't I stopped caring about who the reds manager was going to be an anti can't get it right I have no interest in talking about it next\nAll right so you talked about are the ... in the last segment Joan this but this was one of the more interesting stories that we can game for the CIA so when running out of play in the tenth inning many Machado collided with haste news Aguilar Jonas did you care\nI did because at first I thought man what a dirty play by many Machado what have you tried to ensure the guy and then you realize that ... are\nKept his foot on the bag for an extended period of time if you watch him when he makes a I I catch it first base or he makes an out he's really excitable and uh and that rubs people the wrong way in in major league baseball circles they're talking about Machado is so dirty and\nHold on a second [noise] wasn't Milwaukee trying to trade for Machado at the deadline [laughter] what do we watch it like it's like it's like you and your buddy\nAll hit on the same woman at a bar and he ends up with her and then a year later\nThey break up and he finds out that she's cheating on him and you say to the man I told her she was bad news\nYou hit on her to ... what do you mean like\nDon't don't come after the fact that tell me you you knew way ahead of time they were trying to trade for mainly Machado in fact they were one of the teams rumored to be the closest to get much either so I did care just because there's a lot of hypocrisy in that whole story next\nYeah that's a great point All right so let's go back to the NBA there was a report from the ringer out this week that said both Jimmi butler and quiet let her don't want to play with LeBron James Jones do you care\nI mean it's the start of the season and already were being force fed\nWhere these guys going in the offseason stories I Am so tightly hey NBA if your product is so bad\nThat we don't even have opening chip\nIn the regular season before you start putting the pieces together to where somebody's going to go a year from now you understand that you're telling everybody yet this season means nothing we're only focused on that\nLike that that's the only thing we care about like this season means like stop forcing these storylines down our throats\nYou had a month we have given you July we said be spectacular in July make major\nNews won't give up our fourth of July holiday will put down the beer will put down the shore to American flag shorts will put down to the the flags will put all of that stuff the fireworks will go away no more spark lawyers\nWill will toss or pick a little Pete's if there's a big signing in the NBA we will give you fourth of July and the entire month of July [noise]\nWhy do you need to extend it into your own regular season I'm tired of it go away\nRight so I kinda think uh I Know where the next one's going to go but I'll I'll ask it any way out Paul George said in an interview earlier this week that he would have joined the Lakers if the Pacers didn't trade I'm Jonas do care\nIt's unbelievable man it's just started this season and we're already hearing the NFL never does is\nIt like you never hear this in the NFL unless somebody's got to hold out or something like that nobody is nobody in the NFL is is looking a year from now to say hey who do you think so and so and if you are if you're one of those people that right after the NFL Draft is over you start to look at the top prospects are next year\nGet a life okay the bodies aren't even cold yet and you're already previewing what's happening down the road smell the roses enjoyed the season stop force feeding us these stories [noise]\nKnow did this criticism of John ... and put it solely on John Gurdon we got to accept some responsibility we expecting them to be good based on one season but if you actually do the research you realize yeah they weren't all that great to begin with I'm All right\nSo coming up about ten minutes from now you're on Fox Sports radio there is another NFL situation that is really really bad and a lot of people are surprised by it but I Will tell you why you should not be okay it's a completely different organization a completely different franchise\nSome bad things going on so we'll get to that here ten minutes from now here on Fox Sports radio do won't let you know we are brought to buy discover card become a new card member and discover card will match all the cash back you've earned dollar for dollar at the end of your first year learn more at discovered dot com slash match\nLimitations apply so\nThere was a very very bizarre behavior in the world of sports on friday night and it was in the NBA\nSo the Minnesota timber wolves had their home opener and\nIt's been kind of a strange off season for the Minnesota Tim rules by the way they won the game so congratulations to the Minnesota Tim rules there on the board a big win a holding a just a just a tremendous defensive effort by the Minnesota timber wolves holding the LeBron less Cleveland Cavaliers two hundred twenty three points\nBut it's been a strange off season in Minnesota and\nYou know the Jimmy butler stuff and not wanting to be there and then calling a practice and there was a he took the third team and they dominated the first team and then I just miraculously there happened to be a sit down interview right afterwards almost like it was all choreographed just typical MBA drama\nAnd so it's been a very very bizarre offseason Jimmy Butler clearly doesn't want to be in Minnesota up you would have signed the extension and there wouldn't have been all this talk and all this friction deadlines and teams that he wants to go to at all the all the stuff that's gone on so home opener friday night\nAnd the fans did something that a lot of people expected they boot Jimmy Butler I get it you know you're pissed off with a guy doesn't want to be there you boom mics all of a sense in the world\nUm [noise] then they boot Tom dip into the coach I\nGuess that he's making the personnel decisions and you're not happy that he wasn't able to trade Jimmy Butler and and it's a bad situation I get all that\nThen they also booed Kevin Love who hasn't been on the team for years but ah they decided they were going to boot Kevin Love also ... and then they came back later and they were giving Jimmy Butler MVP chance before the\nGame let me tell you what that is that's\nFood drive through when you're hammered your order never makes sense none of it makes\nThen you ever pull into a fast food drive through obviously you weren't driving 'cause you're not that dumb but you're in a new ... or a buddies driving designated driver\nIf you order a cheeseburger it's fine\nYou order a side of fries understandable cheeseburger fries makes all the sense of the world um you also didn't need the jalapeno Poppers the onion rings the chicken sandwich and the shake\nYou didn't need any of that you would never order all that when you were sober it doesn't make any sense of the world it's like you just now notice the dollar menu when you were rich and\nUse died you know why don't we just get that whole side I Will go with that a couple of breakfast sandwiches way too much food you're never going to eat at all it's going to the the rappers going to be open you're going to pass out and by the time you wake up in the morning the breads going to be stepping stale and they tell you waste\nOf an order it makes no sense whatsoever\nMinnesota timber wolves fans got to the game like they were hammered at a drive through and decided you know we're in a blue that guy and\nI'm sure it's just our here are going to pull him to\nAnd if you want to look at that and the VP chance that makes\nAny sense what are you guys doing Jonah stocks Fox Sports\nRadio when we come back you think your NFL teams bad shoe on this next year on Fox torturing\nHey

nights\nWhen the Denver Broncos went on that run\nThat's a good of a job he did he then went to San Diego to coach the chargers but because they had the worst luck as far as injuries go and they were playing in an outhouse\nMean they may as well put a a crescent moon and some toilet paper inside that stadium it was an outhouse and they ... they had a ... a going away party when which Philip Rivers

scapegoat he gets fired on friday\nArizona was projected to be bad before the season they were projected to be the worst team in the NFL based on over under when totals before the year they were six or six and a half I remember doing a segment on the air\nI remember talking about this that's how much of a life I have that so many exciting things have happened since then but I remember the cardinals\nWe're under when total right so that on the show you who you're listening to your on Fox Sports radio but I remember doing having a discussion about this thinking man I'd hammer the over\nAre you kidding me like I I'd hammer the over\nThere's still decent pieces on this team David Johnson and Chandler\nJones and the quarterback situation better and Larry Fitzgerald and I I I mean I still think there's pieces on Patrick Pearson still they're like I think there's pieces on this team you could argue you've got to all of famers in Patrick Peterson\nAnd Larry Fitzgerald and you could you could make an argument that Chandler Jones is on his way to being a hall of fame I think he's got the most acts in the NFL the past couple of years\nI think there's there's legitimate town on that team I Would have hammer the over I had no idea they were going to be this bad I had no idea and here's the other thing you didn't hire\nYou didn't know you didn't know what this team was because you never got a chance to watch him but this just goes to show you that when you play on a standalone stage your flaws get exposed it's why so few singers are comfortable singing aka ...\nIt's ... it's what makes good tar solo so so ... so difficult because if you watch that on everybody hears it\nI remember playing I was in a band\nFor years and we played a long time ago at this place called the whiskey a go go artist on Sunset Boulevard out here in LA legendary spot all the bands from the eighties went there it's it's like a rock and roll Laura legendary spot there was a a part in one of our songs\nAnd we remember this because it was being videotaped at the whiskey a go go out here in Hollywood there was a part in one of our songs were the guitarist had a little bit of a guitar solo\nUm but we didn't realize that his guitar had gone out of tune\nIn between songs and it wasn't noticeable because all the other instruments were playing and before he really noticed it the song was already going so it's not like\nWe can stop and say hey everybody quit it uh we've got to make sure we're in tune and then we'll pick this thing back up you know we're not telling a TV show we've got a limited amount of time\nAnd were on stage so he doesn't realize that his guitars out of tune until the songs going and he's got a solo part for about forty seconds in that song\nAll of a sudden it gets to his part and he's standing up there trying not to laugh as he's playing the most awful solo because he's completely out of tune and it's on video and you can see me on stage with my head down because I Am\nAbout to keel over I'm laughing so hard and we're so we would have never known we could have gotten through that whole song could have gotten through it all\nBut because it was a standalone stage and that was his part that's what made it worse that when people screw up\nThe national anthem if there's a band playing you can ... through some of the lyrics you forget when you're doing it Super Bowl or are all these other times that that somebody's got out there it's an awful look the Arizona Cardinals were bad\nBut you wouldn't have noticed it because they'd be piled in ... with a machete games all of a sudden standalone stage\nThat temple on the top of your head now it's in the middle your forehead hairs not covering that up unless you got a unit brow and if you do you got double the problems\nLike that was no surprise man if you watch any of their football games throughout the course of the year that was no surprise my McCoy getting fired you can make the claim bad

feeling good about themselves extra innings a walk off by Cody Ballenger man\nWe're on a roll and they won the very next game because em obey thought it was a great idea to start a game after a Thirteen inning extravaganza a you know what we're going to do we're going to go ahead and start a this next bad boys two pm that makes a lot of sense just like a you know setting up a\nCertain fields in stadiums where fans can reach over into play and take a ball out of the year that makes a lot of sense to have a major league baseball there they're brilliant\nThey've figured this whole thing out so their schedule and makes a ton of sense it's kind of like one major league baseball said uh you know even though the cubs and the brewers and the Dodgers in Rockies Dave finish tied for first in their divisions\nBut you know the cubs is one of their head to head match up and the Dodgers one there had dead matchup against Milwaukee in Colorado so so clearly the solution is I'm a one hundred and six\nThe third game to decide the division which makes sense so major league baseball decided is scheduled this two PM game and so the Milwaukee Brewers came out and they were flat and the Dodgers pulled away late into the Dodgers are up three two and then they got to Milwaukee in the Dodgers got smoked on friday and so now we've got a game seven\nAnd the game seven\nIs awesome for all of us who aren't Dodger fans or who aren't brewer fans I Can't wait for it I don't have a dog and the fight what do I care whatever happens happens I mean personally\nI Would like to see good things happen to the Dodgers organization because our flagship here at Fox Sports radio am five Seventy LA sports the home of the Dodgers a lot of good people a lot of cool people that I Know and I like over there so I like it when good things happen\nBut from a fan perspective\nThere's nothing like stress free big time sporting events there's really something to it\nBut if you're a fan of the Dodgers are the

the family go get a couple of drinks\nWatch comedy special you cannot escape the idea that there is a game that is going to determine your mood for the next several days and you've got nothing to say about it\nNothing to say\nIt's miserable anybody who's been a fan of a team was ever gone to a game seven especially if you're a fan of a team who had somebody on the brink and then yeah last game six\nAnd then you went to a game seven you know exactly what I'm Talking about it is a miserable feeling\nBut on the outside we get to sit back stress free\nWe just we just get to enjoy baseball game it's one of those things in sports that isn't it's not like anything else else in life because if you walked by somebody and you knew they were struggling or they were having a hard time with something you'd stop and you try and alleviate the pain\nLike you do whatever it is to try and help them or anything I can do can get you anything is there anything you do for you here we are to fan bases the Dodgers and the brewers who are miserable in anguish anticipating\nThe potential doom that's going to be presented to one of those two franchises coming up here in less than twenty four hours and you know we're all doing counting down the hours waiting to watch I it's it's crazy bad but that's just part of that game sevens\nIt's all on the line you get to sit back so I tell people there's something about stress free there's something about going to an exhibition game where it doesn't matter you really want to want to care enough\nPlay some money on it but there's something about just being able to enjoy game without having to be so stressed out about it right now up until first pitch\nIt will consume at Dodger fans and brewer fans the entire day\nJonah socks Fox Sports

way\nDown for that as well a figure it's been treading ... we've got to get into with lots of\nGood sports though no doubt no doubt we'll start in the diamond was talked about a second ago brewer is being the Dodgers seven to two forcing a game seven in the national league championship series Hastings Aguilar at three other teams eleven hits you also drove in three runs from Milwaukee they're off the engine ... for the Dodgers\nFor five runs in three innings of work game seven later tonight on F. as one first pitch around eight or nine eastern time Walker abuser the rookie for the Dodgers taking the mound Milwaukee will go with your lease chalk seen all my car shopping can be confusing not anymore with through prize from true car\nNow you can do the exact price you pay for your next

tipping on but go ahead basket with under I second remaining\nKevin ... leading all scores with thirty eight point Steph Curry at thirty one clippers with a victory over the thunder in LA and ... thirty one points to rebalance what's around so they beat the Celtics fellas [noise] fetch you figure\nWe are the fellas recovery live from the guy called Fox Sports radio studios that's right\nYou could say Fifteen Percent or more conference with guy cocoa tobacco dot com or call you on the line for seven although\nThe hard part figure out which way he's easier but we have so much to talk to is a bevy of sports a wealth of riches let's start with the baseball because a sick I Know that you'll be Mr Dodger\nThat lasts like hurt because not only do I thought the Dodgers had the better starter in review against Mali last night\nYou can score first at the top of the first you get the run early\nAnd you start to think All right you know this this start you need and then all of a sudden ... gets bombs\nAnd the the brewers tack on and don't use hater\nYeah that's the double whammy the fact that hate or didn't even have to enter into the game because the Dodgers didn't even pose a threat\nToward the end and the same thing that's been plaguing really both teams throughout the series the Dodgers especially since they live and die by the home run ball most most nights they get a couple of guys on base Machado I had a couple of guys on base early in the game and of course\nThe fans rightfully so went after him and he struck out a couple of times uh so yeah it it it gave the brewers a little bit more confident going back home getting themselves a victory and now they have all the confidence in the world\nGoing against the rookie Walker bealer a later tonight so it's going to save up to be a pretty entertaining game seven but yeah if you're if you're the Dodgers you feel like one got away from your you didn't have the greatest game to start it thought he come back and put a little bit better\nUh last night and that didn't happen and they robbers let them in the game and he said we want to have all hands on deck for for a possible game seven we had to have\nReal get us through some of those things they could have easily taken him out when they were down three one it implode it's about five to one before he lasted another inning and they had to take 'em out so this is one of those chess match type of games where you have to get ... out of a guy because you know you have to have save some of your arms for potential game seven so I don't I don't know if I\nToo much of an issue with it some fans did but I understood why robbers left him in there\nYou always can be interesting because I Am trying to figure out this game tonight and\nThey have their thing he's so big because he looms you could go they can use it for three any\nNo doubt absolutely you can stretch 'em out like they did in game one\nAnd he hasn't pitched in four days that's the amazing part of it so easy that plenty plenty of rest they got up and started warming up today but like we mentioned didn't have to use them that's a huge haste to have in your whole for a guy that going to come in you know and if I may have to say they get out to a one or two nothing leads at some point or in game seven later tonight\nI mean you can bring in eight or the middle any the no Bridget over thicken able in some of your other guys Jeffrey's on the back into the bullying free shots at the plate to try to attack on yeah no doubt you didn't necessarily even had to bring 'em in in the closing or you know seven eight nine situation if you're up by a couple of runs you bring 'em into kind of bridge over the middle innings that's a huge advantage that they have and the Dodgers by the way\nI haven't used Tim Lee Jansen a whole lot in this series either now he hasn't been as dynamic as hater as being this season killing has dealt with his own share of issues\nBut are both guys are both teams I should say what they're all star relievers or in the fold or should have plenty of ammunition to go on game seven so uh she'll be a good one\nSo figure who take their manager\nI still at the Dodgers to be honest with you there battles asked it they've been here before\nA Walker below nothing phases him the guy the guy's unflappable he's a very calm under pressure I Know he got rocked up in the early and he's in his start against the Atlanta Braves before he settled down in ... and retired I Believe Thirteen consecutive batters after he got out to a\nA five nothing deficit so he's not someone he gets rocked and have had this confidence shot early so I think he's going to be ready\nTo go and game seven it's just a matter of those bad stringing pessimist together like they were able to do in game five\nAnd that swing for the fences or the doubters can find a way to do that which I Believe they will I think they'll end up coming out with a victory in game seven so that that's my my original prediction was the Dodgers ally in six games\nOr somebody's got to extend it one more and give it give it to when\nI log a lawyer I like it broke I like it\nNow a real quick Tio a subject I Need to get this shirt\nMuch figure feeling that Lincoln has your shirt\nOh say how many freaking Kennedy Kennedy that's amazing [laughter] are you are you there oh\nYeah [laughter] that's pretty sweet little story behind it first of\nAll I Need this shirt is all in all fell is half to have this shirt [laughter] I I I have a picture of what gave me with a cigar or you may not be died piece goes on may or may not\nBe but he's got a shirt that she's licking freak academy on it\nAt our Web that shirt\nWere crazy that's sure cause you're\nPutting the onus uh we got to live well we've got two hundred dollars just to me a couple of years ago was that somebody had asked when I was a at an event\nYou know who are you are you and the the guy was standing next to me and one of the fans of trying to get out of ... like you know that is that's like a freaking Kennedy so I was one guy in Jacksonville gave me a shirt and so now when I Do a parent's is I like to whereas in all in fun and just so yeah that was Lincoln\nKennedy I'm where I I Want that I Want to show that's amazing [laughter] Vicki and I was in a doorway present for Mike\n... we got to have like a freaking Kennedy shared by the way it's cool shirts black T shirt yeah whoever our liquor freak you got to be like that people go well what's that about that's great that can be the hottest shirt around man\nNo doubt no doubt on I I Love it I Love it\nBut there's your baseball work will continue to break down James seven Dodgers and brewers but it is a\nCollege football Saturday and a big college football Saturday and I'm a trusted Lakewood you look at this thing and you know we've been talking about ...\nAll all year long pre season the whole\nRang right I'll ask you the question can they be beat\n\nWho tease him we got a hard time about what they're now oh I thought we were had his knee today\nYeah\nI haven't looked for for what it's worth I don't see anybody misspelled what's going to beat them until they get to the SEC championship and that's probably the only time you're going to get challenged\nBut he was the best player on the floor he shot ten for twelve west I\nIncluded gets three seven boards these scores thirty three and ... as well the big shots and he helps to the walls beat the Cavaliers\nOne thirty one ... data way without Jimmy Butler like he said he got he can't win without me me\nMe you got to have me and it adds to the game\nThe picture swipe at his teammates are we there were disinterested ... you know the the there were ... but meanwhile the fans who blew the ...\nLike there were after they started me Barry body yeah [laughter] really\nA very good ... what do you just put when it's got\nIts own just read it all fair big per second ... ... ... ... what do you think of that like [noise] you\nAlready know because we weren't together for a long time to me no one's above the book\nSo anybody and I don't care who they did what they achieved anybody can be booted anytime I'm with that being said want a guy comes out and says he doesn't want to be on the team or doesn't want to be somewhere anymore especially in this day in climate I I think you have to move them moment because it it it becomes a little bit toxic in the locker room you mentioned several situations with no after he came out of the court\nYou know or the cold shoulder teammates coach told her to the coaches administration he's on everything he can to to to disassociate himself from them he's unhappy is clearly unhappy but he's a good player\nAnd if you can't make somebody happy in this climate the way guys are away people are athletes in general then you you have to move from\nA but but I'll go and write and I agree that ... will be move but yeah but I also under what you're in a way a base\n[noise] like I have like how you reacted as your your all over your boom\nAnd then you start cheering and then you Jan every day\nAnd then also shows you there's there's no loyalty there's ... there's no loyalty you if\nYou're a fan of booze you can't turn around and ...\nAnd ... that's that's the I have a problem with the fans you don't train the MVP after someone and it comes out and if you boom you ... what does it change your your ... your own mindset drink I Know you're not happy but you scored thirty three tonight yeah you're my you're my friend I Want my Jersey back now that you'll be you'll be you'll beat the cab exactly\nThe LeBron was cats\nRight now I mean ... I mean that's outrageous\nThat is that right just usually give the fans of credit for being smart I mean ... and and definitely you know there's a ... of some ... I Want to give it to sort of me\nBut uh I I much covered this for a second Michael what'd you think it is\nI think it's truly bizarre I think it's truly one of the most bizarre things I've ever seen 'cause you guys know me I'm a fan through and through and even as the Cavs fan while you're squad right yeah and I mean\nIt it was actually more competitive game then probably in should've been I mean they were born them out and then all of a sudden the cabs are within a few points at the end of the game but it's like\nJimmy Butler said he didn't want to be there like make up your mind I hear you might make up your mind what you want to do bad like you you you can't be the guy that goes yeah I Want to ... him I I don't like him and then white\nTwo hours later you're like yeah he's the greatest thing ever he's the envy P like yeah it's going to make that doesn't make any sense does it make any sense it's like I get like it's like Oklahoma City thunder fans like immediately like OK though he Kevin direct comes back in the warriors Jersey and they're like yeah\nThank you for all the great time it's like it doesn't make any sense\nNo no it's ... it's ... it was completely bizarre I mean not for profit fake how the world do you ... can you cheer him after you boom\nGotta get I I don't do that\nVery bizarre\n[laughter] as I that I have no way to describe it except as extremely bizarre I don't know how you can have that within yourself to be able to do that doesn't make sense to me I'd rather just be silent descent and cheer him exactly so surprising I Want to talk about fans coming

to cover cats like sea and the hard radiolab [noise]\nIt's time for ... and more with Mark Emmert and Dave O'Hara mark is a reporter covering University of Iowa sports for the Des Moines register in the Iowa City press citizen while Davis a former Fox Sports radio TV and ESPN Radio Des Moines\nOtherwise I mean ... already played so he he's she should be good um I think that's it for the office of injuries honestly\nDefensively before we get into that looked like a one yeah let's talk about that you'll nickname and rumor has it might play or ... or can a little bit or as a chart of we're looking at having start or what what's the prognosis on Nick\nYeah sounds like you're going to be back an outside linebacker uh after two weeks of a ... a hooker playing there and really part of that is not just that he's helping he's part of their best linebacker but also this is a very running team and and the last two weeks it's they play these kind of spread often says these a passing teams which is why they like poker and that's ... better\nSo he should get back I think how could they be out again at a middle linebacker and so he's practiced this week so I expect Christian Welsh to get a second start there I thought he actually play very well against Indiana asked first group started middle linebacker and then of course Colbert's been kind of the un son guy\nLast two weeks so you're talking about a red shirt freshman that was a safety at this time of year ago so he's been quite a remarkable story I'm writing about him for the Saturday paper because\nUm I think he's a really really good and uh and they needed that uh well if he had not been there I'm not sure what the answer would have been\nSaturdays register or I trusted us ... both go check that out folks want to highlight that mark I didn't want to break a little news hear what the heck right I mean they're not the guy here's let's do that so be sure it will check out every day but I have the opportunity in specific has marked chocolate is academically is Saturday to kind of cool and I apologize I stepped on you they're so go ahead and finish high budget\nI'm Talking to us all injured on the defense then uh it looks like then hooker moved back to safety which is unfortunate for dino stone because he got to very very good games at and it was a guy that's a show many deserves to start but they've got three that safety is making we used to sell from now on men out there but I Do think going forward\nYou will make it how could they ... they can use more of that package that showed against Minnesota Indiana with with the hook or being more of a hybrid linebacker ... because if you're playing a passing team you want to ... get out there in that back seven and he definitely gives you that so uh I don't think geo stones or time here is\nKind of been diminished ... you know necessarily going forward I think it might be this week but in terms of they they place them spread teams coming up especially northwestern is gonna be they want her to a an article ... stone and ... and those games\nWell you mentioned the key point is well marketing another key point which is let's not forget upcoming ballgame just nice to have death is nice to have a ride it because you're going to all types of teams not just in the Big Ten\nAs injuries go they're going to have to adjust to a no fly as well so when you look at let's look at a ski medically then you said ... as you mentioned again\nI'm it will uh money Jones you mentioned with a name and playing let's talk about the status good good words we've heard now a nice change for a ... it was kind of not in the doghouse but you have a better term doghouse I'd give us a few thoughts on ... yeah\nWell it's interesting 'cause he was eligible to play in the second half last week and they decided to go with Welch instead he did not play on defense last week he did come out on special teams so it sounds like Welsh may have a surpassed him and that pecking order I think we'll find out what how could they comes back in ... gets his job back you know\nAnd then I ... I neglected to mention the quarterback since I was the big thing that they're planning to start to freshmen again this week\nBranson moss got a brand has been fantastic they didn't they didn't look as way on Saturday to Indiana didn't last Saturday I think he had to end up with one tackle because they were afraid to go his direction and and they went mosses Russian got one touched down in him again just like Minnesota did\nYou know they could be ... and they had was they had Michigan be\nYes they did in in Evanston but the guy that again like when they were asking them be kind of true not Israel part sells the legendary real parts that will tell you mark your record no big\nTeams played Michigan that while this year round there are there and and I think that's interesting about them is that they just give up and the one game altogether because they've lost their their top running back now and uh I think they had\nLike single digit rushing arts last week has won a game and and um they just pass the ball I've got a quarterback they just throw it all over the place and so that that's a fun game I think in a in a few weeks and they come here\nYeah and you know when you talk we joked about Nebraska but when you change any chance I get to buy a little dirt on Nebraska said I'll take that so that's why again pardon me fans for overlooking they're proceeding cook when that huge when now in Nebraska defense as we both said they should it be northwest when they had Colorado beat in Nebraska a couple of weeks ago there have been some\nStrange occurrences and uh so let's take a look at a few of the things is in last up a four or five minutes of the show that we have this week mark so is there anybody so we talked about this with Michigan State in Michigan I wanted to highlight that Penn State game last week has [noise]\nIt's kind of like that deal with Wisconsin you know a losing before with Iowa and then I got I got or they you know they're going to come in Madagascar coming\nNow Penn State loses you know and and with with Michigan State I was not surprised that you and I both just said that's what it would then Tony does and so it goes in there again do you take a nap in Michigan State is really kind\nOf shocked when the laws are very surprised when they lost that Arizona State although that's a tough place to play late on a Saturday Night for a Mid East or\nEast coast I guess each ... each each times on the in the Michigan State so that's always been a tough place to play if they're even decent\nSo they lose that game but then you know so you have you is it just he's reaching those kids now it's a change of scheme a change of power is is a Michigan State team going to be is it going to give Michigan as you said a low scoring game could you see an upset there Saturday with Michigan State beat Michigan\nI'm sure he's he's ... he's had her boss number or has been there I mean are they have one\nOr more than they lost that series and the last decade so a lot of it's kind of a horrible Amish hospital Michigan is a very impressive I mean what they did a Wisconsin was very impressive that that defense is legit yeah so uh it took a really weird play a as a member of\nA two years ago to be thought to beat them so I'm well see I I don't think it's gonna happen but it wouldn't surprise me\nIf you find it interesting though mark ... as as that I that when you looked at Michigan and then you see the record when I jokingly said as you were saying that everybody seems to have some made some had against him are brought in Michigan that is his first\nTop ten when he was like oh when ten they they covered that on game day and I I mean yeah I guess you realize it but when you start looking at an aggregate and stacked up the losses to Michigan State the losses to Ohio State and then to rank teams in rank teams at home rank teams on the road he has really\nPun intended here fumbled the ball when it's come to some top competition here\nRight yeah but things may be different this year there as well as you said the last ... yeah and\nUh they're only losses at Notre Dame which doesn't look that at all now so we'll see this is the big test for them obviously so so rival big\nTakeaway for this upcoming Saturday what we should look out for we both in our production scores who is going to be your start again going into this game beforehand we'll talk about obviously afterwards next thing what do you think's going to be a star for the ... Iowa this week and who's just on defense do you think\nWell I mean on the fence I still think I'm On a hooker is really a big key to everything they do um he's going to have to be really really on his game against the run especially a which is a he is very good at I mean he's a very good tackle rent space\nKind of gets those guys lined up a offensively I think I'm going to go with a I'm not saying they'd be torn young uh between the title that as a as a pretty good game he was almost a hundred last week on the end up in Ninety six [noise]\nUm I just like him I mean he's not the not the flashy guy but uh I think we need a few yards he's the guy you go to so I'm going to go to our young a kind of having a breakout game\nI like a different take from you I'm I was going to go I I like to join young as well I think Stanley in the past ... it'd be more of a run happy I'll go sergeant just for the heck of it you know and I hopefully I can can throw nice enough but I bet I I agree with you it will be back\nAnd I'll go I K R A sergeant just enough to be trained but so many different ... defense I'm going to go with on a return I Wanna say nickname and on the comeback oh really I'm going to say he's going to have it impactful I Hope he does I Hope he makes up laser plays enough\nThat he can do that so I'm going to go with a nickname for that yeah absolutely is their best flying back right yeah so it's really so like you said he's great kid and you know I'm going by what you're telling me to the you know one of their best talented linebackers we'll see how well they can recover from the injury I look forward to that yeah absolutely well\nWe are on record for our picks we're on record for our stars of the game prematurely obviously beforehand say things to the list is also

Jones who are the life of the party who can really ah live and things up\nIt keeps everybody loops and what do you have an office that multiply as you know multi layered here you know you got it in a passing game that is right now I'll pass basing that running game and that's only because the other teams are trying to take the run away I think you're seeing a team that's enjoying themselves because they have a lot of success\nHere find that forcing other teams to decide okay if we go nine in the box these got had actually beat us with the passing game yeah that's what happened last two weeks two weeks ago Minnesota went ... they're going eight no matter what and I was wide receivers beat him last week Indiana blitzed and left the tide in single coverage in both men were not her ...\nAnd as far as the big picture energy\nAren't on just 'cause he works or you know the guys just a guy when he was on the field energizes your to and it just makes things happen money does the same thing on special teams [noise] so you know you might call the steps and you don't appreciate the full value or\nWhat they do for a football team\nPlayers like those two guys that have such positive attitudes and they're they're tough physical players are by nature to me they just kind of picked everybody up and\n... most of the exam points programs my last Twenty years history of a guy who just you know energize the football team I'm certain players have that ability ... got a ... degree uh if you're not big on physical but he's he's reckless I mean he's not you know\nAnd they're like the as big of a physical and it's not but\nGuys really I think just help help energize the team and then give them\nBit of extra drive now get a very a bit of a curve ball is that white joined young it was coming into the second half to bring that energy [noise] ah no I mean last week obviously started with the with the injury to Kelly Mart yeah\nThe Kelley Martin is the most complete running back on the team I mean he's able to do so many different things um you know catch the ball back he's got a good ... but the thing is when he comes in it's instant energy and he runs like a bowl and sometimes I mean I remember the opener\nThat was perfect timing it was hot you got an opponent that you know getting a little bit more down and then you bring in your big physical running back and they can't take him\nAnd I think he's got he had that huge and now that it's getting cold and you know you have Kelley Martin in in its ... charging in there for a little while why not throw torn in there and do and then they get something different and I think that's what he's more of the change of pace\nThey need it just didn't reverse to what we're used to we used to the the big tough guy had lost Sean Daniel ... being the the er counter punch that the other way around [noise]\nHistory wise today um some of these guys back\nNickname and it sounds like he's back and that's going to be important because the team is the last two weeks is what two more of a five defensive back look a call ... ... cash personnel\nBut when you're playing a run based team like this you want to have more heavy duty linebackers Nick demon so best linebacker so he's coming back it does not sound like jak today is is there yeah [noise]\nWhat do you see happening across the street here in a two and a half hour I think they're going to slow down Maryland are going to force Maryland to throw the stack box Maryland won't be able to handle that Iowa will probably be more work than like an office and less explosive except for the winds that they're back\nA heightened you know I I did die with thirty one sixteen I think that maybe a little high scoring on the Maryland and things\nBut uh you know this is a tough physical team though this is not a net Maryland team they are very very physical so\nYou have to be cognizant of that if I can bring its usual physicality I'm either guy wins it probably decisively this is up to Marilyn program though who we have to admit is far ahead of where everybody thought they'd be given the disarray that happened in the offseason without a doubt it's really impressive to see what Matt candidate done\nI mean you know I think next week is when they uh make their final ruling\nI think It's Tuesday on what they're going to do to the uh\nUh the coach DJ target how they're going to proceed so I think the fact that they've got more when they ... they beat that you know the blackout of Minnesota they a detective who's ranked I think that that's the thing about that yeah and also they does good things and then\nYou know they want to Michigan but then she gets a really good team and uh you know so the temple which was really unexplainable problem is there a hundred and twenty fifth and passing and it's really windy day ... so that that works against as well as the environment making them one dimensional which is what the opponent usually try

close\nWe've been doing it for nine sees I'm sure it's not hard to believe that staged a few years yeah\nNo it's great you guys came up with this three point play All right which is a unique partnership with the University of Iowa and that's not the fans and their driveway shooting the three pointer that's like a three point playing basketball and all kinds of things explain how it works and where the money goes\nAbsolutely so the Walmart three point plays all about eating right moving more feeling better pretty simple right keys the better health but we partner with the guys that means that we're sponsoring every field goal throughout the football season and then every three pointer throughout the men's and women's basketball season\nSo essentially make a journal contribution for every successful field goal and three pointer and that goes into kind of a charitable bank and then we actually asked fans we need hockey fans to participate in up to nominate a community to receive those funds the seasons and\nAnd then what will do with those ... is really invest in the health infrastructure project that could be a park playground trail cool so so far we supported over a nine projects really throughout the state a courtesy of Well Mark in the hot guy so it's been an absolute when when partnership\nSo I'm driving down the street and I see some kids actually not staring into a screen and playing at the park and throwing a ball around that so Well Mark\nThat's the whole idea yeah so we really think success on the field kind of begets success in the community so that's

everything goes smoothly so smoothly and the fact\nThat you when the first fourteen games of the season\nAnd then your general manager calls you and says\nHey Jim you don't think you should play anymore starter for a couple of games and what was your first reaction\nWell you know I wouldn't put all of a bill you know one of those things that ... something that we had always done I mean you look at the previous season we'd always those last couple of games if we had the ... playoff solidified home field advantage solidify that we will and indeed rest of our players\nThat was different because we had lost the game of perfect records are there yeah there are several times when they lost a couple here and there [noise]\nUm so but nevertheless we didn't want to deviate from our formula

to build off of after a summer filled with this much turmoil as is any team as you know should be able to avoid is\nA you know I think it's the certainly credit to to not only a ... candidate but also to stay up and and to the players to kind of hold it altogether and\nA ... it's been kind of a rallying cry to appoint a Maryland certainly has had its share of ups and downs or\nYou know success

the guys in preparation\nAs much as anything or ... with the differences in in the nuances of this Maryland team it creates a situation where players really have to be focused in and and the assignments down throughout the game today and\nAnd uh you know ... I I think it's an interesting time for this game to pop up I think it really a a gives the coaches dumped into kind of catch the attention of the players are coming off of a couple of successful weeks on the road that the new national ranking there's a lot of reasons why I kinda\nYou walk through this one but Marilyn present an opportunity for I Would be very focused today\nOne thing to look for for the guys that can they clean up the penalty is something that Kurt fair it's mentioned to after the victory at Indiana and then also a this was a um a ball hawking type a defense that Maryland throws out there they've got the twelfth picks this year so now they're going to be trying to force turnovers and flip the field\nAnd family labeled at one of the most physical defenses that that I always seen today which when you consider they played Wisconsin a couple of weeks ago that's saying something and uh there are certainly some things there that they need to be taking care of and it starts with cleaning up penalties making sure that uh that part of the game is a little cleaner than it was last week\nKind of turned into a flag fast at times but I'm both sides but uh you know I think that this I Would deem a winning has been focused I think they had one penalties for five yards against the badgers a couple of weeks ago that they can play some pretty sound football and they're going to need to today\nSteve real quick your view on the big tend to west heading into this week's gas you get four four teams have won last now a Wisconsin is open the door a little bit for for Iowa or you know produce hanging around in northwestern with that a a half\nGame advantage from from playing in early conference game as it is sitting there in there as well and uh you know I was still in a situation where they can kind of control their own destiny they're going to need a little help but a Wisconsin schedule is very challenging moving forward especially in terms of road games at Purdue starts to a very brutal stretch your schedule right now\nWith the night starting tonight with Ohio State that they visit Michigan State next week and then the hot guys come or to West Lafayette two weeks so ah it it just the tuition where there's a lot to play for a for a lot of teams\nAnd I and I think that catches as this group's attention to a ...

eventually will probably be feeling pretty good tomorrow but ah yeah that's exactly you know all we want to the end of the more than those guys can play and you know better it is for all of us\nIs one of those games where really all three phases a really executed\nWell yeah that's something you implant complimentary team football uh it's how you win games though you know specialist\nAbout the teams that a great job your hand on the when the day like I said often obviously dominated so you know defense and we just went in there and we got stops and when we needed to\n\nParker has the our Iowa ...

very good football team goes for instance a tremendous job appreciate the way they play the fundamental\nSound as they had was an entire football team always have great place to play a great environment to play in um obviously we didn't play on all things with the same sound this we had only had three driving the first half\nI'm the first one in ... the second one started with a penalty\nOr when it was a turnover on defense they had we had to do that for Syria to defend them to feel goals they got the one touched down late there\nAnd then we got on the ... so they did a great job obviously the ... was windy and I thought they did a tremendous job of managing that run the ball and get moving stand you know getting the first person down on all things we didn't do that and you got to defensive guy sitting here\nOn the field a long time we've obviously got to get them off the field a little bit like they did convert some third downs but on all things we've got to play better and uh it comes back to sound as it comes back to the to not shooting yourself in the foot so that falls directly on me\nAnd I will do a better job and we will come back next week and we'll play sound her\nYou know we often like to see them actually got off to these sort of throwing the ball\nThose conditions\nI guess he's houses there were a number of drive that hurt him or\nDoes that play into you know with your office where you have especially in a row where you have a place to go to the\nYou have to make poison um you know I think as a quarterback when you sometimes you throw a bad Mona guy makes a great catch and you have to realize you through a bad ball and then sometimes you throw a good ball and you know he doesn't catch you can't you know every place in exploit you have to\nYou know your mind is the most powerful thing in our body and if you don't see yourself making a play and then you don't make it so I thought he went out we I think the first pass we got also got a first down on the first play right to a job as a nice play against me orange and um and we went down in God's a certain three and actually under snap that feel like we had a good play they're coming up so\nYou said it best on you have to make place that's what it's about and um\nWe didn't make enough on our fence and and again I I'm really proud of our our defense play and they held him to sixteen points right because they gave him seven\nWhat would you know they got we got to get 'em off the food a little bit too and uh let's say you know it just wasn't a very good day for us on often clearly\n\nLately and drive more than I think [noise]\nI don't know I don't know I mean we do we start we couldn't you said the first time was a snap a second drive we got a really good play the guy called back because we got a false start\nOn the third drive we got a couple of first towns and went through the interception um so you know\nShouldn't have thrown at rice shouldn't call it if we run it and running up the mental and that's not good at is what it is but the first African we had three drives and we were down we were down six and we were down six six zero with with not much time left and they went on and made a play\nUm you know and and to get it to Thirteen we still had a chance that went out there and the second half and and um we didn't get it going and obviously we had to turn over in the end zone which is just\nCompletely unacceptable and a disappointing so\nI'm just too bad for our defense senior take some of the nation was we had to just to use the motion he just didn't time it up correctly at the motion guy with the ball and put it on the ground so we had two more turnover was on office today both with the quarterback so we have seven turnovers on the year for all the quarterback position\nIs this is all over you sort of\nTouched on it said\nLose lose anything like this it would be you know informal circumstances that would be you know it's hard to have to have to stay together with what's going on in Maryland and and\nYou know the the Puerto Ricans next week coming out of the findings is that makes it harder or the and how much more challenging does that make it as a host not knowing what what is going to happen or not knowing even when it's going to\nWrite I think you know there's a million answers to that question done and I appreciate the question but the answer is we're going to get up tomorrow we'll don't worry about the football game that we just lost I'm going to do\nThe best job I can do much today like she pointed out wasn't very good but I'll be better tomorrow and our kids are going to stick together tomorrow we're going to come back we'll don't play practice tomorrow when I turn the music on and we're going to condition a little bit Monday they're going to go to class we're going to come up with a better plan and we did for today\nAnd that's the answer and we can't control anything we don't know I mean so there's a million answered the dancers were going to focus on our job\nIs the best you can with what you've got where you are right now we're sitting here are really really really wish could have played better that's really all I care about if this exact moment in time to a foreign three\nCould be better could be worse so we're gonna wake up tomorrow move on to the next [noise]\nI got to tell you I really liked

very much Ralph okay live guy go far sports registered as easy to say fifty percent or more conscious of Geico guy could are comical eight or nine four seven out all the hard part\nFigured out which raises your let me ask you that so we were talking earlier ... joking around about a Dodgers brewers tonight like could tonight the ... last game with the Dodgers good tonight be many Machado last game with the with the Dodgers now those are two very different questions\nI'm I'm Wondering this about Machado in Hartford this off season ... everybody's saying three hundred million dollars three hundred and fifty million dollars or whatever it's going to be\nIt's funny though because just a year ago we saw a baseball contracts look very very different and the owners were suddenly not ready to pony up\nAt a lot of guys had to I mean\nGreatly adjust [laughter] the expectations that they had for the contract that they were going to get it and even the guys who got 'em like an advertisement San Diego like they had to wait I mean they had to wait till February in order to get it done\nI got to ask this to me baseball's Cato explore\nMaybe giving something to the players so that they can get something in return and that thing that they get in return\nA cap on contract length baseball's bizarre you'd never see this it's not legal in the uh\nThe NBA and\nYou'd never see it in the NFL because the physicality the sport unless of course you're coaching the raiders but due in baseball\nGet handed out ten year deal too long and I'm trying to remember anybody in the room can anybody remember one of these ten year deals in baseball\nWhere at the end of it years seven eight nine ten the team was still pleased with the deal\nNo team in the decade never I Can't remember any is too long a rod\nPool halls a look what's happening with Kurdish are right now I hate to break his Dodger fan she's got an opt in there's got to opt in and you're probably not going to like it you're not going to get your return on the next couple of years because of injuries and just normal aging\nI'm I could go on and on with more deals when you sign an eight nine ten year deal in baseball almost by definition you're saying a this has gotta stink on the back and\nSo how willing our team's gonna really be to line up for ten years three hundred and fifty million dollars for Harper Machado\nYeah it's going to be\nIt's gonna be tough 'cause I think the decision that you're trying to make in today's game depending on I guess the economics of the franchise that you run the return on investment out as many Machado McDonald's twenty six\nSo I was on the boats twenty six yeah maybe they get to thirty six you still we'll see you will not be as good at age thirty four thirty five thirty six as you are going to be a twenty six twenty seven twenty eight twenty nine\nYou're stuck holding the bag here would see but the problem is they're going to compare those deals to to deal with that of all we already been spent\nWell let me let me pass along a deal to you that ah I can explain pretty well but I bet America doesn't know about because that's what the San Diego Padres not a national bread did you see what they did with their cars were last year no say here's the deal the deal is eight years\nI think he got eight years at a hundred and forty four million dollars here's the thing though after five years Hossam or can opt out of it ... it can be like nope no thanks and the reason they gave him that opt out is because you're six seven and eight his salary goes way down\nIn other words we'll give you\nTwenty million a year for years one through five and then we're going to give you about twelve million a year for years six seven and eight\nSo very smart thing for a team to do because of the player one without ever like a reverse more yes if a player wants to opt in after five years you're going great except for can expect that age thirty five you're not going to be a twenty million dollars a year and a guy anymore\nSo we go over pay you on the front and write and underpaying owned\nA bad hand if you are still pop and if you're five you hit thirty home runs and driving a hundred and twenty and bat three oh one go be a free agent\nOpt out ...\nNow that should be the blueprint that's a nice I don't think it will be from a child on Harper their names are too big and they're too productive\nBut I don't know man I don't I I just don't feel like this off Steve is going to be as easy as everybody thinks it oh just manage outages show up to the winter meetings and here's your three and fifty million dollars for ten years congrats maternal man that's not the way baseball teams are thinking about it anymore\nAnd they shouldn't\nDo it I mean that that's a good deal isn't it that's a nice deal flip it a little bit everybody's happy the football the equivalent to that kind of deal\nWould be what the eagles used to do with their young players and I think you're seeing the rams do it with a girl the brand new and cooks um when the rams extended to a girl the owners do it was an extension\nTo the end of his current deal okay so this is the only deal that they will probably do it to a girl that he won't get another big deal everyone is talking about the money no oh it's Thirteen million per or whatever\nBut in time as we're seeing contracts only go up and as a CVA is readjusted you would only get bigger in three years the deal that ... will be seen as a bargain\nAnd that is a theme to just look for same thing with Brenda cooks rented cook still has another year on his original Ricky contract before this extension kicks in\nThey are getting them at bargain raised because as we've seen them money escalate or their bedroom junior that were Eighteen Nineteen billion dollars well you know what's going to get into the twenty million dollar range of some point sure you're going to have your does under your control\nAt a deal that actually plays to the team once we get past midway point I think it's more\nIt is smart I mean that's why you know when you when you look at some of the young quarterbacks ... whatever signed these big deals I mean you're really you're playing that five your window out and you're going well what what what we think about this deal and five years if the guy can't play you won't be happy about it but in here and\nIt's actually going to be a middle of the pack deal by the end of it\nBut at the end of it right yeah yeah I'm All right mark road Bucky Brooks and coming up next we're so glad you brought up oh Dell's name I Want to talk about or do back him coming up next to or not or do back um junior oh yeah that's that senior box wars radio [noise] [laughter]\nI don't know I think maybe because people are accustomed to doing it is a lot of thing isn't the norm is not as never okay everyone has an opinion everyone has a Twitter town you'll say whatever you\nWant to yeah wonder wonder if I say it's always okay it was always okay I don't I don't care for that I\nListen listen I used to ... says the league is big for money that's [laughter] I mean this\nIs a little much gave us a ... it's a little emotion obvious little so emotional and I can get\nHow you know now we're talking about uh now we're talking about the\nLegitimacy of the sport you know for which\nIs your husband is obviously very famous and making hundreds of millions of dollars right I get so sometimes it's not just that you said something it's what you specifically said that was back in ... you're going to back it Kate Upton because she's mad and rightfully so\nAbout a banana land ... recall oh what a ball is\nHit a banana Atlanta land but now ... banana and I've never been in and used in a banana land oh you're here with me all the time OK idle at what was ... ... you're talking about the ... check this out\nMy son had this figure it out you looked at that and he goes well look if there's any controversy goes it should be a ground rule double I go why should be God will double he goes because some people think it's a home run and some people think it's announces just\nLet the damn difference that he didn't say damn he's eleven split the baby\nHere's the problem the ball was hit over the fence and you're assuming it's just a bad rule you're assuming that somebody can go five feet above the wall reached their back but mind the wall I catch the ball\nBut he he he had it right nobody didn't he had his glove was right in the mix it to someone move pushed his blood flows\nWell did the first Bush is that the Philip ... are you sure\nAre ya a hundred percent sure sure well but only on certain about\nOkay so that's my point if the call on the field is home run and you're on sure then how can you sweat you ... and yeah they ... well end baseball furthermore what you have is just a ridiculous setting\nThis whole idea that a fan who's excited about the game rooting like crazy their favorite team it's a ball more the fence right at them it's coming at them in a hundred miles an hour what's the eggs and philosophy a hundred twenty miles an hour doesn't say small hard studio\nAnd they should somehow get out of the way this is ridiculous it's nobody wanted one of the ... what is human being is going to do one one of them did 'cause one of them had their eyes closed when it was coming\n[laughter] yeah [laughter] I I might be one of the\nMost people will not get it [laughter]\nSo if you don't want a possibility of somebody's aren't being over a line moving back ... back whomever for your other option is to say hey man you go into the jungle whatever happens happens where he was yoga whoever comes out with the ball when\nMaybe ... end up doing a limbo leap from up there with you [laughter]\n[laughter]\nOh it's all I'm saying is Kate often have every right to say that whether I used to carry ... I don't know about that particular statement but she can sweet whatever she wants ... sweet whatever she wants and backup senior gets wear whatever they want I just happened to notice that when the guy do does nobody says anything no\nI'm fine with whatever they want to like you said they're Twitter feet deep thing do you do what's it like [laughter] but you like it was like\nA real addictive but um obviously what what you're saying is obviously the sexes because they're not gonna live women way in which you're not going to give me a hard time would they weigh in with their pain is only one way to be to view it", "show_name": "Fox Sports Weekends", "year": "2018", "city": "Iowa City", "day": "20"}
