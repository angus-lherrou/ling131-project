{"month": "10", "state": "IA", "station": "KXIC", "content": "A fairy land and I'm Glad you that I'm I'm Glad you're feeling well this morning thank you so much for the call or we are at ten before they our Steve in gardener Massachusetts Good morning\nGood morning here in the state of Massachusetts the rolling out medical marijuana now but a lot of the medical marijuana distributor certain now\nApplying for ... marijuana you know marijuana can for medical purposes can be used as a pill form as you had mentioned just a chemical that will help but it's really a big scam because it's ... and billions of dollars\nWith this recreational marijuana going on right now\nLike the state to get some of that though because people are going to spend their money anyway I I like for instance here in in the in the Michigan ballot initiative [noise]\nThey're going to have a ten percent tax on marijuana assessed on the retailers and that's on top of the regular six percent sales tax and they're going to split that revenue between K. through twelve schools and road projects so I mean at least at least you're getting some money from that is that helpful that\nIs helpful but exactly what you are saying twenty percent tax on marijuana what's happening why should a kid spend an additional ... percent you go to the gang members\nHere in Massachusetts or gang wars going on now to get the marijuana sales so why pay twenty percent more get it from a gang member so it's on the black market it's crazy that it's happening here like go to a recreational store get it from the local gang member\nWell I don't I'd always thought that the one of the benefits of legalizing it is that the price would actually be lower which would drive the drug dealers out of business so they would have less slanted oh\nIncorrect that's why there's gang war is now it gets that marijuana twenty percent lower\n... that's ... that's the law unintended consequences for\nBlack market and by the late Ninety nine percent of heroin opioid addicts started off with marijuana not good and for the long it's worse than cigarette smoke and I was going to pay for all along stuff that's going on\nNow is is that is that ... a comparison because I don't know how much people are smoking marijuana these days but I mean in a high school\nOr high school here in garden or fifty percent of the kids are smoking now\nOr but you're not smoking twenty or thirty joined today like you wouldn't be doing with cigarettes I was a point I was making I don't want to hear that comparison I'm always wondering how they make that comparison because you don't smoke twenty or thirty joints a day\nOr ... or however you ingested you might do it once maybe twice if you're a real hot head but I don't I don't know that that would have the same effect as a Carson ... carcinogens does\nOver long term it does okay there's more carcinogenic type stuff in the marijuana joint\nCannot be taken out by the way it into I'm Sorry\n... do you know if that can be taken out because it seems like the problem with cancer and cigarettes is a lot of the stuff that they put in it not necessarily that\nI'm sure I'm sure it could be taken out but it's not ... it would cost too much to take the stuff out to\nTo actually put the chemicals or whatever to take that stuff up and I say I\nHad anyway it's a big problem and we're getting the kids that are buying from gang members now and that's why the gangs all across the country look into it or starting to have battles for their turf\nWorld that you know that's something again I guess we uh you know we need to hear that because otherwise we would not know especially in places and what's the status of Massachusetts right now I'm a legally\nLegally recreational marijuana they identified to testing labs therefore it'll be rolled out the next month the recreational marijuana after that\nYou know it's still startling I was telling a producer David it was the only other day that the uh you know in in the district of Columbia recreational marijuana is legal and I was walking down Wisconsin Avenue here of around the corner from our studios and\nUh somebody walk by me smoking marijuana and I'm old enough where that still shocked me because I'm thinking oh I Hope he doesn't hope there no police around this guy's going to get busted and then I remember when it's legal now it just seems very strange to smell pot smoke in the middle of the afternoon on Wisconsin Avenue but I guess that's the world we are in now [noise]\nAll right thanks so much for the call very educational Steve I I really appreciate that very thoughtful it's are coming up on five before the hour let's squeeze in a final call from mark in Hutchinson, Kansas out there in the middle of the country\nBear morning mark\nMorning [noise] of snow ...

on your ... well you know I Hope\nPeople aren't getting tired of talking about the rain and the floods but I I wanted to do that little bit talk about it because um people are concerned uh businesses are concerned you know what what are we looking forward to are we looking forward to sandbags I can unequivocally say no sandbags will be done in Corvallis thankfully that's why we spent the\nUpwards of Ninety million dollars to protect our city um\nThere is that it's interesting there's been some district managers of some of the large franchises along first avenue in in a highway six that flooded back and wait that are starting to call the city and say that\nYou know what what protection are you giving our city and we said we have to explain to them it it is protected and as it is now it's just and we have a hundred percent hundred plus percent confidence that\nYou were if I was gonna say one thing\nOr the city council as well as you and Kelly and you're engineers\nYou were so you were so much quicker in my opinion than Iowa City to get in front of that flood protection you started in probably two thousand and ten or Ninety eight or nine and you were so fast to be able to read respond to that clear creek and I got to give props on oh well thanks yeah\nWell we knew we had to because I'm you know that this was strike to Ninety three with strike one oh eight with strike too and and the third one would have put them out so we wanted to get we did get out ahead of it and thank goodness and so anyhow I just thought I'd I have some numbers to share and and I I think people will find this interesting in terms of management of the reservoir um you know that's\nThe ... that's a real blessing that we do have the core of all ... reservoir above us because that provide some control um it's it's a bit nerve wracking sometimes because it's out of our control in terms of management of the water water that's being let out that's all\nThe Army Corps of engineers and um city engineer Dan hold her nose and councilmember Laurie good rich and I went over in August and to Rock Island and met in person with the colonel or who's in charge of the staff that runs that and pressed upon him the important to him and his staff the importance of\nOf the operations to ... and that we don't we the number one thing is we can't let it go over the top it's got to be the outflow so you have to be managed that we keep the water in the base in\nWhich they just increased I think on Monday\nYeah and that's what I was going to talk about a little bit that so that because it's an in an emergency state now they're they have a daily phone calls every every morning or between like the\nThe the cities represented Dan and people in Iowa City in the county and and so forth university and then the weather service to the USGS or the Army Corps of engineers all the players are on these conference calls\nAnd this is the data from yesterday so it doesn't take into account what happened overnight but I'm\nCurrently a as of yesterday morning about nine o'clock the inflow come the water coming downstream to the reservoir was coming out about um fourteen point nine cubic feet per se fourteen point nine thousand cubic feet per second that's how you measure it is so basically say Fifteen thousand coming in\nThe outflow is is that it's been at ten thousand for quite some time several days now he'll so five thousand mores coming in than going out so obviously the the the the reservoir is filling up\nAnd um as of yesterday it was at the level of seven hundred seven point too which is Seventy one percent of the storage capacity of the reservoir\nAnd that's an important point is people might say oh gosh there's Fifteen coming in only ten going out but it's only Seventy one percent of its capacity so you don't have to let out as much as coming in because that's\nThe idea of the reservoir and so I think people go oh gosh it's about ready to come over the spillway you realize how much more rain needs to come in in order for it to go over the spill at another thirty percent\nYup but on the other hand we we've got you need that you need that capacity to accommodate unexpected or large rain event to you you can only let out so much and so fast and if you let if you start at too late then no matter what you do start one twenty thousand is wide open the floodgates wide open is twenty thousand so\nSo the forecast I'm currently is for the pool elevation to crest on Saturday um October twenty so not this Saturday but next Saturday homecoming at seven eleven point three that's about six inches below the top of the of of the of the day of the reservoir there the day I'm\nSo I'm the outflow isn't a plan to increase the twelve thousand on Thursday and then go to Fifteen thousand on friday really yeah I'm so at Fifteen thousand I'm\nA it'll be held at that at that level of outflow until it gets reduced to a safe level and then we're saying that's probably about twenty seven days that would take at Fifteen thousand to get it down\nAnd so Fifteen thousand will cause\nI'm headaches but um for many communities but again not much for Korbel you'll you'll see things that were already beginning to see some things at this level\nOr things that were built to get wet like for instance the lower level patio behind them area in the wetlands park there and that's pretty much the brick so underwater now but it was built we knew it was going to happen that that's not unusual at all um several bike bike trails in low spots are underwater now\nTwo inches of rain have already fallen and a flash flooding into expected to begin moving downstream so watch out for those low lying areas and be safe just don't enter water of unknown Depp turn around don't drown\nI've already seen to flooded out cars within the past two weeks of people going I can just make it through it's going to be okay no I you might get lucky once you might get lucky twice but I can tell you it's really stupid or to try to enter water that you don't know or even if you do know the area if\nIt doesn't take much to be able to swap your car and we're going to be dealing with this and the aftermath of all the rain that if you fall on this week we're going to be dealing with it for another ten and possibly a fourteen days\nSo uh do turn around a interstate Seventy four

City city council and a next on your list well one of the things we're\nGoing to have a special work session October twenty third at nine o'clock or we're going to be discussing the report or for historic preservation downtown\nUh you know one of the challenges as you were ... and I were talking off ... areas that you know I always said he does have some growth challenges and one of the things we're not going to talk about his or her views on height or or put across gardens but you know the challenges as it's always been is\nIs we have this downtown that we love so much and Raul passionate about it and we really want to make sure that it grows but we also want to recognize one of those historic elements one of those things or want to make sure that we do everything our power to make sure that we preserve that\nAnd so we hired essentially consultant um to review an audit the existing historic assets downtown\nUh and that's now finished in October twenty third we're going to have a work session to discuss sort of next steps are what we should do in terms of policy um you know one of the things that we're looking at not necessarily directly tied\nTo this is transferred development rights in one of the things we have in our a river front crossings a south Burlington is we have this really dynamic process that allowed us to preserve it struck out it's like for example\nThe Tate arms a rooming house right across from the Johns county has been building that was able to be saved in part because the developer in that case was able to get an extra floor and the adjacent property\nBut also able to transfer some of those development rights that they could have done for the Tate arms to other areas where now in the process of looking at a city wide transfer development rights concept\nWhich I think we're likely and that was generated by historic structure that we had on I Believe it was Clinton um you knew the dorms Aaron North riding and so we're we're in the process of figuring out how do we sort of fifth district saw puzzle together\nAnd I think the historic preservation piece of it is is going to be key and so I'd encourage members of the public or interested in pursuing a historic preservation as well as growth uh to to to come to that meeting and observe what goes on at that particular meeting October twenty third\nAnd one of the uh one of the toughest things for me to witness was the I think I mean that brought it up with you the last time not the last time that we talked about I think it was an April\nUh that uh the historic preservation is\nWhat it it's described to be is preserving or historic structures\nAnd it was slated to be moved in two thousand and six the\nAh old building right next to the Johnson county court
