at the raiders game you heard people talking about my book down and they will tell me your story I don't know the whole story here\nYeah ... it was a it was interesting to hear people talk about our radio program and obviously I was standing in the background so they didn't know that there were listening airs but uh\nIt was to greater officials who were walking around with general manager Reggie McKenzie\nAnd the subject of Dan Patrick's radio show came up so you were talking about the DPJ show in one of them said yeah you know I wake up early and and I I go to the gym and that's when I listened to a clay Travis on the game and then after that I Dream\nThe damn Patrick show and then the other guy was like yeah man that quite Travis guy came out of nowhere and he's like yeah and he and his book he's got a book now and the other guy said you know the thing is I I like 'em but I can only take like thirty minutes of his show [laughter] and ah I\nHad no idea no had no idea you were working on the show you're just these dropping their right\nI mean because I did have to have a media passed and it said Fox Sports radio on it but obviously it doesn't say what show you're working with or anything like that and you know you learn early on in radio that a word of mouth is the best promotions so when you meet folks you tell them about the radio show and make sure they're listening\nI'm and before I forget by the way a couple of coliseum employees who listen to the show every morning on our affiliate Ninety five seven the game Walter in Selma I told them both\nI Would give 'em shot up they listen to out kick every morning ah up in Oakland\nUh it was really cool to hear those tomb raider officials talking about the damn Patrick show and kick the coverage and then so my job there was I was going to get a post game interview from the winning locker room for our weekend show which was Brady Quinn\nAnd Jonas knocks so I go down to the locker room and the pursuit of comes up to me is Marcia John Lynch\nAnd I'm standing there in ... in the first words out of his mouth I kid you not was\nWhat up [laughter] the N. word and she out of all the players he by far was the coolest he was walking around now he won't go on the air with anybody and he won't officially do an interview but he\nHad the best personality out of all the greater players down there\nAnd so I had to work hard for the one interview I got for the network and it turned out to be really good Mr pick six from the Ohio State Jerry on Conley who we talked about a lot on the show a couple of years ago when the raiders used that first round draft pick on him even though he had that controversy swarming around him at the time coming out of college\nHe was really good on the air they played Brent must burgers pick six a play by play call for him during the interview\nAnd he said afterwards and and I just kind of scared me because he's on\nMy cell phone live on Fox Sports radio and I hear calmly say oh yeah ... su he dropped\nA he dropped a a word he can't say when he was live on the network they spent a good five minutes with them\nAnd afterwards he was really happy and marched on lunch then came over to me and he was like oh man you got to go on the air when he doesn't talk to no bloody and he called me the N. word again\nAnd so was it was really funny because he's kind of like the court jester and their locker room and it was just walking around stirring things up he he told me Derek car would not talk to like go talk to you and uh so yeah ... march on was it was a clown but in a good way it was fun being around him\nSpeaking of clout and maybe not in a good way I think they're cutter may have made one of the dumbest decisions\nAnd the NFL season so far with the Tampa Bay buccaneers and what he decided to do I know Frank right decision to go for it in overtime against the Texans got a lot of attention\nBut I Need to dive into this dark cutter mass and explain what I'm doing and why I Believe that ... than it is now the new start or when they come out of there by week\nBut that game against the bears was such a disaster I think we need to dive into it and
