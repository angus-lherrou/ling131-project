I'll be\nLike I Can't borrow money in the United states because he's so long trustworthy so when he builds his golf courses in Scotland and Ireland you get all this money admittedly so from his son ... from Russia so what does that tell you about that I Know\nWell you know what I'm getting out of the thing is I Can't imagine Vladimir Putin is happy about this because he's got a very restive country a lot of people in his country are unhappy right now and his his ratings are going down which is a pretty amazing 'cause he was very very popular up until a year or two ago but\nHis writings are going down because of the economy being so poor there he does not want to have to spend money on weapons in if we do away with this treaty and the United states starts on a massive buildup\nHe's going to be under pressure to do the same and he doesn't have the money to do that so I don't I don't think that this is something that a lot of food and would welcome from if he's controlling President Trump is not doing a very good job of it this morning I'll tell you that yeah\nYeah but but but he did the same thing I mean he supposedly has already solved and North Korea but nothing came of that so what is that what does he have to worry about is all ... that's\nAll it is very much Richard always enjoy hearing from your let's talk to Mike in ...
