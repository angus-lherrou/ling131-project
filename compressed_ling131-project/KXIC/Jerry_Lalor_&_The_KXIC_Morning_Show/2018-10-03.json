Seventy\nEight where the members of Aerosmith bailed thirty bans out of jail after they were arrested for smoking pot during an Aerosmith concert at Fort Wayne coliseum stuff for them this week in Nineteen eighty six popular news anchor Dan Rather\nSo it's a thirty second change in in time [noise]\nIt will most likely reduce traffic speeds you know it's a thirty five mile an hour quarter but what you often see what four lane hers\nIs jockeying you know you see cars you're always looking I Know you're you're probably one of these guys right euro jockey you you you look for you know while we can remind ... always looking for the fast lane right so you're you're switching lanes and so forth so\nUh you know four layers tend to 'em and set of eyes or promote higher speeds higher speeds\nMean that you're stopping times when something should happen in front of you you know and this is one of the reasons for some of the collisions is\nA you know you're in that left hand turn your in the left lane you want to travel fast and suddenly the car in front of you stops because they want to make a left turn\nAnd you ... your rear end of the vehicle in front of you know that's that's really stopping time issue and and so it's based in in large part on how how fast you're traveling so if we can reduce the travel the traffic speeds\nYou know that's where the the improvement in terms of collision rates and the estimates are they'll fall around twenty five percent\nSo I'm as a city councilor I look at that and I think if if there's something I can do which will have a negative negligible impact on travel times that will reduce the closure and writes about twenty five percent and reduce speeds\nAnd then again to have a co benefit which is really just in my mind that at this point anyway a byproduct of the the bike lanes\nOf which over time I think what's what's the increased use or it's hard for me to say no to that project and I know it's in construction we're down to two lanes so we don't have the benefit of that continuous left her and land in the center which is really what makes all the difference\nUh and it's to be determined right so beat a term it has to paint on the road is rocking has brought up several times before a it's paint on the road and if it doesn't work you can always go back there I uh my solution would always be a go over to Melrose or take emerald\nWestgate\nFunds that and then scream across those residential streets in order to get around any of the traffic so [laughter] sorry [laughter] I had to watch I wasn't going to let the jockeying go completely away but uh you can always go through a residential neighborhoods if you need to get around\nI'm not an door saying that and I know I respect her position I'm trying to be light hearted about it but uh it's obviously a big issue so we're going to continue the conversation with John Thomas I with the city Council on Iowa city's new than sports station eight under ...
