Yemen are consulting roll their bad\nAll right thank you so much for the call appreciate it Tom let's go out to Seattle good morning Mike I understand you're going to get some nice weather today so that's some good news for you\nGood morning turkey has been a tumultuous situation they locked up what three hundred journalists recently and held our American for years and they want that guy from Pennsylvania do you think turkey is collaborating with Saudi Arabia and why why don't they released the tape if they have a tape\nYeah well that's interesting because as I say I said before Turkish president ... is not a paragon of human rights either and I've been surprised at how strongly he's been coming down on this I think it must be some kind of a rivalry between those two countries I doubt that he's that interested in a life of one journalist based on his overall record he's a tough guy\nSo that you know I Wonder what's going on there the other issue this morning as you have all these international corporations and all these foreign ministers\nFrom the G seven nations who are who are very very upset and pulling out of this big international conference and I'm Wondering if\nIf maybe this will be a wake up call to the king and the crown prince that if you want to enter the twenty first century then you need to stop this you cannot run this like after like a medieval kingdom anymore that you're going to have to come into the modern world and you cannot just you know do this kind of thing and they maybe they'll learn if they're looking at the\nAt diminished power and money as as the generations go forward here because you can't rely on what you can dig out from under the sand for much longer to support that country and they they've gotten accustomed to a pretty lavish lifestyle and they want to keep their hold on on the people in that country and once oil revenues drive up a good a dry up\nAnd there's no money to give to the populist and there's no food and no jobs\nThey know the veil be overthrown they're going to go their way of uh some of the other tyrants in that area so you know maybe this will drag them finally end of the modern world I think that's possible\nWell a sniff out turkey to who they are brutal dictatorship or they got to be sniffed out along was when we need to take a full investigation and then we need to take baby steps and get this resolved but my bottom pale will do a perfect job\nMhm well he's ... he's in Turkey this morning so maybe he's getting some answers and he'll come back and be able to tell the president what he learned a close up let's are sort of the\nProblem right there turkey\nYeah All right thanks so much for the call seven minutes before the hour let's move on to Green Bay good morning Jason\nMid morning I'll make 'em to ... points\nIf you go on the first one is I don't fully trust Saudi Arabia especially post nine eleven I think their hands are completely clean stuff and I don't know what we did examine this cheerful yes it does any of the countries that may have make it better for us\nPressuring relationship the Saudi Arabia and the second point is whatever story this journalist is working on their obviously has to be a grain of truth to them that they are as we can never would have been assassinated so closely at what he was working on its feet where that leads as far as a corruption than anything else that's getting started government\nThat's a really good point because of that that could a blow the whole thing open a course I could just be the kind of thing that they're sensitive they are not used to criticism so it could be something that to us maybe doesn't seem that critical are that bad but maybe to them it is of course who knows what they've got their first\nProtect got their fingers on I have no idea what he was actually\nA how close he was to anything that would that would give them that big of a problem he apparently didn't feel that uh\nThat afraid I guess he had a bit of trepidation which is why you supposedly according to some of the reports we've heard had his cell phone running\n... you know sending back audio to his fiance who was waiting in the car outside so he wasn't totally carefree about walking into official Saudi territory but he did it on his own free will we've seen the video of him striding into the building so you
