about it because of the prayers the prairie or you know whether you're saying one thing the one one way or the other\nBut you know I was forced if you want it to say out loud you had to say it uh based on religion different from yours and of course now at schools or even much more diverse than that\nUh you know at the ... you know I don't know that they're ... course you can't do that anymore you can't mandate kids to do prayers outlawed anymore\nAnd I know a lot of people are upset about that but for me it was on there was uncomfortable and it was always a little awkward and I was when I was a little kid and of course they were even at the time I think they were not supposed to do that but they did anyway at least a yeah when I was in like first or second grade [noise] but I appreciate the\nCall seems awfully lethargic old to me too yeah well and I'd never thought of the I'm the plunged ...\nI'd never thought of the pledge in that way I'll have to think about that because that had never actually hit struck me that way but thanks for the call this morning a Ryan we haven't talked to you in a week or two so uh what are you up to what are you thinking about this this morning as you drive into Kansas City\nI Hey Mike thanks for taking my call good morning I'm from the time that I was in elementary school and even pre school or in\nMilitary bases um early in my life I remember vividly that we we reached cited the pledge of allegiance and ... and ...\nAnd and as a part of this boy scouts of America I've I've always noticed at our meetings we we always always always reciting the pledge and\nI did too I was never scouts did the same thing and but here's the problem is if the parents the parents\nAre telling our our our told\nA according to this particular law that if if you're if you got a um consent form that is being a provided to the parents and now the now\nNow we find out that that a kid that parents who signed that consent form is being kicked out bike something is wrong with the lawmakers down there because it's like they're talking from two sides of their mouth mhm and you and I have talked about this before we cannot\nLegislate morality it touched it come from the parents\nAbsolutely okay thank you so much Ryan I I appreciate the appreciate your thoughts as always let's go to uh Lockport New York in mourning Richie\n... you're doing\nGood by the way it's about eight minutes before the hour for folks who are trying to get to work\nAt a push just all their whole career if you're going to the parents get power back and then ... what are they ... they got the conservative citizen of the United states that okay so why\nShould you do for a few shows like that doesn't even a ... and ... and ... and ... says the lord for our ... it was getting ready for him to do because I get the pay is going to district there's going to have been\nAdded up hearing are sitting at a cup of naturally I so I was going to do as I got older I looked around and say hey wait a minute\nIt was millions of dollars in the in the city and its taxes are people out every Saturday and millions of dollars and ... ... people so how's this complication like I worked for ... well they're not even ...\nI don't have a sort of a that was sort of what I think Kanye West or try to say the other day and his rather convoluted odd statement in the oval office the other day but he was saying he wanted to undo the [laughter] the emancipation amendment uh yeah I was not written by people who looked like him although I that didn't really make much sense to me but uh but\nYeah and there's always somebody in all ... and if you have all the streets and Sam is a huge bass and areas in and out yes if if if they look at the cowboys and America\nAll three have always been African American it was a Mexican trying to news but there are no life people uh-huh the only white people do what you eat out west and it just goes goes in a way of getting away laughing and it doesn't if people out there so how can I feel about this whole week I go to either of you that right is it ...\nWell you know you can see how much gets involved in all this because it has a right because we bring up the pledge of allegiance and there's so much meaning to it for ... for for so many different people\nAnd uh and that's what makes it so difficult now as the country becomes more and more divided politically even even the the pledge gets about him anyway thank you so much for your call ... let's go to Sioux Falls I'm Sorry I cut you off there when you were finishing your father anyway morning Greg\nGood morning how you doing I'm doing well how are you doing fine before they our now that\nYeah I think the best person ever explain a pledge was a skit that
