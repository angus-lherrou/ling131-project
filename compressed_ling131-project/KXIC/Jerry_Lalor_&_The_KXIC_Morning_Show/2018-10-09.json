right now a little bit of sun creeping through those clouds but don't expect it to last too long [noise]\nGlad to have the along the trooper Bob Conrad so we talked about or you know just kind of the rain and the ... a rain that just keeps found and across the state but there are more important things and one thing I wanted to touch on with the move over law\nA move over law went into effect July first of this year and basically anybody that had anybody not just the emergency vehicles anybody that is pulled over to the side of the road you gotta move\nExactly if there's someone on the side of the road and their their hazard lights are on or something going on inside of the road you need to move over and I will say are giving you know credit where credit's due I have seen a lot of people doing that in the past I had not seen near as many and it's something that I've had advocated for a long time because\nAnybody on the side of the road is a danger and I probably stop a in a week's time period at least a half dozen doesn't people there on the side of the road or that are just on the phone and when I stopped to check on them or whatever and I I always tell everybody get off\nFor him but I we have an off ramp every five seven miles sometimes two or three miles\nGet off at offering people expect people to be sitting there on the side of the road and slowing down speeding up people are paying more attention so when they get off and and our friends are actually looking around whereas I hate to say there's a lot of people out there just on cruise control going down the interstate not expecting that to come up\nYou know when all of a sudden it does actually on the brakes cause other issues and and if you're out there and just making a phone call and I and I\nUnderstand getting off the road to feel like a great idea\nBut just being sitting there on the side of an initiate it is kind of a bad idea to get off the road far as moving over that is huge uh you don't have a lot of time to react the way it is out there when you go in Seventy mile an hour plus on the interstate so when you move over for those vehicles someone flies open the door\nI mean things happen quickly I got ran off and the road the other day five vehicle and Kirby kept the curve too close and and uh it ... it was really close had I not been paying attention they would have turned out completely did you catch them I did I went down in the day I stepped on my accelerator got myself they're thrown mutt everywhere\nAnd got turned around and uh you know it's shocking because when you walk up to somebody and then they tell you something that's not true because this isn't second hand this is first hand I just got ran off the road I watched what he would do any wasn't paying attention he was cutting the corner\nAnd then he kind of basically in a sense wanted to lie to me about it that does not go well\nAnd I I Would emphasize ... empathize and I wouldn't say also is how many times okay you've been in a state trooper for twenty some odd years or maybe more and\nHow many times as a personal driver just in your personal vehicle do you go gosh I Wish there was somebody nearby that would be able to pull this\nYou know I'm a ... a phone booth let me change politically and I want to get out of car pulled over at agree with you a matter of fact it it's it's gotten so bad and I hate to say 'cause there's probably twenty percent of those people out there\nReally need to work at the drive in the other eighty percent of us get frustrated but the my daughters will be in the vehicle with me and like\nHere's a plate number and this card at you know and I'm like honey I'm not going to pull him over with you here I'm not going to do off duty I won't would brought him down later usually I now there are cases there's probably been a dozen cases in my career or where I have hundreds somebody down one it has something happened off duty there was that agreed to that so and\nThe worry is the water could top over the emergency spillway at that point there is little control over flooding downstream in coral bill and Iowa City I'm real fair to point Cedar

know have\nHundreds of people at a workshop you re want to pass people be more interactive and more one on one must presenter so yeah a couple of thousand people come to it um each year and I'm David purposes festival is what so it's a festival dedicated to exploring the unknown uh\nLooking at the creative process in ... new works so sometimes and when an artist presents but ... it's one of the first times that they presented a new work and oftentimes there's opportunities to talk to artists about the new work and\nI'm sometimes it's so fresh they're not even sure if it's the final product and it's it's kind of a cool thing to get to be a part of\nSo they must be some really interesting things that happen there I mean they are unpredictable and yeah they're kind of\nI'm just kind of a sub\nA subject for the festival this year where we're I'm looking at how to make the world a better place and I think there's a little ... to that like how can you outwardly work to make the world a better place\nAnd then part of that is also looking inward and improving yourself and improving the way that you can ... look at the world understand the world um so I think the thing to me that's most unpredictable about the festival at how people sort of internalized these things and how it affects their lives on by\nDates you last year I just I just wanted to stop time and absorb everything and ... for a while and I actually had to like skip the fashion and just like go and have a cup of coffee and like try to put it altogether I felt like I was being has been changed yeah by the

do\nSomething a little more experimental hum mission creeks pretty experimental I'll do but ah this festival\nThe idea of of debuting new works with really appealing to us and the idea of exploring the unknown so we're always trying to encourage our patrons to go to things that maybe aren't exactly in there we'll house and um we you know we're kind of if if the anger you know that that's kind of what we're preaching at all times like\nAll right you know this may not be like your exact genre of music or your you know you're something that you're an expert on in terms of a speaker go try something new ...\nUm and uh and so this is this is kind of the embodiment of ... that's what I read it and uh and I think\nThe way that it's put together it allows people to really explore so what do you what would you say is the target age oh well we we sold a ton of student passes and didn't have that one so student houses are only twenty five bucks I'm er twenty bucks I mean I'm In a two day
