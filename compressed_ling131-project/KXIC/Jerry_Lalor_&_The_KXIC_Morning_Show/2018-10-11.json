the Iowa City school board for not talking about just some of the expected changes not necessarily this year but coming in Nineteen twenty Twenty one\nCorrect that starting next year and so a program I Know it's something that ... and close to your heart and I and we talked about this last time that you were in something I\nI think we we can value from what\nAre your thoughts on it Oh absolutely um I I'm I'm a very excited uh that uh next uh starting this January students in the city school district will have the opportunity to enroll in the introduction to agriculture foods and natural resources\nAnd the neat part about it is from what I understand about this program and obviously you're more in tune with it is it's not necessarily designed for people that are going to be going in to egg but it really is designed to just understand how things are created in how we all work the land together absolutely\nIs that is that adamant absolutely and especially the the first year course yes ah it's it's an exploratory course it exposes students to a to a\nLot of uh experiences with their hands on activities and projects and problem solving a problem solving a students will uh be involved in communications are communicating and the science of agriculture plants animals the natural resources\nA it's a it's a survey opportunities available in agriculture and natural resources or where students will learn to solving conduct research analyzed data and work in teams and take responsibility for their work actions in learning\nWorking in teams right a farming is not something that you do or by yourself I don't know oftentimes that is a it's a family process right but neighbors helping neighbors and that's the aspect that I like of it is when\nWhen a student walks in and and understands where does their food actually come from no chocolate milk does not come from around ... right uh and understand that process I'm kind of I'm very excited about\nThe well I'm Glad in and I am too and and uh it's\nIt it's extremely exciting at the opportunities that will that will be able to provide our students and also the aspect of FIFA which is a which is a great to entrepreneurial\nA leadership farmers of America you're right well it it stands for FFA uh\nIt it it they did there was a and and that's another program just to just discussing how they went it it stands for FFA now it used to stand for future farmers of America but they had a convention and now it just it stands for FFA seriously seriously I like I say it's it's a complete other does it would my old school guard\nGay that's okay ah ... it was a learning it was one for me\nTo uh because and and I got corrected by a by by someone on our steering committee but anyway uh it it is a great learning act or I should say leadership or organization and provides great opportunities for our students are\nWith the those soft a job skills of you know looking people in the eyes speaking in public\nUh you know proper attire those things and and uh it it's just you know it's a great organization and I tell ya anyone who has an opportunity to uh be around these kids and ... they're just a great group of young individuals\nSo they are and as you may know I've been involved with the stem field for the better part of a decade and\nAnd uh uh seen kids come throughout her pay and getting active within it right it gives you confidence it gives you the ability to think critically it gives you the ability to learn all of those as you put it soft and the world trade for just\nDoing what we do as adult right\nExactly and you know the the thing uh that\n... that we noticed when we were going around and looking and other programs to their schools\nUm the vast majority less than a in most instances\nAre the vast majority of students don't don't live on farms or or even really rural or suburban\nAnd that the the opportunities like you say just to know about where your food comes from and and have a better understanding of of this enormous a job a field uh which one in five or jobs in our state is involved with agriculture and the opportunities that provides a uh is important that we have this for our students\nAnd the fact be it a that a larger farm operations especially in Iowa century old farms they're still around obviously but they are going away due to development
