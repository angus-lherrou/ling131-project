you've got individual therapy for the kids but you also have family therapy or 'cause sometimes those issues obviously affect the entire family unit and and\nThey may require therapy for a variety of different reasons we talked about maybe changes their things challenges at school but\nYou've got to trauma focus therapy as well might be a death in the family that was ... some of those services\nSure so informed therapy is one of our most important pieces of what we do and I'll be honest trauma informed laces every aspect\nOf our therapeutic um modalities but in some ways we look at ... let's say a child is having a real difficulty in school and cats are difficult like they ... gain some ... ... anxiety I'm prior to a test or\nTheir peer relationships caused them some difficulties um we have some behaviors and some things that were able to assess and then um initiate some trauma focus therapies that\nI'm really assess the therapist in um creating avenues for a child to be able to communicate the whys and the where fours of what they um have suffered whether like you mentioned it's loss or or it said a feeling of a lack of control\nUm or those types of things so when those type when that occurs we have some special therapies we also have some family therapy is as you suggested and one I Want to left\nIs a it's called parent child interaction therapy and it really is exactly what I just said what happens between the two way near is that parents can be working with their child with an earpiece and um and the therapist on the other side of the me or if he well\nAnd a coaching the parent with some um skill sets that\nUm help behaviors or with some tips if you will on how to address that child's needs and or that to a mere goes both ways therapists can be in with the child and that parent who knows their child ... better than anyone can use that same earpiece\nAnd microphone to share tips with a therapist so it not only helps bridge communication but it manages the child's behavior and teaches real time right on right there\nSo I was rather interesting and the of something unique there at the manager place again now we're talking

there for training and observation for the staff\nAs well as therapy for the children and their families so it's it in a space where the children feel I'm\nAt home if you will even though it's not their home it's their school they understand that space they feel confident there um it's a space that lens for us consistency because I'm the child doesn't need extra transportation to come up to the clinic or anything like that\nSo it'd veils a great deal of opportunity um we're very proud of our school based program the results have been significant not only that staff saying how much they've learned but also ah\nThe students and I'm telling us that you know this therapy this treatment has helped them feel I'm more successful in their world you know some of our kids mark do need to have\nA
