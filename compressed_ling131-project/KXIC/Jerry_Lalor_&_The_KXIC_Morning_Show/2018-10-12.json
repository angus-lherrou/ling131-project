I Love the books you know you know his book may movie then\nYeah well I just I just finished one a couple of weeks ago called the rooster bar which one of the things I like about that is that it's set in Washington DC I always like books that are set in DC when they talk about local things in the local roads in you know set the scene and I know the places that they're talking about\nAnd that's also a very interesting book because it talks about the scam of law schools\nBecause you know he's he's himself as a lawyer so he tends to write about the law and I learned a lot about law school is that I didn't know before while also enjoying it you know a fairly good story so you know as I say the critics don't like him because he turns these things out one after another seems like at least every year there's a new John Grisham book and\nI have to admit I always read them I've read them ever since the very first one he wrote which was um [noise]\nUh the firm yeah the firm I saw everybody where

will be posted in plenty of time but uh that is set to begin on\nMonday and as I like to point out also in the city reminds us at my ah [laughter]\nI don't I don't I don't do this without the direction of the city is be early on it\nSo it's set to start on the fifteenth so if you're if you're zone is scheduled for two days make sure that you again it's common sense be the date early rather than the day late they'll try to make repeat trips through some areas if time allows\nBut always be a date early rather than a day late and then the second piece to it also is uh just be prepared because\nThe equipment that they use four leaf pick up they also use for dare I say snow removal so as soon as the snow starts fine and they have to put the\nPockets on the front of the trucks and
