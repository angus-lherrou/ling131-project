I'm a buyer of Michigan at this point I'm starting to look at them and say they're not only winning but they're winning convincingly and there is a\n... I guess you're on the show on Fox Sports radio I'm with ya I I did the interesting thing about Ohio State we started talking about ... ...\nUm this is like for me in the NFL watching the chargers thinking how much better they're going to be when they get ... back how much worse is Ohio State considering they don't have are really the best pass rush or in college football\nIt's it's a big drop off 'cause he's a difference maker he's a guy that when he played there is always the threat of a sack you know a fumble scripted score you know he's such a different bigger force the quarter back into a bad throw where he's going to throw a picks pick six and they still out of a ton of weapons on the defensive side of the ball\nBut my thing is it's so much with what was the players\nI I was I was really kind of turned off of this Ohio State team I\nI think that you know we talking before when we started talking to a ... interview about players looking for the NFL now that I'm not gonna yeah I'm not going to cross Nick both 'cause it's a business decision I have no problem with it doing it but I Do think it speaks volumes that a captain on the team would say\nI'm good I'm going to go ahead you guys later I'm going to go work on the NFL as opposed to even if he doesn't contribute to the team\nI think it does mentally means something if you're a leader in there for you guys they're training with your weight rehabbing it giving you emotional corn on the sidelines and maybe just maybe come back and a big tent championship game and play sparingly\nBut at least he would be there for you I thought that spoke volumes that one of the captains was willing to kind of say goodbye to his he made\nAnd I think there's a lot of that attitude that mentality in that locker which there's been a couple of years which is why Ohio State has just whack that killer instinct that we're going to run the table that's why you saw let down last year against Iowa that's why you solve that down and get for do\nI Want to take and awaiting away for Perdue but it just feels like Ohio State of just missing something as far as their mentality\nEvery week and yeah that's a thought season\nAnd I don't want to overreact to Twitter but all of the other star players on that team supported him on social media are saying like like we we like we could get out of here we we\nWe would too I'm for it so so that's fascinating to me a was a zoo there sitting there ranked eight hey they\nDo have a lost to us see on the road a three point game they got to win over Oregon and potentially they'll have a rematch with either SC or or a Utah team who they escaped at home is there any hope for the pact wealth\nThere is hope I was actually pleasantly surprised that the committee last night at eight and the national release but I Wonder if that's kind of tease because you\nRemember the last time when Washington got in and they played Alabama and they got beat in the playoffs first route ... never the conversation surrounding them it was like oh I don't you know ... not very strong\nWell they'll remember member USC USC had those at USC when the league they or USC ... yeah but that was that the U.S he went to the now that was near us he went to the rose bowl isn't trying to think yes it was becoming\nThat Washington got into the playoff which allowed us to go to the rose bowl correct they played a state of the meeting ...\nYeah but you actually had beaten why was Washington that was Washington's only last year\nExactly but you remember the conversation ... ... very good\nWashington state will have the same dilemma because they play ... uh Wyoming eastern Washington and some other you know directional scored very good so they're they're not conferences questionable and I've always been a defender of the tax well because I think they even I each other more than any other\nBecause they play the non conference games because I think it's a deeper conference than in most conferences like I think the worst teams are better than the worst team in the big twelve or the worst thing in the big ... but this year the pact wealth is just\nIt's brutal it's a little bit of a dumpster fire when you look at or going to get the fire at USC get fire on a state they've got a bunch of team bundled up with three and four losses\nAnd only one team left standing and I still think I so there's that there's that question but I also think Washington without a tough time with Washington at the apple up\nAt the end of the year although my grades have something that he hasn't had a long time you always had often quarterback but garden issue but it doesn't have the facts and air defenses tops and most of the category ... and the fact well\nSo I Would give them a chance but I I feel like it's AT T's and I would hate to see the fact well without again and get on the outside looking at I think they need a lot of help from the other team to try to\nDanny canal from CBS Sports check out a

butler spoke with Jimmy Butler\nThere will be no third chance for any of those involved to get this right I mean what kind of a quote is that especially in light of what happened\nTo Jordan McNair so I think that the administration and the board of regents actually comes across even worse with their tone deafness and their set of priorities and I think the students in the community there are really holding them accountable [noise]\nYeah I I I Do think a little bit of this is social media him gone to muck and this you know the kind of uh the the terms a Lynch mob mentality right where we just like look the trainers have been placed on leave I'm sure they're going to be fired the strength coach was in fact fired um but the statement does come out reading super super weird\nI mean like I you know everyone is so concerned like part of the problem with ... like well he hasn't ... he didn't speak after Jordan me about German there after ... died and I'm guessing that's because the University of lawyers told him you can't say anything\nAnd what ends up happening is they say well DJ directing he won't even talk about I'm like well he's not allowed to because his boss like listen when things go wrong and a college campus\nAnd you work for a State University I Know my brother works for one he's worked for like five of them\nAnd I know 'cause I've been on one and he went to a State University and there's freedom of Information Act whatever\nYou either do things the right way by the book what the lawyers say or you lose your job and so my my my very very lemons assessment of this incredible tragedy is that a DJ jerk and was in any way they could find any trace of a true responsibility for his death he would have been gone\nAnd the reason that we haven't heard from him is because that's what they told them not to do and yes the board of regents that ... just you're better to not say anything but what happens is when you say the unpopular thing\nWe tweak it and make

in public\nThat's one of those things like look at all these NFL teams have a PR guy and they have a couple of PR guys and honestly\nOne they're all in on the on the team and a lot of times they they're so pro team that can be a little uncomfortable but there's a way in which you can utilize those guys would you call guy over like hey\nDo me a favor Everytime Jimmy asked the question I mean he's got like half a donut on his face and he looks like a ...\n... these slouching I can barely hear um it's it's an audible is not a good question can you just give me a favor I like the guy I Want to help the guy but my goodness it's kind of disrespectful al how he how he treats what you know that we're we're on TV or whatever 'cause you go that's the way in which you do it\nBut instead you call a guy out in front of all of the guys he works with and I just I don't I don't know that's where I'm completely in agreement with ... with you I understand his frustration I understand his frustration um\nBut I Would also say that that's just not time and place in way in which you do it [noise]\nThere's this thing about people that are\nA super heavy most of their life and you'll see a lot of guys who are really really heavy you know they lose a bunch of weight and it looked great and\nThey still have lingering back hip knee joint issues\nAnd so here's the you're the advice I can give you this is not you know once you hit your late thirties and in the forties\nWhether you're a former athlete or a guy who just wants to be an athlete now before you started kind of go on hardcore trying to be in great shape and play a sport you know do some high level of competition like the ... the piece of advice I have for you is\nGet your weight at inappropriate level before you do it because\nTechnically you don't pull a hamstring because you're ten pounds overweight or tear your knee because you're Fifteen pounds overweight or blow out of an Achilles tendon or any of these injuries like there's other reasons\nBut you're more likely to hurt your knee back hip Achilles tendon any of this stuff if your body is just off and if you're a little bit you know top heavy\nYou're a little bit sick sicker than you shouldn't be you're more likely to get hurt and then once you get hurt what do you do because you you know now you can't move and to put on more weight and it becomes a vicious cycle\nWell there's some guys that they've lost a bunch of weight\nAnd they still can't they still can't shake the fact that they were they were heavy for ten years or they smoke\nGuys and smoked for ten years and all of a sudden like I haven't touched a cigarette in Fifteen Years and now I got some sort of emphysema or a guy was heavy for ten years and he's now he's been in for ten years and he's got some sort of heart or\nUm [noise] you know\nHe had some sort of cholesterol issue\nThe fact is that if you carry too much weight for too long even when you once you get in shape you're still you're still almost going to be penalized for all of that time which are overweight that's come all Anthony in the NBA\nDo things with mellow air um first is\nYou know he he was never big on diet never big on being in great shape he was always just in good enough shape and a good enough score to where you get into basketball a get you buckets\nAnd and I feel for him and his play like he's at a he's a type of of score who is not utilized nearly as much now\nOr even if he was in his prime as it used to be like I'm not sure Tim Duncan would be Tim Duncan if Tim Duncan was playing now cause Tim Duncan like he's a he's a powerful word center scored the blocks score at the high ... guy Tim Duncan and shoot threes\nNow what do you learn to shoot threes I guess but would he be as effective no ... was great to a gym in the block you throw it out the window and we'd go in\n\nSo some of this is the evolution of basketball some of it is mellow was out of shape or not in great shape for so long that now his body even though he's you know early mid thirties his body isn't reacting well to being in better shape to playing in a faster pace because\nHe carried a little bit too much weight was a little bit out of shape for far too long and even now when he gets in shape\nHis body doesn't doesn't act like somebody who's in shape I look\nAt the rockets and I I listen I understand I I heard Jason Smith who of course a host the show at night say you know the rockets aren't going to get any better well that's not true they don't have James Harden they're going to get better\n\nBut last year the the they were second in scoring in a hundred and twelve a game\nAnd they\nAllowed only a hundred and four points per game this year they're scoring only a hundred and sixty game allowing a hundred and sixteen again\nIs it all male oh no no\nI mean some of it is you haven't had harden for half the year because of ... or ... year because of injury in some of it is you've lost and reserve who's a defensive stop or some of it is that Gordon struggled with his role some of it is mellow\n\nBut you're shooting forty one percent of the team is twenty nine in the NBA it's next to last you're tied for twenty first and three point percentage you've gotten worse three points shooting they'd gotten everybody else has gotten better\n\nAnd you're allowing far better fuel gold percentage deep at forty nine percent we'll go shooting that that's like a lab drill\n\nNow again this is not all about mellow but if I told you when they got him into decision by subtraction and he's still starting and this is one of those you we made the promise of weed stardom and we'd see how it worked out like it wasn't this is why the thunder got out of the middle of business\nCan't start anymore and honestly it's hard to find that role for him as a backup player because in order to be a bench player\nYeah you're competing against inferior players not as good guys come up the bench that's why they come off the bench or reason and you ... you have a shorter period of time to play so in theory in theory\n\nIf you give him fewer minutes he's in better shape better condition even at his age you can play harder defensively and it can be more effective offensively but that's in theory and practice Carmelo Anthony has been one player\nSince early on in high school up until last year and that player is give me the ball and I will get you a bucket that's been his role that was ruled Syracuse that was his role with the nuggets that's been his role with the nicks\nThat that's his role a team usa ACL timely a score and the history of team usa he is a bucket getter\nIs a is a sign that you are stable at quarterback that you know what you have I must be reading a different set of tea leaves the Nick writes reading\nI think he's disappointed with the ... and I don't I think you you don't know if it's wheat that they didn't replaced act that's a problem at the office of lines not as good as it used to be that's a problem and that the quarterback play isn't as profound as it should be that's a problem\nI grew up right now ... is the third best quarterback in the NFL excuse me third best quarterback in the NFC East their best that's behind Alex Smith\nAnd if you think that's good enough for Jerry Jones especially Jerry Jones which you have to pay him ... after the season a huge a contract extension\nI'm going to beg to differ I think this is the ultimate in hey we're going to go out and overspend on a wide receiver because we think we have a franchise quarterback but we won't know until we see them all play together\n[noise]\nSay well that makes sense I just I don't I don't feel like it's a known he's a I think if you know anything you know he doesn't have it and you got to cover up for it by going out and getting better players\nBut I I I think reasonable minds have told me in the NFL you only get to know if you give him a real number one ride receiver you give 'em running game and you fix the office of line and they tried to address two of those three in the already think they have the running game especially if they had the offensive line fixed\nSo thick that for what it's worth this is talk show on Fox Sports radio getting ready for Halloween music is gonna be manning the inlaws front door Ramos how do you handle given out candy you give out candy do you have somebody come over the house you have a grandparent give out guinea ... how do you handle that\nYes my mother likes to give out candy along with Sara Sara will give out she loves giving out candy better than accepting handy so we'll see how that goes\nYeah I I'm I'm seeing is the candy Nazi around my house now and the other because what happened was the ... one of the first times I ever got to trick or treat with my kids was um\nWas our first year here in two thousand I actually was a second years two thousand Thirteen to two thousand Thirteen let's hear my son was used to like four or five\nAnd my daughters were eight he was made before they were eight or they were there are seven and we go sugary and the first house we hit up they give us those super size like king size twitch bars are king size Milky way's\nNow remember they're four and seven at the time and they bust those soccer is open their unlike I we get what you get to eat one big bar candy and they're like one and my wife basically told me to go back home and hand out candy if you're going to be if you're going to be Scrooge and I was like do you know how big that candy is\nSo people my my family generally thinks that I'm too harsh in terms of the the amount of sugar intake now I Do I have one that's definitely afraid\nOf eating too much candy and getting her stomach sick my son kind of has that same sort of thing so they have a pretty good and then my daughter ... she she basically to run on candy here for the last three days and she'll run on candy until she passes out\nTonight but we have a DJ marshmallow I'm One of my daughters grace I don't know she's a some sort of cartoon ones that was his Japanese Anna Anna my enemy a Anna may and I'm a there's a there's a cat character from a Japanese enemy show that she's going as\nAnd then my daughter harbors going as a boxer with all of her friends are all going as female boxers\nSo I don't know\nI haven't decided to dress up yet I may go with me 'cause you know [laughter] I'm pretty scary as it is pretty scary this great Cosell joined us upcoming next made his take on all of these trades in the national football league\nUm

Minnesota timber wolves trade saga intensified today with news the butler is sitting out tonight's game against Utah record was set straight right here on Fox Sports radio is former NBA player ... they're both with Jimmy ... and then I was calling coward why isn't he playing\nEvery once in a while he'll make a throw that you go hey what are you doing and then that he may be that guy for his whole career but not enough where you say he's problematic I\nThink what all said and done he needs a multi dimensional offering that features a run game as well I don't think that ... cousins should be dropping back more than forty times again which he's done I think in at least five and ... of his games this year\nOr they haven't been able to run the ball with great consistency they rented really well against Arizona a few weeks ago\nWhen I think Murray had over one fifty but for the most part the run game has been erratic and inconsistent and I think he's being asked to drop back too many times I don't think that he's the kind of quarterback that can do that\nLet's go to the game of the week that the Green Bay Packers taking on the New England patriots why the Packers off install late there against the against the rams\nI don't know if it necessarily stalled um [noise] you know I think the Packers\nAre another team that's an odd team offensively they come out in this game and they run the ball with Aaron Jones counting the first player the second quarter Jones already had seven Russia's at that point and and they'd run the ball very effectively\nIt was a game they were had a good part and then they abandoned the ... now I think when you have a quarterback like Rogers it's very easy to say let's put the ball in his hands\nBut again it's very difficult to drop back any quarterback and we know Rogers is extremely talented and maybe the most talented in the league but it's still too hard to do that\nFirst of all they didn't run a lot of plays in this game keep that in mind it's very hard to get into a rhythm because the rams Rand well over Seventy plays and I think the Packers rant about fifty that's a very low number and that impacts your ability to develop a rhythm to your offense and you're off its becomes individual play based\nAnd every play becomes magnified\nGreat stuff a regular cell joining us in the ... ... it's hard to tell because there was such a thorough level of dominance against the bill's on the defensive side but as we continue to watch the New England patriots up and civil\nOr they're able to win without Sony Michel but they obviously need that power running game you and I have discussed before ... ... what are your thoughts on this patriot ... as they will get Michelle back healthy\nWhile it wasn't very good this week the bills defense was better than the patriots off into this week\nThey had they were able to generate a pass rush with before they got Brady early in the game being uncomfortable he started to play a little fast that happens to Brady a couple of times every year it happened in this game now he's certainly made a couple of very good throws\nA when he had to and that's Tom Brady but overall he was not a comfortable player in this game the bills the line dominated the patriots all aligned\nI built a check is telling you where they stand with their running game\nBecause on the first series Darryl Patterson was there I back and they came back to that on the series the fourth quarter series in which they scored a touchdown so they're struggling a bit it's a concern right now they need to get Sony Michel back keep in mind he was kind of a driving force of their ... in those three consecutive games that he I think had\nTwenty five Eighteen and twenty four carries\nA last thing the Dallas Cowboys that I'm Ari mark Cooper as they are wide receiver does he fixed what fix what ails the cowboys often [noise]\nA fix is a relative term he make them better because he's better than what they're going to ... and they were putting out their previously I think that his core their offensive coordinators Scotland ahead would like to line up with three wide receivers and one back\nCooper now gives them the opportunity to do that and as I said he's better than what they were putting out there the big question now is how does that Prescott handle it will they throw more that's the question and they'll have to determine that because I don't think they wanted to throw a whole lot will they throw more now that they have a better word receiving corps\nGreg great stuff and I just

if he just struck out pneumonia is\nUh the very last hitter um and apparently the conversation was how you keep an eye on me when you think and and if you watched that conversation he'll handed him the ball almost before he got there so it wasn't so we might actually be overreacting but I think it's fascinating how little people pay attention to managing\nAnd many times in the regular season and how we pay almost too much attention to it in the postseason as that up is that a fair assessment\nOh no question plans on the microscope get a bigger and bigger and how season and then of course we'll hear about it sharply focuses a yeah as I possibly can be on every single day in the book or whatever you know aspect of the games to be quiet so [noise]\nUm but that's part of it I mean that's part of the you know you're going to be a good team and make the playoffs and even for income or even if you lose your coffee the manager's going off\nYou know he's going to be the guy at the end of the questions and that's the nature of managing and baseball now especially with the with the media\nWill listen to welcome to Southern California thanks so much for spending some time with us and we wish you nothing but the best and the off season hopefully loading up on some pitching in some health in that didn't that pitching staff they should be our guest impossible trade your bread\nAlright thank God\nI read awesome is joining us in the dugout live show here on Fox Sports radio kind of side note when he was a player remembers a three time gold glove or an all star he used to come on come and when you just talked about pitching with him and I mean it's so next level in terms of his ability to analyze exactly what makes guys work and doesn't work and\nUm you know we had met holiday on the show a lot who I feel like as the exact same\nA sense and ability as a hitter Brad has that type of a baseball brain if you will especially from his eye catching days as at for that perspective but a bitch kids going to be an interesting job angels\nPossibly getting a new stadiums are opting out of that stadium deal or at least getting the stadium redone and then the travel deal and you know tiny deal there's a lot there but there's a lot of questions as well let's get to ... is the answer to all of our questions about what's going on in sports what are you got\nDug it starts with something that just occurred moments ago the governor of Maryland Larry Hogan as just issued a statement regarding the University of Maryland board of regents reinstatement yesterday of head football coach DJ Dirk in\nAn athletics director Damon Avon the statements that in part quote I Am deeply troubled by the lack of transparency from the board of regents and deeply concerned about how they could have possibly arrived at the decisions announced yesterday\nThe university system of Maryland has led down the University of Maryland community and the citizens of Marilyn and now is the time to fix it unquote so is it is that is the governor of Maryland Larry Hogan in a statement issued moments ago\nDays trying to stay sticky because yeah you know this is what we do we oh we massively overreact to public pressure I mean they they did a thorough investigation which has been made public and then they came to their decision I don't know all of these things are all these things are in fact transparent like this is\nSorry due to space is pandering it does it's not going to bring Jordan McNair back it's it's not that's the sad thing firing everybody might make you feel good gay and you know but and I know German airs parents are ... are really really upset and don't want him coaching anymore I understand that\n[noise] but [noise] I [noise] I honestly I I think\nThis is now but now we're now we're show boating you know in our grandstanding\nI was born regents had an investigation conducting investigation these are the findings this is what they decided guy the people go back to work to go back to the work the people that don't don't\nAnd now we're like well wait a second all that wasn't good enough so I'm guessing DJ dark and going to lose his job 'cause it's really hard to operate but I don't think you know [noise]\nI don't the border regions generally are people that love the university that's it they love the universe and they want what's right\n[noise] I\nI completely disagree with the grandstanding the second place now\nAnd along those lines in case people out there and wondering about the relationship and the authority that a governor of a state has on a university from that same statement\nGovernor Hogan said quote no governor has the ability to hire or fire any university personnel were members of the board of regents but I can and will demand at the university has held\nAccountable for making the reforms that they have pledged\nTo put in place with a full transparency that the student's parents and faculty expect and deserve unquote so he doesn't technically have the authority to make any personnel\nDecisions with anybody in the athletic department or the board of regents that issue just moments ago by the governor of Maryland Larry Hogan and the NBA Jimmy ... they're not playing tonight for the timber wolves against Utah\nMemories in the midst of a trade demand and there are conflicting reports about who's decision it was for him nuts it's late at night will Fox Sports radio was karate butler spoke with Jimmy Butler and set the record straight alert earlier today on the herd why isn't he playing like\nFor some neutral
