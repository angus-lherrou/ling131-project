giants converge on a ball\nBut nobody blows up the wide receiver wasn't blown up at all and there was a flag for hitting a defensive player it was awful call\nAnd as much as I'm sitting there saying that's a terrible call that changed the trajectory of that game as it goes down to the wire ... fifty seven your fuel Goldwyn change introductory 'cause the the drive would have been over instead the
