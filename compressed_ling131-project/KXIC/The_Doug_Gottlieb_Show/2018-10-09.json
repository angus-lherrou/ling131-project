Smith um earlier today on first take said something along the lines of like look here's what you here's a black guys say black African American people will say that it's in aid that they\nThey don't mentioned enough all say it Jason gage relationship with Jerry Jones is the reason he still has his job\nAnd that relationship is only because basically like eight of the ratio is only 'cause he's white I I'm not disputing that his relationship that his tenure in Dallas has a backup quarterback as you know a as a position coach\nIs one of the reasons that he hasn't been fired\nIt also might have something to do with the fact that two years ago didn't\nThey win Thirteen games and then last year with out this week for six games they won eight and they didn't have tyrants Smith and they didn't have Sean Li like there is some reality to it\nLike I Love this idea that we want do you like we want our franchise has to be stable and yet when they're stable\nWe want them to be unstable and the only reason that it could be stable is Well Jerry Jones is racist\nAnd they went nine games this year my bad they were actually better\nNine games when they didn't have the for six and they did have tiring for like five or six games to like what am I missing and the division was damn good but the exception of the giants\n\nRight Redskins were good eagles were the best team arguably in football in the regular season before they lost their quarterback and then won the super bowl without him what am I missing I don't need a rape\n... they'll see me I don't need a a I don't need a race whistle blower\nI don't\nIs it because of relationships sure it's also because he has equity and cashed in that equity that's why they changed so many position coaches\nAnd he doesn't get it done it'll be fired\n\nBut I think all of these things are in fact true and one of the things that people don't understand about professional sports specifically the NFL is okay Jason Garrett's not good enough who is\n\nLike oh well Shawn McVeigh why they miss on ... bay like All right\nYou're going to replace Jason Garrett with the next Sean May where Izzie you better identify the right guy\nBecause they haven't all worked out just because you get a play college work it out in Chicago yeah well they also have clear Mac [laughter] and us deep in\nAdam Gates was seen as an offensive wizard and it's a mixed bag in Miami why his talents just okay oh yeah and if you don't think that's good enough that's fine now you gotta find next quarter back it's not easy\n\nMany tried many failed this idea that you just get rid of the guys teams that get rid of guys really quickly\nBecause they're not achieving those are the ones that are unstable those are the ones that are to fix\nThe how many coaches the browns to go through how many quarterbacks to the browns gone through how's that worked out for the rounds oh well now they're now they're awesome\nThere to to in one and both of the games they won they won by a few Ogle\nDo do I think the browser good yes it's because they've been bad for Twenty years\nAnd they finally figured out they got enough talent to where they're pretty good and as much as we are going crazy about Baker Mayfield is the number one running team in football they have the number one turnover ratio in football those are two things that help you win games and help\nProtect you from a rookie quarterback that's just the reality of it but if you want to fire every coach and get rid of every quarter back and change everything all the way\nAnd uh just jealous that he can play as long as he wants but women say one thing and mean another we all know that um [noise]\nI I get the sense she's going to continue to pressure him and he doesn't seem like a football life or just doesn't seem like something even his kids are going to do I'm going to say there's a greater chance that he plays longer than braid interesting Yeah Tom\nThose keen on ... movies after get old after enough years earlier today Jerry Jones said this on the Thin Man in Dallas a cougar\nWar you call one of the night you really oh do you see quite a lot of crap\nYou're there in my mind are ever going to have a ... don't want to quit the quiet [noise] those guys are just so lovely football with where they where they are a lot ... than a quake was several years that we go to ...\nHinted desert Brian was that in mind what are the chances desert Brian who has been tweeting up a storm today what are the chances dead never plays in the NFL again [noise]\nCan I hear that cut one more time I thought that was really really telling me that would cut one more time go ahead\nOf them want to call one of the NIH said we'll go you see ... ...\nYou're there in my mind are ever going to have the number one we have quite a bit of a quiet [noise] those guys are just so lovely ... where they where they are a lot ... than I have several usually we go to war several\nYears here um look the problem with does is\nHe doesn't know where he stands in the NFL he doesn't know that he needs to do a ball he doesn't think you need to a ball and he may not have the emotional intelligence to understand that and to change has gained the weight Larry Fitzgerald that go on the spot become better better block or become a leader to come have a higher football like you like ...

Drew Brees\n[noise] I think he's he's the you know you talk about what he did on the field but to me he's the standard and he's\nHe's really been a teaching tool for quarterbacks all around the NFL and just in terms of preparation or that's what his reputation as inside the league and guys like chase Daniel that have been around him and share that information with Alice share that information with homes you look at the chase Daniel share that information with Carson west\nI mean it's kind of spider spider Web its way through the league just in terms of how drew prepares\nUm ages made it he's he's taken to a whole nother level with that and that when you look at what he's done on the field\nThe best way I describe him as we have there's there's quarterback from the NFL that are explosive explosive arms big plays there's quarterbacks the recession or and even though drew it and have a big arm he still generates explosive plays well being extremely efficient he's combined the two as well as just about anybody has ever play the\nGame how much does he helped by painting and playing in the dome\n[noise] well I mean definitely I think it's helped him playing in the dome I think that was a big reason that wasn't really talked about when her cousins was making his decision he wanted to go play inside a that was a big factor so no it it definitely does help him and he said the same color and run that same system\nForever or no doubt but I mean look he he makes the whole thing do what do you have duplicated that success at every other team of the NFL or probably not but he is still a very very high level very long time\nOr Dana Jeremiah joining us in the ... show Fox Sports radio let let's start with the team you cover up for a living outside the NFL Network the chargers that was a thumping after another slow starting to feel golfers drive but\nYou know another miss kick does make you think maybe the Hugo kicking issues aren't song but it does feel like the chargers even without jelly bows is starting to find their footing and that was an ad they weren't they're missing their starting tackles and they still dominated the game or am I wrong to think the chargers\nA team that are playing better than their record religion to believe\nYeah I mean when you're winning games with two on drafted tackles won a second airplay or the other one rookie from ... and you go out there and thoroughly dominated divisional team um that gives you some encouragement there the niners game was probably closer than it should have been\nA but now it put two when's together and when you look at the schedule I'm In Cleveland I was not cupcake the way they're playing right now but they're coming off back to back overtime games you could see a little bit of a little bit of wear and tear their on them and then you play the titans in London and that's the sea hawks and the raiders of the Broncos so\nA fall by the cardinals when you just look at the schedule so that they should be able to rip off some winds here and at some point in time they are going to get Joey votes the fact and uh you know if you could be if you could be five and three or maybe even you know six and two when you look at the schedule and then you bring back to your best defensive player arguably the best player on your team or if you're in pretty good shape there\nI I I tend to agree what about the raiders how much of these issues fall on the shoulders of their car\nThey're bad team and uh they're just up there are bad football team Derrick did not play while the other day um you know what it was the one of the critics I've had there and and it's just as what it appears like when you're watching the tape is he's a he's a ... load Hi guy so if there's if there's a completion there he's going to take it right now\nOr or there's been some other opportunities deeper down the field if he wanted to and I just would read high low if you get some more opportunities\nDeep down the field but it's far from being a you know his fault for where they are it's it is it's been referenced it is one of the slowest defenses I've ever seen when you can just pitch the ball out to Austin heckler and try and save a play after a fumble snap and and he goes forty five yards\nBase one touch one cut that's the only thing I Will cut and two guys ran into each other and there was a house of cards defense\nNo there's nobody there is no speed and pursue there's nobody that threatens you're up front on the defensive line you can get your facts on their line backers and they have no way that can run in the back yard so they they they have wholesale changes needed on the back on that ...\nOkay how much does McKenzie how much those good\n[noise] well I mean the rough there's\nBeen so churned and so turned over bike route and I mean I think it's as you say there's blame to go around there there's plenty of missed picks yeah that will be ... and all that but you know hey hello Mike was a home run\nOh yeah that makes a difference to the question with him there I think it's just in that transition period getting to the guys that group wants I just don't understand why they don't go ahead and let Reggie leave a obviously doesn't have any more ... junk roots station out that he wants to try and change this roster and in what he does so just cut Reggie loose let him go somewhere else\nI Would guess its money always comes down to money to\nMe that that's the theory that's working theory for sure\nI don't I don't I I think that's a pretty good pretty good theory if you know anything about the raiders Daniel Jeremiah knows things about all NFL teams he joined just on the ... show on Fox Sports radio\nI I Want to freak out about the eagles the problem is I look at their division and like ... not impressive\nGiants seemed to be a dumpster fire or even though they they easily could have won that game in Carolina and and the red skins had like a week and a half off and they got their ass kicked last night and New Orleans I think you know it's again I'm going to end up thinking the eagles division anyway even though they marry good\nYeah it looks like a nine and seven you know it might get it done in that division this year a ... to me the eagles don't have a figure it out right now they spark at one thing I have worked that organization Ben Ron Howard Rosenman\nAh he's not afraid to go make a move in and take a chance I Know I saw there are some reports out there talking about ... potentially coming back uh they'll do something I Would be shocked if within the next two weeks he doesn't ask somebody does that roster\nVia trade to just try and provide some spark and provide all juice here to this team as they continue to you know get some other guys back healthy getting Darren ... rolls and Corey climate back will help you off at but\nThey've got to play better up front of the fence lines are dropping passes they're given up chunk plays on the fence so they've got a whole host of issues just fortunately they find themselves in the right division this year they're gonna have to figure it out\nWhen you when when you watch um\nThe uh the Dallas Cowboys you mean we watch that when you heard the New York giants ... back in the junior have that interview\nThat interview a before they ever played the game and he said and and the the trigger words I heard everybody talking about anything I wouldn't say anything about ... but he said energy we don't we don't have the energy we need that that some talking about the coaching staff not getting guys to play hard\nHe talked about heart like I don't talk about your teammates heart and he didn't say teenage are but we need to play with more hard saying that saying we don't play with hard and then he talked about the scheme coaching staff like look at your head coaches ... do rule uh play color\nI I Can't think of a worse way to be honest then what oh del back in June or did you been in NFL free ... says he is he like look we actually played better because of it what do you what's your take\nOn it was a pretty thorough hit list um that's for sure ... the only

it feels like the NFL just screws a lot of stuff up\nThey had first of all a paper certificate for him I don't know where the paper certificate came from but it was like Drew Brees just got an honorable mention at the high school or a middle school science fair\nAnd as he's coming off the field and this is this is pretty crazy they have the guy there and the gloves first of all do you really need to be in the gloves\nIs is the foot ball which has just been handled by a bunch of different football players and everyone else who is a who was involved in the game does he I really need to have white gloves on take football from Drew Brees that was a little bit much and then Drew Brees the NFL flags in for a celebration penalty\nThat that's not the most NFL thing imaginable that Drew Brees has just set the all time passing record the NFL has sent a guy there in white gloves they've got a certificate for him the official on the field gives it to him\nThey flag him for a celebration penalty\nThe only thing worse it would be at the NCAA also said it was a violation of NCAA rules and New Orleans was put on probation right like that's the only thing even more bureaucratic\nYeah I don't I just think you're trying too hard right you're trying too hard now\nIt was helped by the fact there was a touchdown that it wasn't in the middle of the game that was the first play first pass completed like all those things were great\nBut yeah it it just seemed like a hodgepodge of ideas like ooh let's give them a certificate ooh let's let's have some of the issue with the gloves get the football let's have big day Baker come down and his kids come down and let's forget to tell the officials on the field exactly what we're doing\nThis is what happens when everybody tries to do their job but nobody actually communicate right adult thing has to kind of work together and not letting the officials in on it is as big of hope on yes that one was an abject disaster I I Will tell you that um\nI I I don't think the NFL meant anything by I think part of it was a pro Football Hall of fame which is not actually the NFL and ... are trying to make it a bigger deal but it did seem kind of high school English\n[laughter]\nHey what does the Fox chase bought the by discover card we treat you like you'd like to treat you well you didn't pick that game last night I I was driving home I was\nLike I didn't pick up and I was thinking nobody's going to pick the Redskins right Ramos would you pick the Redskins I Would not have said would you pick the Redskins for now I Would have gone saints last night yeah\nYeah here's what I don't get about baseball I Love Red Sox Yankees would have been watching any Red Sox Yankees because I'm watching football you know\nAnd it's two teams I don't really care I don't care about the Redskins are the same it's like I'll watch it because my job but it's also that's what most of America did\nAnd I do I enjoy the fact that baseball unlike the NBA like let's get the ... series moving so the guys can't pitch their best pitchers every single day\nBut at what point in time are they going to realize the ... regular season earlier so they're not competing against a football or playing only playoff games in the middle of the week\nSpeaking of which Kenny Yankees come back after getting blasted last night by the Boston Red Sox the only game
