getting me\nCome on I mean to have the opportunity to go to the world series back to back years that doesn't happen very often a matter of fact not at all but to see the success that he's had during

an unbelievable contract offered by the Washington Nationals to bring him back that\nWould be my first thought if he said there's a deal on tables from the national in my opinion because by the way\n... he signed that deal right now he never signed early deal ever for any of his God and if you break Harper you don't want that attention you want the bugs right\nAnd so I feel like with the off season got to go the way it usually does will see him sign after Christmas maybe January February a when all this stuff called out because you gotta make Scott bores me he doesn't do that that's not his style man he bought the headlines he wants he wants all that\nHe quotes just as much ah I I guess you could say a love at Bryce Harper ... he's scared that you know when he's scared to throw out some hook and some stories may not be true\nA lasting ... uh it it appears the Dodgers doesn't bring David Roberts back I guess here's my fear right so you go you go mostly based upon an illusion your decision this year\nAnd you either stick with that and that's like who you're going to be or correct for you like over correct and now you only go by got like ... it feels like there are really hard spot in the future in the playoffs aren't I\nWell I think it was tough this year man because you went up against Boston and I think the analytics of everything just didn't pan out I think the thing about it like it I mean if that's the type of team you are and that's how you play all season long that's how it runs the\nRosters that's all that stuff\nAnd then all of a sudden you get to the world series and you struggle it's hard to change the way you do things that are creatures of habit organizations habits of which they do things right\nSo a lot of heat that put on the Roberts because of the decisions you make but in my mind I think that's an organizational thing running out of All right handed lineup that's an organizational and that's ... billion dollar decision\nSo I Know Robert catching a lot of ... and rightfully so because he is the manager but you don't\nLose that guy he's one of the best in the game and even though he didn't get the job done two years of ... it still doesn't mean they get a future they've got an unbelievable team he's an unbelievable ban communicator does the game of baseball because think about it if you get rid of Robert now who you're going to bring over there\nIt's going to ask them I mean it's a great question um\nLast thing many Machado I don't know I mean look you go back to when you go back to what was the game for\n... I I Would ... me an incredible throw buddies ... got a buddy replayed on monies flowing above all running down to first base like Jeff um he had the one that went off the wall would you you got into a single because he thought it was ... or she was a home run like I guess\nI feel like this was ... and then in the shadow hit the ball well I yeah I Know I feel like he really hurt his value I'm just say I he's not my kind of this like hustling isn't always his his cup of tea yeah Mike I'm fifty\nHe's not Johnny ... that's what he said yes [laughter] so I think\nWith many Machado man here's the deal do I think he's going to be the shortstop for the Los Angeles Dodgers next year do I do\nI think he's going to find himself back in the American league game I Do\nAnd here's another thing that I Hope happens I Hope that he switches back from shortstop to third base because he is in a lecture third as good as the as the shortstop I think he's way better as a third baseman I Would feel like the things that happened this postseason Maddie Wright kings\nBaby might be Larry but then again he came out and said exactly who he was we talked about it a second ago he says he's not Mr Johnny hustle he's not going to be diving into basis like that\nYou know I I Would I think I'm Betty Machado I think of somebody like a ... and this is why right now all of our players can be can be heroes right you got to have some ... instigators and drive around green is one of those got what people still love dream on\nBut when I Dream on budget and green plays hard like the idea\nBut I think the idea of like hey do you want to make two hundred fifty million dollars that's cool but like I like and and I don't know\nI I don't know if if if the angels for ... for example they're going to spend some money um but the angels had the opposite of that that they have tried who has all that talent and he has gotten hurt playing hard and I just I just wonder if you know if that act works in another ties when you're going to be either they got\nOne and and and obviously I mean obviously you saw what happened in the ...\nYou know and in the world series I mean you bring over garlic man which I think he's going to help you know help you run the table and I can promise you if you would have helped him win the world series there's no doubt it would've been back in LA\nBut because of everything that happened and not only that you know with with superstars like that sometimes a little package comes along I Know if I think if you're a general manager owners got to weigh the pros and cons because the end of the day\nThat kick in swing pole and he can play baseball it's just you got to be able to get in there and say hey I Need you change your style or maybe you're approached\nEspecially the best thing to join us no matter how well it may help you're working on that\nTennis and we've got political you know played some tennis Sunday's summit something tells me that Swisher covers the court quite well like so much which\nI'm working on it but I've been working\nFor Fox and there'll be ... by the way I'm this will be how ... how\nIs the is the third baseman for the angels you only hit this year they take it gets you have any idea what he\nWhat he hit this one thirty I'm going to go one Seventy eight one Seventy Seventy it yet\nDo he played a ... and you're like no no no he was only part time there was no no no\nHe played every game this year he played every game this year\nHe had sixty one hits the entire season that's believable I feel like you could fund and get on on base for a ... probably right\nI feel like you get bud and so that's a hard one if you're the eight like it seemed like the ages like man we need players we got money we got trout would try and get a new stadium we gotta figure some things out and then he got a guy like really played hearts aren't really my thing not my thing secular damned by\n[noise] than what a day of the national football league and uh I guess in a way dug it keeps getting better and better it started with the Cleveland Browns where things aren't good in Cleveland and really not good for\nFormer head coach Hugh Jackson yes fired today by the browns along with all sorts of coordinator Todd Hayley in fact Jim John Dorsey in order to Jimmy has a meeting with the media as we speak saying that they are looking to quote put the organization in a better place today\n... these guys are really good but in that case he throws it right the PGA take six and you just can't do it in a game of that magnitude Sunday Night Football close game and all I Know is as a cowboy fan I miss her cousins playing for the ... no I Do I Do yeah he was one in six against the cowboys 'cause he always\nThey're always hidden blunders and has to be our\nThat play whatever who's ever fault it is you just have to eliminate it is it digs fault or is it just should the quarterback not tried it at all whatever it is it's it's a typical ... cousins play\nI I don't think he's ... he's representing the play where ... was on a crossing route against men to men and cousins steps up in the pocket and leads him at the exact time he leaves them ... plants his feet and stops like it's his own it's pretty obvious to step on digs his fault\nThere that's not a typical ... cousins by her cousins does lack some of the arm talent of the the Aaron Rodgers of the world I mean the fact is that\nThere's a lot of Drew Brees incur cousins I Drew Brees as first four or five years in San Diego there were there was a lot of talk about his his lack of arm strength and cousins it's been a lot better playing in the do much the way it's been better for Drew Brees playing in the dumps there are times last night with Drew Brees throw the ball up for grabs Andrew interception\nThe craziest part about what's what a skip is saying which is not inaccurate how good does too wide receivers on\nIs that that game was lost by those too wide receivers\nAdam feeling bubbled when the Vikings rep three and I think it's a ten yard line at the same ten yard line he fumble plenty of time remaining and they could have double dip scored then got the ball back to start the second half they either ... or up six or scored a touchdown glove ten\nBut ... and stuff on Dix quits on a route in which she either read the defense wrong read her cousin ... I'm not sure what he was doing maybe thought cousins was going to run has made a man he stopped his men would stop not sure the point is that neither were cousins fault\nAnd at minimum that ten points that's different than the gate difference in the game so\nI I'm not disputing that Kurt cousins is not Aaron Rodgers don't think he is only going to tell you what are you not Tom Brady and he was but considering the Vikings haven't had great quarterback play considering how well he's played\nIs he a product of the wide receiver sure but they haven't had a great ... I think he's been actually inappropriate value based upon his level of competency\n[noise] say that there's a story on age or Jesse says Rick Pitino hopes to return to coaching in the NBA\n\nRick Pitino is first coaching job with New York Knicks was a success to a point Rick Pitino second coaching job but she had complete control of the Boston Celtics was not\n\nA rip Pitino should coach in the NBA in my opinion because he's a tremendous basketball\nYou don't have to like him are like his style and I'm not sure if it absolutely positively translates wins but I Do know that he says close to ... as we have in the sport [laughter] he he embraced a three point shot with Providence and took them to the final four and then use that with the New York Knicks before\nAnybody else did he tank with the Boston Celtics for anybody else did playing small ball that was Rick Pitino I credit done Nelson as well but he did so also having guys lose weight before anybody else did\nNow do I know if he's evolved enough offensively with some of the ... probably not it'd be a need for some NBA coaches 'cause coaching the NBA is different\nBut the idea that because of the scandals that little oval he shouldn't coach in the NBA went by all accounts he's as good a coach in the modern era basketball's we've ever seen\nIt's silly it's silly really silly\nI wasn't the hell is going on in Cleveland if you're just joining us not only is huge action out but so too is just off into court or they don't get along and they're both gone what does this mean for baking Mayfield who would possibly take that job\nIn the upcoming off season and kinda brands when the seasons by the dysfunction less Michael ... joins us next on the ...\n[noise]\nName is Preston James I've been a stock options trader for twenty three years I used to be an active swing trader but that all changed once I discovered my money press weekly paycheck method these days I'm a passive trader hauling in more cash well being able

investing\nGo paycheck proof dot com that's paycheck proof dot com [noise]\nFox Sports trending\nDo Jackson fire today by the Cleveland Browns is their head coach Todd Haley fired today by the Cleveland Browns as they're offered the coordinator moves made my own or Jimmy has\nIt is certainly there's some elements that happened but I think more than anything I think when you look at the Vikings I don't think there were a hundred percent go into that game I mean people that has the bomb over getting ready to score Canada have\nBut you can't make mistakes I mean that's the reality you can't make mistakes you do that you don't lose games and that's what they did they turn of all this while they lost the buffalo so\nCircles back to the cousins you know the guy throwing the ball really well to the game but yet he makes the reception for the touchdown they fall and the red zone those to place they killed their team and they kill the test if I were to tell you Doug\nThat breeze is that that that uh uh Drew Brees as go for over a hundred twenty yards in the in the states we're going to what you said you're crazy\nMan right yeah and yet they did yeah and it now looks like both those players or like like you know digs cut it a quid on a crossing route and against men to men\nAnd dealing fumbled like those I I'm with everybody on cousins does have a stealing is lower than the star quarterbacks but I think he's played really well and I don't think either of those two mistakes run him\nI I agree look I think he takes so much\nFor for making so much money it's not his fault if you want to be mad at anybody ... general manager of the Washington Redskins he's the one I messed up the contract don't apart you know her cousin does it up he was franchise even sports\nFranchise he got put in the income bracket by the Redskins thinking that they could outsmart as they get so look her cousins has given them everything they have I mean I don't think that's the problem I mean look everybody loves sitcom Barclay he's a great player he's one of the highest paid backs guaranteed money in the ... the giants are one in six to me you could work given him a hard time\nWhat do you do with James Winston if you're Tampa\nTampa Bay I'm On the train them I'm going to try to trade of the problem is Tampa Bay doesn't have any any real awareness or any\nAny reality of what he's worth\nYou know right now he's on the books next year for twenty million dollars guarantee for skill I wrote about this and the athletic today so what that means dog if he plays this year and said he gets hurt and I don't wish this on anyone\nBut let's just say he gets hurt any terrorists Disney and his ACL that means next year his twenty million is guarantee they are at a high risk if they play this choir for the rest\nOf exposing themselves to twenty million dollars\nOkay because she could get hurt and if he does if he's not able to pass or end of the year physical\nWhich is at the end of the season or the beginning physical they can't they can't take that scale off they can't take that injury awful it becomes guarantee and they owe it to him so if you could trade them between now and tomorrow which no teams going to take that contract on and have that liability I don't think\nAnd I take the turnovers on his well I don't I don't do that I think I think ... percent for the harsh reality that the prior they think is the franchise no one else does\n... a Josh Gordon is he going to play tonight against the bills but he's gonna miss them series because apparently he was late to a team event\nThis is the same Josh coordinate comes in with some strikes against them you know Bill Belichick really really well you work with and for Bill Bill Bill ... what's your assessment of uh of just how close Josh current news from getting run off in the patriots\nLook you know I said this from the beginning volume is going to be the hardest thing for ... you know it's it's not doing it once one time and that's why all those helmets are out there on the basis of navy seals a lot of guys can go through seal training for a day they could do it for two days they critic\nBut then they got to do it for thirty straight days that wears on that and that's what I'm concerned about with with with ...

right um you can sure\n[laughter]\nI honestly don't know I I have I've I've I mean the prices I told you guys I suppose you rank TV and cable yeah you have to separate and so I watched because my whole thing is like I never want to turn our like I Can't watch the game like that's just silly that's it is\nKind of my job ... director who does that patch twelve network and you need to see that I saw that I don't know the SEC Network you're probably right and I and I also want to say\nThat um [noise] there's a couple other packages you can get only with ... with cable that you couldn't get and then you can't get a Sunday ticket\nYou can get red zone but you can't get Sunday ticket with cable so yeah I spend a crazy amount of money on TV I'm that guy that's keeping with cable\nAnd I like that you\nGot to be somebody you know the the thing about McVeigh which is interesting I watched that ramps Packers game\nAnd it was a very good football game if you listen to ... comments after the game he even said like I kinda got us in some trouble lives some of my ... play colleagues like one of the things that's really impressive about McVeigh\nWe were all kind of concern I'm I'm I'm In a lump you guys in there with with me because I kind of convince you guys be concerned about the rams with all the personalities they have in that locker\nAnd while everybody goes crazy about ... play calling upon those really good to play going only get you to a certain point you you got to win the hearts and minds of guys and they're often was not good for the most part against an okay defense the Green Bay Packers\nBut they won that game because they got stops they got points off of their defense and like the perfect example of the level of buy in is Todd girlie taking your knee or giving himself up when he had the game one he should have gone in the end zone go in the end zone you're up eight seats\nFirst case there you can tie kick the ex point nine you can't lose the game or as you could actually bumble snap even in victory formation you could possibly happen right so I actually think statistically the the smart thing to do would have been to take but the idea that Todd girlie was putting the team above himself\nIn a city like Los Angeles a team like the rams\nReally impressive what make bays been able to do not accept everyone talks about the political\nBut it's not about the ex than the oh it's about motivating the Jimmy fund the Joes and what he's done connecting with the ... air Donald and you know ... holding out you've got all these guys are one year deals",
