ways to win unfortunately some of those then go to the right way but ah yeah I think this team ah has has the makeup and has a chemistry to to just find a way to\nTo battle through a diversity and find ways to to not let it\nBe overwhelming and get us down and um you know they'll get into that whole so uh I I think our our biggest thing is is trying to start fast try to get a\nGet on the field and get the same role in a little bit quicker because our our second half of games of have been exceptional I mean uh are are two minute stuff has been a excellent so we just need to find that formula

which had the uh Minnesota Miracle but you know it's it's one thing to be coming up a hamstring which has been and up and he's also coming off an ACL from last year but you're also in the NFL and the game like the saints you're going zero to a hundred that's going to be a\nPlayoff caliber playoff type of level play up but\nI Love you mentioned stacks Harris and being traded and this is after he like apple being traded we're still waiting to see if he lived ... will be traded\nAnd I've seen all over Twitter that\nNot only are the giants waving the white flag but that the giants are taking\n... and that we'd never seen this before in the NFL between the raiders and the giants now the Arizona Carter's apparently are not trading Patrick Peterson he posted a note basically saying like he wants to be part of the process to turn this thing around he's upset at the season but but he's all and so\nThe cardinals are like now we're not gonna tank we just suck [laughter] we're going to suck the old fashioned way and we're going to start a rookie quarterback who's going to make some mistakes behind a future dolphins in line\nWith a rookie play color and Byron left which so they may tank without knowing or trying to tank or getting rid of some of their long time long tenured stars but it feels like it just feels like to me\nThat the\nThe NFL is finally catching up to a baseball is finally catching up to basketball it told you last year when the Houston Astros win the world series that it I Know you don't have to win a World Series\nIn order to validate what you're doing like\nThe Oakland A's never never won a World Series but money ball clearly works and their their salaries are quarter that of the elite franchises in the NFL and the ... in in major league baseball they're playing in a dump\nFans barely show up although this year when they started playing really well they they they felt it up\nAnd yet they're still able to be competitive most years so Moneyball works even if it isn't it validated by World Series right but when you win a World Series it validates every sort of bit of the process\nAnd so when the Astros tanked in two thousand Thirteen they gotta Butowsky in their home ratings\nThe secret to baseball is their home ratings not the national ... home ratings are usually through the roof\nHouston I Know they switched networks and whatever but their local ratings right Butowsky zero point zero\nColor bars would get a higher rating they got in two thousand Thirteen because they were trying to lose games and they loaded up on draft picks and prospects are over of a three year or year period or so and now look at how competitive they are they made the playoffs three out of four years one of the world series last year but last year validated it and have them teams in the American league take this year\nIn the NBA the Philadelphia Seventy Sixers tank last year we saw the grizzlies do it we've seen the mavericks do it

truth is when he got the job he wasn't doing the work and he admits such in the book\nWondering worked into names have guys didn't really know storylines didn't watch the games as busy hanging out having a good time and just kind of waited and when you get the debate format the way I learned to debate was you know finding a mistake and the argument becomes the house of cards\nAnd then sometimes it wasn't even a debate which she would love a name and me and the host or try and figure out who's going to clean it up and how are we going to clean it up nicely so that we don't make Jay looked at\nSome of it is an internal security knowing you haven't done your job and if it gets pointed out you are mad at somebody else knew you're not doing your job\nNow he came around in the book to say that you know he\nLooked up to me in that it made him work harder and made them totally buy into the business and I see I always thought he was quite\nGood\nAnd it's really hard to go through what he went through not knowing that he had a prescription pill problem not knowing that how badly he wanted to play or how bad his body was hurting like I didn't know any of these things\nI just do where they were talking about basketball and sometimes it do to make a mistake and we try and clean up for him because we were trying to be good teammates\n\nAnd he may have thought I had some inherent jealousy of him because he played it to go on a national championship and\nI I went to this day thing that he had the opposite in terms of jealousy thinking I was trying to make him look bad because there's this memory gap that you have when you play professional groups that you don't know a bunch about basketball ... this is business\nAnd so I have though I don't have anybody who I I don't go to

school basketball players the verdict is in in the college basketball corruption trial guilty on all ... okay but the\nThe the more interesting part is in the I'm In a statement made or do you see this or from the prosecutor at the university's had known about the defending secret payments they never would have issued those scholarships\nWell that's\nThe case of the schools they're like hey it's sort of the victims of the victims yeah like they're the ones that are hurt yet now the NC double a can take all of the evidence all of the testimony do their own investigation and find out how much the school's new and they can be penalized\nThat is simply amazing simply simply amazing um look I it doesn't mean that I think\nThat all of those coaches new right there is that they would they want plausible deniability\nAnd look I don't know you don't want to tell me I don't know I don't know\nFine just get it done like that's what they tell guys just get it done and he helped me get it done good get it done daycare they use vague terms like get it done and take care of them and that's what actually happened but the idea that if they had known\nI Do think there are some schools and it read it read read really stuffy right it reads really not presumptuous reads a very very pompous way\nThere are some schools that they wouldn't pulled a scholarship offer but they knew the kid had his hand out was demanding and was making my error some schools have been like yeah and I actually think there are some schools they did know it did back away or that suspected ... back away but the idea that the scholarships wouldn't be offered\nAnd that's a hard one for me\nThe giants are in full tank mode course the first rule of tank club John Ramos is don't talk about tank club but the second rule of tank club Ryan music is\nDo not talk about tank club right so you'll never hear the jets the giants or the raiders talk about ten club on the other hand there's he like many who says the exact opposite\nOf what he really means I remember you lie didn't really have a problem with not starting last year that was the public sentiment\nThe private set of it was you kidding me you don't want to let me finish fine I won't start you would try to embarrass me and make it look like I'm holding on the streak I'm going to embarrass you he like many never said he didn't want to be a San Diego charger\nHe just said all the right things but behind the scenes it was known he like many would never be a San Diego chargers here's Eli Manning on WFAN in New York\nI haven't thought about the uh trade scenario as an organization is the only game I've I've ever played for the only thing I Know in in a loving New York giants so hard to imagine\n... another organization no I'm not just a a focus of trying to get away for the giants and get prepared by the next day with the big of a third of things around and and you're an opportunity\nMy feeling is this with my friend says hey the way in which Mike gets Alex Rodriguez who gets cut by the Yankees to walk over and do an interview and he has a weekly deal where he has he lie manning on\nEither I knew that question was coming that question was vetted that question was cleared\nYou ... you know hey everybody knows this but you know I got to ask you like I Would have to ask you about being traded\nHey this is the only thing the only organization I've ever known and saying I I Will never all you have to have you don't want to be traded\nThen you'll you say I don't ever want to be traded don't ever trade me cause I Will not show up to work I'm In New York giants\nAnd he has a no trade clause so yeah Oh yes you say is hey I have a new trade cause I have no interest in playing for a different team that's not what he said he like many said I haven't thought about it\nReally\nYou haven't you spent zero percent of time talking thinking of it I haven't thought a lot about it would be reasonable it doesn't invade my every moment it doesn't read every moment of my thoughts\nBut it's an unreasonable statement to say I haven't thought of it\nAnd it's a disingenuous statement to say when asked about being traded you know this is the only franchise I've ever plane but that's actually it's true but it has nothing to do with the answering the question [laughter]\nDo you think about being treated as the only franchise or played for not what I'm thinking about things better next game\nAnd of course if it wasn't if he didn't feel like he had to ask the question and he asked a question there would have been to follow up would you allow a trade to a team like the jaguars what'd you or would you allow it or a trade to a team that looked like it was a playoff team\nYou ever know Trey clause how open argue to being traded NATO but it all spirits are but that's not what was asked that that was the answer\nAnd oh yeah by the way even if you pay any lie down he is slippery he he's smart you're not going to actually ever answer\nWhich is what to do ... learn from\nThat was that was a lesson right there NPR from the lie manning ink say nothing but do so in a nice way\nDerek Jeter said nothing Twenty years

[noise]\n... show Fox Sports radio every day this time we played for a portion of a show previously on Fox Sports one of Fox Sports radio we call it and now [laughter]\nHey I'm an undisputed this morning that is whiskey Bayliss and who else is on that show now a chain and sharp Jenny tapped as well skip had this to say about the one team he believes can take down mighty Alabama in college football\nI told the great Joel clap before the season started that I thought there was one team that could beat Alabama and the more I watch that team the more I Believe what I told you before the season started\nI think Michigan has all the components to beat Alabama I Know Alabama with two at quarterback is flying as high as any college team I can remember in all my years of watching college football\nThey are dominating in ways I've never seen before\nIt's over after five minutes every game he throws three touchdown passes and it's just over\nMichigan right now is number one and passed defense in college football\nLook I I think Michigan would give them a game they have an incredible defund\nIncredible defense I don't know how much you guys watch the Big Ten\nBut Brian the work he's a solid quarterback a senior quarterback I did pick that game or did pick Michigan correctly in that game and the reason was because the work he was at eight interceptions to go with ten ten touchdown so he's a turnover guy but he was five twenty five\nFive times like never heard of numbers like that outside of ... and the big tent\nYou go back to the week before that one and they took on Wisconsin now I have\nLess faith in them at the quarterback position then I have in ... but the fact is that Wisconsin with their ability to run the football and they do have at least if not a great player at least they have experience at the quarterback position ... broke\nBut ... when he broke with seven of twenty seven twenty here's a guy who on the season is a hundred and forty two point six quarterback rating\nAnd against Michigan he was seven and twenty completing thirty five percent of his past is one touchdown and two interceptions crazy their defenses\nDynamic but but they're often it's even worse shape Patterson is still rather pedestrian um he he's a good running back they have decent wide receivers that just not great outside the numbers do I think they could give them the game sure sure do I think they can beat Alabama\nI think Alabama is just way too productive offensively you know I I saw this stat where I'm Haskins from Ohio State threw the ball over sixty times this past week\nLike sixty three times and in the last four games combined that's how much to us on the football asking through for foreign your actual like well if there were four hundred yards\nIn this ... almost the same number of passes to to buy Logan has over a thousand yards past like they're just a machine\nSo could I could Michigan give them a game yeah right now Michigan or in Michigan probably more so than LSU that organically play out because Alabama takes on LSU\nBut you know LA is used in let's say beat Alabama they're not going to college ball player I Do feel like Alabama's Michigan's a one team with the defense to compete with Alabama\n[noise]\nSay on the other hand the the lack of competitiveness in the SEC makes it a hard watch it just does it it becomes like watching the Golden State warriors like wake me up when we get to the finals and they take on the Celtics doesn't it\nIt sure feels that way we\nHaven't talked in a in a bit on the show we started with talking about the Dodgers and I don't know the baseball does this to me all the time he like baseball does this to me more than any other sport in which I'm watching a guy and he's clearly pitching well liked by as was last night\nComes in is a runner on a on second base strikes one out walks in walks Martinez another strike out and he looks intensely watch Martinez right\nSound like a radical sound like he was struggling and remember even intentional walk now they don't throw four pitches anymore which they should they should in the playoffs that's a mistake because there is the chance of a passable\nBut intentionally walks Martinez any strikes in egos he's actually mount ... in and out comes and Alex would come to the game\nThe red Sox I mean right now ... Cora everything he touches turns to gold you know he puts ... and the game endeavors hits home run\nSo there is some confirmation bias and giving up the home run but anyone who's watching that game last night like why are you taking them out and my my response would be that's not Dave robbers doing what he wants to do as the robbers doing what his boss wants them to do\nIs to Andrew Andrew Freeman came in from Tampa their analytics guys and like look we're living and dying by the book and they died by\n... by discover card we treat you like you treat you did the Dodgers go too far with analytics does it go too far they like and if they really want to go analytics wanna put by is that right field have would come in and if they throw right hand wrapped but went back ... back in what has got some at holiday next\n[noise]\nTheir job sites that Sandia tons of the wrong resumes to sort through that starts smart it's like making the lottery the centerpiece of your retirement plan does not smart but you know it is smart\nGoing to zip recruiter dot com slash Doug to hire the right person\nZip burger doesn't depend on candidates finding you it finds them for you it's powerful matching technology ... thousands of resumes identifies people with the right skills education experience for your job and actively invites them to apply\nTo you get qualified candidates fast that's why ... ranked number one by employers in the U.

P. recruiter dot com slash dug\nI don't want to say average stuff 'cause he's still got a tremendous\nCurve ball and and do a really good fodder but I think is south is backed up a little bit makes it much easier to hit now than it was five years ago but I I to tell you the truth on on your past it's hard to say I mean I I think he and knowing them as a tenacious competitor a he's he's everything you would want as far as hard work goes\nAnd I don't know I mean sometimes\nThose things that really hard to explain why tremendous Blair possibly one of the greatest pitchers of all time certainly of Myra um is is not have the same results\nAre in the postseason have the regular season if it's sometimes it's hard to explain but um and knowing him I don't think it's one of those things where it's a mental block but you never know sometimes it gets in our heads as athletes and ah it's hard to get it out\nDodgers weren't sharpness plates and bowls in the field and of course then you know\nYou give up a three run home run so it becomes well was a really competitive game becomes aid for when they ask you about that the analytics thing\nDo you think that these managers like a day Roberts that in the heart of hearts that's what they want to do or is that what their boss is that why they've gotten a job and their boss was like this is what you're doing and so they kind of\nTook the lack of a better term sold out to being to siding with analytics and so there got\nOh I don't I don't know I think that's a case by case situation I think that I think the managers and the and the front office now I think they make more than they ever have I think the analytic guys the general manager\nAll the guys just in general managers and the manager I think they be before every game and they go through scenarios and they they they get the input of the analytics guys and they talk about this guy comes down to face this guy you know the numbers say we should bring this guy in you know in this situation you do this and\nAnd so I I think that the relationship between analytics general managers and managers it's more of a collaborative group effort now than it ever has been and I think that the managers are\nThere I I just think that there's a lot less times where they go off or got now and and I think that that's the way that GM's analytics guys would tell you the best to take the human element out of it and if you just play it by the by the numbers that you've got your best chance of success\nAnd I think that part of some of the part of the the problem with the games that I I don't love that I don't like that I think there's a place for number\nBut I think that there's a place for watching the game with your eyes and go on with your gut instinct that a guy like the Roberts is played and managed encroached seen tons of baseball or he could see something like that or maybe the bias thing it's like you know just as dominant I don't care who they say bad off about against him I like my chances\nAnd so I I think that that's probably what you're looking at that I don't know if somebody's managers or you know for to sell themselves\nTo to the gym to get the job they'll tell them what they'll do whatever you know they want him to do and but uh I think that you're looking at at ... numbers guys haven't begun but what goes on in the game\nHow soon will you know David Price has had tonight\nYou know I I think it'd be able to see the body language I think your first inning if he's trying to get that motel going again and get the crowd into it he's got that good changes that was the best change if I think I've ever seen him throw that last game he said a hypocrite when I'm facing them\nUm you know you you kinda don't really worry about the change that much he was using it a lot and and it was really good so I think you know watching a change that and then if he's able to locate a fastball in all those write in it are set up that change that down in a way\nI I think that that the good formula ...\nWhat's it like to play and suddenly thought great atmosphere tremendous environment a\nCrowded into it it's a if you feel like you're kind of an old time warp of opinion and all kinds of baseball where you know you're you're it's just it's just a really cool environment especially now opposes\nYeah it feels like you should pull up like the old strip sun and we're like the the knee high like you always went along parents do you go like knee high you know and then around the bases like Babe Ruth does feel like a shot back in time\nIt's all it's a great it's a it's a great environment but that's the world series environment\nBut she didn't like that I remember you didn't like Dodger Stadium you especially with the white shirts you need like didn't like picking up the ...\nYeah that's a it's a it's not a great place to find out why\nIt just it's the the these are like yellow and it's hard to pick up the all the lights are lower uh it's it's a it's a visual um for outfielders um it's just it's just part of the like you you want a dark\nDark of atmosphere dark of environment behind it or to get your best read on the fall and it's it's\nLike I said those those the chairs out of the color of other rubbed up baseball\nYeah I I I mean you you would you would know I'm laughing how competitive you think the series is going to be\nWell I I think every time you count the Dodgers out they seem to find a way and there's a lot of dynamic players they have a lot of guys that can take 'em so you never really count 'em out I think that the red Sox are much more fundamentally sound team\nUm I think that they they are I think they're the better team but I also think about it are very dangerous because one through eight or they could hit home or and or you know they get a walk and a single mom you know they're they're very dangerous but any foreign affairs a three run Homer which\nYou know one of the world series um I I think that that that kind of thing is is like a ... danger but if I had to guess I I Would say the red Sox land and stuff\nBut I don't know I mean I like I said every time I think the Dodgers are out they they find a way they are they make it make it interesting\nWe'll ... we'll see if I David Price has the good stuff good stuff that's going for the red Sox if not the will probably have a series Matt Holliday seven time all start for time silver slugging in front of the show many thanks so much for joining us\nThanks to Doug ... she'll rules on here on Fox Sports media will turn our attention the NFL coming next will mark Cooper fix the cowboys often I'll ask Greg ... he joined us\nNext this is the jump godly show on Fox Sports radio [noise]\nSeries the old\n\nMedia home [noise] always say [noise]\nFollow us on Twitter during the October Matt this is an easy anymore with\nSports radio\nHey they're diehard years in football ... you might not even know the first football game was played in Eighteen sixteen on an average gained the ball is typically play for only eleven minutes and finally pizza consumption rates go up during the week of the big game okay you probably knew that last one well here's another bank you might not know that is actually ...\nPretty close they don't throw the ball down the field deep a whole lot now of course people are held in Mr number of weeks [noise] um [noise] I Would say that he's\nSomewhat of a high turnover guy because throughout his career he's thrown a ton of passes and it's not a defensive him I'm sure he would tell you that he shouldn't throw that many picks but I think the key thing this past week\nWas two things number one their defense was able to hold the opponents often granted it was the bills and they may not be able to do that every week but that that the game was such that he threw less than twenty five passes stock the problem in today's NFL and you and and that's the way it is with let's say someone like the show and watching as well\nAs these quarterback shouldn't be dropping back forty five or fifty times that\nThat's problematic and particularly when you don't have a big time offensive line you shouldn't do it anyway but it gets exacerbated when you don't have enough sense of line and then the cultures of oil and as a work in progress and the Texans line is not very good so you get these quarterbacks that dropped back too much\nAnd ... bad things will eventually happen\nI'm a little bit Carson lands in the Philadelphia Eagles only three of twelve on third down they did dominating times time a possession of who he was sacked four times and three of ... three of a twelve on on third down I I Know you're dealing with the backup at running back running small without their you only had thirty two yards\nBut do what by your estimation is wrong with that he goes off as\nWell I think there are lacking a whole lot of talent first of all I mean they've got a great title ... they've got a good white out in you know Sean Jeffrey not much else ah they've not run the ball this year anywhere near as well as they were in the ... a year ago [noise]\nUh we did a study of their third down since wins this play it and I think their average third down has been over ... yards\nSo that so we can talk about their their lack of third down conversions but not many teams walking for third downs when it's thirty eight plus on a consistent basis I don't think when says the problem at all I think it's a team um whose line has not played as well as a year ago they can't run the ball particularly well and they really do not have a lot of weapons\n[noise] other than that Mrs Lincoln how is the show right here you go yeah yeah um you you mentioned the Texans Ishaan watch them going to see and tomorrow night on on Thursday Night Football yup um\nWhat's your take the last year the kind of set the world on you went to bat Athens applying the kind of set the world on fire or this year they they thankfully rank right went for it in his own territory and that kept him from a tie which which would have been a disaster instead now therefore in three in first place near division what's your take on watching if you're watching him on film\nI like watching but I think that it's the they've got to be careful with how much they ask him to drop back and again this week they play Jacksonville who didn't score and he only through twenty four balls\nAnd and not that you're going to throw twenty four every week dog but I think it's ... with their own line and with the fact that Watson does have a tendency to leave the pocket prematurely to drop his eyes and read the rush\nThe more you drop him back the more problematic it becomes so I think he's working through some things but I like the way he throws it he will play from the pocket but the more you ask him to drop back the more you make that difficult so we'll see where that goes but I really like him as a quarterback I think I'll end up being a very good player\nRaged upgrade Cosell NFL Films joining us every week you're on the Doug ...
