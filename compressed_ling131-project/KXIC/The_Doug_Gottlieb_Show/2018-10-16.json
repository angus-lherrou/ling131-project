this morning says that bills quarterback Josh Alan ... not gonna play week seven against the colds and is expected to ms multiple weeks\nBecause of that elbow injury there was another part of that report is in that is interesting if they're saying that the players in the locker room would not be on board with Nathan Peter ...\nGetting the stark in week seven against the colds college football news Ohio State defensive a big bonuses leaving school and we'll focus on training for the NFL Draft folks had surgery to read very poor muscle injury last month and it's projected to be a top pick in next bringing strap\nGained through the ... to the red Sox and Astros whose at five ... eastern time you'll see that what on CBS series tied up at a game a few states that have all the against Dallas guy go\nGame for between the brewers and Dodgers on Fox Sports one breweries up for the adults yes do you want if\nFirst pitch expected nine ... nine eastern time geo ... goes up against ... tonight it's the open or to the NBA regular season Sixers Celtics at eight o'clock eastern time followed by the thunder and warriors ten thirty eastern Russell Westbrook out for Oklahoma City well Steven Adams is a game time decision\nFor the thunder because of a back issue dug\nThe big back a very very back Steven Adams probably the most enjoyable quote in the er I'm most in in most enjoyable coat\nOr anyway yeah he's great finally Austin Hoover did walk into that one he walked right in alleys tight clowning SEC defenses SEC op fences and like dude I was watching the rose bowl and you guys for one you line up and you put Fifteen Lyman on the field and running right into Michigan State and lose but I Do like\n\nA J Bates Thompson's that just waiting on got leave show to call out and they both are being selfish and quitting on his team like he did Kelly Bryant Nick closest coming off of surgery dude\nKind of different kinds of different the idea of not playing in a meaningful game 'cause you might get hurt is different than not playing and meaningful games 'cause you have been hurt\nIf you don't understand that I Can't really have a conversation with these really hard to have a ...\nUm [noise] yeah exactly well I Do\nI'm a fan and he had his predictions for the upcoming NBA season and many of them are good and I'm salivating over the thought that tonight you got to NBA games not going to see the Lakers take on the trail blazers until Thursday night we got good him and I like NBA hoops just fun\nIt's fun but one\nOf his predictions is um that Kevin Iran's gonna end up with an ex now he does\nAt the end of the couple of paragraphs back pedal and says look even the warriors have no don't don't even know who could possibly if no one seems to know Kevin rent because who he used to be said wasn't the real him and now this is the ...\nBut in his piece in ESPN dot com ... says they'd clay Thompson has no plans to take a discount Thompson is actually said otherwise but it very well could be accurate and the warriors don't expect him to lead sources say\n\nAnd so between clay Thompson not wanting to take a discount and the fact that people believe it's still Steph Curry steam\nKevin Rand could go after winning possibly another title and spread his own wings and go to New York to be the savior for the New York Knicks\nAnd there are some logical conclusion and there is business partner of course lives in New York City many have tried to climb that mountain that is the Everest of the NBA who can climb the mountain stick the flag in the ground and save the New York Knicks do I need to go through the players and coaches that have tried right\nFrom Rick Pitino and Larry Brown and Phil Jackson or all the way you go players whether it's Carmelo Anthony most recently ... penny hard away pat Ewing you name it\nMany have tried to be the guy or even after the ... regime and the Riley regime went away they haven't really been relevant with the exception of one eastern conference finals\n\nBut the idea that Kevin ... knows what he's going to do\nIn July of this year in July of next year during October of this year\nDo you know what Jack Lew is not taking into account the most\nPowerful but annoyed the second most powerful drug\nIn our existence second most powerful\nI I Would say it's love but it's something else is the most powerful drug at least in mail existence right the second most powerful drug is winning\nWinning nothing nothing\nCures all ills like winning little pill of winning hey last year this time Paul George even based upon his own words it was like dude I didn't want to go to Oklahoma City I didn't want to stay in Oklahoma City I was going to be a liquor and they didn't even win that much\n\nSo relationships evolve people leave all\nAnd the idea of changing and moving again dude I just moved half a block down the street and there's\nA ... oh\nYou got to go to the school district in change addresses every thing every account you have you got to change those are called Fox and Fox Sports radio and changed my address their\nForget about moving all that stuff and cable and satellite and the worst let alone moving cross country sounds like a good idea he actually do it\n\nAnd maybe he will but the idea that he knows right now when he's walking into a situation of winning potentially third consecutive championship\n\nWhen he doesn't know how he's going to job with the markets cousins\nWe don't know the health or frankly of 'em\nAre his of his you know hybrid big guy\n... ... you look at what the Golden State warriors are you want to production I Do think that for example tonight Kevin rent goes crazy I Do think that Kevin rent is one of two of the most likely envy\nBefore teams that are alive in baseball in terms of the best chance to win the world series so Red Sox Astros brewers Dodgers rank 'em one before the best chance to win the world series\n[noise]\nHi I'm going to\nGo up for those die ours Dodgers gave away home field advantage losing at home and uh the big reason\nThat I Can't buy into the Dodgers even though their bullpen was good is starting pitching and they're going to go rich he'll start to gain for he laughs at best fifty pitches and then the ace of course ... Shaw who the brewers got to last time around or I'll go Dodgers had the fourth\nGraders probability of winning the world series I'll go brewers at three that's because I think the American league teams are better than Red Sox who split at home with the Astros at two in the asteroids though I Do believe are the best team in baseball and now they have a home field advantage in the American league\nSo I'm not surprised by the Astros I was wondering where you were going to put the red Sox and uh too is a strong spots let's do a little NBA preview regular season starts tonight you talked about jak well some of his predictions Doug rank the top three teams in the NBA's eastern conference is ...\n... eastern come Celtics one and there was a big drop between one and two um I'll bite and go raptors a direct cooler at two and um [noise]\nHad three I don't know it may be a surprise for some people put the bucks at three\nI think yeah I I liked the Milwaukee Bucks I liked the honest\nI think um they're better because of you know the the two moves they made [noise]\nOne is obviously the coaching change that was made at about mid\nYear right when it was a media when Jason Kidd was fired but yeah I felt like mid year and the other one honestly\nI kinda think they're better ah with Jabari Parker gone by Parker they always wanted to play and they just can't guard anybody\nPain he was a guy who kind of demanded some amount of tension offensively now everything's built around young as I liked it better I'll put the bucks at the new arena new coach I'm like ... making the top three All right rank the top three teams in the western conference\nOr more years one thunder when Russell Westbrook healthy to rockets three I I think the thunder are better because of the consistency and because they got rid of Carmelo and the opposite for you is that a top three heavy conference is anybody even close to three I I Know but there's there's a big group\nOr behind them which is is is pretty good right whether you go Lakers or jazz people forget about Memphis my company didn't play last year because of injury\nAnd uh those ... predicts that mark a soul opt out at the end of the year and and go elsewhere [noise] uh when you have those two and ... you can and I think they drafted well\nYou got a chance there in Memphis they are good culture there in terms of how they play who they play I'll be like this deal when he was their head coach he's now with the Knicks [noise]\nUm I didn't ... will be better I you have New Orleans who was better after democracy cousins was gone I Know they lose Ron do but he wasn't really started for them anyway like I think there is a big group there but yes there's a big gap between three and four\nOr I'd finally jog let's rank the top three candidates for MVP not best players but candidates for MVP entering the NBA's regular season yeah I'm going to go a young uh Katie one ...\nTo and I'll put um [noise] the brawn James three it's not that James ... big numbers or press Westbrook stopped going to put it in a number Davis anti gay anti Davis would probably be the board but I'll put LeBron only because there's going to be a dramatic change number wins and he rightfully will get a bunch of credit for that\nDay and time again sky rocketing young godly issue [noise]\nOver the ... to the juice right isn't that the the adage will ask a Vernon Davis who Thirteen Years into the NFL he still doing it while his brother\nQuit at halftime that oh you're going out last spring Davis he joins us next the dugout show Fox Sports radio\n[noise]\nHere's again you can't win credit card debt\nWith lending club you can consolidate your high interest debt or pay off credit cards into one fixed monthly payment just go to lending club dad comments are few simple questions and if you're approved up to forty thousand dollars is automatically deposited into your bank account in his little is a few days ago to lending club dot com slash play book today\nTo check your eight minutes lending club dot com slash playbook all loans made by what bank member FDIC equal housing lender\nHey I mean could you know the Honda Dream deal sales event is literally happening right now where you can literally get great deals on certified pre ...\n...

I Would say the burdens had the best career and even a loaded not as seems injury when he was in Baltimore hasn't been as good but\nI Would say hello to not to is the one guy who had probably would be would go down and say you have had a better career\nI'm\nNear the Angela Williams who joined us last year at a very good career with Carolina and then later with Pittsburgh Roman Harper had an excellent career like you'd Roman harbor and part of us we had gray hair ... old like we're in Davis is seems older but not old at all\n\nYeah ... I remember him Michael Singletary didn't get along very well well that was the can't can't do it that way and that that was who you're talking about gay and he even admitted when you talk with us like look I'm different than it was then\nYou know mature to change my mindset that happens M. J. D. Maurice Jones through like I always think it's interesting how people look address like oh Vernon Davis didn't live up to do if you can drive from the top ten in the draft and get a guy that last Fifteen Years the skilled position of play plays in a couple of ... like\nI actually think he's a he didn't achieve what here over achieved\n\nThat people don't understand how hard is Vince Young was taken third pro bowler and his first year as a league by like his fourth year\n\nEven Reggie Bush you won the super bowl they Reggie Bush Dana league for ten years was the first team all pro once and then\n...\nIt it's we as fans kind of have to change our perspective and our our our way of looking at no did you become Rob ... or was he Tony Gonzales or know those guys are hall of famers but if you get a solid pro for Fifteen Years a pretty good about twelve years Thirteen Years that's\nYou know though that's a far that would be the last\nMovie horror psi phi I'd rather watch romantic comedies is like a thriller what's your favorite romantic comedy\nUm I I just said I'd rather watch one I don't know if\nI say you don't like romantic lead what he did yeah there was just reading Harry Met Sally I'm\nSure sleepless in Seattle yeah have you not seeing as they've is in Seattle um what is that the one with Tom Hanks yeah yes and Harry Met Sally is Billy Crystal yes\nYes I saw one of them probably a law [noise] long time ago\nUm okay so ... are you a ... of course yes yeah papers good of David ... thought okay yes yes\nI saw on a on a plane coming back from Miami and it was it was good\nAs it was um it's it's definitely it's definitely a thriller and at the end you're like whoa wait wait what's happening other aliens in this movie no okay\nNo um\nThere's a little bit of a ... there's a lot of how nine thousand type of thing to it but it doesn't occur in space okay ... ... yeah I I think report back I think you like it though but it it's a tribute movie Tyler Boyd I think\nHe is like yeah man I was really really good at my seat and I tend to agree with him I think that's exactly what it was so\nThe John ... which are making rounds John ... is the owner of the New York giants the quote is that oh Dale needs to play more\nAnd talk lots quote I Wish she would create headlines\nBy his play on the field as opposed to what he says\nAnd what he does off the field I think you need to do it all up a little more playing a little less talking\nMirror said I'm Still embarrassed to being one five I Can't stand up here and make excuses you you are with your record says you are as a wise man one said there's nothing I can say to make people feel better about that I'm suffering just as much as our fans are probably more\nI'm\nPat Sherman who was asked about marriage comments and says I don't like it either I'm disappointed or one in five working to correct that I've said it before when we lose games I'm disappointed for our players or coaches are fans are ministry nation that includes John I Know the feeling\n\nBut what did we really expect I like I can I went when you're a parent\n\nThe one thing I Want I you want your kids to do is ... have when they're not under your watch\nI like my my kid goes to today he as tennis we say you know like ... how did you did you do with the coach asked you yes or no sir and did you say thank you when you were to\nBe respectful and if they're not it's like mortified just is like you don't want to be the dad who yeah I had to tell your son to go sit down in the corner because he was being a jerk like that just doesn't reflect good upon you as a parent\n\nAnd John ... and they're going out back in the junior I Wish she would do like this was\nHe's under your watch you will allow him to act the way he acted\n\nAnd it doesn't matter what you said oh del by rewarding him with a huge contract the biggest contract at his position in the league forty even play\nThe game what was it like well you know we went to six seven weeks of playing in the season and he continued to act like a leader and act like a mensch we reward them and then things started to go bad like they didn't play a game they gave him a contract before the season began and they didn't have to\n\nSo the only people the giants had the blame is themselves\nThat's what his response should be you know I shouldn't be surprised about oh down in the way he's acted ways behaved but this honestly falls right on me I was on me I I thought he had changed and I gave him money before we saw some diversity\nThis by the way it was exactly what I said what happened in when I knew would know weather oh Dale back in June would change\nI could really easy to say it's even easier to\nDo and things are good which is hard when it's when things are not good\n\nI remember when when Johnny Manziel drafted by the browns and he was interviewed afterwards and they ask Matt Johnny Football and he goes hey I'm just ...\nYeah wow All right\nI used to combine interviews you remember what would Johnny Manziel did after he got drafted that night when I Manhattan spray people champagne method ... champagne\nGone on a plane hung over and flew to Cleveland and willing to and we're told now these different he's changed and I remember a report very early in the season there's video of players walking in\nAnd Johnny Manziel was walking in with some of the last guy is in\n\nThe one the last ... last guy not quarterbacks last players into the building\n\nAnd I said to myself then and I think I tweeted it and set it later on my radio show like\nI'm buying the ... I'm not I think yeah Brian whole year started ahead of him I was ... was out on the field well Johnny Manziel was just walking into the stadium one guy's a pro the other guys Johnny Manziel\nThat's basically have an outback um junior it doesn't mean that he's not preparing himself but he his issues are separate and distinct from from men's else right he's never been accused of coke or partying too hard with the exception when he's with the chicken the bedroom but even that people didn't say will\nObey Jay is on it it doesn't look good and he did like to go out surround himself people ... it's more about the flamboyant way he acts\nThe arguments that he has with teammates with other teams and with a immobile sideline objects kicking nets in fans\n\nHe tried to convince the giant sea change maybe I changed maybe I'd change maybe I'd change in change same David how you are to a diversity in verse adverse the exposes\n\nYou want to know what kind of duty is you do do you are let's find out how you act when you guys get blown out that's how you find out what kind of team you have what kind of leadership you have what\nKind of player you are what kind of person you are\nTelling me on well CJ bathroom started ahead of Jimmy ... last year because they want to put Jim grappling there until he knew the system\nUm it's funny I always thought this\nBut I was talking with Dave ... before the game on Sunday ... quarterbacks coach former giant quarterback left handed off from ... I was talking to him about um about quarterbacks and\nWhat allows guys to be successful he said the number one thing that allows guy to be successful is if they if they understand the system\nIt complete knowledge of the system\nLike there's nothing worse than you'd call a plane you and I knew it\nAnd you get to the line of scrimmage and you can do the hot yes I think because all it takes is one miscommunication you throw a ball to where you think someone is going to be and they're not and it's six the other direction\nCJ better as great knowledge of the system and until Jimmy ... how did they didn't want to play him and then Jimmy ... at the world on fire and was he great this year no he wasn't great this year but this idea that see who's got three hundred yards\nLike [noise]\nYou know Brian Fitzpatrick had four hundred yards and way better numbers ... back up so it's a you know if anything it gives credit to the front office and their understanding of of drafting a quarter back to doing a good job and developing a good job of CJ better\nBut you gotta do who's the highest paid guy or was the highest paid guy at his position in the NFL and is going to continue to ... do so there is no quarterback controversy\n[noise]\nHey you know Jimmy ... is a salary cap his thirty seven million dollars this year only Thirteen next year\nAnd they Eighteen point six million dollars there is a potential for an opt out at the end of next season that this is for grapple\nI'm All right so a Nick ... is going to miss the remainder of the season in a matter of fact he dropped out basically of Ohio State he's going to rehab and he's going to get ready for the upcoming NFL Draft I look I don't like guys skipping their bowl games\nBut in this case he wasn't going to be back until December and when you're coming back from a sports hernia or something there are core muscle tear core muscle injury\nThe likelihood that your full boats or if you will when you come back to play\nYou can in fact hurt your stock and you'd only missed the college football playoff Ohio State makes it this one I got no problem with is it's a there's a difference between Michigan game ... you know I'm\nGetting ready for the NFL Draft when you're already hurt and getting ready to get and getting ready for the NFL Draft because you fear getting hurt gain you disagree\nI just think it's a unique situation because of where Ohio State is in the season\nBeing undefeated in the national championship hunt and for what their fan base feels\nAnd that program feels could be meaningful games meaning a college football playoff semi final and national championship the Christian McCaffrey Leonard for not\nEven Denzel Ward last year for Ohio State settled the cotton bowl those were just bowl games this is different I think because of where Ohio State is in the national championship picture\nAnd that's where I think it's his dad clarifying that Columbus station that he wants to get to be ready to mid December\nI think may ease some of the ah the anxious that some of the Ohio State fans probably felt knowing that he wasn't coming back and wouldn't be back for that Michigan game or a potential Big Ten title game but those situations were different like McCaffrey miss the sun bowl\nFor that ... I think it was or buffalo wild wings ... whatever it dragged on I'm was theaters in the thick of a national championship picture and I think that's what makes it different\nYeah I I Do think though that by announcing now does give clarity\nUm I I talked to a gym in the NFL this is\nThree weeks ago and like duty and playing again it unless unless you really wants to play against Michigan again but even then it's hard for your first game back to be a game played that level\nYou you know what's here's what's important to remember okay this is like why didn't get rose play in the playoffs that one year that he was hurt like which year I don't remember which here because he was hurt like every year and the plant\nBut there was one year which he was he was cleared right before the playoffs and he didn't play in the playoffs remember I'm Talking about yeah okay\nLook there are certain best playoff games are played a much higher level and you can't just you can't work your way back in the game shape at that level it's the same thing once you get to the Michigan the Big Ten championship and the college football playoff\nSo I agree with you unique set of circumstances Dana Jeremiah from the NFL Network joined the show he's also the chargers radio enlist\nAll ask him as the chargers exposed Baker Mayfield what the charges are really just\nAn elite team that sex in the dugout like show

Stewart to discuss how different his reporting process has become over the years\nOr was it was a home person is was absolutely um\nYou know 'cause 'cause in the old days when we used to my albums you know yeah he's he's in the middle of the problem for about three hours you get fined drop and then go industry to I'm trying my music when he when he missed them back to his next time so he is\nJust just took off so much time of being studio you know my family and everything and the way we do this can\nLive with moms from wouldn't see Kevin and we just do it through the computers of uh [noise] you\nCoach sequins on trying to smooth there to send it back to him and he sent me back to me than we only went in to to to a few times was real drums home and do the vocals otherwise we sold on the Kevin's house in my house which is wonderful prone to\nKeep listening to my heart radio for ... rod Stewart and all your favorite [noise]\n\nFox Sports trending\nIt wasn't shocked me um you know I Know he's\nI just think John ... is kind of all over the place depends on on the day you catch them whether he's in love with his quarterback he's concerned about his quarterback you know same with a mark Cooper single out of their personnel\nIt's just kind of a roller coaster ride um from what you hear so nothing would surprise me at this point in time I made a comment the other day I Know he said today took offense to ah the insinuation that they were tanking\nUm I Would just say well that's one thing I think you could make it taste the NBA got right I mean that's the worst thing you can do is be six seven eight when team in ... in that world so I if if it's me and you've already treated ... signal you're not win or anything right now so don't go half and jump all the way in\nA you're gonna have a topic next year and then and go get your your quarterback of the future if you don't believe their cars the guy and\nGet as many of the picture you can totally revamp this roster\nI I completely agree like look baseball does it ... won a World Series last year if you go back two thousand Thirteen they tank now everybody and baseball is tanking I I completely agree uh it just has done it may be on them I don't know this was was plan a plan B or playing see but it does feel like that's\nThat's what they're doing ... show here on Fox Sports radio um what do you make the Carolina Panthers other team kind of all over the map could have lost to the the giants at home and then did lose to the Washington Redskins on the road\nI don't know I mean that's there's they're a team or the when I watch him I just think man anyway the bets on NFL football is certified nuts um because the Carolina Panthers or a great example you do not know what you're going to get from them\nOn a weekly basis and one can be ... when you go back and watch it we camp kept clean and he's got some room a suburb rounded legs we'll put his feet in the ground or you can play wanting football he throws obviously with plenty of of a loss to the drive the ball accurately and all that stuff but then when the Redskins got around legs falling off rows\nOf all goes all over the place so uh that's one of the issues that's been there in the past continues to be there are the good news for the Panthers I think when you just you see and and you see a guy big time receiver a ... and get him back in the mix he got his feet what a little bit here go see him get more comfortable that'll be a big addition for them getting a big tighten back\nWhat do you do if you're Jacksonville of lake boils considering you got another he's he signed a new contract well what do you do\n[noise] you know it there is a belief or strong belief and in the personnel department and Blake oils and it's been unwavering um I just I just would hate to\nWaste of what could be you know if you keep them this year you keep them in the next year you could have a three year period where you have a championship caliber football team\nUm major quarterback just isn't good enough um so I Hope they're not in that situation I'd be at least making calls to see what's what's out there at ... percent I probably wouldn't do it inside the division I'm guessing what the Colts are but I didn't choir and see what was out there I call I call auntie Bridgewater\nI probably can't pull that off either but I'm at least on at least on some homework has been trying\nYeah I mean it's it's it's crazy 'cause they're they're screwed they they can't they can't get anybody makes money right they they have to get somebody who's who's making backup money\nTo me though it was the you know the you know with all the money they had to have a lot of room they still have a lot of young players are going up having to pay but they never were really they never really got in on the current cousins thing they they committed the lake and and that was their deal and I think\nThat might come down and one of the big mistake because I Would imagine Kirk went to Minnesota because he thought it was the best chance for him to win that was what his decision was about the money just had to meet the threshold um and I think the Jacksonville and if they if they meet that threshold I who knows I think he might have gone Jacksonville over Minnesota\nYeah they get they get better personnel though in Minnesota in Minnesota in terms of what it in terms of wide receivers I'm All right lady on bell doesn't make it back to week ten make I don't know what four million dollars or so you're Pittsburgh you play 'em right like you're not going to sit in when you're playing them all that money and he's that talented\nYeah I mean maybe you give them a little bit of a pitch count initially I'll just make sure you don't have any soft tissue injuries but even when you watched that game of Connor had you know very productive game but there's some of those runs\nYeah the the eight to ten to twelve with levy on bell you know role and those are twenties and thirties and forties you know so uh he is an upgrade and or if you're ... you're trying to hunt down a championship you get your best guys on the field just got to make sure you don't over you Sam or early on just makes you know any of those injuries\n... last thing I and this this does go to the bears deal um I thought\nA out of a time out to hit on a touchdown but uh but he he left some heat up some throws out there that you know ...\nI don't know I like Mitch a lot they love him in terms of his personality and what he ultimately will be and he's very athletic at a huge run to start the second half which kind of triggered their their first tried to put points on the board but he he can get inaccurate he can get he does make only preached nap reads it feels like\nBut I have this hypothesis yelling throughout at U. K. really run that can't city stuff where there's all kinds of most you know kind of movement and the only really running a cup you're not running a ton of plays but they give you a bunch of different looks\nYou know it's kind of a slight of hand thing right yeah\nOne of the reason I think they're not as good late and games and this is Kansas City sometimes and and we Chicago is when you run into minute ... you can't do all that stuff you just got to kind of line up called the play and go\nIs that a is that a viable hypotheses over maybe why does it work as much in the playoffs or in second half of the big games is that you can't do it so much sleight of hand\nYou know I I'd be totally honest with that I never thought about that but it actually is a great point um they were able to use motions in shifts information ... defenses to get the match ups that they want\nAnd it is you know you you can't do they get a lineup snapped a ball and go when you're in a two minute situation then it becomes more about players in place you know can you win one on one and can you make a throw a ... that's ... that's actually a great point and uh and when I Want to think about talks and coached about because it is pretty interesting\nAll right cool and then the other thing is they ah they love Anthony Miller I don't know you like it was a wide receiver\n... great route runners tough tough as nails too\nMan ... could not have been more fusion is he's like look I've only been to the NFL for\nSays you know seven months six months or so and he's like so I don't know what a pro bowler looks like but I'm just telling you that sort of looks like to me he's like the time and are they really like alright listen uh things much rejoined his great work on the radio and the TV will say that the ... this week and appreciates being our guest on Fox Sports radio\nOh you're the best things but\nI did that is the one in only Daniel Jeremiah joining us on the ... the show let's let's do this the NBA season begins tonight is this the last year of dominance will see the warriors\nWon't discuss that are coming next first\nUsing true can easily find the car you want to price and to call you can avoid the ... the ... the confusion you encounter on line by getting the great price you can count on before you ever visited dealership I remember the old days of walking into a dealership when\nYou look at the sticker price and then all of a sudden he started kind of calculating how much below that sticker price can I get those days and then you throw out a number and the salesman that go back to my a sales manager and come back\nHere and it was back and forth and it was like an all afternoon all day affair those days are done\nIs to cut it will show you what other people in the ... the car you want you know what a fair prices and the true car certified dealer knows this they said they're true price competitively over three million cars\nWon out the bottom of the first inning Boston's up on Houston in each town by a score of two to nothing game for between the brewers and Dodgers is it not on eastern time in Los Angeles breweries up to one\nThey have ... on the hill rich chill pills for LA giants ... Mehra told reporters today you wish you ... back in junior would do a little more flying and a little less talking and quote marrow cities embarrassment of teams one in five star to an added that he wished there'll be J made headlines on the field\nInstead of in interviews off the field Ohio State defensive end the boats that won't be on the field again for the buckeyes he's leaving school to focus on training for the NFL Draft\nHis dad's job and all ... the Columbus ohio TV station that his recovery from his core muscle injury likely would have lasted until mid December and tonight\nAs I was talking about the ... regular season fixers and Celtics in eastern thunder and warriors ten thirty eastern of no Russell Westbrook for Oklahoma City tonight will Steven Adams again Tom decision Doug [noise] wasn't lining\nFrom nine to ... [noise] like if you give a yes don't look ... gas for what's up the the line did you see the lion science game um I think I did it was a double digit number Thirteen yeah bigger thing is we're gonna we're gonna see Gordon Hayward tonight for the first time since last year's first game\nWhich was Celtics versus the Cavaliers instead it's Celtics at home\nAgainst the Philadelphia Seventy Sixers he played all have two minutes I remember I I walked outside 'cause I was flipping burgers or something\nUm no not not my job I'm although some of you believe in listening to the show I should be flipping burgers but I'm a Bush\nI Walk outside of flip burgers and I come back in\nAnd everybody's like oh and I look at my phone and I saw the injury\n\n... no man has ever been more disrespected than Gordon Hayward while not playing a game where they were was an all star in the west\nThey beat the clippers in game seven in staples he was the biggest free agent signing of the last season and while not blame because he suffered injuries similar to that\nOf Paul George come back to be an all star\n\nSuddenly be like well you know going to reject him on the bench like might be their best player yet do you play and guard for positions they can shoot past offend and rebound what am I missing\nLike I I like Jason hate him a lot I like jailing ban a lot you know what they're not they're not as good as Gordon Hayward and Kyrie Irving\n\nSo I think the south is going to have a great year um\nI I don't love to do the\nBats but it does feel like a good bet to take the Boston Celtics tonight at home does does it was like a symbol on Seventy sixer new general manager\nElton Brand so meanwhile are the Sixers got Jay Jay read it back Robert Kevin ... know minutes restriction would invade difference is going to be off the bench and we'll get a chance the mark helpful in scary carry\nAll of those videos like and I'm I'm just as guilty of when I play is this thing called games slippage you can look in a gym withdrew handling you can look you can look great shooting a basketball I think there's still a hitch there and the junk shot but we will find out tonight\nAs a matter how good you look at an empty Jim how good looking preseason regular season game on the road again scary ... he was going to try and rip your heart out yeah we'll find out if if ... has it or doesn't have it or how far back he actually is\nFrom uh from his mental hiccups of a year ago and I think in ... make a jump shot can they make ... make a temp job\n[noise]\nUm I said this earlier with with Daniel Jeremiah or if it's my belief that they're going to use levy on bell as much this is like hey you have a lease on a car and\nThe lease is up or you got to give it back you gotta get back a cop car or at least a car at the end of the year\nBut you have another car that's perfectly fine you already have your next car it's fine and like I got a couple of thousand miles you can join this couple of thousand miles in the car\n\nMy brother does one of the he does that at least they're swap Elise and least traitor if you guys ever seen in those so what you can do is people try and get out of their leases you can pick up their lease and you know they've already paid the down payment sometimes they'll even give me a a little bit of a bonus so that you pick up their lease because they're moving and they can't take it with them\nThey're getting close to being up on miles they're just tired of their car\nAnyway\nWhen you're paying so much of your ... amount of opportunities base one on your town and two on your salary the same reason Blake bottles is not going to be moved or you know that no one's going to trade for them and they're going to be will cut him is the salary that he's\nOwed the salary that he is owed by the Jacksonville Jaguars well the same thing is true with lady on bill you owe him that much money and\nYou're going to lose him at the end of the year of course she used in\nThis feels like I'm no as I can read runners interferes was he's safe at second base that's the big question so the Houston Astros now\nThere's no more in the neighborhood rule in major league baseball\nIs baseball the only in the neighborhood sport is anybody else have and in the neighborhood rule I'm trying to think of NBA basketball you're like ... there's a lot of that with vowels you know kind of close enough in regular season but in baseball used to not have to step on second base when somebody's trying to break up a double team\nYeah I had to be in the neighborhood or shoes and hand grenades right but now in baseball because a replay you actually have to be on the base yeah standby\nI almost think that pass interference is because the refs can't see of contact is there so if you don't turn your head around you're likely to get the call so maybe it's the opposite\nOf of um being in the neighborhood but I mean nine times out of ten if the guy doesn't have his head turned around on a pass they're going to call interference whether we made contact or not\nYeah that happened a on mic if it's Patrick twice he he broke up two balls this way but there's four times in which he did he wasn't turn around and I think it's ... for the Miami Dolphins but uh it happened to get called for two pianist twice for not turning around when the ball was on the way in\nYour maybe great coverage of it may not touch him but it's it's kinda the opposite of what you're talking about that you're almost guilty of it even though you play something the right way mhm mhm\nYeah look I'm I'm\nThe one thing that I found is that\nSometimes TV and it's because we're not focused on a wide receiver the entire time and we can't see it we only see and replay a lotta times you can in person\nYou can see especially down at field level where the refs are you can see a little bit more clear as day like I've always felt like man that stuff happens really fast you can miss it but\nWhen you're only focused on a couple of guys because of how they split up the field I Do think you can CPI a little bit easier you can see holds a little bit easier then maybe you can see him on television even though television seems to give us the best either", "show_name": "The Doug Gottlieb Show", "year": "2018", "city": "Iowa City", "day": "16"}
