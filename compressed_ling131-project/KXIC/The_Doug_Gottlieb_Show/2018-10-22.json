uh special teams coach of Washington saw the way that the long rap or the cowboys moved the ball on the ground before snapping and\nTold Jay grew and he thought that was illegal even though it's not\nAs a loose or a mentioned that you if as long as you lift the ball off the ground you're able to shift it I guess you've never been called for that before but the specialty and coach from Washington to OJ grew new told the officials to watch for it and they called it at the worst possible time for Dallas\nAnd interesting and and I'll tell you there's official should notice\nThe official should know this coming into the game that they should know this is the way along snapper snaps prepare for your game just like everybody else does but if he is moving the ball enough to make up a defensive player junk guys a penalty but it's never been called ... it's not been called the ... the ... and that's on all the previous officials were not catching it\nFirst of all I don't believe it's illegal secondly these officials should know this is the way he snaps the ball\nHe's had six penalties for for false starts after nearly two thousand snaps that's it\nMan that is tough

game seven Denise oh like how much how much gas could he have in the tank [noise] hey hey it's October this is I I get it but um\nYeah that that one well I guess dug it just allows them to use him in game one come back in game five if necessary and then be available in that game seven if you would need it so [noise] because if you put you mean game too I don't know [noise] yeah and you're pushing it yeah but don't don't you\nI mean don't you want them to be right I I ... the use of her Shaw is his fast that the Chris Taylor catch can you can you tell me one you remember being as\nBigger bigger interesting 'cause I thought it was a good catch but I didn't think it was as\nAs great as you thought it was what I Will say this okay so he's only four people didn't see it okay uh it was often with Lorenzo came in Des Moines okay and hits it and it's to less center\nYellow jihad says right so keen on deck right basically the brewers have to do the whole line of Dallas leads up a yell at you left the game was a home run yellow chanted to left center field\nAnd it is not quite to the track but it's like in that perfect spot in between left and center field he's playing a you know natural kind of left field he's on the run moving to his left and back to and she has to reach with is I guess\n... left hand goes right on it I mean full extension on the move makes the catch on those that it was amazing catch and\nThen what happens is the final score because yeah Seattle police hits a home run in the Dodgers next half the ending it it becomes no one talks about it but I think the game changing dramatically if that ball drop\nYou know what I think in this is the only reason why probably downplaying it and it's something that you touched on last week and we talked about\nWas the brewers pinch hit for Josh later\nAnd the momentum when when uh Santana came in and struck out in all of a sudden it was that at that point\nThat you're like alright haters out of the way we don't have to deal with them anymore like there's this new momentum that has developed because of bull pending\nAnd it was like the Dodgers got past that hump facing hater instill we're up to one so it so it helped with the ... strike out is that helped with the catch and then it all poured on when Jeffries gave up the three runs bomb all of that in ... it was basically the the bottom of the fifth opposite sex\nWas basically the game yeah so there's your baseball recap\nA lot of football as you mentioned the breaking news raiders pretty wide receiver Omari Cooper to the cowboys\nFor a first round pick according to ESPN\nSo Cooper who's got about a year and a half left on his deal in Oakland now we'll go to the cowboys in exchange for a first round or something called Clinton wanted all

is Ron but Raj Enron do start to three game band\nAre huge that's a huge opportunity for Alonzo ball who looked awful in game one a second game looked OK at the start and then was ah was was pretty good in the last Houston but run do he here's a question I have for you\nAnd a buyer you got other work to do just you know damn buyer does a lot of he doesn't just sit around like for our show to call on and he's doing updates for locals as well um\nIt's one thing to spit or spiritual and punch\nA another team player and there's a certain certain kinds of uniting force behind you get into fight during the year and everybody's trying to show their toughness for LeBron James\nIt's a different and Chris Paul is one of the brown James as best friends best friends as that banana boat crew right and do do you spit in the face of one of my best friend\nMore than that's worse than punching a guy in the face\nIs spinning in his face I just wonder how long term that relationship goes between run do who is is going to be on the bench and probably loses starting job for good after this anyway I just wonder how that ended up playing I\nMean somebody spits in your face like what do you what are you going to do and I don't know it wasn't like he he didn't like load up on it\nWhen I was an aloof [laughter] yeah ... yeah yeah I Know what have you seen\nSome of there's been a lot of Seinfeld references made about you know the was there a second spit or yeah well yeah I ... down [laughter]\nYeah it was it Roger McDowell what was it anyway um I I you know I think that's that that whole thing is is absolutely passing let's let's get back to the raiders that's the story the moment that's the story of the day I get what John Kearns doing I don't know if this was his plan immediately there's um [noise]\nOh what's the book is called I recommend this book to a lot of people so I Want to make sure I get the name of the book right I Believe it's called the first tiny days is the name of the book\nAnd what happened was I didn't get this I didn't get this book until uh I was so for the first ten years of my professional life in broadcasting I worked at ESPN\nAnd\nWhen I transitioned to work at CBS it was so different than anything I'd ever known the the way it worked at the ESPN when I was there was because I was on their campus uh just organically I interacted with almost everybody there and it got\nMe additional opportunities and you could go into somebody who ran ESPN news and go lay you need some I'm here and you go into somebody who did sports center go hey if you need me I'm here and if you go into somebody who did the magazines that you know I Am here and you go into dot com read they started the did you do when I was there or whatever\nAnd so I got opportunity after opportunity by simply being there knocking on doors and being available and doing a a a reasonable enough job\nWell when I went to work at CBS though they have you know we had radio when I was there but that was knew they had the cable network but that was um until the last\nTwo years three years I was there it was actually a different location then um then you know CBS in the weekends\nAnd the digital element to it and the online that's actually in Orlando, Florida like there's something called silos everybody's got to get their silos and though you can work for different ones like they actually have to get on the phone and call each other and that is that you didn't used to having multi platform people that just go in\nAnd they're also not used to people going like hey I'll do that hey I'll do that again for example so you guys know that I got to do the sideline for the NFL which is awesome so cool well I'll just CBS and they have a cable NFL preview show\nOn Sundays and so early on the basketball season started in like November I Would take a red eye out on a friday night I'd fly and I land I'd take a shower and a nap and get up and do like six minutes half time get on a plane and fly home that was it\nAnd so I I told one of my boss there was like hey I'm you know if you need anybody if you're NFL show [noise] I'd love to do it and they're like well why would you do and I felt like well you know I Do a national radio show oh we don't really talk college basketball on\nNational radio show like well you know we have the iron do basketball and I was actually doing in all sports TV show on the same network where we are talking about all these other sports\nBut they that's just not how that's just not how they conduct business there used to they want to ask you they don't want you to ask them\nAnd so frenemies friend of mine said hey there's this book called the first Ninety Days\nA amazing huh oh the miss direction of cowboy talk is not like the cowboys are like All right you're going to be an Jason Garrett's back well put it on the front office and do the knowledge where we forgot we are starting to show talked about the confidence of the cowboys yeah\nBut look I I Do understand that you got identify problem and they didn't replaced as Brian where they're good enough go too wide receiver [noise] uh I don't know if he's eight Thirteen million dollars in his last year [noise] wide receiver but [noise]\nUm I Would actually think here's here's the way you would calculate if you're Jerry Jones K is\nProbably not although Samy Watkins is the fourth best weapon or the chiefs and he's getting like sixteen but\nYou're only paying seven hundred I don't think they have to pay the bonuses I think the raiders had to pay the bonuses so between you got us a half a season and then the season so first season and a half at about\nFourteen million I actually think that's not bad and you had to get a number one wide receiver and\nGetting a kid out of college and that's not that's not a great ride to go\nBig deal little deal or no deal the titans they'd go to Mike ... chose to go for two instead of the game telling extra point in yesterday's lost to the chargers in London [noise]\nI thought it was a big deal I thought it was an awful decision not to everybody's like was a play called his bed the decision was good no one's in the charges were on the field for thirty six minutes defensively\nAnd they were out of gas [noise] take the extra point flavor over time you get the ball you will scores charger were done do guns do big deal it given away wins and look at what these ill fated go for decisions have done to the Houston Texans right [noise]\nI mean are they there oh in three and they're taking on the colds and Frank Reich chooses to go forward instead of\nInstead of putting the football at his own forty three yard line\nIf he does do that game ends in a high there's a tie completely different season and of course Jason Garrett doesn't go forward and punch on the Texans forty three the very next week and now this helps the titans lose a game\nThat they could have one in overtime and so Houston's down first place that division [noise]\nBig deal little veal or no deal Doug that Las Vegas feels the world series is most likely to be wrapped up in six games nine to five are the odds for six games series according to bravado\nI felt like a big deal\nYou know they seem to have a good sense of it\nAnd I do think the red Sox are the stronger club but man their bullpen has been a mess a mess so far in the playoffs\nLook there one uh ... overturned a home run and one in ... catch a what a you know being missed way from losing that series the Houston Astros a completely different series so I I

the end of it but yeah so I went so it was kind of us are too early\nGot it or what about what about you music ... you're you're kind of pass the it was it was cooler when we were younger there was that there was a phase there when it was no super in know piercings and tattoos no person no tattoos\nYeah um look when I started when I went to play in college I did have this desire to have a fervent desire to have an attack on my arm just like I remember playing in Stefan ...\nAt ABCD camp and he had this big black panther tattoo and I was like that's the coolest thing I've ever seen that was like maybe I'll get a lightning bolt\nLike I just thought I'd be like a lightning like what like they'll they'll wonderfully lightning bolt\nAnd I could just never and my mom was like here's the deal come back come back with ... with this and without these two things come up with a degree in back without a child and without a tattoo now they got it eventually succeeded at all three are brought back by home life though yeah so um\nSo I never get a tattoo\nAnd my my thought of the time and it has kind of worked out that way where I started to see the change in\nWhen I first started in college there was like one guy on my team Notre Dame that habitat and went to Oklahoma State there's like three or four maybe five guys that cat now I just I knew if I was a guy that didn't get the tattoo I Would actually because he used to get one to kind of stick out\nBut then being the only guy that doesn't have a tattoo it actually sticks out more now\nAnd you don't have to face your body and being Jewish we don't get tattoos all of those things where it to my face but I did like the Christian Bale take people out on social media and then all of these guys that have to have a a belly button ring\nOr tweeting up pictures like story on with your Chris is like actually I didn't have a belly button right\nSorry about that\nI Want to talk a little bit about this Eric read Malcolm

in the ... through and got picked up like those mistakes those mistakes run counter to what Amy read traditionally believes in in the playoffs which is\nAn turnover can't take crazy chances\nSo Reid has had sustained success with inferior quarterbacks to my home and I'm not I Don McNabb had a really really good career and they got the five and a siege two games in one Super Bowl\nThat stuff was awesome and at no point in his life has been ... been what ... homes is throwing the football nor do you have the overall weaponry they had some pretty good pieces in when Tio was there and you know they had a Brian Westbrook at at running back they had some really good pieces but they didn't have\nThe depths of weaponry in China's Kelsey might be the best I'd be the best pet sketching tied and in the league better yes better than grown Bronx bigger but Ron ... is in his birth stolen by the way not as healthy as Kelsey is\nWatkins their fourth best then you have to re kill who seems to be an stop on they use them as a ... bunch and then you've got a tremendous running back like they got that the armpits and stuff they seem to have all the different pieces um\nAnd a good degree up its mind was the other wide receiver cut a bunch of balls or send them I'm like completely blanking like I was like oh my God I forgot they had him because he's they're they're so good\nSo um I this is not in any way trying to but how many times how many times can we see it uh with Travis ... you had five ... hunt\nYeah I think it was to meet your tears it maybe just one catch sometimes you get now to be the\nBig tide and he's the second time that he's like six seven six eight he's a monster they have another they have somebody I think it's Spencer where there's other running back and catch it some of the actual like they just seem to have do ... do they have to do and you can really throw it\nBut tell me when it's worked before we know defense and as much as this is the way they call it now they call it way more loosely for the ... in terms of for the defense once you get to the playoffs\n[noise]\nSay best team in the NFL as the rams were okay with that\nSecond best team in the NFL would see me of most dumpsters the patriots and be a problem with that and then you put by the cheese right they're sitting there at at the third third best team we okay everybody okay with that like those seem very reasonable rankings now the patriots and then of course now the page to have a chance to get healthy\nUm I I Want to just look I don't want to dive into this Eric read Malcolm Jenkins controversy

Kaepernick or like that's part\nOf negotiation part of negotiation is you're gonna have to give up something in order to get what you want\nHe got a hundred million dollars for this stuff that you're protesting for a hundred million dollars earmarked for things that the players are invested in off the football field\nYes he sold out but he just sell out for his own so not for the right of the cause but the bigger point is this anyone who tells\n... tells you that the protest art and divisive and the problem with the protest I give you a ... here's two guys truthfully on the same side of the aisle and they can't get along and they can't come to some sort of agreement\nIf they can't how can we expect anybody who has a different perspective to to come to some sort of agreement protests
