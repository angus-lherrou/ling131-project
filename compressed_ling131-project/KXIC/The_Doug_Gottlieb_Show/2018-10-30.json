Kamara and mark Ingram on the field at sun during lightning combination we're both of those guys are so incredibly dynamic both as runners and pass catchers it's hard to bet against a team like that\nUm I I Will be thrilled ... you know to see them play a team like the rams or a team like the chiefs and sea of Drew Brees still has an indigo shot for shot with some of these young I'm a high flying off fences\nOn the defense is really encouraging you know mark ... is is still an incredible players still the headliner on that defense um head to head right now against the rams I think that they lose 'em but you can never really underestimated office with that many weapons\nAnd of course uh you know that that game is that game is upcoming so we'll get a chance to see it actually on a football field what about the chargers outlook they didn't beat the chiefs they didn't beat the rams the two elite teams that they played but they've also still been playing without joy both ...\nAnd who's arguably their best player probably the best defensive player any changes how we look at Melvin Ingram when you had the two of them as Russians um they have so much negative baggage so many people are convinced that they are in fact for real\nOr are we convinced that the chargers\nAre a legit contender in the AFC\nI'm convinced that there are contender but I I still don't know that they get over the hump and and beat the chiefs the thing that scares me about them is that the often so it's a little bit one dimensional\nUm and it runs through Melvin Gordon he's essentially the number one receiver on that football team and I know that can now has more catches more yards but he's been completely ineffective and the red zone I think he has one receiving touched down this year and when it's third down\nFive six seven uh he's almost a non factor it's all about Melvin Gordon the team that figures out how to shut down Melvin Gordon who by the way it is coming off a minor injury or going or you know coming out of the pie week\nThe team that figures out how to shut down Melvin Gordon in Austin heckler coming out of the backfield lining up as a wide receiver\nIf it's going to be able to figure out the San Diego ... I'm Sorry the Los Angeles drug\nYeah ... not having a hunter Henry and I know that they brought Antonio Gates back and he can still be marginally effective and not having a hunter Henry\nChanges them for the worst in the red zone and\nWe'll see there's a there's an outside chance he comes back and plays late late this season um last thing the the eagles have been I think at least mildly if not more than that disappointing so far this year course some of it comes from not having your quarterback and even when he comes back\nAnd not being completely healthy all Sean jeopardy not healthy to start the year they they add\nA they they had golden take today um what our thoughts down the eagles as they've added number two or maybe even a slot wide receiver in golden Tate\nHoping that would that division they can win getting the playoffs and take another shot\nYeah you know I I'm excited to see how they use golden ... lower together because I think they're very similar players and they both really thrive in the slot\nSo I think that with Nelson having a little bit more experience and the often they asked him to go be that boundary outside receiver and they asked golden taped to take on a more familiar role at something that's probably a little bit easier to adapt to it in short notice um you know they've got bigger problems are probably at other other parts of the roster but\nAs we know in today's NFL everything runs through the passing game so if you if you've got an opportunity to you know spin I I I think a third round pick is what they gave up on them yeah yep\nIf you've got the opportunity to go get a starting wide receiver was going to get you\nSeventy eighty catches a year with a third round pick a especially when another team in your division just gave up a first round pick for a player that is not producing nowhere near what Golden State has been producing in Detroit and of course I'm Talking about the cowboys trading one for mark Cooper that I you know I think that's a great deal\nUm the eagles are at a critical juncture in their season\nAnd they've got some pretty good opponents coming up I mean you've got the faith on November Eighteen you've got a Washington defense on on December third you've got the rams in in mid December on the sixteenth um so I you know the the road for them is a little bit more difficult than the first half of the season has banned and I think they they felt like they needed to make a change\nNow well nobody mentioned the saint saint got rams this week the Bengals on the road or the eagles at home will know what they're they're real upcoming Robert you do a great job of them to be a make sure you saw him on Twitter read his work at the MTV dot com things much you're doing is thanks for having me\nPleasures

get rid\nOf music right not yeah it's not the it's the basically teams just aren't meeting are asking price for John\nAll we want as a seventh round pick in Twenty one eighty four\nAnd nobody wants to give it up so I don't know a hundred and sixty something years from now nobody wants to give up that seventh round pick so we are stuck with John\nAsked for music it's just really his attitude is the problem is it's just an issue that we can't but we've got twenty four minutes to try to try to make a deal a deal just went down according to Adam chef tour of ESPN any unwrapping part of the NFL

more trade or do we believe that jaguar story but they had four guys arrested for supposedly running out on a bill walking out on a bill um ... here's how I Know it to be a very strong possibility

ten thousand euros Lenin and what's interesting about it is\nThey didn't run out on the bill they ran out of the bill well now you're probably guilty but if they walked out because they've said hey

you love with the eagles added a wide receiver to love this alliance got a third round pick for ...\nI Would say who [noise]\nI Would say probably the Texans getting them areas Thomas [noise] cause because they just they have an absolutely look battle or it might be the best player of any of them and the rich get richer the my fear for the rams\nIs that by trading Leah third round picking this year ... like the rams whole plan is they know they're going to lose a lot of these guys on one ... one year deals\nAnd they're going to try and draft using that deepens back we'll keep trading away your third round pegs or whatever like that's where you reload a but the rams already good just got better because of this so\nLet's go let's go Thomas who I don't think it nearly as prime but really important at one\nI'll put a ... at two\nIn terms of importance or because I thought the rams gave up a lot and I'm going to put golden tape at three it is the eagles and they've shown the ability last year to go out and make a move ... jai and look how change them I think that this gives them a third weapon\nFor Carson went and it's really important they went to spend as much a third round pick a remember they were they were looking at a mark Cooper as well they're only willing to give a second from Ari Cooper so I Would I Would put that is number three\nDoug rank what you'd think the

I was like what what he's supposed to be like one of the ... great kid uh I'm kinda waiting to hear some more information\nOn what I look at all but I I'm guessing honestly this happened to me on the floor all five of the other end I'm driving back from the airport because like a dope I parked at the airport you've not Lou into a different airport I should just ... to the to my life\nAnd there was a traffic jam and in ... in an effort to avoid\nA like an accident there's a like an exit that you don't actually have to exit you know what I'm Talking about a ... okay and so last second I kind of switch over and everyone's driving too fast and a cop like flags me down with this and he's like why juggle awesome wide you go off of the uh\nUh a crossover like that that that median and I was like yeah I I didn't I got there right beforehand\nSo yeah you did I was like well I'm In a town hall I Would know if I went over something right like you know why are you talking back to me I was like dude I'm not I'm just you're being you're asking me and I'm being honest you I\nI can honestly see where you're in a traffic jam it take a quick turn and you didn't know a cop as they're like oh you only around me over like I I understand it might feel that way to you but I was just trying to get around traffic and get to my meeting on time\nNo question so yeah that that one answer your story ... answer your question I you know there's not like there's a great option uh but I I Would I Want to explore and just see what Paolo it looks like at some point in time or the second half of the season you're not going anywhere and and that it's over\nSo uh what do you do for Cleveland he'll take take me through the process of finding a head coach seconds help fix this thing\nOkay I ... the two names that will keep an eye on just kind of thinking about this\nLast couple of days you know winning winning is is is something that hasn't been down there to find someone who's been successful not an experiment\nBut somebody with actual experience to this one and a two names that I come back\nI don't know all these guys will end up hitting the market but I think there's at least a chance to see one of them oh Mike mccarthy we'll see what happens if they don't make the postseason in Green Bay um and the other one I keep an eye on is John Harbaugh I mean John Harbaugh off the ravens who are at five hundred right now they don't make the post season\nI Believe you look it up I think it's like five six years they have not gone\nTo the postseason that'll be the end of ... tenure the cost of will take over as the new general manager that's already been set up\nAnd you know how it is a lot of times you knew general manager one chance to go higher your coach haven't been to the playoffs five for the last six years I could see that you know kind of be in the end there so that those are two names that kind of keep an eye out for Cleveland and no more experiments let's go out and get somebody that's actually one\nYet the one thing though is it is a copycat league right and\nYou know whether it's nagging or Sean McVeigh these young ... with all these fancy ideas you know that Jimmy has some sitting there going like hey look it\nIt's it's worked for so many other teams and offensive inventiveness worked in Philadelphia for Carson once worked for Jared golf seem to be working for mental ... even though I think he's more limited up to three or how 'bout that push back you're going to get from your owner\n[noise] yeah no I mean look that up and that's been think talking to folks Ronald Reagan's feel like it's all the hires are going to be offerings of guys because if you don't hire and all sorts of defensive guys will come in there and say well I can bring this guy the coordinator well yeah you're going to be there for a year\nThat somebody else you're hired on his head coach um so you know offensive minded guys that is what teams are going to lean more towards um but\nThen there's the name you name it hasn't been thrown out there that selfishly that would be would be so much fun and I don't know if it would be a disaster or not I would like to see the ... with a with a chance to work with with may feel to be fun\nYeah I mean like look at some of those air raid guys got Lincoln or I don't think he's leaving Oklahoma\nYeah at least at least you can't do each although that would be fun to\nHe couldn't do you couldn't do leech a kings very and may feel did not end on good terms now and a whole person would be interesting it would be it would be ... you've\nNever heard one time with an assault job I mean nobody ever French but that it would be a it'd be fun\nYeah and he maybe he maybe the best of all of them considering his kind of creativity and flair and uh uh but but we we shall see great stuff DJ thanks so much for joining us thanks ...

Maryland\nThe two had been on the following the investigation into the program following the death of player Jordan McNair\nYeah at which ah which I mean it's a terrible story right terrible story um and there was a was a culture of fear but not a culture of what was the was the other term I'm\nLike look I the talked with the ... yeah it wasn't wasn't attacks there wasn't a toxic culture but a culture of fear which\nI think reads a little bit differently ... with the things they were doing that were odd yeah apparently are watching ... animals kill each other head they were showing videos at ... killing each other to certain players to motivate them to toughen them up that's an odd form of motivation but again is that something you want to fire\nA guy over I I don't know I mean they you know this is what happens in sports in life people try and change pull this Dole let's change the culture\nOr too soft and of course then the strength of conditioning coach goes a little bit overboard I don't understand how the medical professionals allowed a kid who is clearly suffering from something to go or you have to go so long without receiving the proper treatment I Do not put that blame on the coach I don't\nI'm less the coach sat there and said don't treat him which is not what he's accused of doing\nThat I don't really understand\nYou know and and some of the stuff can go bad we had a player named Scott rubbish who is brother Brett was are starting center is dad Dave course played in the NBA play Kansas\nAnd Scott during my second year my junior year at Oklahoma State during Christmas break were were how often are run together if somebody doesn't make a time\nThat everybody keeps running we kept running so long which everybody just stop like we're not running for more he's got to make his time called a five and fifty five up and back five\nTimes and fifty five seconds and we were called them every name in the book well he was like my leg hurts we're like no it's a little bit north of your leg right that's what really hurts and finally he finished and made his time but not after getting a bunch of grief from all of us because we're tired of running for it\n... does that taste you served up by Dan Patrick and of course was echoed by calling ... earlier today as well sounds like the same people are saying the same things to Cal heard and Dan Patrick\nI'll buy in guys like to hire people they know and um and the idea of hiring somebody unproven you Jackson's proven proven to not be a good head coach\nOr Mike mccarthy has proven to be a good head coach and proven to be a pretty good play color when he's done that\nUm but we also don't know what you mean has some decides as the owner there's an expression in football and it works in basketball and baseball as well but especially in football and it goes like this owners own\nAnd what does that mean give me a ... a perfect example that\nBack when they drafted Johnny Manziel they had an analytic staff highly paid one and they won ... with the best quarterback to take was an analytic staff said teddy Bridgewater\nSo they thought about taking teddy Bridgewater couldn't decide what to do end up remember has some got the story goes got a suggestion from a bum and of course I'm sure the marketing department said we can sell a whole lot of gear fill up the stadium and be exciting if we hire if we sign Johnny Manziel\nCoaches didn't want it for an office didn't want it but you have someone that\nYou wrote the big check to own the the the Cleveland Browns Jimmy has them and so they drafted Johnny ... and it ended in complete and utter disaster but has some could do it because owners own they make the final call so this all makes sense for Dorsey\nAnd it makes sense in terms of bringing somebody was credibility but there's a bunch of things that have to happen one is the Packers have to either not make the playoffs or get eliminated early in the playoffs\nToo he's got to be fired three Dorsey has to be willing to wait that long to see this thing through and for Jimmy asked them has to decide that he's going to\nAllow John Dorsey to make that hire this has gone coward on why Lincoln Riley wouldn't leave Oklahoma\nLincoln Riley all his quarterbacks are good how do we know that Lincoln why they looked at Baker Mayfield and goes yeah that's who I wanted my NFL quarterback he probably looks at Russell Wilson pilots with Aaron Rodgers Carson once meant Lincoln Riley his obviously been great for bakers career Baker was a walk on couldn't get a starting scholarship\nHow do we know that Baker is so great for Lincoln Riley's career especially in the NFL\nTyler Murray is the new quarterback at Oklahoma\nThrough eight games compare Baker last year for this new kids ... calories numbers are better\nLincoln Riley would never say it publicly Tyler Murray maybe a better fit for him in college than Baker every quarter back Lincoln Riley's had in his entire coaching career they're all stars at Lincoln while he's a smart guy how do we know he looks at Baker and goes that's the guy at one time my career to\nUm look I think there's some of that I also think there's two other factors one\nEither college or pro guy and Lincoln Riley has never shown himself to be in a pro guy just isn't it the cliff kings very would make more sense if not for the fact that he in may feel did not end on great terms when may feel left\nCourse may Philips ministers replaced by pat homes as well as Davis Web but the fact is the kings various spent time the NFL as more of the pill knowledge and the idea that Lincoln rather is gonna come straight out of coach being a head coach for a year and a half in college and being the head coach the Cleveland Browns that's a lot\nBut also there's a college guy in a pro guy the other part that's changed is college guys make so much more money now than it used to use just be a limitation on what you can make and when you're Lincoln Riley and you can be in a place where you really can't when you make five or six billion dollars a year working for arguably the best athletic director in college sports\nYou don't feel the need to like Scott Austin Kendall young guy will replace ... goes and plays baseball\nWell I don't see him leaving either and I see the dysfunction all the court coaching changes in Cleveland as well as being not being a pro guy the reason why\n\nThey will turn to the NBA upcoming neck I have a a hypotheses\nOn what the warriors are going to do to keep themselves engaged and it's playing out

I'll tell you look at the the\nThe couple of thoughts that I I thought they would be a little bit better uh I still think they're trying to figure out the lineups and the suspension didn't help as they're trying to figure out who to play in grim with and when do you use ball they didn't use ... and the fourth quarter late yesterday at all which I thought was a mistake because even though Ron does better\nUh defensively all around he can't shoot were as long as the last show and the ability to catch and shoot makes them open shots 'round old even look at a jump shot\nBut um I I did think that they would get everybody's best effort you know kind of like\nYou you know sometimes the warriors will get like they're they're now your big game and I thought they got that Jimmy Butler looked like Jimmy Butler all star I Want to show the world I'm a superstar last night hitting three fourth quarter threes including the game clincher last night\nAnd I think that's one thing that they maybe they didn't understand or didn't plan for that's got to be frustrating LeBron he's used to dealing with this and the rest of his players are not\nYeah I mean look absolutely um you know the Lakers even though they're not of the worst talents are going to get a warrior mindset for teams as they come in and are they play LA wherever that may be that that could happen all season long you mentioned the Ron do lots of stuff and you know this is\nWhat I thought was going to happen to in terms of fourth quarter in who's out there and I wonder how much influence LeBron James has\nOn who's on the floor at end game situations because if he does that influence wrongs don't make sense I mean Iran do catch you but what broad wants guys out there he can trust and Ron do at this point is the guy because of his IQ because of his experience that I Would gather but you know the Bronx clearly trust one lump though is it all the way there yet so\nI I think there's a lot of issues that need it worked out and looked up they're going to get together at some point there to win a out of\nTen and January or February the question is how deep and the whole are they when they finally start to get to the around five hundred at Christmas I don't think they can make up the gaff that's going to be there to the class\nChris Mannix joining us on Fox Sports radio Hi Lou six games and gone without insider information feels like they wanted the tank and he was tanks but no tanks is it that simple is there something more that leads the guy who's been to three straight finals to be shown the door so soon\nI think more or less it was exactly that um you know their drastic situation I Believe you have to check me on this but it's you know they if they lose if it's under ten they get to keep it if it's over time they could go somebody else\nI'm ... and look they they want to play their younger guys in pilot who has\nA strong allegiance to the veteran players out there so we're not going to burn your colon sex and thirty five minutes per game we fix Churchill can help and Wendy rocket elite JR Smith on the bench he's loyal to these guys that you saw with all the Instagram post they're loyal to him right back but I I think that's what it boils down to they want him\nIf they were going down and they're going to go down playing the younger guys and type it wasn't wasn't down for that and you know in addition to that got you know you see the capital of injury and it makes it even more than ... that they gave him all those years not deal like in the argument that Kevin Love would become more treatable because he's under contract for\nWhat four more years was\nIt just never made any sense to me now they're they've got Kevin and he's he banged up with a foot injury and do they think about training at what is it has value I mean they're just not a bad spot right now in Cleveland\nOr the bucks the best team in the eastern is still the Celtics\nI mean right now we call it the walking but you know I I'm In Boston right now because this game tonight the Celtics will figure it out like they're just way too good not to to figure out who's role goes where and to stop deferring to each other a little bit too much\nA Milwaukee is fascinating because you know there there's there's a comparison here the Golden State in that\nMike boot and holds or might be too you know to the box with the ... was the Golden State in March Jackson took them to a certain point same thing with Jason Kidd but you bring in a high level coach say what you want about ...\nGmail skills they
