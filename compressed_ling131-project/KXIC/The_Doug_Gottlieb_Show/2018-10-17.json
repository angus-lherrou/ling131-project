[noise] ... yes a climate\n[noise] so I think already know the answer to this but what is the price where you would spend your own money to purchase them or go to hundred is obviously still way too high but I mean if if they were like twenty dollars a day or so ugly\nIf they look like they got a sneak up on a glass of water Marlon Marlon they're apparently going to get new uniforms in a new logo

those colors and more it seems like it's a it's not a good luck I Am not a fan I guess the question is how much what I have to pay you well aware of the ... are aren't they all\nLike all black\nThe picture that they that they are showing for the new\nOnes are black with blue and yellow orange red and white ... yeah\nBut I mean if you went to an outlet mall and you saw that in the clearance

straps across the front and they have read runs\nRed red and yellow underneath and then some blue on them as well and then ... is that what it is\nYeah you can only play for the Oklahoma City thunder and the issues that that's the only thing I Know is that it would maybe man I don't I I guess that the ideas they pop right 'cause now he's the shoe color rule in the NBA where you can have any color you want [noise]\nBut you didn't have to put them on lunch to wear purple [laughter] on this question\nIs ... colorblind [noise] [laughter] right\nOh man\nStay annually are not with colored already

they could take a beating that's a big big when my son is he just he just trashes shoes because he plays sports outside and um anyway [noise]\n[noise] yeah they're they're I wouldn't pay a dime for

bleep out of here and quote [noise]\nUm he sounds he found a balance that that was not the most alarming thing in the oh no you want to share the most you you're most alarming thing is I don't know um [laughter]\nYeah that was one of those it's one of those you should read it I don't really want to share with\nAnd there's like a new piece coming out each like day of another another chapter in and this is life I'm\nI I don't know maybe that maybe he just lost his mind for a minute that can happen to\nMatt Holliday joining a seven time also for time silver sluggers dug out in the show Fox Sports radio\nSo now the sudden the advantage goes completely in favor of the Dodgers because they survived that Thirteen meaning of the remaining shattered does come through with the game winning run after a huge hit in in the thirteenth and they turn to clean courage Shaw who he is not the cleaning crew shot that you use to face when you were with the St Louis cardinals\nAnd he wasn't very effective is first time out against Milwaukee\nWhy Kurdish also different is it just what used to be Ninety six Ninety seven is now Ninety three it's that it's simply that simple\nI I think that that's a big part of it I I think that when you when you when you have to honor a mid to upper nineties fastball I'm with high spin rate which you know I don't know if people know that the ball place fast pitch is up in his own he used to be able to pound right ... with Ninety five are up in England\nAnd and now you know some of the fast balls or even down to the Ninety Ninety One range or you just don't have to be quiet as a conscious in and play you know you don't have to in your mind be as ready for the the high now but not a fast ball\nThat that would make you so far out in front of his curve ball and then and swinging over the top of his wider\nUh so I I think he's a he's a different style pitcher it's more of a cutter you know when the ball is inside and and ah it just it looks a little bit different than it has in the past and and that doesn't mean you can't get out obviously still had a really good season\nBut I I think ah whether I you know I I don't know why his lawsuit down I don't know if it's accumulating of qualities any anger\nOr if he's you know how to sort of throws back or whatever it is but um you know when the when the velocity comes down typically that's been comes down on the water and and\nThe curb on up I don't think he throws enough curve balls or you know he's mostly fastball ... or ... but um I I don't know I don't know what was it to me at the at bat is not quite as difficult as it used to be\nThat holiday joining us in Doug ... the other side I'm a you know a leaky played in going back to last year Red Sox take it on the Astros and they got to they got to Joe Smith which came a lead and\nAnd then all of a sudden Roberto as soon as completely blew up um the red Sox turn to report cello who's not what he used to be against Charlie Morton how much does a serious change because Boston got back home field advantage last night\nYeah and I think it's a it's a real this is a really uh I think pressure packed game for Houston tonight I mean I I think this is a huge game I mean it's ... it's going to be I I think that all of a sudden a lot of the pressure\nGoes back onto them which I I think experience obviously last year they had they had plenty of a pressure and and inexperienced and playing a very intense games that that they had to have so but I Do think that the ... the series kind of took a big shift last night\nAnd ah and I think more than you know he's got that experience and he's he's really good I mean if you if his his stuff you know I don't know how you physically but when his stuff is is on he's going to be very difficult to especially in that ballpark um and and so I I think the Astros win tonight if either if I had a pet\nUm but you know I I did these game right here in the future who said\nI got I got like thirty seconds or this guy comic Laughlin apparently was sitting in the enough so Todd well and they they're using him of stealing information how valuable information if you can sit\nMost of the other team's dugout [noise]\nYou know I don't know what he was trying to get I mean everybody's trying to you know everybody's on everybody's trying to figure out what sign are using one runners on second base jury lifetime better\nI mean there's a lot more going on now than ever before as far as I've what I've known her so\nI think they're trying I don't know what they're trying to you know what he was trying to steal or supposedly he was seeing if they were the on checking you if you're checking me\nStart with you know but um I I don't know I guess there's an advantage I can tell the hitter what's common or yeah or if you're a base runner and I know what fine\nMatt thanks so much Matt Holliday joining us the Doug ... show ...

Gurdon last time around with the raiders had to say about what rude and inherited\nA lot of down beside the fact that they got a hundred million for ten years was practically all you gotta legitimate franchise quarterback in their car\nAnd I think after being in the organization for nine months and months I think that realization is different now and I think that he's got to sit there and look at really what does he have fears are they part comes in\nYou can talk about the raiders rebuilding but when you have a franchise quarterback never rebuild you repair\nAnd they're talking to rebuilding which shows your your you know\n... ...\nLet's get to ... from the NFL ... joined just in the ... the show or do you agree with Michael ... assessment that John Gurdon thought he was taken over franchise then in franchise quarterback instead they have a quarterback that runs the franchise but is expendable at the end of the year\n[noise] my guess is that John gluten thinks that whether that's true is interesting because I think Doug if you look at Johns history or many other quarterbacks he had I think pretty much all of them were veteran quarterbacks\nWho'd been around the block a few times or some would argue if you look at his career that he's never really developed a young quarterback\nAnd say what you want about their record he's still a young quarterback just because he had that great you are a few years ago does not mean that he's a veteran a grizzled veteran who's been around for a long time so I think there's two sides to that but my guess is that uh what Michael and body said is probably true within within John goons mind\nYeah but I I'm I'm I'm asking you based upon\nDo I think he's a franchise quarterback franchises is is a relative term um let me ask you a question is Matt Ryan a franchise quarterback yes\nUh I think\nA lot of people would probably believe that there are car could be that kind of player\nBased on what he did earlier in his career and what his developmental looked like a so you know I think you'd have to be with him every day I think this particular year\nI I think the fence has has struggled and there's a lot of throws under five yards from the line of scrimmage under ten yards from the line of scrimmage I think there are cars is a guy with a strong arm who likes to snap it off and it could be a case to of an offense and a quarter back that don't necessarily go together\nWhat about John Watson I think many people were convinced that he could\nHe could break the mold on quarterbacks that can run and that could develop into being pocket passers last year they ran more of a kind of college and style off and uh it's been hit or miss so far this year when he wants to Sean watching the Houston Texans on film what do you see [noise]\nI think I see what I Would expect to see a guy who's starting who started eleven or twelve games and therefore has significant inconsistencies to his game he he must continue to get quicker with his ability to eliminate what's not there and isolate what is there\nThere's far too many snaps in which he created his own pressure\nBy staying too long and what's not there and then there's also too many snaps in which he created his own pressure by leaving the pocket too early\nSo there's the the problem with all these guys who run dog is that that removes the structure from your office and it's a very ... and these are great highlight plays but it's very difficult to build and often say consistent task game on a week to week basis\nWith plays that are outside of structure and make sure offensive line look worse they don't know where your quarterback is\nSo it's it's it's very difficult they were exciting place to watch but you can't live like that\nNo no question about it or Doug ... show Fox Sports radio that's the voice of great Cosell from NFL Films ... what's what's your take on Baker Mayfield who struggled against the pretty game or chargers team that had seemingly had a very good game plan and a building a wall in front of the more you struggled to see down the hill\nYeah Baker struggle this week he played against the defense and when the chargers that for those who remember guts Bradley who's there DC now when he was in Seattle\nIt's not your grandfather's gross Bradley there were a lot of multiple front looks there were a ton of what we call sub packages he played with five defensive back six defensive back seven defensive backs\nAnd he changed up the looks and I thought that Baker Mayfield in this game was not as decisive because of that he was not particularly quick with what he saw 'em\nAnd that resulted at times in both poor decision making and kind of a ... and this might sound contradictory but I think you as a former point guard will probably understand this kind of a mix of both impatience and hesitation at the same time\nNot know got got it um I completely understand exactly what you're ... is Doug ... show on Fox Sports ... can you figure out the Panthers I mean I I Can't I have if I watch a game and then I watch the next week game it's like I'm watching a different football team\n[noise] well\nYou know and I think that comes back again to uh not not one hundred percent because I don't want people to take this incorrectly but I think Cam Newton has always been a quarterback that as a pastor has been somewhat erratic somewhat of a week to week proposition\nAh I think North Korea has probably recognize that now that he's been there for quite some time\nAnd therefore he's incorporating integrating more of all those multiple run game dimensions that the previous staff used because I think that ultimately plays to Cam Newton strength he's certainly capable of ... throws and and you can see them any given week Doug as you well no\nI mean he's a physical freak he can make throws that or do you know three or four people can make in the league\nBut there's just an inconsistency to his passing he's it tends to be scattershot he at times tends to miss throws that are there and that that\nIs tough for the the worst thing and you appreciate this the worst thing for a coach is unpredictability on a week to week basis\nYou're ... and for any employer right eye any employer when you're when you're unpredictable I Need to know where you know it's it's it's hard to forget that football players is are any employer to have an employee you use unpredictable Greg Cosell joining us on the ... why the massive breakdown with the Tennessee Titans offensive line\n[noise] yeah they really had a hard time and and I think they they struggled on and off this season\nUm they they play the team with the ravens that is really multiple with their fronts\nShows but from one side and drops down comes from the other side and I thought the the titans had a difficult time identifying pressures\nAnd then what made it even worse is when they did a good job with the identification and had a blocked up\nThen they would lose some one on one battles and that just makes it worse that makes it look really bad\nSo they just had a really difficult week\nUh in this game and I I think right now they can't run the ball and that's really causing problems uh there's there's absolutely no balance to they're often it's putting too much pressure and Marcus Mario to who is still developing in a brand new system he's now with this third system in forty years dog that's hard\nYou know for those who really like Mario to that's that's a difficult thing three systems in forty years\nI'm ... I'm I mean I'm totally intrigued by your take on the job\nAnd everybody wants to lay blame at the feet of Eli Manning and I think that's fair I think it's possible that he's a shot fighter but there's also issues I Would guess with the office of line and with some of the play calling when you see the giants is it all you lie or there are the factors\nWell I think Eli is is a problem and I think a lot of people have been you know kind of struggling to say that it's a problem but he has really had issues with his ball placement this year dog and you can do everything right but if you can't throw it or you want to then you you don't have anything as a quarterback\nAnd that's been an issue all season and even we all understand that sake one Barkley a spectacular we get that but there has not been a consistency to their run game you all you have to do is go back two weeks Barclay had two runs in that game one was twenty yards one was thirty yards his others Thirteen runs gain minus two\nConfusing well it was confusing not any more until you about true price from ... it's a price it actually means something because it's the exact price you pay for the car you want including
