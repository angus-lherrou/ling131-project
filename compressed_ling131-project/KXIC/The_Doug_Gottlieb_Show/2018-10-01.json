Gurdon yesterday get gets his first win and there've been plenty of people that have been critical of crude and for trading away we'll make\nMy point was simply that look listen to what what\nHe has had to say and that you can't afford to keep a you know two guys that that that soak up twenty percent of your salary cap right and oh yeah by the way the raiders weren't good last year with ... you know and then again he he he took over a Super Bowl team and the train away their best defensive player\nI I kinda think it's a smart long term plane and you look at how dare car is improved steadily during his time under ... I'm a I'm kind of a buyer and the ... even though I Do love all the things he did in the offseason you played for them what are your thoughts on ...\nWell I Do think he's got a plan going forward you know and I think the other part of the situation we're missing with the ... issue too is I think the raiders have money issues and I I'm not so sure that could actually pay the liquid cash and me the upfront money that could map was going to demand so I\nThink that's another issue that plays into it as well it certainly hurts that they have ... and I know\nYeah I mean yes they weren't great last year with ... on the defensive side of the ball yeah but the year before they weren't great either and he made a number of places to close out games and you know was the NFL defensive MVP because of that whether it was ... is our\nInterceptions against Carolina Panthers that he returns to the touchdown and critical moments all those type of things that's what great players do I do think they've been missing that you know our first started at the end of some of these calls football games it was great to see I'm going to win yesterday\nGarrett car is doing some very good things he's had a few bone had moments but let's I mean\nThey actually buying the emailed out yesterday\nI don't know what he's doing what he's doing what he's doing Miami I Know you're not surprised over New England\nBut it looks so bad the week the week before right now and again Edelman back they they appear to have figured out how to use Josh Gordon a little bit do you get more and all that of course is gonna you know ... ... as he gets hopefully gets hell did they got drunk\nUm they they seem to trapped in a pretty good running back as as we all ... or so I mean should we should we not ... is is doing and still one of the elite teams in the ...\nI I don't think they're going anywhere I don't think like ... why is there on the like a league talent a list for Chris ... but I think when you combine the course of course the coaching staff and the Brady Koch factor\nAnd their ... their experience and playing type football games I I Do think you have to put them in the conversation is one of the league teams and they see what you just take everything into account\nYou know then you also hey you got the call for this week okay yeah I I expect him to win that game Kansas City chiefs that that's going to be scary for the Kansas City chiefs I Know there are awesome but\nMan you know New England knows how to crack the code on some bad defenses too and that Kansas City chiefs the fences up in the special either so I'm certainly not counting them out I Am after yesterday this is the thing a yesterday every once in a look at the score and go wow they one thirty eight seven they're often says back on track\nNo I'm not totally going to say that yeah that certainly will improve with Julian Edelman being back in the story of yesterday was their defense that game was three nothing with what twelve minutes left in the second quarter\nAnd then Miami's deepest finally just got worn down there's only so many times you're going to stop Brady Bello check Josh again is before they crack the code a little bit and put up a few plays\nMiami's office was just horrible yesterday\nAnd I do think that that's where the ... the price of thing to me it was\nNew England defense aligned dominated the line of scrimmage and their coaching they were I watch the film already they were all over some of the past concepts of the Miami Dolphins like they knew the call or they had huge tendencies in certain formations and that's what New England gets dangerous this time of the year\nWhen there's four games to watch on film I used to break down film for them the New England patriots\nWhen they start to accumulate game after game after game and they can study you more and more in depth man bill is not the greatest coach just because he's lucky he is extremely intelligent and he knows how to break down what teams are trying to do ... in a weekly basis\nYou mentioned Kansas City with a league catch up to Kansas City\nTill like not not to like we're not going to see them far off the earth like we've seen the last few\nYears I Do I expect this pace to keep up no but I think the big thing is is hey this is not I'm not blowing anybody's brain here either I mean Patrick mom's is the real deal he's not going anywhere like his his hundred and ten miles per hour fastball is not going to slow down here they\nSpecial quarterback and\nThen they have other special people around him with a really creative system\nSo now they're going to be a handful all year what's gonna happen to be damaged teams are going to have to get in front of them for one they're deep sense is not good we just haven't had to perform yet because Kansas City jumps out and everybody thirty one nothing Twenty one nothing whatever it may be\nBut no I don't think there's often a gallon and system and numbers are\nAre going anywhere to a degree I just don't think it'll keep up quite the pace we saw the first few weeks\nChristian scratched up I'm In uh we got to catch up off they are going to hear more about your family appreciate you joining us to continue to enjoy your work on NBC\nThanks Doug I appreciate it may be good\nThat's why many Christians joining us up by the way OU Texas this week I

just a bait and switch to add that we use to get to hear to buy more expensive you what\nAnd then you get past double overtime you got to go for two essential let me acquaintances to\nBasketball that would be if we decided basketball games once you get the overtime let's only play half court then once you get to double pass double overtime you could only shoot threes if I suggested that the NBA or in college basketball would would anyone say that's a good idea\nNow which is why can't you know like I was like oh it's so exciting it might be exciting but it's not football\nFootball is played on a hundred by fifty field\nNot twenty five by fifty and you have to go for two\nI don't like ties but in this particular case in your the Indianapolis Colts force than for you get stopped you hunt the ball and you have to play another day\n\nAnd so to all of you people who are defending Frank right I Want to hear from you on week Seventeen when the colds missed the playoffs by a game\nOr by half game and the Texans make the playoffs by a half game or a game because you\nGave away you put losing into the equation\n\nAnd I understand at risk reward we want to go for it but you have to ... in in football you have to be both you have to be tough and that's what Frank right you're saying right rise going like oh we got to be tough we can have a winter's mentality I got it but you also have to be smart\nBig because you can take that well coach you know listen I Know I'm Andrew Luck I Know I shouldn't throw into trouble coverage but I thought I could and we could have gotten the touchdown you also get an interception you got to be smart\n\nYou know this is this is Jimmy ... running down the sidelines last week for the San Francisco forty niners the smart thing to do is that bad about the tough football ... well we want in San Francisco we want a culture of toughness\nI leave our quarterback can run over some dudes and get a ... yards what kind of running backs and wide receivers do\n\nThis is no different in basketball than what we call a good shot or a bad chest doesn't mean you can't make a bad shot it just means the percentage of time in which you know a contested three will go in off the back board from straight away he's pretty minute\nI don't like ties no one likes ties\nBut I thought we hated losing then we\nHad apparently Frank Reich has forgotten how much you hate losing and how important that game is going forward is fine\nGoing forward is fine I\nBought one stop with the whole guys are playing for ties in the NFL no one's planning for ties those teams missed ... field goals and cut their kicker shortly afterwards because they're kicker is blue kicks as the as the buzzer expired\n\nAnd time school or possession and opponent matters\n\nAnd I know that he can get away with it because it's his first year right if it's your for in your contract here and you have a a a you have better count around Andrew Luck you probably can't get away with it whereas now you're like wow we weren't going to the playoffs anyway\nWhich which you likely dramatically changed the outcome of this entire season for both teams\nBecause you made a dumb decision going forward and you know that's cool in mad\n\nMen I Would go for ten times intent\n\nBut at the same bed let me quickly gave you get you to um\nGet you an update\nBecause we have a final score in baseball why are we got a final score high ...\nHigh then I'll give it to you or the Milwaukee Brewers have gone into Chicago and beaten the Chicago Cubs which I Believe means tomorrow there's another

today quote give them a little slack this was a very very difficult moment than most people would never understand unquote Doug let's all yours\nRachel because there's there's no people that because people have jobs in LA though they were holding it against them at the Dodgers day they just found out there's a game yesterday I Do like game today a is tickets full price like I have no idea what what's it costs the tickets they may know Ramos you have any idea\nWhy it's awesome stuff for lower ... below average price it so I'm sure there's ways to get in if you have a chance right after the you're done with work I guess the cost lowering as we speak look in the crowd and he goes on well\nI Am I just I Wonder also traffic is it going to fill up it's only one Mike one o'clock game and it's a beautiful day in LA the kind of seems like a great but it ... and on a Monday like do you have to go into work on a Monday\nThe Dodgers provided like on social media like written excuse notes for their fans from work I guess that didn't work out I don't really work I Know Wrigley Field is smaller but Wrigley Field would be sold out no matter what the circumstances in Wrigley Field health fifty six thousand I think it would be it would have been filled today even on short notice\nWell it doesn't hold fifty six thousand so it's important to note they also having been they've been the plastics can say this is the seven kids I was six consecutive year they won that will win the division\nTrue that true that\nI mean I don't know they do for a million people this year right yeah they don't have the brunt of the rams either out there I suppose\nI mean they're they're the bears are but you know the bulls you know I always get stuff to do I I Would I Would I I thought about going today that was like oh it's I mean four o'clock start when I saw one o'clock it was like oh so somehow I did the math reverse of my head was like four o'clock east coast time\nOr four o'clock east coast that 'cause I saw my son is four o'clock I was like oh for class size like no at east coast is like oh I Would totally gone at work\nBut one o'clock middle of the day yeah it's just another thing to do I don't know\nOf course everybody's going to claim to be a Dodger fan as soon as if they get back to the world series ripe ... about this new brand new Dodger hats which they do in Chicago yes Ramos\nWell maybe you should have gone because according to Bob euchre the brewers have won the championship they won the whole thing when I ... to keep playing anymore even say the average of the national league central he did and we won the championship and it just stopped\nYou have a euchre has once he had Mr wasn't Mr belvedere as Mr belvedere once he was on the ... he was on Mr belvedere and he had major league as well\nHe kind of like crossed over and then people just like ah whatever euchre [laughter] he ... he now old and he might be a little bit drunk and so it doesn't really matter I like Harry Carey was but love it and at one time was very good and then he was\nAwful\nAwful\nBut yes he did say we will they won the championship ... what\nDid he win the pennant it just one of the division\nThey won the right to possibly lose in the very next round we made the playoffs officially like I don't even think the team that loses in place in the wild card I don't think they're in the playoffs I don't consider that it's not play that play in not playoffs\nMy crazy\nI Love watching the bears I got I got I mean how good was ... play calling been there [noise]\nYou know it's interesting in watching last year ... ... and in watching him this year how good the play calling his now last year he's a rookie quarterback\nLook you have to take a couple of things into effect you have to remember the first thing you've got to remember is that all of these quarterbacks are putting up crazy numbers\nAll of them seem to be putting up especially ones playing for office of coaches because the rules are dictating such rules are telling you throw the ball more play faster that's what the NBA once that's what major league baseball once that sure as hell with the NFL wants\nA fence a fence often\nIn the perfect example as we think of Mitch ... and how well he's playing 'cause he had six touchdown passes Mitch Trybulski do you know where he ranked right now in charge in total yards\nTake a wild guess Ramos on twentieth ah you're pretty close Seventeen [noise] yeah [noise] pretty user oh pretty good\nRight\nWho is from the most yards and the NFL so far this year Drew Brees no breezes seventh ooh wow seventh yes he touchdowns no interceptions but who's doing for the most yards\nOnce they shot this a music\nThanks John got to turn that on their mobile homes\nAmong homes has not played a fourth game mood I'm sure he does play tonight uh but Mehos would have to throw for\nOver five hundred yards\nReally in order to be number one and it just jump is Patrick Ben\nNo no idea big Ben wow\nBig Bend now Jarrett golf is complete Seventy two percent of its passes and drone for a fourteen hundred and six yards as opposed to big Ben who's known for fourteen fourteen eight touchdowns five interceptions\nQuarterback rating is as high as ... one twenty seven point three\nHere's what you have to ... the reason I didn't believe Lance Armstrong\nThing\nWas because either Lance Armstrong is the greatest athlete in a sport where everybody else cheats or he's just the best cheater of the cheaters that was my time\nAnd so I'm I'm with you if you if you want to tell me that ...\nOr um heck pick a quarterback here I'm bigger Mayfield\nIs they're amazing quarterbacks because the numbers and the touchdowns like okay but through four games for games can quarterbacks have a rating of a hundred or higher ten\n\nTwenty four quarterbacks have a quarterback reading of Ninety or hire twenty four\n\nWhat's happening in the NFL is a lot like what's happened at some of these prestigious schools like at Yale ...\nIf you go back Thirty years ago at Yale only twenty percent of the student body had an a average in their GPA\nNow eighty percent habit you know why because you Gail doesn't want ... doesn't want their graduates be like oh he graduated with a C. average hey everyone said Gail guy with a four point oh\nIt looks better on the resume\nStatistically if you went historically either we have twenty four I'm amazing quarterbacks\nOr every rule is set up for the quarterbacks to look amazing\nWhich do you think it is so that's not to take away from pat in my home he has\nPerformed the best of any of these quarterbacks but an but stopped me if you're getting in love with with Baker who had four turnovers yesterday or any of these younger other young quarterbacks you're in an era where\nIt's increasingly likely for use to succeed statistically better than any previous era\nBut if you simply beat the bad teams you can be about five hundred\nAnd that's where the cowboys feel like they feel like there's some more seven and nine to nine and seven depending upon a maid field goal here or a lucky when they're or a bad laws or a bad deal Gore a bad play\n... the gamble they took\nOn getting rid of the jazz Brian and losing Jason when those are fine they just didn't replace him with good enough players I don't believe you can play through one guy and when the entire city at some point he's going to break down or somebody's going to be able to take them away\n[laughter]\nWhat's their situation here at Chavez Ravine the Colorado Rockies in the top of the third inning have two runners aboard against Walker Mueller two outs so the Rockies first chance to put some runs on the board\n\nAnd the Milwaukee Brewers went in to Chicago and got to win\nSo that means the cubs are going to host the loser of this game in the national league wildcard game are friends that TV side are really really really hoping the Dodgers do not lose this game\nLike you don't want Dodgers and cubs and only one team gets to the playoffs right\nAdditionally a Wednesday you have the A's and the Yankees\nZero people in the ... television land or radio land or actually rooting for the A's\n... is a it's a great story\nGrazed or mom sick cardinals did right by um trading back home aides in the playoffs great story but in the when I say no one cares I don't mean no one cares I mean most everybody with a television set doesn't actually care\nSo baseball's in this you know that I I Believe they created the extra wild card\nGame with two markets to markets in mind New York in Boston they legitimately care by the way the Dodgers get out of the inning so bottom a third and no blood at Dodger Stadium\nIt's my belief they created in with the Yankees and the red Sox hey we got to get the Yankees Red Sox in the playoffs every year and now you have the Yankees and the red Sox in the play offs but you also have the cubs and the Dodgers\nYou don't want the cubs and the Dodgers a face off in the wild card you need the Dodgers to win this game and then to take down 'cause I mean think about what have you have you have only the cubs and said the brewers and the cubs or then the cubs lose in the second round you get like brewers Braves\nOr brewers are Iraqis will that can be bad or Cleveland Oakland oh still so very much originally depend\nA promise you when you're you're again this weekend a boys want girls last say\nMusic we went to a wine tastings bacon I was thinking of you very much because you like one you know more about what I learned a lot about wine but it's a lot of information thrown at me that I don't really know [laughter]\nAnd I tasted bunch stuffing once you get to where you ... you know you said like three or four glasses it all the it tastes like wine it does taste different from each other\nBut tastes tastes like one so you enjoyed yourself I did I did I become a big fan of British Columbia 'em and non British Columbia you know either way\nEither what I did not know what a commonwealth was one of my buddies are explain like no it's a commonwealth it is a sovereign nation but it's also a common\nThe kind of part of the club but they have their own you know they don't have to they need to fight the revolutionary war and the French Canadian morbid right\nWe celebrate weird things in our country

Texans territory yet so it's not like you're going to win the game on one play I felt like it was an unnecessary risk to go forward and overtime and you open the door to losing a game where\nTiny game is not a bad thing as a ... you know if if losing is not really an option really what probably wasn't much of an option to percentage chance\nUm risk versus the war and what was your reaction to what they decided to do in in\n... I was surprised and I heard the comments after a day and we were planning for I\nMy question is what they've gone forward on fourth and eighth and when they vote for the fourth of course on fourteen at what point would they have decided upon me saw him come out with that initial formation which actually like before the time out because they had some options to rub people often in\nMen and men coverage and that's what they were going to see is manmade coverage they take him out they come out with a two by two formation and they weren't routes of sticks so everybody runs up the first ... turned her out yeah\nThat that that's fine if you're re fever is better than their defensive back if you have a match up that you think okay I'm going to get this guy isolated and my guy is going to win but that that\nDidn't seem like the case and it felt like it was more of a gut reaction than it than a a mindset going into that drive and then my other question is did you tell the ... coordinator were poured out their toy cars that can affect that third downplay as well\nSo in in I hurt what you're saying I I I get what he's saying but\nI don't know if that was truly thought out going into that drive this is going to be our approach and I don't know if that played was\nWas the ... got to have it play that you'd want in a critical situation knowing that if you don't get it the odds of you losing the game has increased substantially it's if it didn't fame or make a lot of sense\n... joining us kind of quickly here the I Can't see chief take on the Denver Broncos harder to do what did what did she want to do on the road but the weather's not bad\nAnd I don't know Denver can exploit their defense of weakness is the big question is I guess two fold one can Denver get to ... homes with their past rush more than anything can it illegal to figure out what Kansas City is doing\nWell\nLet's look back to the laughter Kansas City comes out smoking\nThere five at all and I think they lost seven out of the next month so historically they've they've started fast and I started fast last year with Alex Smith and were Patrick is doing is obviously impressive but\nThe league has a way of catching up with you and then somebody's got to find that spot that that soft spot in my home game and then it's whether or not he's going to have a second pitch one side is exposed and the nice thing about watching division games is is that much more familiarity typically\nThat gets exposed within the division as opposed to play outside the division there's less familiar to you so\nCurious to see how they pack homes differently and then once once we see okay here's here's where it is\nHow how well he's able to react to it and they see you see it all the time were guys come out they liked it up early you know back Prescott you know for example or I'm I'm sure there's any number guys are initially believe trying to figure it out they figure it out and then ... what pitched what happened next yep\nYep totally I could not agree with you more haired mangy check them out in the first things first we appreciate you joining us You're on the ...

Thomas and they lost their tight end and we'll just sleep well at any injury and the game on Sunday so not only does it get harder from an opponent perspective but you're going to have to do this without maybe one of your top three or four officers the players and certainly one of your ... defensive players\nIs Pete back next year uh I think\nHe is I think he is a if you would have asked without a month ago I would've said absolutely and now I'm starting to baby kinda heater a little bit I I think he comes back because I think as long as Russia will tear\nIt girls get I think he has a chance to win and look they're going to turn over this fire roster again over the ... and uh they got a bunch of money in free agency really for just the the second or third time and his career is the coach of the hawks they got about Seventy five million bucks to spend and free agency next year ...\nI think he's coming back but if this thing just turns into a complete disaster\nA and they roll out of four and wealth type year and it looks like babe either further away than they thought they weren't going to a few thousand Nineteen there was a chance he's not here but I Would say as of now you have to come", "show_name": "The Doug Gottlieb Show", "year": "2018", "city": "Iowa City", "day": "01"}
