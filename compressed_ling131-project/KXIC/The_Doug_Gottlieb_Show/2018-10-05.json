Newton and look at cam Newton's record like Kim in place for a company or organization\n... played with one of the top defenses in football good news team had been built around offensive line and look Cam Newton this is the media calling out Cam Newton\nIf you think the media is anti Cam Newton the media voted MVP the media voted him Heisman Trophy winner\nThere is no more false narrative in the history of sports in the media doesn't like Cam Newton\nBecause the media voted him for the two most prestigious awards one in college in one in the NFL\nSo you're going to have to you're going to have to try another route they're like oh well they're just against like knowing that we just ... not an accurate passer which is ... not great in the red zone you know how we realize that because two former star wide receivers Steve Smith a borderline hall of famer and Calvin Benjamin\nBoth said the exact same thing about playing with Cam Newton\nYeah ... is is not really that accurate or that good and a red zone and reading progression isn't being accurate and and no one's disputing any of this\nNow was this meeting is you'd Andrew Luck plays with a crummy team\nHe inherited the worst team in the national football league a team that had gotten completely old and that parted ways with parts that well they tried to get be bad after when Peyton Manning was hurt they must just they tried to be bad they were bad they were accomplishing their tasks\nPay yes\nMs ... well they were they weren't taking they were just bad\nOff all\nTheir star players all got old collectively at once from Bob Sanders retired two the two Russians that they parted ways with Andrew and James was gone Peyton Manning was not like all the stars that have been a dominant gene for a decade they were all\nGone and then they add a complete idiot as a general manager and they were poorly coached outside of that outside of that Mrs Lincoln how is the show\nNeat I remind you that Chuck ... called a a fake punt whether they directly snapped it to a wide receiver was playing under center and he was surrounded by five New England patriots because remember when that happened\n\nThere general manager traded for Trent Richardson trade of first round pick the Ford pick in the dry they traded for Trent Richardson when everybody league newly stunk\n\nTheir intentions were to surround him with a better team that Peyton Manning was that's what their owners said hey you know we we had Peyton Manning we only got into a couple of Super Bowls we want now we want to win a couple of at least a couple were they Andrew Luck you only have guys like this every so often and they've done the opposite of that\n\nDo they share a bull and oh yeah by the way not only are they had a talent deficit in comparison to the patriots were on a crazy talented team [noise] [noise]\n[noise] But Frank right wasn't supposed to be their head coach Josh me Daniels was and their best off into the weapon outside of luck with T Y Hilton he didn't play last night\nThey without six starters a team is not any good anyway without six dollars including their best pass catcher\nSo to the Andrew Luck is overrated the actual answer if you ask anybody in the NFL they'll say you know exact she's underrated he's kind of awesome have you thought he wouldn't come back and throw a football why he leaned leading passing yards\nThey're actually competitive with a completely depleted roster\nAnd the media doesn't hate Cam Newton the media voted him MBP and Heisman Trophy winner\nHis own former teammates are the ones that have taken shots that are coming up next John middle costs going to join us he's got the three now podcast it's really good will get snippets of it\nUm he's got strong takes on the raiders what we can expect to see them against the chargers and oh yeah by the way it is this a winner going home for the Pittsburgh Steelers that's upcoming next\nThis is the junk godly show on Fox Sports radio\nOne will be the thing goes off\nAre we allowed to govern from the city\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n... dream on steroids like a little much man just this pump the brakes\nLittle yeah I mean I go I mean do you if you if you if you want to say you you you want I Want to say something about drunk or whatever or ... you didn't have to say just to kick in most of his success and the kid game but when I'm not even a hockey guy but the idea that you learn to gain a week or a month or whatever on the ground zero\nChance yeah um okay so will the league catch up to ...\nI I you know typically read said ... ever since I was alive right young quarterback they always you can actually get exposed but I just think the wolves and dramatically changed what can you really do besides ... in Denver did well if your quarterbacks athletic enough just to get out of the way\nAnd you have a good enough off as a coach\nOr you know coach up these hot breeze and different ... works for a quarterback and the one thing and be probably in my lifetime and watches football is the best that as a green color like he's incredible with calling screamed course quarterback was great and Phillies obviously excellent in Kansas City back and all we\nOf negates a blitz so what are you going to do you know these these receivers don't have to worry about getting lit up over the middle are so hard to press now because they call you for defense of holding all the time the quarterbacks don't really mean to be worried about getting hit\nThat I I think it's harder than ever to just like catch up to these offices\nNow is the kid got to have a bad game ... eventually going to have one of those three picking just human nature but just think that these defenses are going to catch up I I don't know if I see that now here's the other kind of elephant in the room it is\nIf they let's say they get home field advantage in Kansas City in January is not going to be new for\nHave you got to be really cold hard to grow even if you do have a good arm\nSo they're not the other half at forty times in a in a playoff game what they do have a really good running game the problem for me with Kansas City they're often probably not going to be doubtful that they're being census atrocious and it's not like bad bad coaching they just don't have any good players\nAre you you ... you mentioned you live in northern California ... as you want to have some fun or download the three now pod cast one of the herd pod cast network he joins weekly here in the garbage also writes for the athletic given as fun or listen to his his ranch on the raiders you know a ton about\nWhat's going on with the raiders and and the remarks the Cherokee makes about Reggie McKenzie kind of ... not so subtle jabs um\nBut they've actually looked pretty good offensively and defensively they've been proven only spit away a couple of games like the Miami game on the road I thought that was on their car the terrible interception they win last week against the Cleveland Browns now they're playing a virtual home game I got to be Ninety percent raider bans\nAgainst the chargers who are too into the charge would be the bad news to the good teams what happens in LA this weekend\nYou know like you said it might be like Ninety five percent I saw yesterday they someone tweeted out that they were piping in crowd noise to ... you know ... ... yes crazy you know that's that\nWill not only John John you know John you know what what that is that there's there's two things Carson is an epicenter of all raider fan them and there are legit charger fans they don't want to deal with raider fan I'm just like the ...\nMaybe think there's any do you think there's any chance that they actually go back or they know that way for good\nNo I think there are there in LA for good I I don't think I Know there's been zero discussion of them going back that they think there's a new stadium will will cure everything a new stadium's really really big really big and going to be beautiful it obscene I don't know if it will cure everything but I Do not think there's any chance to go back in in the in the near future\nWell you know pretty fabric over one of my favorite player in recent memory their team is really talented like the raiders shouldn't win this game but like you said there often is playing well the chargers are weird they just keep your games I mean the the niners Quidam won that game that they were in that game last week\nBut just on paper the charges were better but say one thing about grooming and he's taken a lot of crap and rightfully so first personnel moves he vanished salt coach ... style plays\nLast week he had a couple of big quite they'd have to be quite all four games that they just haven't yet but the guys that open coaching and the often is not necessarily vent his problem or they were they had leads like you said the Miami game Derek ... they they were up\nI think Eighteen or Seventeen to seven in the Denver game we too on the road in the fourth quarter\nA so I I Would expect them to be in this case I Would say the raiders more of an any team in a week if you just look at their schedule from here on out most teams you can kind of go when law law when whatever schedule went to ...\nYou know you can convince when one game the rest of the season or they get it back together and they like compete for a wild card I mean honestly everything is on the table\nJust because they they have such a big uh just swing in every game that they can have two hives where they look like a playoff team and then they can have drives where they looked like there'll be drafting in the high end of the lottery so I they are an impossible game to pick but I Do know like you said the way fans were going to be there big time\nAnd it's going to be loud and I I Do think the raiders to acquire that they've taken a lot of pride and go in the Los Angeles and like having a second you know basically because they were the only game every year because they have to go to Europe or a when you go because the legal at a movie so\nI I Do think they treat this kind of like an owner\nJohn ... joining us in the dugout lake show ... if I say rams best team in football and the argument\nNo ... there are more complete the Kansas City and even New England now ... I don't feel good about saying the rams are gonna go to the Superbowl Jared got it not play a meeting or game in college\nHe's played a couple of meaningful games before this year in the pros last year down the stretch you know like against the eagle they went up and beat Seattle one of the game and then obviously the playoff game which he did not quite well now he looks like a different guy\nBut like the playoffs we we see it every year there's different pressure just it's not like baseball where you play every day you have seven day period you just get one shot and if you're off\nAnd if they're fourteen or Fifteen when gain a little different because the way you know especially you know in LA like pressure wouldn't be like New York Philly but there wouldn't be a lot of national pressure\nOn this team you know that we to win the playoffs they get home field by and they're playing let's say Cam Newton or ... I guess I I Can't just say that they would be a lot to win that game now they're clearly edited the playoffs and they're gonna probably less of something bad injury to feel by\nBut I don't know I mean I I I'd probably if I got seven point with Drew Brees I'd probably bet on the same you know until I killed ... till ... proof that\nHe's comfortable boy in January game now I think they'd have going on those\nYou know it's not the weather's going to be perfect and there are probably\nMore of like a California team better it's sunny weather it in in the dome a than they would be like playing outside in Philly or something\nIn the cold but I still think you're ... you're it's got to have to win a game it's just the natural evolution of any choir in any major sport until you can feel confident picking them in a in a playoff game\nNo no question about it a couple more quick ones uh feels like Pittsburgh this is incredibly you can't you can't lose another game you're Pittsburgh at home against the falcons how important is this week as they wait for lady on her return\nI I think there are three teams that it's kinda crazy but it's already must win for now it's four in ...\nAnd Minnesota I mean all three of those teams you would have basically written in panic the ending of the seat and that's going to the playoffs and it it would be\nYou know they they'd be one for Minnesota would be one for you won in Pittsburgh would be one three in one like you you just can't you can't start like that and make the playoffs it it's just hard to get and when a Pittsburgh\nYeah they just it's been a weird year with ... include the organization have handled it well beyond in\n... I I Would just guess I don't know what do you want to see what was that they probably imagine that just housing I got to turn down fourteen million he was just going to show up any kind of all their boss didn't show up in it and then obviously with the wind and said just grew off their season\nAtlanta's had so many injuries Minnesota's just\nLost a couple of pie gangs but all three of those teams that and they're good especially Minnesota and Lana you watch like they have clear ... their office is so strong but those two events isn't really let him down and Steelers just you know all around the ... that gets crushed they're they're often spend a lot to\nJohn ... three now pod cast John thanks so much going to check out his stuff the athletic follow him on ... on Facebook and Twitter and or download the podcast and the herd pod cat ... podcast network thinks most young\nThey have a good way\nTo let's get you to Dan buyer and find out major league baseball I got it on here kind of in the background is I'm watching it I'm hearing news in the eyes that must mean that Houston's become more on the board\nAlex fragment of civil home run Josh read it gives edited in RBI single the Astros finally got the Cory Cooper and the Indians throws up to nothing and the top of the fifth inning in game one of their American League divisional series no one has gotten the Astros darker Justin ... just yet through four innings of work for land or has not allowed and the hits\nRockies and brewers coming up and about thirty five minutes or so and they're getting too on Fox Sports wanna brewers are up one oh one the best the five series game one between the Yankees Red Sox is tonight in Boston at seven thirty eastern deemed to between the Braves and Dodgers on Fox Sports one\nYeah it does is it was I\nWho ever and I use the term flinch but whoever was going to flinch first and they got a huge advantage and now I mean Berliners got Seventy five pitches through five innings um maybe maybe they can they can get them off the seventh grade and the unions have a chance for the right now like Houston's momentum for short a dug\nAnd psychic what roads and gets the first one of the divisional series and all of baseball royalty\nSo far the two home to use one last night we got a home team up right now what road team gets when first [noise]\n\nI'm going to say it's um [noise]\nI'm gonna say it's the Atlanta Braves\nLana brands gets Clinton ... by the way Julie was not hers was not good news last start no [noise] no but George bring her just get a solo home run for the Astros\nThree nothing Houston out on top of the the into the bottom of the fifth inning moving to the NFL psychic the jets and Broncos go head to head the Sunday so which coach head coach will be with their team longer Todd Bowles the jets or the Broncos Vance Joseph [noise]\nWell that's a good question\nUm I think Todd Bowles\nEnds up [noise] remaining as head coach longer than Vance Joseph and Joseph hung on by the skin of his ... being the first coach to surrender type game last\nLeading by double digits in the fourth quarter at home in sixty six games ... second times they've done it [noise] that's not good and remember they started out winning three of the playing three of the first board home they finish up with a bunch of road games I think ... gonna make a coaching change more quickly than the jets will\nPsychic is this week the Arizona Cardinals finally get a when the last one this team in the league there at San Francisco this weekend [noise]\nAh no no\nI was staying Wendell is is Arizona San Francisco and bad\nLast week in in LA against against the charge that their injuries continue to pile up but uh no I Do I Do not\nBelieve you bastard as a serviceable backup quarterback he's actually ... I think what you would expect in a backup quarterback yeah yeah a psychic she said another home run\nThe or else who may I Am\nNot I know where I'd looked away empty I looked at when I looked away for a second to get it and yes it is\nOh back to back jak Houston\nFor nothing as heroes in the fifth inning psychic ... Davis be a Boston Celtic by twenty Twenty one and of course there was a report that ... has been talking to Davis about becoming a Celtic plan for the Davis be assaulted by twenty Twenty one\nI Do not believe so [noise] um [noise] ... they have kept problems they got young guys are going to have to be ... new contracts\nI Do not think that they have a whore for is not as good as Anthony Davis\nThe also doesn't make as much money as Anthony Davis and they'd have to part ways without Hartford who I think is the guy that he's kind of a fundamental blueprint sort of a part of the architecture of that team is to have a no ego true professional would they like that isn't isn't alone to [noise] I just don't see it happen\nPsychic who wins Saturday to leave or Conor McGregor blue or can be like to go to the ground right he's a Rappler against God am I getting again I'm going to go with ... can be just seems\nLike a bad dude man which Conor McGregor he's he is much more about the brand than he is about the fighting and we both can be [noise]\nAnd in our final minutes that we've got is John Ramos just you know two minutes into my ear and say how many points will Kevin Durant scoring so nice return to Seattle so there's exhibition moves Kevin ... Iran and the warriors taking out the kinks tonight as dreamt plays in the city that used to play in a\nGrocery could get like forty shots tonight [noise] really\nGet that when you ... just joking but you know it's only thirty five our number here you go [noise]\nGained sky rocketing now got lame she [noise]\nDoug ... show you're on Fox Sports radio\nThe biggest game and the NFL this weekend does not involve two teams in first place it's because the two teams that well maybe could or should be in first place\nBut they're fighting just to survive we'll talk about next in the dugout show on Fox Sports radio\n[noise]\nHey they're diehard years in football ... you might not even know\nThe first football game was played in Eighteen sixteen on an average gained the ball is typically him play for only eleven minutes and finally pizza consumption rates go up during the week of the big game okay you probably knew that last one well here's another fact you might not know that it's actually really useful especially if you're playing on tailgating true car also helps people get you\nScars that's right true guard isn't just for buying new cars with their certify dealer network and nationwide image where nearly one million used cars you'll enjoy real price you know an actual women tore into simpler buying experience would you buy new or used\nAnd which ... users can see what others paid so they know if they're getting a good deal before buying they're also more likely enjoy faster buying experienced by connecting the troops are certified dealers they're over Fifteen thousand true car certify dealers nationwide\nWhen you're ready to buy a new or used car check out your guard enjoy more confident car buying experience\nSome teachers that are available in all states\n[laughter] Fox Sports trendy and\nBecomes tiresome tedious and you can't just go to work and play basketball ... it's hard enough to win has it is\nIt's even ... it's it's made more difficult when you have to answer questions and I think what Brian is even\nLearn from that like man I gotta sign learned some contract I guess that fool around with the Lakers don't fool around with the Lakers because people just don't love that is you don't love the every year free agency thing every year discussion\nAnd so Kyrie Irving coming off his knee being cleaned up and for people who don't know I remember when he broke his knee cap this is like four years ago and the NBA Finals in game one I date already lost Kevin Love in a game against the Celtics\nThey're playing against their playing against the warriors in the finals it goes over time and his knee cap breaks remember that\nWell part of the surgery to fix the kneecap was he had three screws put it into his knee and then it was kind of held together by this mesh wiring\nAnd at first last year the mesh wiring was irritating his skin and it just felt like it was a nuisance of pain they took the mesh wiring out\nWell and there was there was still something wrong with the knee they found out that one of the screws maybe to the screws were infected they had to get them out immediately because if it becomes into bone becomes infected naked your knee cap can break apart become brittle and now you're never play again\nSo it was more precautionary clean out move and you combine that with Gordon Hayward being out they went to the NBA NBA west eastern conference finals game seven without him without their two best players\nSo I told you guys this summer\nNow I've heard is he's super happy there loves the professionalism loves the guys show up to ... they have practice or they weren't practicing in in Cleveland last year didn't practice that much in previous years there is no turnstile it head coach there is no players making the decision is ... ed coach there was just young town guys get after and he's got to the alpha with the basketball\nNow doesn't mean that it's officially official this is more like Facebook official\nBut committing and saying like hey\nI I told everybody I'm coming back if you'll have me that's as close to it as you get and that's Kyrie Irving saying we're not going to talk about that this year\nI've learned from what it's like to play on teams where people don't know what they're stars are going to do in the off season and that's just tiresome tedious and I I don't have the energy to go rebuild this idea that you have to get to New York\nThat carry wants to get to New York and have his own team why when I'm In Boston better franchise better GM you know more proven coach even though everybody loves Dave is Dale\nI don't need to move like guys come to me\nThings for his mark dug out live show Fox Sports radio\nLongtime NFL insider John Clayton joins the show we'll desert Brian play in the

you know the one would be interesting uh we're following today now it's not going to happen this week is that the Packers are down\nPotentially three wide receivers el Randall cobs already out to other receivers have to wait to them or to see if they're going to be able to play their top three receivers are all banged up if they have to carry those injuries over for a week or two maybe that could be a team that would consider it but again maybe not\nYeah and it does not does not seem like that will happen or ... you think he plays and now he's going to try and give it a go Minnesota once again uh just crushed by injuries take on the eagles who have been a little bit disappointed so far this year and what are you hearing about ...\nYeah I mean he is questionable game time decision but I I think you'll be active but how good he is going to be able to play because it ... and even this is David from the middle of the pre season that burst hasn't been there yet I mean it just seems that you know he still\nHasn't got the ability to really exploded yet and so my guess would be you know you you bring him and have him do seven or eight carries just to try to get him going to get him positive but uh you know it's still question mark you know he's been limited in practice in right now questionable on the injury report\nGreat stuff that John Clayton go to John Clinton football dot

it\n[noise] taking away any of the like like favorite teams are Red River rivalry really yeah I mean I Love that game yeah twice yeah it's really good yeah ...\nYeah and it's on it's on Fox tomorrow um [noise] the red river rivalry for people who don't know obviously O. U. Texas that's all always always always the first weekend in October weather's great it\nIt occurs with a cotton bowl and the cotton bowl is\nUm situated inside the state fair of Texas so you got kind of state they are going on outside\nAnd then you have um [noise] and then you have the\nThe football game which is you know Austin is couple but both are a couple of hours ... hour drive away and big alumni bases although a little bit bigger protections takes a little bit bigger school and it's played there you know first ah for Saturday in in October that's interesting though because you\nKnow one of the I'm In a fight no one I guess what the other big game would be LSU would LSU Florida the other is the second biggest came yeah yeah prominently yes every weekend for college football\nNo but sometimes that those weekends give us the most surprising ones like I said that's a ... and then all of a sudden ODU takes down Virginia Tech Ave Syracuse has this close to ... a big one in Blacksburg\nYeah there's a big one there's just something I actually I covered it as a member of the media about twelve years ago dug it loved it so much I Would probably there I went back as a fan so yeah really it was\nA it's a stadium is is cut like right now in the middle you know you got to orange on one side and crimson on the other I mean right down the middle ah it's pretty cool it's at\nEarly ... as well so it's not you know you get you got the eleven o'clock start 'til the sun is shining bright it's yeah great atmosphere the rest of the day you could just go to the fair\nYeah you go to therapy in kind of come down from a high if you won or if you or continued you know drinking or you had your unit wallow in your ... and you had on home it is a really interesting event okay that means no NFL games\nThat means no in Jacksonville Kansas City [laughter] there's only one or Texas at the ... the only way I also have Red Sox Yankees I you can't watch any of those games yeah I'd I'd go to college football game I oh good good for your damn buyer given his speaking of Jacksonville in Kansas City\nUm Jacksonville deepens number one and points regain number one yard for game number one in passing yards per game\nI mean this is you know to anyone who says our the illegal figuring out find out now they are at home so that helps yeah\nI don't think I think it's in arguably the best atmosphere in the NFL\nLike Kansas City in football is like Oklahoma City in basketball\nStick with me for a second Oklahoma City so\nPlaying basketball in Oklahoma State and by the way I first started radio working for the sports gambling Oklahoma City and you know my first chance to I'd never been to an OU Texas game I've been to several now what this is like their big blowout weekend this has everybody heads down I thirty five and goes down the down\nBut the state was always divided between basically Oklahoma football fans and Oklahoma State basketball fan it didn't mean that there weren't Oklahoma State football fans but they just weren't as you know\nThey had you know fifty years of a lack of consistent success in Oklahoma basketball has been successful but it's still just kind of a football school the one uniting thing in the state was\nOklahoma City thunder and those fans they don't know that you're ... like they still haven't really adjusted to a little bit less are not as loud as it used to be\nBut they still don't really know that hey Laker games people show up late it's still expensive and if you're gonna you're gonna get something out of your money when you're in Oklahoma City you show up early in the yellow lab because well that's what basketball venture supposed to do the same thing in Kansas City in football\nThat we have great Kansas and frankly Missouri basketball fans\n\n\n\n\nAnd you're like OK was is Virginia Tech any any good because they their their signature when of the season was we've when they did beat Duke on the road last week I was a bit of a town on the other hand they lost Old Dominion\nSo we have no idea how good Virginia Tech is\nNotre Dame I think is better than they were when they played against Michigan because they've changed quarterback Winbush Brenda when Bush is a good run or a bad throwers only touchdown pass the year was that miracle kept throwing catches ... actually was just a great catch 'em in the end zone against Michigan into\nA into a covered wide receiver in book seems to open things up but when we we do this all the time in college and sports where we just start talking up wins where they play Pittsburg\nAt home and that will be a win and they go to play navy in San Diego and that'll be a win and they played northwestern in Chicago and that will be a win and they play Florida State and Syracuse and at USC like look\nIf you know anything about college football like what's already happened this year Syracuse did beat Florida State almost be Clemson old the Old Dominion did in fact be Virginia Tech how you look around the house with the exception of\nUh Georgia ... George survive somebody a lesbian couple of weeks a couple of weeks ago I mean like schemes there's always going to be a close game or to Michigan and I think he's really good and come back from fourteen nothing down to beat that same northwestern team\nSo if if they are twelve and they can play ... of course they are [laughter]\nLike that's not groundbreaking stuff no offense to clay like you know is this is my groundbreaking stuff they're they're undefeated they'll play for national championship not just because they're Notre Dame and because they played some big name teams and they dominated Stanford and they beat Michigan at home\nBut also because everybody else is going to lose the game or to outside of maybe Alabama Alabama might lose\nOne might lose ... I'm\nAll right also earlier today skip Bayliss said this is Shannon sharp about\nJak Prescott playing against Texans\nI Believe that my cowboys we'll wind is football game because I Believe\nMy guy ... press got and I love me some to Sean too but I Love me some back a little bit more jak Prescott will have his best game of the year against this defense on the Sunday night stage one thing about my God Jack Prescott that you you will not\nAcknowledge what an honor\nHe rises and Sean big moment big stage big challenge what happened ... called them out but the ball and ... fans remember that was a big Sunday night game against our one way okay I I got it but that was really good in that game and what was his line that we challenge except it what does he done three times\nThe he's faced the ... you said the best quarterback and pro football erasures what's happened in those three games they look like ...\nTo to else but he played three of the best games up his career and he out played Aaron Rodgers each time he made them yes he did so the average to be our for these three games eighty four deck sixty two for Aaron Rodgers\nYeah eating out playing Rogers and playoff game that was an Aaron Rodgers when Jack was terrible and Roger\nGamely ... let them back in the narrow judgment when the greatest throws in the history of the playoffs roll into his left right and they want to gain weight vehicle that that so that when I actually didn't happen but I'm not going to like going to go back historically through what dad Prescott hasn't hasn't done and his level of ... because if he was super clutching super\nAwesome [noise] you know a one day have made the playoffs last year when they lost to seek you know they get spanked by Atlanta\nSpank spanked by Philadelphia and spank by the rams they played three good teams in a row and they lost the three good teams and row last year they lost at home to the Seattle Seahawks\nAnd uh that that essentially ended their season so\nI you know look I I think that's fine I don't think he's great\nI don't think he's surrounded by Supreme town is ...\nI don't know why he's his guy and whatever I Know he likes the Dallas Cowboys\nBut I don't think of jak Prescott as an elite quarterback or a top ten quarterback and I think the Sean Watson who had been struggling coming in up arguably his best game of his career or at least this year has come back here we've got to try and figure out was was that simply Sean Watson against future coal defense or is it a shot Watson back\nBut but this idea that deck Prescott is going to somehow when a ...\nLike dude he's got three three hundred yard games in his entire career we're three years into this thing\nLike that three hundred yard is not the ... is not the that's like the Mendoza Line in the NFL and if you don't turn over three hundred yards you'd better when the game and his numbers are about five hundred so he's not winning a ton either\nThat's what the Fox at\n[noise]\nSay yeah I'm I'm I've never I've never\nBeen a huge huge\nOn a on deck but I I Love his leadership I think he saw it I think he's fine surround him with really good players it's pretty good\nPretty good is it going to win you a game no he's not shown that ability is not shown that ability to elevate everybody else it's a lot like hey in the NBA that's what it's like is well\nThe the the true superstars elevate everyone around\nHarder in baseball right maybe a pitcher one\nHit or like it's hard to elevate guys but in basketball and football football quarterback you elevate everybody around you and basketball\nThe true superstars make everybody else around them better\nAnd that's you know that would step does opposites LeBron does I think that's what he does um I think I don't think that's what Carmelo ever did during his prime I'm not sure James Harden does it\nI think he does but I don't know that he does\nChris Paul absolutely does so\nI don't know going to be interesting to see what happens with the Dallas Cowboys as they still appear to be at a talent deficit\nI liked learning things is that famous Tiger Woods commercial where he he talked about his dad and what would your dad would say well what did you learn from something you know and my dad would say that after every game I watch Thursday Night Football last night\nAnd I think I knew but now I absolutely knew I we all learn something from watching football last night tell you what it is next to Doug ...\n[noise]\nHey they're diehard years in football facts that you might not even know\nThe first football game was played in Eighteen sixteen on\nAn average gained the ball is typically play\nFor only eleven minutes and finally pizza consumption rates go up during the week of the big game okay you

I think often times the Packers you've always been a young relied on younger players route experience I think they need to get their core they rotate too many players I think Aaron jokes the best one back on their team ready to oil and I think time our government give 'em to actually quite where they can move around a little bit\nBut I think they have to be more diversified to get the ... a little bit more of a chance you know when you have Rogers would affect a quarterback you kind of cheap system a little bit because\nHe's so good at making plays with his feet and now that he's got the cat quite do it it's going to be a tough game in Detroit the last time they ally and it was on the helm areas on Thursday night alliance playing really well and I think this will be a tough game for the
