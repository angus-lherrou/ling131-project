I think my biggest thing Doug this time of year don't ask your players to\nDo something that they have had to go in the rest of the senior and I was leaving\nJoe mad as walking game seven turned out the way it did two years ago because otherwise we would still be talking about why did they bring Jon Lester in in the middle of it in and it didn't make any sense then doesn't make any sense now even the one yes but it still doesn't make any sense\nNo I didn't know\nThat we talk about it I think that probably for boon game three of the weather is going to stick with them during the course the wintertime\nYes and and look the one thing you point out of ... who everyone likes and I think it's tremendous regular season manager\nBut they won the world series in spite of not because of mad and like you I mean he and he had a deep bullpen and he chose to just not use instead he votes than a couple who just burn through a couple of guys hum let's not get caught up in the cubs don't want to get to them in a second job I'm Rosie ... and the ... show\nI guess my my my reasoning behind asking about him and I think the numbers guys were telling him that's why they wanted to try and flip the older before uh before they made the move\n... is it feels a little bit like the Houston Rockets losing after missing you know twenty seven threes whatever in a row like\nI I like analytics I think it really works for a hundred and six two games then I think it's a useful tool but anyone can see anyone could see Serena stuff was flat it's like it's like cc last night like\nShe she's not a swing in this guy anymore right but he wasn't locating last night and once they got to tell those right handed hitters they were going to smash him at some point you got to ... you know you got to go get him earlier I I felt like last night was was a ... a pop to the chin of analytics or this series was a pop to the gym analytics because the Yankees\nRed Sox uses well but that's their kind of default am I crazy by all over\nOverestimating there used to ...\n... that's a very good point and I think that you look at the way they gave a games with management and and I believe that really all teams on on some level are doing it\nBut I go back and we think of all what is actually worked in this realm of of of analytics and match ups in the last couple of years go back to the world series last year and everything else yes but the Astros\nAnd and I think the analysts would have said you should not close out the game with a starter necessarily as it lands but colors and game seven of the ... the Shirley morning in game seven of the world series\nFacing a lineup multiple times as they did but it worked and and I think that's where I think age eight inch\nSome will say okay well he's analytical because he went to Stanford well he's a very smart guy with just everybody also was a very traditional baseball person as well and I think he blends things very nicely I think that's where\nYou have to find the right blend in and understanding that in some moments you know there may have said they may have been set for a long time they'll get camera was the great match up last night he ended up getting out of it but\nClearly you saw how from the very first batter the ending he couldn't locate the ball\nAnd so we can have all the numbers on the spreadsheet are great but and I and I've never done this and the major leagues clearly and and and all I ever do it but it's different getting on the field and so the numbers may say one thing but\nBut the the manager may be able to look at the picture see I was warming up see I was acting in the club for the game between that the guy really is ready or if he's not and I think that the I think the Yankees Red Sox have both views analytics\nI think the red socks though they use it more effectively in the series and then if you saw it as well with the decision ... made to not have brought cold start game for you know he had been hit the cycle and came three first ever playoff history amazing story but guess what left it on the mound and the next game where to start kittens are second what kids are too\nBig R B Ireland the game goes back to what we talked about the second Doug don't ask your guys to do stuff they haven't done during the course of the year and you got a better chance to have success Alex Cora probably how does that monitor a bit better than Aaron Boone did in the series\n... are you going to go I going to ask you one more though um friday night on Fox I I'm a we have a ... why is he started game one and he wasn't starting gain one in the DSM ... I mean was he is I mean that the whole thing seems weird to me\nIt is a little interesting I'll grant you that I I think this that that the way that the the rest works out they wanted to make sure that Clinton got the extra rest prior to game to prior to his first started the playoffs\nAnd and having a ... game one achieved that\nUh they believe that there was a substantial benefit to keeping Clayton on that\nSo five days of rest to make sure that he was able to to make that started he did he push it very well I think it's now about keeping him on that routine with a little bit of extra rest\nWhich is exactly how the Dodgers analysts they probably also don't want them to get too much rest and so that you alleviate that issue by having them start first and then put in Rio behind him I think the Dodgers right now I Would say dug or are in a better overall pitching situation now they were a year\nUh the brewers we're seeing this this team is really trying to flip the script with all this youth\nAnd they've got to go back to what it in game one of the division series they start brand the rough and back him up with Corbin burns you use it all worked out that they they are the team probably right now dog if you want to look at it if you're running for a team of totally up and the way that we think about pitching going to have success in the playoffs\nYou a fan of the Milwaukee Brewers because they are basically doing it ... one time traditional starter in Julie's chest scene and then just opening with three or four segments for the rest of the group it's fascinating and they add the ethic team integrate both and so she'll be a great and the other degree else yes as well\nBut I used to do when I played RBI baseball back in the day John ... an amazing job or a Fox baseball coverage Jamie thanks for joining us\nThat might look at the ... thanks so much my\nPleasure is absolutely absolutely mind dug out like show here on Fox Sports radio jump Palmer owes he's brought you buy discover card we treat you like you'd treat you let's get you to Dan\nBuyer [noise] find out what else is going on in the world of sports they only got what a pleasant conversation you had with the John ... they're the exact opposite happening today at Minnesota timber wolves practice Jimmy Butler was there yes demanding a trade but practicing with the team\nI've heard of [noise] going to join us in a couple of minutes then you'll hunter of course are LSU product grew up in Katy, Texas\nI signed a big extension over the off season even though he was coming into a contract you're he did not do with some of his defensive end brethren have done any remains with the Vikings will catch up with the Geneva hunter in a moment guys what do you think you want to play a game in the meantime we have time to play a game of this is yeah let's let's let's do that [noise]\n[noise] game to\nTime on the job godly show a want all of you to know very important News I'm kind of a big\nThing around here I'm going to Miami\nTaken on the bears yeah hard rock um stadium I'm going to be there on the sideline Doody show our fault football to her is going to take us to Miami Beach body by Granger\nFor safety in industrial supplies strangers got your back visit Granger dot com hunters going to join us at a one a clock\nOn the west coast for a clock on the\nEast coast practice was running late into interesting 'cause I just read a story which I'm Mike Zimmer is head coach said I'm One of the reasons you search the excess Lewis his constant need to put an extra work everyday practice probably why he's missed his window for a radio interview [noise] any wire\nStem by what he got the games today Doug is real news they knew it\nWas real news or fake news Mr hunter is late because Jimmy Butler ran over to their practice and yelled at them is that real news or fake news [noise]\n[laughter] that's that's fake news you can do by the way that you're going to be on TV number\nTwo Sunday I Seahawks played early against the raiders they'll get t._v. number one but bears dolphins locked in on TV number have you on\nSome hey hey I have I I think I've made it you make it to Dan buyers TV Now [laughter] you might have buyers TV number two and you know forget forget about Hollywood walk of fame or get an Emmy or a Marconi\nNow you know you've kind of me I ...

weeks which you don't see that often with right now is they have Michelle with twenty five Russia's two weeks ago and was show with Eighteen Russia this past week now knowing go check you could have six Russia's this week but that's not the point the\nPoint is they seem to be committed to a run game\nAnd Michelle is that kind of run or because he's a roadmap point of attack runner so he can get sustaining type runs\nAnd I think there is no better quarterback and football and Brady in completing secured passes so if it's second and for ... and a great position you know it's funny I I take one Berkeley just jumped into my head when we talk about Michelle Barclay last week had to Russia's for fifty yards\nGreat runs a thirty honor and a twenty or you know how many yards the other his other Thirteen Russia's gained minus two you can't it's\nVery hard to play off and it's like that you know you need your back if you're going to give the ball to her back always have positive yard but yet those two yard runs means something dog you know that\nYeah you know a ... cell joining us on the dog got live show here on Fox Sports radio what about the Kansas City chiefs obviously defensively they've shown they can play the past couple of weeks but ... it hasn't been as spectacular ... homes what people started to figure out\nWell I don't know if it's what they figure it out I think two weeks ago Denver did a really nice job in the first half was some concepts where they matched a lot of the shorter out and they blurred the looks in the secondary and teams will start doing these things just to give them a whole different looks he's still young quarterback who's learning how to play we know what the talent level is\nI'm so he'll go through some ups and downs he's not going to throw five touchdowns every week\nThe patriots will do quite a bit of that uh\nThe patriots were way man I they do play man and and then you get to match up that ideally the the case will look at those match ups and feel good about but then you still have to convert but I think that they'll they'll do a good job wouldn't match concepts in in ... zone looks a because what you want to do is you want to take away clarity from home\nYou don't want him dropping back and feeling hey there's might throw or you want to beat him and make him think there's my throat but it's not really there\nSo that's what teams will start to do it it it's all about lowering the looks for a quarter of a young quarterback\nGreg ... who gives us clarity as we get blurred looks we watch our TV said great great

wolves starters at practice today so I don't know if it was a good practice or a bad practice for Julie butler if you want to summarize it that way but a lot of stories coming out of ... practice today\nIt's a crazy I Joe Joe is practice yeah right\nI joked on Twitter I said hey some rules versus timber wolves was the most of the game of the season ... school wouldn't have wanted to see Jimmy Butler going crazy\nI'm joined crazy in the NFL was Mike Tomlin he's now find twenty five thousand dollars as the Steelers head coach was fine for criticizing the officials following their win against the falcons in week five calling the officiating a joke when it came to a rough in the past recall on Steelers defender DJ watt\nBills that go Sean McDermott dismiss trade rumors surrounding running

the charges he's not ready yet but I Do think that'll that'll change some things when he gets ready that's me and she gained the chargers who\nAt three in to beat up on bad teams uh we'll see if the browns or a bad team or a good team the Jimmy ... the thing is fascinating I'll say this that before we overreacted Jimmy Butler and a third team beating the first team as it's been reported\nUm this does happen in basketball a lot and so\nWhat happens often times after a loss is a starter or a bad game you get technical foul your moved to the\nThe second team I could change your jerseys and when you say second team that's often not guy six seven eight nine ten that's often guys nine through Fifteen to the rest of the rest of the third team if you will\nThat's because the starters also have kind of subs the rotation is the first team to depends on teams\n... my first year at Notre Dame the ... the first team was blue and the second team was like we had old gold was the other side of the uniforms\nAnd so I I'll never forget that uh we used to I made up a song because my freshman year we had like for freshmen and we're all on the gold team almost the entire pre season\nWe and we set the tune to on the road again only was on the goals again life I Love his playing defense with my friends I Can't wait to get on the gold again you're always on defense but\nWhat happens in regular season play at least in college and high school some they the coach in order to motivate you and really the tick you off put ya and make a point put you on second team you turn your Jersey over and even as those guys hadn't been playing like they're not playing games\nAnd that much in in practice just playing defense and they they do win scrimmage is more than you'd think but the idea that you would if you're Jimmy ... the thought that he's doing himself some good and it's a little bit different in the NBA\nBut the thought that you're doing to sell some good Bye bye handling your business this way\nIt might have been light hearted trash talk we don't know how it gets really but I don't feel like you would get out like this unless it was less than light hounded lesson light hearted trash talk\nI just really do but I just I don't think you are going to send your ... your you're going to be sent to a stable organization like spurs on any of this\nI don't mean the Lakers doing this the clippers maybe maybe\nI just I I don't really get the philosophy you're going to be traded it's\nGoing to happen you can be displeased you could even talk a little bit of trash but going Sherman and burning everything to the ground\nThings are flying so it wasn't just you know normal flying it had like the pillow between his body and they are and you can tell like this arm is totally locked you can't move it you can't do really anything because he basically gotten his shoulder reconstructed\nWell guess what used to do he used to get there before any of us would get there in the summertime and this guy's arm was shredded after surgery and he would get on the treadmill\nSet it to about two miles an hour and do it dropped back on the treadmill for a walk for miles basically just that like cross over as if he was dropping back in his wing I'll always remember that I just thought to myself you know ... there's something about this guy and this was before he blew up and obviously they would go to the playoffs that year and then a couple of years later they want a Super Bowl\nIf you missed anything from the dung godly show you can always find gas going up box sports

Fox Sports radio or Fox Sports TV we call enough\n[laughter] hey\nI'm earlier today a we heard this on Fox Sports television\nNo one's ever lost their job over hold out now you got your hall of fame quarterback\nThey don't want a couple of Super Bowl he's saying that my plans I might ... not Mike Tomlin\nNot the general manager of all these guys said something on it would really make sense but this is why quarterback and he's saying he getting ready to cut my time [laughter] like who gave him the award winning go to the principal's office\nAnd advocate for the other guy 'cause there is because of the play the game ain't going to be sixty five minutes so you can bank and try to spend it has no no no I'm just promoting James Connor was only the only place we were on there's only so many touches for running back and so he is saying I Am going to advocate for someone other than you\nLook I I don't think that Ben Roethlisberger is kind of a different sort of cat right he's not one of these guys that's that's the loved at times even in his own locker room that was Chris Carter and Nick ride talking about Ben Roethlisberger advocating for James Connor overlay beyond bell I'm\n... and so like look ban is that is one of these guys that says kind of weird stuff and I think he's a little bit late to the party\nBut being linked to the party at least he was invited to the party and by the that I mean he's reacting to the office of line he's reacting to the stability of Connor and I think he's also telling us what the general sense is\nYou know Ben almost feels like a guy who waits to find out who everybody else is voting for and then he in fact\n... said that's who I voted for like he didn't want to vote for somebody just because that's what he believes in he wants to vote for somebody because he wants to vote for the guy who wore a woman who won I that I feel like that's his mentality\nBut he's also telling you were telling us as the public what's going to happen I I've just I've never seen any of this I've been doing this for sixteen years now and this and I've\nWatched and studied football and basketball and I've never seen a team when you have\nA contract dispute between player in team players are always always always behind the scenes sometimes a little bit different but you know in front of the cameras and microphones they're always at least neutral most of the times supportive of\nPlayers and that hasn't been the case here and I think this is kind of\nBeen going oh my all my office of lime and moved on from ... I'm going to move on as well and look there's some of this is self preservation some of this is it makes him look better\nAnd that that ... not just with his office of Lyman but the thought that Ben Ross would need lady on but I don't need anybody else I'm Ben Roethlisberger what a volatile mix in Antonio Brown ... or ... we heard the story yesterday's facing a lawsuit for going crazy because he had some stuff stolen the off season\nHe had that with Antonio Brown\nI'm the defense hasn't been good much of the year you get the lady on bell thing yeah Ben Roethlisberger and some of his comments ruined the year and now these comments about James Caan or what a weird weird situation for the Steelers who are coming off of a huge win\n\nI think look I don't think Ben Roethlisberger is nearly as good as the reputation of tell you and some of this takes us away from actually watching how he plays football he had as bad interception as anybody who had all year\nBut they came up for when and we're still talking about lady on bell and that's where big Ben even though he feels like hey I'm getting in on a conversation that everybody in the locker who's going to agree with me and I'll be kind of one of the guys that the timing seemed really odd really off\n[noise]\nSay Doug ... show you're on Fox Sports ready to this story ... go ahead or right\nIf there's something with the Steelers and the giants that's a very similar where they have those really accomplished veteran quarterbacks that are clearly not nearly as good as they once were and it's sort of these big flashy position players are kind of trying to like\nTake back or not take back but take over as like hey we're the guys who kind of running around here and we help you and that quarterback still kind of holding on as the leader of the team being the quarterback saying like a not so fast year\nYeah and it's interesting on how they're handling in different ways ride he lie he lied doesn't even who doesn't even engage I don't know if you saw the do you guys see the quote from Eli yesterday when he was asked about the OB Jay interview\nHe's like yeah I don't really listen to the amount amount on listen a little lame I'd like it was a it was a perfect kind of peak Eli I hear all this stuff I'm not going to engage don't you know don't worry about me\nWas fantastic so I I think that he lies is smart in that way um whereas this Big Bend is Big Bend wants to insert himself into this conversation but do I think this is a a massive kind of ... contest so you're you're kind of getting onto I Would say yeah\nI think that's exactly what this is\nExactly what it is it's this\nIs my football team and the question if it's my football team just no out through my support behind James Caan and you'll never get\nThe football I kinda liked that sort of big dog we kind of like a little bit more now you paint painted in that in that sense\nLast night was who's the laws for the Yankees was a big loss for

from twenty down in one possession in basketball you can only come from eight down in football and baseball if you go to the bottom of the ninth inning and you're down a hundred runs\nYou can still scored a hundred runs there is no limit with the exception of three outs\nSo while it was four to one heading into the bottom the ninth and you're like man the Yankees had one run the day before they hit and that like to sixteen is a team no chance then you look up and you're like well they do have\nStanding and judge and they do have Sanchez anger glorious and oh yeah by the way\nUh you

okay to be biased [laughter] unless you're hanging [laughter] yeah I I I Do think baseball because like you said there's no limit this age you can score you down ten nothing ... eleven runs in in one inning and there's no time limit to that it's just like\nWell yeah you're just you're watching somebody come apart we why we're watching somebody and and that\nYou know guys had throw breaking blossoming kimbrell couldn't trust eat he did throw like one curve ball for a strike but he basically just like I'm going fast balls I'm On the heater and we've seen this from so many pictures you get down late and you're trying to close that I've been trying to close that in Yankee Stadium and then it's Yankees Red Sox and then you've got the names of the play was amazing night\nBut I thought it was a loss for the Yankees and their use of analytics now Aaron Boone is going to take the heat in New York radio is going to take the heat from some baseball fans because two nights in a row really he left to start or into law\nAnd while those decisions can be chalked up to have an experienced any had too much faith in his guys everyone got that job among other things because he sold them on his hard core belief in analytics and that's what Brian cash when the Yankees believe in\nBut what we saw in game three what we saw and at times in game for what we've seen in with\nThe Houston Rockets is one of the same numbers are great they they're interesting they help you\nThey help you in so many what we saw this from Joe mad and with the cubs\nComes to playing one game playing game he's got college whoever and Jason Hayward and you could sit there and go out in this situation ... yeah but ... is a better hitter and they both left handed ... go by field goal by your what is your guts say\nYou've been doing this job for Twenty years Aaron Boone you've been around baseball since you were a\nFetus do what you feel instead you go by the book\nYou go by the book and you go by the numbers numbers don't take into account how a player looks on that particular night guys can look like ask any hitter\nI'm not seeing the ball tonight that doesn't have anything to do with what the analytic say I'm I've lost my rhythm I've lost my timing well he's got good numbers against this picture or this picture as good numbers against these hitters idol last night was a loss\nNot just for the Yankees\nBut also for analytics it's not that the red Sox aren't using them a Red Sox use analytics better\nUsing Christian Bale out of the bullpen analytical you did that make sense maybe\nBut the red Sox and Joey Cora joy core as as operated more by his guts than he has by the book is that I think I keep saying Joey Cora Alex Cora I Apologize Joey and Alex Alex Cora has operated more\nBy is God\nWhere's the Yankees are committed to doing this and and I look in fairness to like the Oakland A's they were built their teams on money ball and the use of analytics it I Know the people you never want a World Series they wouldn't get as close as they've got and without the use of it and the truth is that you need pitching\nYou need pitching if you're the Yankees you need pitching if you are the days you know you have this idea of being able to start guys that are the openers and not the starters I Do think there's something to having one guy you have confidence in who you believe can get through a bad inning and rest your bullpen\n\nThat opener thing again another usa ... which we'll see if it works for the brewers over the ... over the or the ... yes\nBut I thought the L wasn't

I should say no one but the defensive line doesn't get as much credit for how great the dominant they were and if you just look in the results\nWhether it be when he and Michael Bennet came a border or even the season before when Chris Clemmons was there and ended up tearing his ACL and blowing on his knee and then they lost to the Atlanta Falcons but offensive line is really what made the legion of boom the legion of boom all highly they'll\nLet let's let's welcome in cliff cliff a rule who uh you can check online like them right on but you know they are nine fifty um yeah I mean listen a Richard Sherman gets all the credit so those defensive backs and truth is it was only guys up front right\nIt always start with the guys from but now that we've got a heck of a player does well and and they know deep down inside that you know we played a big role in there that the vice versa as well you know they would always give us a lot of low uh after interception and different things like that so that we we understand the correlation between the two\nUm your career was ended too uh too soon because of a neck injury\n... what's what's what's that like when the doctor says hey do you can't play football anymore what is that what is that like for some money as competitive as you\nWaste it for me that's a you know I didn't think my interview with that Syria when it happened I was ready to go back in the game you know I'm I'm like look like they're I'm good I'm at ... for\nA while I felt like I had that before I can go back out here and play you know thank God to the doctor he was like no you didn't go off\nAnd that night when I got a ... they might actually be over with a difficult process that but you're not the same time I'm fortunate to play ten years ago a beat the odds by three I mean I think the average is only three three years to contain\nA want us to go I lost every game I wanted to visit a pro ball what else can you ask for you know it was a it was a great run nonetheless\nClever all joining us in the ... show on Fox Sports radio I Would point to last year's rams game\nHas the if the unofficial end of the legion of boom right that the may come on now they're up forty nothing now after that was after the Jacksonville game\n... in in reality you being a part of that franchise windy really in\nOh wow when did the leading up over it or not I mean last year I obviously what what was the big she appoint through it I mean so many injuries to now you gotta you gotta realize myself a we lose champ chancellor sir a though though are guys that were banged up\nThat played a lot of football over a five year period so overall um you know I Would say probably the Arizona game what really you know what that makes it quite\nClear available joining us in the ... show on Fox Sports radio uh there's still a lot of questions about about the Seahawks I mean\nI think what's amazing is they ... penny he hasn't done anything but the running game hasn't been a problem because Chris Carson when healthy is really really good um yeah ... ... how\nDid this happen that Carson and look I'm I'm In Oklahoma State alum so I Know the talent the cars and had he had trouble us that he had trouble staying healthy when he was in college that shouldn't be a surprise but what's your reaction is somebody who knows this franchise to the the mist pick on penny but to hit on Carson\nWell I mean ... and my David Alex I leave him out because he that he that uh you know a hundred yard game\nOr the week before and and I think they're just a good one to watch um you know let's see them trying to find a running back of my ... at least that running game that marks on his lap\nAnd and as of right now you know over the last three weeks they've been consistently been able to run the ball and that can up you know a couple of hundred yard a hundred yards the game which is impressive and that's what they need\nAs far from any outrageous thing you know it's a it's a learning curve for him um you know we got her early a priest either so it's kind of behind the eight ball at the moment and the other two guys they've had experience\nThey play it and and at the time and so uh allowing him to the kind of learned from those guys that they can keep for him right now\nOne of the ... one of the things I've always wondered is it felt like\nUm the front office and ... to a certain extent now Peter had the benefit when he first got there having coached\nAnd recruited so many guys any of the great feel when they drafted but they've done a really good job in town evaluation just look at the legion a boom and how many guys were high draft picks to begin with right\nSo as much as that was that was created like the same group concrete it again I feel like they have some young talented players that because\nThere have been so many departures of so many great players from that more than half decade of dominance we don't realize is Seattle's kinda got a nice little group of younger players in my over selling what they actually have on defense right now\nNo no you're not at all I truly\nBelieve that they do I mean like you just said right there when they got Richard Sherman camp chancellor voting for fifth takes round draft pick\nYou know when they got the ball and he he was drafted you know Russell Wilson third round so they they they could pick 'em it's just all about trying to find the right one the timing and all that good stuff they have a great group of young players are that are trying to figure it all out and they have some leaders still there that's a big difference between when they first started\nAnd now is they do they have a back and play\nUh with Russell Wilson obviously in it that one of the best line backers and Bobby Wagner that can actually lead the guy and a half later I mean big time game\nSo I I think they're in the right path I think they have there on the right path um they just have to confess to keep dropping away and then I think they'll surprise that shocked a lot of people as well\nWhat do you think about the rams are widely considered the best or second best team in football should be pointed out that are both ... both went out last ... last game with concussions both in the political um how impressed ... were you with the rams when you saw a ...\nHour that the game and I you know I'm ... I was very afraid they have all around good game um but I Will say as well you know I think the the kind of show that they they they have some issue that they need to clear up if they want to get all the way uh you know with the running game in ...\nTo be able to play better in the run game obviously but overall though they're solid they have a solid quarterback it all they have a solid running back and I think that's a key player right there and it's the talk of girly everything is played off man that was the early ... opens up so much\nFor golf for Jared golf man and they show it um but you know if they're going to be uh to to be for sure enough he\nWas yeah it it feels like do that you got to make you got to pressure you gotta make ... but then you've got to pressure you can't just sit back their Nike's sit back their charges them sit back there whereas the Seahawks got after him a little bit and and uh and and he showed some of his paws at their\nMost definitely and if they were cheering up man you know if you make a movie\nIn the pocket his percentage drops out tremendously I think it goes down to like thirty percent or something like that\nSo it got can get after him and and make a movie now that it's much credit as well you know they're pretty solid team together and if you guys can get after him consistently in the past the game you know you'll see you'll see it passes a gradually decrease and and his attempts decreases well\nCliff April joining us and the Doug ... GREs on daily cliff um the the Seahawks win and played the bears a couple of weeks ago I'm doing a bears game didn't sideline for bears game there's a lot of talk about the dynamic a pass Russia they had led by ... they they have they got an athletic\nYoung an active defense um how ... how good are the bears in reality in your mind\nThat they're solid team I mean the quarterback plant solid uh and then you acquire probably one of the best in the league with Connie Mack\nAnd obviously you see what ... you know the fact is bringing turnover is getting intercepted score is doing everything that most of the line it wants to be able to do or at least half of this stuff you go on every other day a lot we can do that they'd be very productive\nSo overall you know they have a solid team they have a great leader ... um you know that there are a lot actually is is playing well with long plan plan a good ball of their leading the way\nThey think they didn't have to keep dropping the way it looked like Detroit's on there it is it's kind of leading the way for that for that division but um you know they can make some things happen for sure", "year": "2018", "show_name": "The Doug Gottlieb Show", "city": "Iowa City", "day": "10"}
