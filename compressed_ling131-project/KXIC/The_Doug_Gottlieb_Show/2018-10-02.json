I Will point out when I pointed out yesterday and I said earlier today on coward which is it is not a coincidence that all these quarterbacks are putting up crazy numbers right\nNot to go into an oh yeah by the way they just happen to now called the rough in the past year call\nYeah more defensive holding\nThe NFL knows exactly what they're doing it's hard enough to watch the NFL or watch football with all the ... review reviews and replaced so you're you're better off reading a more exciting than friendly game and oh yeah by the way what gets people more engaged in fantasy football\nThis idea that well now it's legal to bet on football you know a single person who didn't bet before that it's like well now it's legal in a you know technically even though it might not be legalized in my state so now I'll do it\n\nRight like there there was a difference between the legal gambling which you could get on the or\nYou could you could bet offshore you could go to Vegas there are ways in which you could do it and the legalization of marijuana\nBut\nMarijuana I Would say you know\nTen percent twenty percent of people who smoke now we're like well it's illegal now so I'll Try a main gummy take a toga or whatever it up\nBuddies party or I'll go in at least walk through a pot store\nWhereas gambling I Love gambling has always been a legal and and ah but it's more been frowned upon than anything\n\nMoving frowned upon that I think what's happened in terms of people watching more one on an election year end to the NFL has figured out that this is a more logical\nBrand is great\nI don't know if it gets more people in the stands on early Sunday games and you can be at home watching six or seven other games but I Do I honestly believe that the NFL watch the NBA and the NBA getting more and more popular\nAnd stats are great that's a good first of all are\n\nSo there's a reason that over ten quarterbacks have a hundred or higher passer rating through four games in the Nashville bowling either were playing in the greatest era of quarterbacks\nFour\nQuarterbacks are allowed to throw the ball more freely move more freely\nSand in there longer and their wide receivers are able to get open easier than they ever had previously which is more possible which is more likely I think you know the answer and oh yeah by the way we haven't had any of them hurt yeah right\nWell what was the story last year\nThe dolphins didn't have their quarterback Ryan Daniel Didn't play at all\n\nGo around the league and look at all the guys that got ... death\nRather than good to you Ben thanks so much for joining us this is awesome stuff you're doing a uh with with all pro dad which I Know Tony ... of course I Believe helped found a back in the day

there are issues with race in the in the country I'm not going to diminish that there are also issues I think there's associate there's a socioeconomic divide but there's also the issue of\nEither you know having not having a two parent home I like you've ever read freakonomics where he talked about you know every stat makes you more likely to and you watch\n... homes dad mom sitting up there and how his son has handled this sudden rise to stardom rise to success it reflects well upon his parents but also and some of this is confirmation bias like well\nI mean feels like feels like he had two

that back to you\nKnow speaking of hockey uh Mitch tweets the show at ... shows to handle sorry Doug you're wrong well playoff baseball is definitely a step above regular season terms of intensity playoff hockey it's actually more intense than the regular season hits harder shots multiply power play peek case get magnified the gold he's become goats or\nGoats yeah you're you're you're wrong you actually wrote\nA first of all this actually even though there's a ton of teams get in the playoffs in hockey percentage wise you're still getting a baseball but that's not actually the point that the one of the sales of regular season hockey as regular season hockey has fights\nRegular season hockey has has a great level of intensity that's just you can't play hockey like like the NFL you can't play even though I I'm not dismissing\nThat there is greater intensity in playoff hockey especially overtime hockey where game is over at the drop of a puck\n\nBut what I Would tell you is regular season hockey's pretty intense\nAs opposed to regulars and there are there are games in hockey which there's fights brawls every hit a feels like guys trying to top one another\n\nAs opposed to baseball in which getaway day baseball like let's just get this thing done by there are based on how many based basically baseball games on the record numbers of position players pitching this year because we don't want to use our relievers once we get four or five relievers in\nSound like it's not close to the same sport\n\nUh I I I'll keep my thoughts in regards to ESPN's Monday Night football crew mostly to myself\nMostly to myself but I Do think there's some interesting stuff in growth going on between the three some of Joe tested tour like I Know pretty well uh Jason wait until I Know a little bit but McFarland who I Know\nLittle bit as well I found this interesting what ... say\nA lot of conversation about rough and a pass for the national football league but just watch me on my he's got an opportunity to know what I mean you said you know what\nI'm not going to get up you know the here and just have to get into the ground but even if I Know what I Can't do that because that's a point up there and I don't want to get flag and hurt my nice move there ...\nThere's this um there's this thing\nRight that we do and we freaked out about rules and we think it's the end of days\nRight now\nI'm not sure if you're aware Ramos I'm\nMost sex in a season most accent ...\nHow many are who did it who did it [noise] from the Fox Reggie White no no no most ...\nMost ... and all the time was Michael strain remember when that all are like ... or yes I thought he broke direct for most most accidents career okay I was most action when seasons two thousand and one now they should be pointed out\nThat ah that\nThere are more possessions now there are more passes thrown because there are more possessions and more past friendly league\nAnd show there should be more sex and yet it's about the same but\nThe Tom I'll call it the Tom Brady to roll because guys had been hit at the knees or below and torn their ACL's but the rule hadn't changed that rule change I don't know six seven years ago and then four or five years ago they they put in where you couldn't hear the quarter back in the head right\nSo the thought was that this would completely crush this is that the first time the defense of aunts and outside line backers have complained about the rules changing and trying to make it harder for them to do their job\n\nBut in two thousand eleven ... the Jared Allen at twenty two section two thousand twelve Jay Jay y that twenty and a half section two thousand fourteen with all the new rules outside of this year's or just in Houston and we saw last night had twenty to sex\n\nJ J what three years ago had Seventeen and a half but remember the last two years he's been hurt by injury the point is guys still get home plenty a guy you can still get home twenty to twenty two times a year if you play enough games and if your team has the lead with the other team is playing from behind\nThe difference is this year\nNow you can't land with your body weight on some and so the thought is that it's going to eliminate guys hitting the quarterback\n\nIs that her to Chicago Bears what was the story we brought you yesterday where my silver was covering the raiders and he reportedly overheard John ... saying\nThat um ... got to go back on another strip sec the\nPoint is guys are not going to stop getting after the quarterback they're just going to\nEvolve they got to figure out another way it's like Jurassic Park remember that famous lion drastic park nature finds a way right at\n\nThe same thing happens in football\nAll right so you can't live with your body weight I guess we'll go up to strip sex more now after the football more we may not land with their body weight but now we're headed guys arms a lot more which by the way and I only gonna cause more fumbled interceptions but potentially more shoulder injuries\nNature finds a way\nThat you guys are smart and they're really good ones once they get home will just change what they do when they get there\nBut they're still going to get\nWho's the most every team in the NFL I'll tell ya next this is the junk ... show on Fox Sports radio\nAnd the M.
