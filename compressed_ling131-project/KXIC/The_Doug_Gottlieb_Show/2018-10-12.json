I mean I\nBoth teams could easily make the playoffs the both of them might not get the five or ... I mean I think those are the\nMore bizarre hard to pick on a week to week basis teams in the NFL\nI bears come away after a week off they got a dynamic defense plus he had met nagging who of course comes from Kansas City and no one's better after a week off after the by weakening you read his mentor to get on a Miami team that found a way to ... up by Seventeen nothing lead because Ryan tannahill or through through two packs and uh\nI ... you know obviously a tough way to lose lose a football game ... what do you like look I don't I never bought into mining when they're three you know but I also don't think they're as bad as the results would tell you the past two weeks where are you on Miami's you get ready for Chicago\nYeah I'm with you there they're definitely not as bad as they play you know you take out that New England game that New England just ... absolutely kill them and last week the game snowball a when you look at Iraq they don't have that many premium players but those first three weeks they just play it really well as a team and tanning he'll get a really good job\nNow ... to ... you know especially last week or ... percent took over well that's a problem

but I I went to really do it\nNow is this gonna throw sticks touch downs every game no\nBut they do have players on al ... the two running backs were good and like you said\nThat he has apprentice ... read for nine years so he knows exactly the real is what you do in the Bible and for what whatever Andy does in his office over by it has been proven that it works so I Would expect some big time wrinkles I\nI from a betting standpoint to beat up there a lot of the week I think they come out and just ...\nI Will tell you that Adam gauge told me one thing in our meeting with him today which I found a and he said it was kind of a smile and say she's like you know I I said how are you going to handle ... he's like my our goal honestly is to make it to the gloom back never wants to play the doubt that the Miami Dolphins ever again we're going to see if we weren't getting\nTriple the minimum chip and I'm like we'll doesn't care you know like you can send tied and Adam just taught them to the side and the other thing with the bears is they got a bunch of other good defensive lineman\nSo she can triple team and do all that stuff teams do but got other actually got to block that that's what makes it effects I mean I don't know if it's a week but it's it's darn good\nNo no question I'm I'm just really no I don't know what he\nDid last year he kind of got crushed I I have people I Know friends or with a high level guys so they are just count the dog so you know you don't have those meetings get when every meal to coach ... yeah it's pretty impressive\nYeah no I I thought he was I thought he was great when he was ... negative or anything you want to ask him\nNow just to just tell them a middle cock says what's up\nI'm proud to I'll tell me we're talking all kinds of trash about him okay a game of the week she's taking on a patch has a path contain all that speed\nI don't know I mean they're they're db last time they played a really putting off and on Sunday Night Football was it Monday Night football when they play the YMCA looked terrible now bell jak treats you know September kind of at the pre season but\nLet's not forget I mean these two teams played last year in New England now granted it was weak one entire retail was running wild cream on was running wild Travis County was on a while and this guy or ... or ... or ... or so\nCoaching job [noise] and I don't think it's his all his fault this year [noise]\nBut their office has not creative some that Scotland and coaching what he knows some of it is they don't have a personality creative [noise] I Believe the quarterback should problem the wide receivers your problem and some of it is a coaching problem as well but I don't think he coaches beyond this year if they continue along this path that you know often\nThe Doug I also made a mistake you made one on the flight yesterday I said that the giants were their white jerseys against the bill Superbowl twenty five that was incorrect that should've I should've known they also were their blues like they did in Super Bowl Twenty one against Denver but boy did they look sharp last night that giants across the helmet what a great look a psych and the\nOld school giants goes home and I like yeah look I like the giants white with the great ... great britches allies are saying I'm a big fan of like a Monday Georgia's road uniforms which

to Georgia that number Thirteen LSU number six West Virginia's at Iowa State number seven Washington's at number Seventeen Oregon and number two enemy UCF\nIs at Memphis what top ten team could be\nIn

the new [noise] I mean you start Patty meals at point guard aid not just that they lost it do people want to say Tony Parker Tony Parker is washed out for the last ... Murray and I lost their white\n... also remember they lost a slow mo they lost ... Anderson and the off season in ... point powerful or [noise] they they've lost too much passing too much ball handling and then you have the factor two star players are mid range in a post up player [noise] I I don't like it I don't think the ...\nHow about a couple of quick one psychic from the end they'll see as we'll Clinton Kurdish I'll throw more than six innings tonight in game one against the brewers in Milwaukee [noise]\nYou know he was super economic and his last start yeah six innings there was only like eighty five pictures so I think yes I I think the days including her shopping a strike out picture of the sun will probably gone but I I think he gets through six innings and pitches in the seventh\nWill geo Gonzalez the brewers go more than six innings in tonight's game one of the ... [noise] I don't believe that will be I'm Wondering if it's going to be that magic number for that we would we see the reporting to a throughout the playoffs finally dug a psychic after scoring two goals for the central coast mariners in Australia [noise]\nThose same bolts heavy future as a professional soccer player [noise]\nSure why not yeah kind of speed and\nThat's what I thought to chasing a ball down in the\nCorner yeah [noise] yeah the answer is yes yes\nAnd he's getting a dog godly show [noise]\nThe Julian zealous thing is fascinating to me right he has not pitched yet in the in the postseason and so you know ... issues\nUm\nKnow on the season on the season a four point to one E.

C. than a must equals C. right\nIf the if the jaguar if if the chiefs are better than the jaguars and the jaguars better than the patriots than that she must be better than than the patriots that's the transistor property doesn't work that way in sports\nBut it is got to be pretty alarming that you know the two teams that they got going against\n\nA are not playoff teams\nAnd when you look at the Kansas City chiefs not just to every killed Sammy Watkins in Travis Kelsey and I looked at loaded with weapons that stretch you out and as much as you can say as well you know it's just defensive ping pong\nWhen you play against the really really good paying bomb players you can't even be defensive 'cause you can't reach the ball and you know even a defensive player that always hated him play doesn't imply\nThere's a reason that ping pong player has given up on trying to hit winters because he knows you can't win that's how I think the ... chief need to look at the patriots and I think they will\nBut it's kind of fascinating and how people are looking at how I beat them at all I beat them the best way to beat them is don't make mistakes\nUh\nThis is John middle cough earlier in the show\nStuff or did I mean these two teams played last year in New England now granted it was weak on\nAn average bill was running wild green on was running while traveling on a while\nAnd this guy this or that can grow the ball or so\nIt's just a bad after for New England and I I Love radio ballot jak but I I don't know just I don't know what they do to these guys ...\nTeddy walking through that door you know they just they just don't have personnel and ... you know arguably the greatest coach any sport ever but what's he gonna he can't cover to kill me I got on like Ninety thousand I Know\nYeah there there's there's I mean there is something you can do but it it means getting away from who you are that this is this what happened for years the Pittsburgh Steelers and the Pittsburgh Steelers use their linebacker they're they're they're\nDefense has been built around their line backers for years and so whenever New England is gone in there and granted last year was close\nAnd Jesse James touched down at the scores maybe history is different\nBut but New England has gone in there for years run in the run Tampa spread out spread out of the Pittsburgh Steelers defense and been able to get to beat it the logic behind the correlation between that and the chiefs and the patriots is it's just a bad match up for the Steelers\nAre Steelers whole thing was to take away the run and for years the patriots didn't run the football\nIs a bad match up I think that's the exact same thing with Kansas City\nDo I know that ... homes won't have a his own brain fart won't make a mistake I Do not\nBut I also think or maybe no this team has so much athletic talent and I've had enough people tell me it's such a bad match up for the patriots that even if they continued to prove

like I'm In ... over the hill ... has always been kind of an odd sit there and they liked the Marta rose in but he's a mid range guy and this is not this is not a mid range league anymore\nAnd I don't know ... let me look minimum in Jeff ... who's a a play by play voice for the Milwaukee Brewers they take on the LA Dodgers tonight game one of the NFL C. S.\nI. which of course you can see on TV on Fox yeah thanks so much for catching up with us I Know you've got to interview a crank counsel uh for for your guys pre game [noise] the decision to go with geo Gonzales was that when you saw it coming [noise]\nUh I think it surprised a lot of people done or to be honest with it because he didn't catch that division series I got hot a couple of times but never appeared on the ball game and his postseason six that's just kind of been okay never won a game you never lost the game he's been in the postseason ... with the Washington National [noise] um but\nHis match ups are good against the Dodgers the Dodgers have a lot less than a pop and the starting lineup so we're just announcers Noam ... there was no Jack Peterson in there the only traditional lefty and there is is Ballenger so uh I think that the big thing that\nCounts I wanted to see in the first two games the series with Donald way pilots trying to neutralize that ended up uh especially at Miller Park where we're left hander ... drive in the past\nI uh I'm obviously I'm you know some of us we we look at the brewers regular season stats I mean like look we're all honest honest each other students say like I've heard of the Christian yell at you and I've heard of a couple of the other guys\nBut you talk to you and basically like these two best teams nationally what is it if if there is no ace that has to pick up the ball game one of the and al and Al's cs then there must be a ton of pop in the lineup is that what the brewers are built around\n[noise] I mean they're built around the top two guys in their line up its its Lorenzo Kane who's who's had such a lie under the radar type a season I mean a lot of people talked about him being a potential MBP candidate when you look at the actual numbers for Kaine he'd go oh man [noise] numbers thing and it does make a whole lot of sense but one one of the best defensive players\nIn centerfield and all baseball if not the best um Christian yell at you who is kind of buried in Miami story has been well documented over the past that after they jettison standard sooner yelled she was the clearest third guy to go\nAnd the brewers hopped on that opportunity and and gave up or really good prospects to get them and if he's not the MVP internationally this year I'd be shot 'em but those two guys kind of steer the drink as it is but he does that give ours had a tremendous season it thirty five on run\nFor a guy who was basically a bench player last year traffic Sean had another thirty Homer season that's true in a row for a guy the brewers got from Boston\nMan when Pablo Sandoval signed with the Boston Red Sox the Sox has said well we can we can kind of get rid of traffic Sean out in the brewers have reaped benefits from it so\nThose are those are two big guys Orlando ours is a great defensive player Ryan Braun has had another twenty Homer season it's just kind of at the next guy and he saw the division series against\nThe Colorado Rockies where if it's not one guy it's another guy and they pick each other up so well the same way with the open to [noise]\nYeah and the yell at each and Kaine are one two in war internationally you get that type production to players your line up and like you said it's it's built around built around those two [noise]\nUm I'm In I'm intrigued by the idea of of going with an opener right of like hey I grew up playing RBI base going and as soon as the guy would start would lose the juice you go to the pen and you use the guy bringing you just kind of go through your guys\nRight um I I felt like last year last year was the ... because the Astros want it and because the Astros had tanked suddenly taking got credibility and now now half the American league tank\nIf it works this year for the brewers if they can go through um ... you know use use the bullpen and go to and when the world series\nThat forever change major league baseball\n[noise] I I don't think forever I mean it's so hard to do that in a hundred and sixty two games you saw that with Tampa Bay in ... bay was one of the last teams out in the American league it's just so difficult to do it you'd have to do it around specific off days\nOr to make sure that your bullpen guys you're openers your middle guys you're close there's are are okay\nI'm over the course one sixty two now in the in the policies you can get away with it a little bit it and we've seen this for the last ten years I mean the cardinals in two thousand eleven when they won the world series they barely had a starting pitcher go more than four innings if they even did that\nIt it was go through the line at one time I go to your bullpen and it'll be just fine I'm so it's not like it's a big secret formula that was just formulated this year\nOr this isn't happening over the last few years and the brewers if you get five innings outta starting pitcher I that's a like a complete game these days ... the biggest question that\nThat comes out of this whole thing dog is is how does that\nIf you end up doing these ball and start\nYou're not going to have starters go five and six innings in the future unless you've got the horses right um so how do you how do you pay players and that's the biggest conversation that we have\nIf you're not if you're not Mac's jurors are going out there seven eight innings every single day and you you got a guy who's going three and they have a middle guy that goes three and ... than a culture that goes three innings\nYou got three guys that are going for one particular day how does one guy make more than another guy and the other guy makes more than the other guy\nThat's that's where this whole thing kind of get a little backwards in terms of the players union how you're going to pay these guys move forward\nYeah I Know and then of course you got a guy going tonight for the other side in a including her Shaw\nWho is is going to get paid but we just don't know what if it's with the Dodgers doesn't start game one of the ds he does start gain one he was very economical or in game two of the D as a really quickly ... out of the brewers you told us how they how we know the Dodgers don't match up all gets left hand pitching\nHalf of the brewers match up against Clinton crocheting\nThey've had some success against him in the crate council era I mean the first game that he ever managed was back in two thousand and Fifteen and\nIt's a lineup that it's not even close to being the same as what it is today\nIn one of the national championship series but Craig councils teams have played well against clean Herschel now what's that translates to today's is totally different question but it's basically a neutralized a couple of uh what kind of bad for the brewers traffic shot that it alive today but he'll be available off bench\nYou start with their non Harrah's is in the number five body clay everywhere are my stock is in there today so you have to traditional left handed hitters yellowish remove stock it and they're separated by three left these are three right handed\nNot only are there are wide receivers not as good\nAnd there are more of a ground and pound team but it's harder to do that in this like maybe maybe\nThey become a power team in the national league and ultimately it comes back around to them but without their philosophies of lying that that doesn't appear like it's going to happen but I I actually by his comments I think those are reasonable comments to make to anybody who knows sports\n... the results may not show that he's a better quarterback but I'm sure he reads things better I'm sure he has a better understanding I'm sure he prepares better 'cause he's done it before\nOn the other hand um ...\nIf this is the better version it is not good enough to be the long term solution and command a huge contract the off season\n[laughter]\nHey here's Cohn coward on his envy piece of the season\n... Mac is massively affecting three teams could this won't happen but right now I'd give ... Mack the MVP not Patrick ... homes\nLiterally Oakland has a top six defense in the NFL there one in four why 'cause our last in the NFL in ...\nThey can't hold a lead they can't get to the other quarterbacks the Chicago Bears defense number one in the NFC their number two in the NFL insects number two defense overall they lead division why ... Mac and ain't Mitch ... and Green Bay Aaron Rodgers still isn't\nRight\nYeah I Would ... I Do think he's turbo charged this ... defense and made a good one even better and he's having a great years so far and they're having a great year but I Would also point out that he's not the MVP\nHe's just not it just it's not that kind of like um\nI I don't know how it could it could be anybody other than ... homes but go for it right starting quarterback undefeated team fourteen touchdowns two interceptions one twelve point to quarterback rating yeah I I just I don't know how is anybody other than pad my homes\n[noise]\nProblem with Jared golf and I know that promise to send their child in the ... what about Jared golf it's it's I Will equal parts to golf equal parts to a girly equal parts to or even brand cooks they just have too many weapons they split the votes whereas\nI I think that there because of the lack of turnovers because of the production the overall off and so I think pat homes is the ... is the one guy who right now it'd be the MVP but you know like look dude let's see what happens in New England\nI give you my picks next hour was having a reasonable approach but I think it's a really tough that's a really tough sell to anybody to go there yeah I could I think a a quarterback wins MVP is tough sailing me I'm kind of interesting here\nThe the Minnesota symbols are not going to bring Jimmy Butler with them to play in Milwaukee tonight\nYou know all the conversation the past few days it's been about journey Butler's behavior in the practice and and ah then it was about the meeting and who actually attended the meeting and was it a players only meeting into Jimmy Butler actually call in and what was actually said within it\nI I I Do think that the team is\nPutting out there that they want to keep him\nBut I think that simply elaborate play you don't you're getting ready for regular season the guy just started practically your team he's on your roster and you're not going to even bring him with you on a road trip to Milwaukee that shows he's toxic that shows you don't want 'em around otherwise why wouldn't you playing with your guys to get them up to speed for the regular season\n\nFeels like Jenny bothers you they're gonna be traded this weekend or then they'll have to wait this is like a last ditch effort to trade him\nAnd I know the Lakers aren't bringing in their stars and not playing tonight against the warriors but those guys actually played together so far the season as opposed to the timber wolves are the only time they've played with Jimmy Butler is on the other side on the wrong side of a

and take lumbar ... by the way is a great deal that's maybe the biggest problem with the giants thing is me saying they should have drafted Sam Donald or address the quarterback situation in any way\nUm they wouldn't have had cycle I'm Barkley who is a local kid is a great kid is a good player and will be a good running back for a long time but running backs you can find in the second round in the third round\nOr even guys on the street you just can't find quarterbacks there's just a limited supply as this but I Do think that eventually evens out and maybe they get Justin Herbert ah this upcoming year\nBut then again now Justin Herbert as to walk into a situation where if he doesn't perform you got ... junior throwing a fit over on the sideline\n\nI also heard there was a part in the I don't know if you guys watch the pregame show was really good on Fox and there was a part where they they had Michael Irvin and Troy Aikman are being interviewed together and Troy said you know part of it is it's about respect you know you have to have each other's back\nAnd um\nAnd he talked about how Michael even early on when Troy was struggling\nMichael had this back look we all know that he lies\nHe doesn't have nearly what he used to have and I would I Would concede the point that oh Dell is still a lead at his position while he lie is not even in the conversation of being a leader and probably if they had a reasonable backup plan\nHe'd he'd be under threat of losing his job next week\nJust because it's obvious doesn't mean you need to pointed out\n\nThat meaning he pointed out just like I was taught at a pretty young age that when you screw up when when your teammates screws up there's nothing wrong with as the point guard as leader saying my\nBad that's on me coaches do this all the time\nTeams will lose the game he's not the coaches fault and they'll go over the coach said coach what'd you think like you know what this is this is on me I didn't prepare them for this
