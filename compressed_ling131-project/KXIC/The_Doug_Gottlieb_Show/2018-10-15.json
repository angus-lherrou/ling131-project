says manufactured and people are going to um you know get on to a little bit in the books going to be written on him and he's going to have some struggles\nUm but I don't see any reason why and two three years from now he is not a top ten quarterbacking asleep\nThey they seem to they seem to be believers of it there's just there's some throws there that he well he leaves some points on the field which is the only things that lead you kind of scratching your head the leadership stuff they love what\nAbout Brock ...\nUh get just a pinch it gets to start because tannehill is hurt\nAnd he's got this crazy sat where first start with the Broncos ... get a win first start with the Texans against ... you know and then yesterday you know they got rid of it really quick and ran the ball bunch on

Joe Flaco forces him to throw the ball especially on third out when he all of a sudden does employers fast and yesterday\nFor whatever reason the peace whos practiced against Joe Flaco most of his career when he was in Baltimore decided not to do it and wacko was sensational on third down yesterday and made a difference in the game I think that whole south to me there's not a strong team I thought it was Jacksonville at one time\nI'm not sure there's that much don't think they're the best overall team but for me I don't think Tennessee's a playoff team even though they went to one last year and used and can't wait to get games away they just couldn't get one yesterday that the Buffalo Bills\nAnd and and they got a gift from Indy going back two weeks ago and maybe one from Dallas going back last week and yet here they are kind of hanging around\nFascinating fast nice to have great stuff from Michael in body Michael you teach us something every week about the league appreciate it and we'll have people pick up your book thanks for joining us backed up that's Michael and body gridiron genius is the book pick it up let's get\nYou to Dan Meyer where our hours away from an LDS game three just weird to see the brewers in the in the U.S I'm Sorry\nI don't see us but yeah ... sorry unique in considering them and we're looking ahead and and guessing\nBut you could have an Astros brewers World Series or the other one was a national chain ones and it was an American you know the yes yeah and for a period of time division rivals so that that would be interesting but we're a long ways from math brewers and Dodgers coming up on Fox Sports wanted\nFor game three at six thirty eastern time released shot seen pictures for Milwaukee Walker viewer does for LA the lives have been announced Mac months ... months he that is is going to bat second Justin Turner is going to bat third for\nInternet and I mean they're they're just in terms of stories incredible you know there's there's guys that are heart and soul of teams and in and that that's what when he was out with the Dodgers they had no life and as soon as he came back suddenly they were contenders\nYeah and you knew that he was going to have something in game too because he had an awful game one and of course then hits the home run in game two to give the Dodgers to leave for good so he's going to bed thirds and I was making a minor change there are a lot of trauma shoves gonna play second\nUh that's not the genes you've got a bat cleanup tonight for Milwaukee's in say get large gonna benefit for the brewers again coverage on Fox Sports one six thirty eastern time we'll get to the\nSome football news in a sex but want to tell you the sun's assigned former charge them all Crawford doing contract or free agents are Jamal Crawford to a contract according to the athletic the thunder are really Russell Westbrook out for tomorrow's opener against Bush\nWas surprised by that want to\nSee if I Am so selfish I Want to see ...

meeting I talked to somebody there an hour ago he wasn't in the building they don't have any sense that he's showing up tomorrow or you know I guess there were\nReports of week seven I mean that's you know they they have no idea I mean when the SPN report came out about week seven or maybe we gate they call those aged ... they wouldn't read too much into it I don't know what he's going to do so\nI mean your guess is as good as any bodies at this point I'm I suspect you may may maybe doesn't come back if he doesn't really doesn't want to be traded then I don't know why he would sign that thing before we ...\nYou know for people who don't know K he's a franchise tag eat but he can't be traded unless she signed the franchise tend to which he is not yet side right so he actually has he can actually ... you can say like look I don't wanna be traded to them\nAnd play for them because you know you know I'm going to be an a pending free agent and so he could not sign until after weekend\nRight now they could they could agree to terms on a trade and give that the the team that would acquire him permission to speak to him and then they can say look dude here's the deal you know let's face it it's going to be the eagles or some contending team\nHe's still probably has another trick up ... up his sleeve but those guys are still cold assassins I mean\nGetting in their feelings and crying and the corn flakes is not going to be what brings down that dynasty it's going to be to fake it Tom Brady gets hurt and hits the wall or Bob crap hands a team over to Jonathan craft in

this year the students are all about one thing and it's holding that trophy at the end of the year\nUh tonight we're going to see Green Bay Packers take on the San Francisco forty niners how bad is that relationship between Mike mccarthy near an Rogers\nI don't think of it it's it's bad it's just sort of war you know what I mean and and a little bit sort of haggard and you're there a decade and you have ebbs and flows and the lead changes in our fences evolve and different concepts come in and personnel comes and goes both on the coaching staff\nAnd the and obviously from a roster standpoint and I it's it's sort of crushed thing that I don't think it's going to crochet\nYou know again and the bottom line is a very young GM and ownership which basically amounts to team president mark Murphy a board of directors are going to have to decide like there's no way McCarthy's coaching out a lame duck year next year so we're either\nPutting on his finger or letting him go right and he's not going to take another one year extension I mean I just don't [noise] I I don't know whoever's advising him can't possibly be like yeah just let them by your cheap for another year in rent as they go\nSo knowing what they're paying Aaron Rodgers now and knowing the deficiencies there and knowing that everything just gets a little stale over time I don't know anybody who I talked to in the league who sees them giving McCarthy a deal that runs concurrently with Rogers contract and say you guys got another four years or whatever to figure it out\nSo who would be the guy [noise] the guy I don't know um you know I\nMean it it's very ... you know I don't know the guys that I you know what I mean like that's the thing it it made me a guy just gets let go somewhere else\nYou think it takes very so like I almost feel like the the trend in the NFL and maybe this is with the younger quarterbacks yeah ah is is to get one of those fireball you know play collars or to\nHow many of the mind [noise] you know what I mean like I get\nMarried you got any holiday ... would you do ... new good kings very go do ah what's his name Lincoln Lincoln Riley [noise]\nI don't I don't know if that's how that franchise\nOperate that they seem a little more conservative in state the problem is if you bring in somebody who doesn't know as much as Aaron Rodgers then you're in trouble and some of these guys are from gazing in some of them are the real deal\nYou know some are byproducts of his system and the guy who coached them up and who they're mentor was and other ones are better than their mentors I don't know where they're in Rogers is thirty six million plus here in New money\nYou know you take a whole lot of chances there um\nBut I think it'll depend on the landscape and and again who goes out there or they don't like is below Brian on the street or something like that you know I I don't know I'm just thinking out loud but I don't know if they go that young I I just boy I don't know\nThat same stuff good and you know it sometimes the non answer the honest answer is always a good answer and even when it's not an answer is better than you lying to me and making up a name that
