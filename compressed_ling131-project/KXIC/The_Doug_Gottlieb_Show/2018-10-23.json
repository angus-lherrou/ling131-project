their way of ... doesn't make an unbelievable catch things don't go their way or Houston may still be playing was also another awesome team\nHow the red Sox seems suddenly be double in the postseason\nI'll tell you what though man here's the thing after getting to the division series\nI thought Yankees are going to win this series it felt like it take it home field back from the red Sox you know going back Yankee Stadium which was as loud as I heard it\nAh going into game three and you know the red Sox go and take two on the road a Houston wins game one I write a a what now in hindsight was exceedingly ill advised call I'm saying that the Astros look on beautiful point\nAnd what happens Boston comes out when's the next game and then goes and takes three in Houston ... and let's not under sell just how difficult what they've done is they've won every game they play it on the road against two hundred wind teams\nThis postseason so far and and they're now facing a team and the Dodgers that while talented\nI don't know if there is talented at the Yankees are really talented as the Astros and I understand that talent does not way they've all games in October in of itself\nBut it's certainly put you in a better position to do so and the red Sox have just some merrily dispatched to really talented teams so I I think it's more the whims of October uh than it is that the red socks look feet of all I think they're just playing great teams\nAnd they won the series three to one and Fort Irwin they're they're they're seven into this postseason against those excellent teams\n... pass and joining us in the dugout show on Fox Sports radio how do you explain David Price being so dominant against that incredible line of\nWell a ... if you want to look at it through a granular perspective of that particular game his change up\nWas awesome and I I feel good or as bad as I feel about that Astros column a following game one in the first inning when he struck out George Springer I Believe on a change up I tweeted something to the effect of\nThat was a vicious changeup by David Price if this is on tonight he's got a chance to be really good and it was on and he was really good and I wrote a column that night\nThat essentially said for all we want\nTo to believe that there's some mystical thing going on with David Price or Clayton cursed Shaw or Alex Rodriguez warfare bonds or whoever it is has been part and feathered with you can't play in the postseason\nTag yeah it's not that they can't it's that they haven't and those are two wildly different things we we have\nTo understand that these are our professional athletes there where they are and they've achieved what they've achieved\nBecause they're they're talented on\nOur imagination and\nAnd because they've made adjustments and that to me is what happened with David Prosser David Price more than anyone wanted to be good in the post season because he knows that it impugns his reputation\nEvery reputation and he's worked really hard to build up every time he goes out there and ... and ... so I think that David Price finally found a comfortable area in which he can succeed in the postseason now\nJust as that means it's not that you can't do it he hasn't done it yet it also means that he might not do it for him or not like it's not like a ...\nWhich was turned out all of

he told us all with with this talk of having a belly button piercing issue um\nAnd and now he's starting tonight ... ... have you figured out that has anybody figured out why the disparity in a\nIn the miles per hour coming out of his arm\nUh you know I think that's the biggest question going into tonight was Chris Sale sitting eighty nine Ninety One in his one started the AOL cs through which he\nLabored significantly because he had a stomach bug or whatever it was or because his shoulders hurt I'm going to listen to my eyes and thirty seven thousand other people are going to be directly on the ribbon scoreboard\nUh tonight at Fenway Park upon that first pitch because you assume it's got to be a fast ball to see how hard he struggling and if it's Chris Sale who's Ninety three Ninety five\nWe've got a chance for our the games it's Chris Sale of who is eighty nine to Ninety One\nThan the ... the doctors have an advantage steel home field in the first game of the world series and and Chris Sale you got to give them credit for what he did last time because even though he didn't have his ABC or the stuff I mean this was Chris Sale with no command a and without philosophy and he's still got through four innings a you need more than that\nIf you're going to win the world series and I hate to put it on to people ah who are starting pitchers because the the starting pitcher has been just so minimize in baseball these days but\nMy colleague Tim brown yesterday said something and I agree with him I think whoever's better out of sailor pressure on the series is who's going to win the world series\nWell let's uh okay so let's talk about Persia or couldn't distorted worse against Milwaukee right gets lit up and then all of a sudden he has incredible command of the curve ball and uh you know instead of you know the ... the Atlanta it was more it was work than like you was\nProbably what he's going to have to be in the future getting a lot of ground balls and and be smart keep the pitch yellow wood against Milwaukee a bunch of curve balls and then he comes in and how close it closes out the series\nI you know like you keep going that crucial well though and I feel like he's not a spring chicken he's had continuing back issues what our expectations of him considering how much he's thrown even if he's thrown much better the past two times out\nThe thing is I think the expectations of Clinton Kurdish are always going to be that the guys are stuck because that's that's what Clinton crochet has been throughout his career he's a best picture of this

Burt\nAnd what's it what allows you to do it while you play from the post and you could be in school or in the air one you can get found trouble and the other teams big guy their team's best big guys to allows everybody else to kind of catch their breath\nYou get to the foul line allows you to catch your breath what did you just running up and down and shooting threes and trying to play transition that's a hard way to live\nThere is a reason that no one's play that way successfully in the NBA over the last twenty five years\n\nSo he may believe in be trusting in the process and he may not be freaking out but if you really have balance and look at it\nI think the brawn James is that a rhythm 'cause he's not used to playing at this temple I I don't think he has nearly the town around him in terms of one or two guys that can carry the load offensively if he's not hitting his shots\nAnd LeBron James just thirty four he's not the same as he was it thirty were twenty six and so and ... and I forgot to mention the other part\nThe western conferences weighed more difficult like you can tell me all you want a man it was awesome the holiday eight straight NBA Finals in the eastern conference\nBut was it was it\nHe had three of the best players in the conference that didn't have any sort of other collecting the town to compete with\n\nPortland Portland you know Portland is a playoff team the spurs are a low level low end playoff team the rockets already high in playoffs and they're all in three three legitimate teams come in and bitchy twice on in your own building\nAnd I'm not saying they're not competitive and they didn't play hard and they're not better than they were last year\nBut this process is different than it was in Miami than it was in Cleveland\n\nAre coming up next can you be too reliant on analytics in the NFL Daniel Jeremiah from the NFL Network joins us to discuss next\n\nThis is the dung godly show on Fox Sports radio [noise]\nBut it's one of the world series is that\nA out changing Marcy Boston Red Sox from the analysis\nIs Angeles Dodgers on new champion he's coming soon we're all over [laughter]\nFox Sports radio hey they're diehard years in football facts that you might not even know\nThe first football game was played in Eighteen sixteen on an average gained the ball is typically him play\nFor only eleven minutes and finally pizza consumption rates go up during the week of the big game okay you probably knew that last one\nWell here's another fact you might not know that it's actually really useful especially if you're playing on tailgating true car also ALS people get used cars that tried to guard isn't just for buying new cars with their certify dealer network in nationwide image where nearly one million used cars\nYou'll enjoy real price you know an actual women tore into simpler buying experience would you buy new or used and withdrew car\nYeah and okay so now what do you do a Derek harming cars got twenty five million dollar cap it I just I feel like well you got to trade Derek ... who's going to take on that cat number or for the remainder of the season even if you can get out of it at the end this ...\nYeah I mean look you know like I say only takes one right um you just have one one team fall in love with you and we can point through the sand Bradford career to say maybe you won't see it come and maybe I won't see it coming but there's somebody out there that that's that's willing to do it\nUm so yeah who knows it definitely is it's a tear down job at this point in time and now it's up to Oakland to make this all work out\nThey've got to hit and I I was talking about you about it today and I\nSaid if somehow they end up coming out of this thing with with both uh uh to kind of replaced Mac which will be a lot cheaper version in a in a really dominant player\nAnd ... you know ... ... and we'll see who knows what Herbert it's going to do a but if they if they can get the quarterback right to pass Russia right then maybe we'll all do you know John Gurdon apology for what's going on right now but that's going to be the big challenge for the raiders can they get these picks right\nDana Jeremiah joining us now Doug ... show on Fox portray what about the cowboys they are so needy for a wide receiver that they're willing to go get a guy who seems to have lost some burst and he's going to make Thirteen million and changed next year guaranteed a path to rework that deal and extending long term or is he just what the doctor or does he fixed their offensive ineptitude\nWell I Do think how why even with not seeing the same guy he was ... I still think talent lies he'll be their most talented wide receiver I'm so they've they've added somebody that can upgrade what they currently have a you know now what was the price too steep I I tend to think it was\nA but they've got better and that's the goal to get better in a NFC East that right now it's pretty darn watered down and therefore the taking maybe they think they can go steal the division\nThat's the voice of Daniel Jeremiah covers the chargers where they're networking course works on the NFL Network and as a podcast move the sticks Bucky is Bucky Brooks who guess hosted for me you should download the podcast it's it's outstanding let's let's go round the league a little bit here\nUm I I don't think ... he hasn't they love I'm In Chicago\nBut he he can be so inaccurate and everything is free snap read ... are are you willing to call it or is there still time to fix that thing\n[noise] I there's still time he has played a time you know so there's still some growth and development now to be honestly I had a chance to watch that tape\nOf that game this past weekend so I Can't really comment on that one but just what I've seen from him this year um yeah I mean I think he's got a good coordinator there for what his skill set is I think that he's a good fit for him being able to get him a lot of those quick hitters and er and hopefully they'll continue to grow and develop and be able to play the position you know ...\nSome of the big time guys do but he's not he's not ready to do that at this point in time and they're finding a way to score some points a move the football even though you've got a little bit of limitation there\nAre you willing to say that Andrew Luck is fully back\n[noise] I I don't know that he's fully back to you know throwing the ball with us as much power as he did before but I think he's fully back in terms of being able to play winning football and uh and do everything you need to do to win games and I think in some ways it might help them a little bit\nTo the kind of pulled back a little bit of his confidence you always want quarterbacks be coughing and there's a time he'd be a little bit too confident he's\nTurned up all over a lot in his career forced a lot of throws and I think maybe in the back of your mind thinking you know I don't think I can jam that ball and there are maybe it's not a bad thing I mean I I I get to watch Philip Rivers every week\nAnd Philip has a good army used to have a great on me as a good arm or but he he he's he's pretty darn smart now he doesn't put the ball on Jeopardy like he did when he was younger and I think you see a little bit of that same thing with Andrew Luck\nYet they're Burnett got shoulder surgery day he's out of the year for the Philadelphia Eagles strength that team is that just wins but it's a defensive line how much does that hurt the defensive line\nYeah it's good I mean he's a really good player it they have a lot of depth they have guys there um I didn't get to him and journey going back to help them to but they you know that's that's a tough one just because they're able to roll for ends through keep all those guys fresh and and you definitely need that when you get into the postseason as you saw last year he scooped up the formal there to help\nSecure a Super Bowl so yeah it's a big loss they've got some deaf but uh the they'll feel that one no doubt\nKansas City continues is just pummeled teams now ... especially at home granted the bangles not good in in prime time um I look I I feel like we've seen this before I Know it's different because I'm a homes his arm talent but we've seen dominant\nRegular season is this is this different than years in the past with Kansas City\nWell I mean gosh you got to have you got to have some firepower to keep up with them and you better play great red zone defense so they're just run your right or the gym I you know who who would you compare this to is this off and it's like if you're going to basketball comparison\nIs this feels a little bit like you and I'll be back in the day like you just kind of look up and you're like holy crow when the game's over like this thing is over um you've got to find a way to get some stops on them it's just explosive a group as I've seen\nYou reminds me of honestly it reminds me of the undefeated year that the patriots head\nUm okay that's a good thing because if you remember they're often the first half of the season they're all fence was ridiculous\nAnd then leave but surely and then of course last game is eating the giants nearly beat them in the giants did beat them in the super bowl and the ravens nearly beat him as well and\nAnd like look this is the team I Know they lost the patriots and they lost the pages 'cause the patriots did a good job of keeping the homes all to field by running the football right and that's you gotta hit him with those body shots but you gotta get first downs as well you can't have empty possessions\nAnd that to me they're still ... homes have played great take nothing away from him but they're still those teams\nWith a dominant front and we'll get to see it in Mexico city you know we'll see what their and Donald ... company or when they get him off the spot hit him a little bit if if he's going to turn the ball over hill that's that's what the giants team you were just talking about did the Tom Brady inside pressure inside pressure will destroy any off so that to me is something to keep an eye on\nEr the saints for real\n[noise] really good you know are still trying to find themselves I think defensively but the personnel is good so to me you look at the results you can look at the personnel and to me I I like the the personnel that they have\nAndrews still find a really high level this'll be a heck of a challenge for him this week though a Minnesota's playing pretty good defensively so we'll know a lot more about both those teams next week\nGreat stuff as always welcome back to the states was it was it ... it was just a longer\nA it was I had a great time it's a beautiful city had never been before a went and saw a a a a soccer match over there which was the that was a great experience I never understood dug the soccer thing I've never got why people are so into it\nAnd then when you go over there in the Chelsea and man United play and you get it in that atmosphere I was like okay this is the first time I get it\nSo now you're going to be waking up and tweeting it like on Sunday mornings like all these other guys are into soccer\n[laughter] I'm a you're not going to get it right you can start calling an opinion on me or you\nI I Will give you this one quick story though I work with her before the um the headlines when you get over there you know you get\nMore than I Would want to you have\nTo find out in the next ten games if you're going to pay back Prescott or not and now when I'm Ari Cooper you're going to have an elite running back an elite left tackle an above average off into line\nOffensive coaches\nPlay in making parameter player gate if he can't get two hundred and Seventy five yards think you've answered the big question he's not the guy\nLook all of that is fair it should be pointed out though that a huge part of the deal a big reason that his value was hard um to to measure for these other teams is he is guaranteed to make over Thirteen million dollars next season\nAnd so with that in mind now the sudden the mark Cooper you can pay him Thirteen or there's a lot lot of money and then are you going to renegotiate a long term deal\nAre you just going to let it sit there so it wasn't just the first round pick is the first round pick and a half the salary that spike next year and if that's what it's going to take to find out if jak Prescott can play what do you do jak Prescott can't play\nBecause you know where you find a quarterback don't ya in the first round the NFL Draft hoops\nOr that because problematical you don't ever jump pick\n\nThe reason why you got jak where you where you got that doesn't usually happen that's the exception that the rule and it's probably the reason the deck as in performed as well as many people thought he could perform well I was the fourth round pick\nBecause not that accurate because not that good ... he's a good athlete on a freak athlete he's a good thrown out of great though he's a good leader not a great leader he's fine but he's a fourth round pick maybe he dropped a little bit 'cause the DUI but even that would have been a third round pick and that's what he's playing like\nUm I Do think the other part to it which I Do I disagree with is the idea that aggressive wins doesn't always win\nIt it depends it's like one of those would you trade a mark Cooper it depends what would you trade ... it depends what would you be aggressive it depends\nIt depends I Would not have gone forward if I was my ... I Would not have gone forward if I were Frank Reich on my own forty three yard line\nWhere are you are on the field and oh yeah by the way if you're the raiders and you're saying why aren't the raiders being aggressive they are they're aggressively getting rid of players in order to obtain younger less expensive assets for the long term future\n\nThey weren't handed a blank slate he was handed a crummy franchise have been crummy for Fifteen Years with one years an exception\n\nAnd that's what the fuck shit [noise]\nUm this from Patricia trainee who covers the New York giants for a living for the athletic\nAfter the you lie apples right if you're just joining us he like apple former first round pick of the giants was traded away to the New Orleans saints earlier today for a fourth in the seventh round pick after he like apple is rated ... says the giants aren't throwing in the towel it will give an opportunity for younger players to play moving forward which\nIs the exact same thing no no no this is the NBA guys do this all the time were not tanking we're just playing or younger players and that causes us to lose more\nThat's not tanking you know why you can't say that we're trying to lose because the first rule of tank club is Ramos do talk about tank love a second rule of tank club music is don't talk about ten club you go\nCrazy that we thought last year the giants had to draft a quarterback because the giants never dropped in the top five of the draft right once every Twenty years last time they you they end up swapping with the chargers and they got Ely this time\nYou end up passing a wide receiver but he should have taken a name I drive from the top five two consecutive years\nGood fight with the raiders to see who gets uh the number one quarter back on the board\n\nForty niners no cardinals no bills no rounds I don't think I'll be there but no I mean some of the coal to know all these other bad teams they have their quarterback in the future\n\n[noise] [noise] we got to tend to get to our next our we have um ourselves while I was going to join us in Studio right [noise] I was actually a manifesto with him about his new book that dude new member of Fox that'd be awesome plus get you ready for the world series is gets annoyed at night\nFind out what Ramos is watching it does feel like you're supposed to have rain and terrible at like ... things are cliche things are supposed to happen I Boston's weather is horrendous so I Would expect nothing less than freezing cold rainy gross night in Boston\nYou know screening lunatic fans are where the strike stone suddenly shrinks for Kelly dancing in the ninth inning\nJust like the cliche should be that there's all these stars shots when the Dodgers play at home and you have perfect sunny weather I\nI Can't wait for the world series tonight curse shot taken on Chris Sale questions about both of them coming up next numbers lie all the time actually don't believe me I'll prove it to you next in the ...\n[noise]\nReady to become appointed ... signed up today for Exxon Mobil rewards plus an earn Fifteen cents per gallon and points for the first three days after you register plus or one hundred bonus points worth one dollar in savings\nJust for registering your card you also get two points for every dollar spent on convenience store items and car washes sign it today at Exxon Mobil rewards plus dot com terms and conditions apply available participating ExxonMobil locations you must only enroll prior to January thirty first who does Nineteen or to participate\nExperienced else in the technology on the Dell XP has Thirteen [noise] the laptop for people who never say no to one more episode [noise]\nHi there I'm calling about making a reservation at seven yeah I'm not coming out\nWith life like color really in sound clarity ten uninterrupted streaming down cinema technology on the ...

better where I'm at\nUh the new book is called never shut up life opinions and unexpected adventures of an NFL outlier I Would guess that NFL outlier would be hey most football players\nDon't leave Compton to go to the ivy league in Colombia then go stay in the league and as a first round draft pick and then when you get out of it go right into the media and do well in is that is that the NFL out letter\nMan you're smart smarter than me or whatever do a lot of interviews with people that supposed outlier part and I'm like well\nKind of interested in is the road less traveled not the yellow brick road to the NFL obviously going to Colombia a lot of naysayers ... told me that I wouldn't make it to the NFL\nOr if I went to Columbia and a lot of people and competence an Ivy League school you'll never make it there so uh I've always kind of going against the grain in a way from the hurt in a ... it's been great for me and to live a life that I've actually drained and tried to desire\nWhat what was that like because I my dad actually got his masters from Colombia I never I never been there until we moved back\nAh when I was at CBS and I was working in the city and I went to a basketball game there and you step in and it's it's actually like stepping back in time it looks like when I guess the Seventeen or Eighteen hundreds in New York with the with the buildings in architecture or whatever right but you go from Compton you shut your first day at Columbia what was it like\nSocial shock a it's a ... you know New York every once in your space everyone's sharing energy everyone's just got to get somewhere and\nIn this mad rush but they're walking and I remember the first time I walked by a group of guys maybe like ten dues in front of a bodega\nAnd in LA if you see the news on the corner in front of liquor store or don't go there you don't have and I don't know you don't need to go stick that bad I write a book in New York that's just the news in Chile and I remember just having to learn a new set of rules and customs and\nThen you get in a classroom Jews were more competitive\nIn the class then guys were on the field in it and I mean do dress up at three piece suit said taking naps before they had to go to the professor to speak um like\nY'all are all in in the classroom so it was eye opening in terms of perspective\nUm when when I grew up I'm a little bit older than you but I remember when I grew up Columbia had like the nation's longest losing ... and they actually started covering it I mean I used to cover it on the NFL games like oh Columbia gotten longest as long as losing streak yeah um what was that like do the plate to be like an NFL caliber athletes playing in the ivy league yeah\nAh my coach they recruited me Rachel you're told me something we're sitting at the top of the Empire State building few select recruits and he's like do you want to go somewhere and carry the torch or you want to go somewhere like the torch now I'm a guy that has prospects in uh other opportunity to go to major college football factories\nAnd that so many big fish in a little paw or get a great academic reputation in degree but\nMore importantly have an impact and I just went back to Columbia for homecoming so what we lost we're not on the street but we lost the game but it is tight knit community the family aspect is is is something that really separates it from other schools in terms of that network and but\nBut as it were a sacrifice of like did you could've playing the SEC or not twelve right so is it ... it all in all honesty as is is that is is that worth what you have now that we're sacrificing hey honest on on a college football Saturday you can't wash your alma mater play and play for ... there's no\nJust you got I searched even find the games on TV yeah there's a tradeoff there yeah is that tradeoff worth\nIf you want to play the long game no matter what sport do you play or you're going to stop playing that sport yes and so it's weird Colombia puts me in places in mental spaces with others in terms of reception that no football factory will allow me to think about that that stigma\nDumped jock or just think about how many times you you're looking at an athlete and you're like what else did this guy know beyond the scope of the game\nAnd I'm just the opposite is still not meet someone the eyebrows go up you went to Columbia and they presume intelligent and we just go all these different play also from Compton people like oh you must must it must have\nBeen it's been a drug dealer and yeah right right like they do at your armpit right All right like and then if not what you want to go over and over I mean I wouldn't do that lately\nAnd living living down to any stereotype people have where's your destroyed so many so many stereotypes right um\nWhat about the transition to the NFL 'cause you go like lets you can change your body and you can be ready but you were playing
