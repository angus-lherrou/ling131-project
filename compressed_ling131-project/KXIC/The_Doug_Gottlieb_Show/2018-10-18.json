might have missed on our apple\nI I don't believe I think that we would all have that sort of reaction would solve a couple of nights ago on a foul ball\nIn the brewers Dodgers series were Christian yell at you went to try to make a sledding catch and it was just one fan reached over there was no fan interference called at that time but all of a sudden you've got an arm that leaning over and follow the earth's Ari while running at a wall it can be somewhat distracting\nI just look at it like this it's it's a bad bad rule don't be mad at the at the umpires last night for getting it right because that's how it should have been it it it it infuriates me to sit there and say\nWell they didn't follow the rule when it's a bad rule I I look at it in the NBA and we were talking before the show if a guy goes to the basket image driving to the basket and just gets hammered\nOn the arm of the ball flies out of bounds and they don't know who it was awful\nI Am totally fine with saying we missed the call we missed we missed the foul we're just going to give it to the team when you doubled down and say not only did we miss the call but because we missed the follow it went off of you other teams possession\nTwo wrongs don't make a right and I think that last night Joe ... well he didn't have the best thing all in all replay couldn't overturned which replays a whole nother aspect and all of this\nI just think it's an offer rule for major league baseball the have and the Boston Red Sox where everybody was saying yes the baseball failed by not getting the road right good because this would have been for the good of baseball I just there's so many answers his Bucky where\nWe should follow the rules are because they're so ridiculous and if they get I think it was a good move last night in major league baseball well\nYeah I mean I think it was a good move because you have these kinds of things happened to make people have the heart mind discussions and so maybe out of all of this we have a discussion and maybe\nTo what your suggestion was maybe they will move the fans back a little bit five feet just so they're not able to impact began particularly yes online and something that is a high stakes imaging\nPut her all flowers there put put something there to leave you alone lower yeah a lot of things I Love gardening flowers but at least ... originally I wore a ... those reads that they've got drug yeah there it would give some greenery I think it would affect remembered Houston is also the team that had the\nLittle hill in center field with like pull their they took it out it was gimmicky\nBut you do have fans sitting there and they're not the only part that fans right over the field\nBut I\nThese things come with it and if your team was going to be disadvantaged\nMore because of it may maybe not that close because they're like how can we just put it in there they'll call that they won't be able to call interference and that will benefit by major league baseball got the rule right last night and even though the rule was wrong they got it right\nHighland Joel West all you'll watch they made the right move ... catch that ball and it should have been an out sorry Houston that's the way it is\nBy the Houston an awful night last night at me wrong it's a rocket\nPelicans tip into this oh wow they didn't rough rough night and then the span of a

heart radio weapon again reaches sense where I'm at the end by Iran box you can get Bucky on Twitter at ... Brooks Broncos cardinals tonight I Know it's two and four against one in five\nBut there's just there's some intrigued here and maybe the the first real look at Josh Rosen for for some people you've got Denver just gave the ah the rams a bit of a a bit of a game but a little bit of injury tonight on Fox\nI think so I think a lot of injury ... intriguing about what's going to happen in Denver if they don't play up to the standard tonight and then when you have young quarterback and Josh Rose and the guy who really has been kind of under the radar in terms of all the rookies you get opportunity to see him on a national game primetime stays on the excitement about\nThat he's a longtime NFL insider check him out on the doomsday pod casting follow him on Twitter ... and ... our fate and word or joined us You're on the ... and how you doing today\nI'm well how are you guys so we're we are doing well if you're not again John Elway and overall grade as president on the quarter back you\nKnow that would be way too easy that would be way too\nEasy we're ... we're going to crank it up a notch as the president of the Denver Broncos what kinda grade you give John Elway\nI'm going to give him to be a because she went to a Super Bowl a won a Super Bowl as a a\nA director football operations for the team he put together\nA the year that he went out and and got a new defense of starter at you know depending on the defensive line that linebacker a and in the secondary and want a Super Bowl with a Peyton Manning even though Payton was sort of at the end of his career and it wasn't a dominant player anymore uh so I'm going to give him that grade\nOr even though his recent giraffes have not been very good and he still hasn't figured out the quarterback situation\nYou know it is that the biggest surprise that ill way a great quarterback hall of fame quarterback hasn't been able to find a quarterback for instance quarterback for the Denver Broncos [noise]\nThey're not convinced that this is the right way to win to me is reflected in the fact that they don't have a backup quarterback who plays anything like that ... that Prescott is not the kind of quarterback that Jason Garrett and the cowboys have ever had before you know he's kind of a modern a option type\nPlayer who throws best on the move not really a pocket guy and that's the way Garrett's one here wants to play off it's like the cowboys did in the super bowl dynasty years\nOf the early nineties and yet they have this quarterback who's more of the revolution of quarterbacks that we've seen a guy who can run a and throwing his best when he's able to do both\nWould they have any interest in tomorrow Cooper if Cooper's available\nI I think for the right price they would have to have because he would be\nA the number one receiver on this came by a large margin um and if you look at at one of the things I'm the cowboys are failed to do was like I mentioned they didn't replaced as Brian when they decided to release him because he is performers didn't justify his contract anymore\nOr and then they didn't have the next guy in place when Jason ... retired after Fifteen Years um so if you believe that that grass is a franchise quarterback like Jerry Jones Stephen Jones continued to insist\nThen you have to do with the rams head for Jared golfing you have to deal with the bears the permit strip risky and what the eagles have done for Carson wins and you have to go all in and get the quarterback the kind of weapons necessary to sustain a success and so yeah I think I'm Ari Cooper would be a great fit or in the cowboy system\nOr if he were available at a reasonable price from the raiders which to me as a two or three a you know he's going to cost you a fourteen million dollars on his contract next year the cowboys were paying approximately that does Bryant before and they they shouldn't have been kept issues after the season but um yeah I think he's a player who would have to appeal to them at the right price\nI think one of the underrated stories coming out of Dallas has been the ah I guess the solid play of the defense in a new ... was not defense coordinated he's a passing game coordinator but for all this is versus he's kinda G coordinator cursory short he joked about his impact on the decent\n[noise] yeah you know he came in he was fired by a by Pete Carroll as a defensive coordinator up there and as we know the previous to defensive coordinators\nHad both gone on to become head coaches Gus Bradley and Dan Quayle and um and Chris for shark did not obviously have that opportunity\nAnd he came here to to kind of run the passing game and coached the secondary which was the role that Matt ... loose hat or he left here to go to Indianapolis as defensive coordinator after last off season and\nYou know rush hour has been a so impressive that rod merit Allie has effectively allowed him to begin calling the defenses are not just on third down but on a more regular basis and so I think that's why you see a more man demand and the secondary I'm\nA more a aggression at the line of scrimmage by the quarterback sport blitz sing or in general or the thing they haven't really done until the last two games is create a lot of turnover at two in each of the last two games over the last team in the NFL to get an interception\nUm but that sort of the direction it seems like Chris ... wants to take this defense\nOr ... been really impressive in that regard and for all the people who would criticize Dallas for not drafting a wide receiver and the first round where they could have had Calvin Ridley or anybody else\nBecause no receiver had been drafted they took a lame Vander rash\nOr who has played well as a rookie leads the team and tackles which has never happened Dallas that uh and he probably won't finished the season that way as because shortly\nI spun out and and should return soon but the interests are and playing time even one shot leaves healthy ah and they've got a good three man rotation there in a position that you know they really couldn't win at any more if they didn't have shot at least so I think the defense is really the strength of this team and it wasn't a surprise to me going into the season\nThat for maybe the first time in Twenty years Dallas was in a position where they were going to have to be able to win games on defense because they're off at is what's going to be a work in progress\nDead word or long term NFL insider check out the doomsday pod guest and find him on Twitter at at the border are FAA we appreciate it at enjoy weeks I haven't actually I think we get the\nUh the the info on the cowboys we know about the history but just a depressive was the the knowledge of what went on in Denver and and the brand new and all that organization runs as well uh you know we hit the the double the Denver and Dallas ... we we get a lot but there's a lot on there I Would be interested because now we have seen more deals in the NFL occur\nIf the cowboys would make a push for mark Cooper\nYeah I think it is all about the right price I Would not give up the number one form or will be hesitant to maybe give up or to\nUh just based on the amount of money that you have to pay and the way these plate of late I knew he has a couple of thousand years seasons\nBut he also has been one to league leaders and drops a each and every season a it is just kinda hard to figure out exactly who more Cooper is because he hasn't consistently played\nAt a high level enough where you can say are he's absolutely a number one will pay whatever it takes to get him and he will automatically upgrade the team he would be an upgrade from the devils yeah boy but I still think you have to tread lightly when it comes to how much money you will pay him and how much you draft capital you give it to\nBring them in the ballpark would that prices well he's Bucky Brooks on Dan ... here we are in for Doug you're on the ... show on Fox Sports radio and coming up next we'll tell you why Laker fans to be careful for what they wish for\nBut now the saying goes bills on the latest in a big game that I was

kicker Caleb Sturges was limited in practice again with the growing entering the raiders were fined twenty thousand dollars for an injury report violation failing to downgrade of Lyman to out when they actually didn't travel with the team to the game\nThe bears say linebacker ... still day to day with an ankle injury there is a college football game of no tonight Stanford at Arizona State nine pm eastern three NBA games the lake contest Lakers at Portland\nTen thirty eastern so LeBron James official Lakers debut nine NHL game that I ...\nThank you very much Steve ... what do you want to see from abroad you're a guy that's followed the Lakers for for a long time\nI Want to see a cohesive five on the court which is what we didn't see for quite some time when his Miami team debuted with all those star so I'm assuming it will take a while that that\nThat is good to be unique thank you very much devious Bucky Brooks I'm damn buyer Lakers make their season debut tonight against Portland were in Los Angeles there's tons of Laker fans\nAnd I find it interesting testing the waters of what people want to see from abroad as he makes his Lakers debut tonight because there are a lot of different ways that they can go Steve's option is one of those of seeing 'em\nThe five players on the court actually playing as one\nThere's a lot of different ways this thing go though in the Bronx tape you\nYeah I think there is to see how LeBron alerts to start the game\nAre we seeing some games where he imposes ruled on the defense early and allow these guys to fill in Willie feel compelled to show the basketball world no I got a good squad around me I'm a trust him to do their job and our can insert myself where I see fit I think\nBased on how you typically done it I think this has to be a game where he starts fast he gets going he starts to cook and then that allows everyone else to kind of off his plate\nSo that's that's what I'm curious about is how this plays out we were talking before the show right music our executive producer is a Laker fan I said do you want to see LeBron get fifty Ryan you said that that's not you kind of wanted what Steve wanted as well right\nYeah 'cause the thing with the brunt as we've seen what he can do in the finals he can go for fifty five with a team that's totally a match and as long as you don't forget what the score is with ten seconds left he can probably lead you to win what I Want to see is him trying to lift up the players like Alonzo ... ma\nBrandon Ingram so that way they can grow and be comfortable playing alongside the broad like we know what LeBron can do it's time to see what he can do with the young\nPlayers around him I think he recognizes what tonight is about because it is about him there there's\n... there's a reason that liberal on in the Lakers did not have you on Tuesday because you want to give that night to the Golden State warriors that's they're the defending champ they're going to get their rings that's how you're going to do it there's a reason the Lakers weren't\nDebuting last night when there were fourteen other games in the NBA ... there are where they could get lost in the shuffle\nThere's a reason it's a Thursday and I think LeBron recognizes the moment I think that what LeBron is going to do is going to be a hybrid of what you guys said I think it's early on\nDistribute Brandon ... might get those guys in\nBut then he knows second half third quarter is what people came to see and he's going to give you a glimpse of what he could do with the Lakers uniform and I think that if you vary from that if you go I'm going to score twenty five in the first half or I'm going to score zero in the first after you got to lead a lot of people unhappy being like\nOkay well what about the other guys or why is it abroad scoring I think he recognizes the moment and it's going to be a gradual distribution and then you'll take over the second half\nYeah I mean there's typically you them over here they're more he's more of a passage in a play make it as a good job of Hindu for men ah went down to the first reason game down in San Diego my son that when it gets you have to watch him and the thing about the Lakers when they're going up and down and play fast and they're transitioning a three oh two two and one breaks\nThat paycheck by the way it nearly four times the average G. league contracts to players who are you know not eligible for NBA\nFucking go pro now not least the leap prospects likely would be in the NBA get some sort of NBA contract anyway\nBut if you were to say as you said Steve if they were to get what the Julie contract was which was thirty thousand dollars during the ... yeah yeah yeah that's not enough I'd rather I'd rather go to North Carolina\nYeah I mean you won't you that much money in North Carolina whoa whoa I don't know any more [laughter] good cheer you could go to make up a made up classes though right that's right you might be a pick up an independent you\nKnow degree but I Love the comment from kind of Lisa rice who is chair of this recent commission on college basketball this year's public report she said elite high school basketball players with NBA prospects and no interest in a college degree should not be forced to attend college and it's often less than a year anyway and the one and done has to go\nOh this is a way to get around a hundred and twenty five thousand plus what they could make yeah I think you're I think you will see only process and marketing exactly so they can it can go a in many directions for them and as they go pro but not NBA pro yet\nItem number two for gas who gets to Paul George things he would be playing for if he never got traded from the Pacers\nOr you want to focus on Bucky I mean there's still see but this this is a bad one because I've looked at all the stuff when she needed to work or what have I Would have the answers to that wouldn't there were no but that's a good when it's an obvious one go for it it isn't obvious when did he would be with the Lakers are\nBelieved to be talking to the undefeated saying if he'd never been dealt from the Pacers but you see they did deal him to Oklahoma City last year and he fell in love with his new team and playing with Russell Westbrook and then got the big four year extension this past offseason\nDo you think it's because he didn't have to just trafficking our [laughter] and I was in I'm In Oklahoma City in ten years and I guess I'm worse\nBut I showed up the the I've only been Oklahoma City once and I showed up when the thunder were just starting and I was like All right I Can't wait to get to go get some thunder geared because it was new I went down to the arena there were still building the stores like it was well up yet either\nI had to buy it at the okay see airport still have the T shirt doesn't really fit anymore called George\nSouthern California have got to be playing the LA Clippers on friday that the Lakers but you know this'll be continuing storyline through the season because\nOh yeah he'll be playing the Lakers a couple of times this year item number three guess who in the NFL isn't worried about proving he's worse his high draft position at the top ten selection from this year's\nFlu or who isn't worried [noise] gosh there's a lot of\nCars team may have had an audition for somebody I was going to say say Kwan Barclay\nHow about that wow All right he's done a lot on the field but the team certainly had said overall and it was the giants Cohen earlier this week that said he had no second thoughts about hats they took in taking Barclay running back and it's not weighing on his mind oh we should have done something else like maybe a quarter pack\nThat he could sail he wants the storylines going to be in New York for the next I don't know how you make changes yeah it'd be like serious it's definitely for the next five if Arnold the success of the next Fifteen and if he's taught them the next thirty\nAnd finally guess who in the NFL at Arizona was reportedly on the trading bloc until the team owner today said ... ... not happening we're in a perfect game this is close enough Arizona hosting the NFL ... by the way\nThat I like I feel so bad because all this stuff came across a that's all right when I'm lucky if you know it you know as we go to Patrick Peterson excuse me excuse me\nYes it is in fact his coach it called it a ludicrous idea and now the owner has doubled down saying the same\nI Will say [noise] you don't want to say anything early I'm way to avoid any [noise]\nAh I Will say that we of course we have to get the imaging it that's driving a reputation over produce segment of a sudden I ... Patrick Peterson in my top five of nicest guys in the NFL\nWhat would you what would you argue with that Leno's super super nice guy yeah they're really really nice guys but nice guy sometimes finish last will tell you what the Denver Broncos are heading that way fast next year on Fox Sports radio\n[noise]\nSports fans it's time to get in on the action with my book he dot NET Bible dot net is the industry leading sports action website that often\nReal Vegas odds on all your favorite sporting events my boogie dot net\nLet you play on line and when they used ... when you register for your account and getting one hundred percent sign up bonus my bulky dot net ... got labor a hundred percent bonus no deposit necessary terms and conditions apply for entertainment purposes only ...\nHey I mean could you know the Honda Dream deal sales event is literally happening right now where you can literally get great deals on certified pre ...\n...

concentration I learned is false [noise]\nFox Sports trending\nThe NFL's on Fox TV tonight ... pm eastern time Denver's losers are four straight trying to get back on the team at Arizona which is one in five the dolphin say they are not looking at surgery for quarterback Ryan ... shoulder injury Jacksonville running back Leonard ... could miss a third straight game with a hamstring injury\nIf you just hit doubles and the first round you'll be fine you don't have to hit home runs to put together the tests were rushed to put you can't completely with ... is a complete ... if you're getting nothing out of ... uh you can say Garrett bowls hasn't been a great player form but we can move on\nWhen you miss at the top of the draft it just says you're franchise back and they haven't been able to do it especially when you're the only sane raise been pretty much a knock contributor can't have that many first round is not be contributing factor because those guys should be your new for you\nWell and that's that's another point to LA here and I know you said that Bradley chubby to add a good game last week against Denver\nDid they did they need Bradley ... this is when they were picking at number five in the draft and if you're a team at the end if you're a John Elway you have to say to yourself OK I don't believe we're going to be this high up in the draft again because I Believe in our team\nBut when you have a Josh Rosen's still available when you have a Josh Allen still available and then you draft\n... and I'm all for drafting defense events quarterbacks and and tackles at the top of the drought that's I think the three positions you should have\nBut to to continually missed some of the quarterback position this is the fourth year and I'm including Peyton Manning Super Bowl run where they don't have a quarterback and and and I just I look at the Bradley jumping is Bradley ... may be great but it doesn't fix the problems that you now have is an organization no and then\nThis delicate balance in is is it's kind of an extended debate the the debate would be\nRather they'd show up and said one Barkley in my mind what you are the best players in the draft and I know we spend a lot of time focusing on the quarterbacks and Sam Donald Baker may feel Josh Allen Josh Rosa\nBut I Do believe some guys view those quarterbacks with question marks and if you have question marks about the quarterback and you feel like you have a sure thing and Bradley shove you typically up for the sure thing the issue comes when you see Sam Donald\nSeemingly have success immediately with the New York jets you see baking may feel flash it passed with the Cleveland Browns you wonder\nWhat would those guys do in a situation in Denver where it appears that you have some weapons around them you appear to have a B B plus defense in place you would think that a young quarterback would win\nBut whatever they were looking for the quarterback position wasn't available and some of that may have been due to the fact that they tried to swing for the ... and ...\nThat's why they may have been a little more\nConfident that they can get a right of free agency ...\nI think that they get something right with Cortland sudden I Will I Will say that it it seems like a pretty good player and could be like to take over from dumb areas Thomas and any manual Sanders when when they ended up moving on but yeah it's been a few and far between ... you mentioned that the missus ashamed ray and and maybe if you're a ... and ...\nAnd those are the ones that you have to worry about look if someone misses on the third and fourth round uh in in scouting a parlay is like a a fourth round pick is supposed to be a developmental\nGuy if he becomes anything more

and everywhere everywhere ... trying to stay busy yeah you've got some high school football after little practice today is a little bit of Notre Dame highschool Sherman Oaks returned to a bounce back at it began as we can well a ... there's no replaying\nIn high school football is replaying college football is replaying pro football we know there's a replay in baseball and re playing basketball you a fan of replay it so much in the news from what we saw last night\nI'm a fan and get Nicole right um I have my own issues were replaying how they showed on TV 'cause they always slow it down\nJust believe and replace sometimes let it run it it it game speed so then we can see how hard it is for officials to have to\nNavigate through some of these calls are there has to make\nIsn't that part of the the issue like I look at replay the replay is in the end all in my mind like replay is there to to aid I don't think it is there to get every incorrect ...\nA call correct I think that there are some human error with it and that's why you get this blur of was inconclusive call still stands sort of thing I think that there's there's there's a way that it can it can really be used and you see last night of them not overturning the call or you see last year with the Calvin Benjamin\nOverturned touched down on a replay where it was\nIt was a detriment and not a benefit because the replay actually made the wrong call but I I'm I'm a fan of it I'm I'm with you that I like where it is I just think that it's as you said you don't like the slow moving the speed of it I just think I think it could get miss used\nIn places where we're looking at things like I look at the the NFL and pass\nInterference was was the topic of the should it be reviewed absolutely not put a face mask\n... if you you there how many times have we talked about this earlier this week on the show how many times you see a guy's head turn\nBut no I was looking at a play because they're looking at the linemen or they're looking at the quarterback has done or or this and that like there are things that can be used and the thing that's how replaced you end up being beneficial last I don't know it wasn't the greatest night but I I I'm a fan of it I I I like and I think it can be used in other beneficial ways you just can't look at it as the end all be all\nNow I Can't be the end of ... um it has to be looked at where we are with technology you should give officials every opportunity to get the call right uh you have to be able to do it quickly so it doesn't bug the game down because it\nIs entertainment people don't want to come to have these games don't pause for an extended period of time but you want to get it right you want to make it enjoyable experience and you want to make sure that the game is being played the right way I Am fine with it I just want to make sure that when we look at his sometimes almost getting in rural speak but always super slow motion\nIs it is it like on targeting on hits is that an issue is that does that yeah I don't know if anything I I think\nThe thing about the targeting rule I think you have to have replay in that because the game happens so fast and we're asking officials to make these snap decisions on ... a place that just happened I think replay helps in a fish will come to sort out what are you really saw\n'em as opposed to what he what he thinks he's seen in the moment so I'm a fan of it I'm a fan of a particular when it comes to the hit hit\nI'm Amazed at how many times we think a guide lead with this helmet and he didn't like like in in those came when you're talking about when you were saying oh you actually led with the shoulder and didn't have any contact at all with his helmet that's good for that that's a\nGood use of replay it is a good use a replay nothing with a helmet to helmet stuff you have to because there's so many things that change in the moment if a receiver flinch is if he ducks if he\nTurns his head trying to get down and he goes lower while you're trying to go lower you either inadvertently hit him with your shoulder pad to his helmet I Believe you have to have replay but I think the guy who was into replay um booth must know and understand what he's looking at so they can get that cold and particularly right\nI I just I look at last night and I can I Know it's just it's I I hate the rule I just that simple as it is I don't think fans should be able to to touch the glove I'm so glad that they got it right I'm so glad that the the replay was\nConsidered inconclusive if you will or that the call stood and I feel that same way as I mentioned about basketball if there was a play where the guy gets hacked into ball goes out of bounds and you see that you missed the foul well it's W.\nBut it's being ready to play but I Do believe by midway this team will hit their stride they will still be one to top teams in the west and they will eventually emerged at emerged as a viable contender uh for the going to say\nAs a player I I haven't been a Carmelo fan and and as of late I haven't been a fan at all I don't think that the value of what\nHe thinks he is is is to what he is in reality to a team and so I see last night's game and you see them lose by twenty points and you see Anthony Davis playing and MVP level and he said a lot of the pelicans planning MVP level but with that performance\nIt doesn't go on Carmelo shoulders I don't think that in Collins right and the fact of Carmelo is not a great three point shooter Carmelo is not there to play defense Carmelo is going to be Carmelo\nThen blame that on the Houston Rockets Darryl Maury in the front office ... ... ... if ... if you want to bring in Carmelo and you know what the stakes are if it's even if it's just one game and if we want to take that sample size\nCarmel is just being Carmel ... that was three of ten from the floor one five three plus or minus the notes deceiving but was minus twenty first pause and James Harden were very similar as well but that doesn't all go on Carmelo Anthony just because the river result for Phoenix and then you put Carmelo Anthony ... isn't the reason they lost by by twenty\nPoints so there's some validity to everything that is being said with the type of player that Carmelo Anthony is\nBut maybe in the end I don't blame Carmelo Anthony who wants to extend his career blamed the team that brought 'em in\nYeah blame the team blender construction of the blame there are more 'cause he put it all together Santa Carmelo was supposed to give them some firepower some needed firepower\nUm where they face the Golden State warriors they're going to need someone off the basic and fill it up back in Kevin neutralize some of the sports that the war's you're making a thinker mellow can do that the thing the problem with the rockets\nRacket don't play great enough ... good enough on defense um I'm not saying that they have to be a lockdown Nineteen eighties or nineties Detroit Pistons um bad boys team but they have to be able to get some stops to help their office because right now they're one dimensional daily heavy on the office they don't get anything from the\nBucket I hated that Trevor reasonable left that team last year for the simple fact of what he can do on defense or we can stretch the for all we can ... and ... really good to be with the with the sun's last night there went over the mavericks the\nThe the team that they put together to beat Golden State last year was it Chris Paul hamstring strain away from beating that warriors team yeah and and so when you look at it that way you could say hey\nJust going to add Carmelo Anthony well there's other pieces that ended up being taken away we met you drove a result we mentioned Jeff ... of not being on the bench and that's just it was better defensively last year but this new rockets team and maybe it's the old rocket steam that crept in\nIs going to be different than what we saw from year ago I'm not ready to sit there and say this team is it is done for after losing by twenty points\nIt's just not fair to put it all on ... shoulders last night and and that and I look at it that rockets ... it was a James Harden MVP because now the envy MVP that now the MVP orders given after the season last night beforehand they had to give James Harden this is trophy it's\nOne of eighty two it's nothing to panic about will say I'm not sure how much more you're going to get from Carmelo Anthony than what he gave you last night but it's just not all metal spoiled\nNo certainly not all of those four I think\nI'm ever want to find their way I think we knew the is it takes a while for the identity of the team to kind of emerging with Chris bald and James Harden in a bunch of new pieces around a while for them to find a group but they're too many talented shooters on this go out to many telling this course with this team to ...\n[laughter]\nBy the way if I'm rockets fan as well I'd rather have the steam sink now and then take four months to maybe get your footing and then turn things around in the western conference wherever they were the number one seed last year\nAnd ended up having that home court where they ended up losing the game seven at home but the point of this who wants to peak right now on August Seventy\nWhich yesterday was so don't worry rockets fans because you're going to be okay even if mellow isn't good anymore he's Bucky Brooks I'm dead by or that's just the Gottlieb Joe Devon Booker was quite a night last night

tonight in Portland to ready for the athletic and covering the Lakers bill ... joins us here on Fox Sports radio a bell I don't think so much for coming out hey my pleasure how're you guys today\nWe're we are doing well pulled a unofficial poll but pulled some Laker fans around the building and on the show you're a little bit earlier on the show said and what do you what do you want from LeBron James tonight what do you expect what do you want to see from ... got a bunch of various answers but they're kind of old gender are generally built settled on\nDistributing and then being a little brown is that what we're going to see tonight is LeBron takes the the court for the first time in a Lakers uniform what do we expect from King James tonight\nYou know thinking about a year and goes one one dynamic that I'm curious to see the ones that you're respectable Roger ... Rondo and ... well a resident run does a guy who is a leader on the brunt is raved about is basketball IQ but the team was Condit expecting them ... will be the point guard in the future\nHow does that relationship how did that play out as we get into games just run the store to Ron Ron does finish what kind of roll with ... with the school\nI think it's I think it's a kind of all it's Alonzo I think it's going to be I think the default is that Ron does the starter and probably the closer and then ... who has a lot\nQuestions to answer is he um is the offensive lean more I'm\nMore confident as his three pointer I'm more of a threat I mean he can't be going out there and she didn't want for twelve from three like he did last year and a couple of games he's not going to have that leash like he did a year ago I'm Rhonda with more ready for the job right now but the Lakers need Alonzo to the\n... the the guy by the end of the year so they can do for him as as a point guard of the future otherwise they're gonna have problems\nAre so I think I think the Rondo dynamic is is it interesting because last year the Lakers didn't have a veteran point guard presidents for Alonzo to um study or learn from them anyway now he has that and I think\nI'm a bit of it has a long while but it's also a security blanket so you have Ron who can come in and do the job\nUntil Alonzo forcibly taken from him which is the challenge the Lakers have made like I'm getting this job but if for some reason lawn though I get ... his ears on even like a year ago and LaGuardia was very good as a rookie and point seven ... down seven if that's the game but shot thirty percent from three had historically that shooting number for the first half of the season\nIs tons of time with with with Whitney injuries there's a lot of question marks about in ... and ... and you can't go into a season with the best player in the world in the world and you can't waste a year of the best player in the world's career with with with that big of a question market point guard and so\nWhy Iran does here that the Lakers full effect Alonzo to um to come get that shot it sounds like a season\nAnd that first year of the LeBron James era in LA starts tonight in Portland he'll be sitting courtside or maybe because there's so many ... I don't even know if they have auxiliary seeding I don't know where they got to put all the other press a button or a ... it's\nAn amazing it's going to be a fall out they ... I heard they had to turn away more media in Portland and they have in a year's long it's going to be a it's going to be quite a show\nBill or on the rise for the athletic covering the Lakers will be there tonight to take it all and we appreciate it bill and ah yeah enjoyed tonight\nHey thank you very much I can\nFind bill on Twitter at simple enough at bill or them shouldn't be a spectacle today and again the NBA knows what they're doing the schedule was set out to have ... brought up his own nights and I even though it's on the road yeah\nBut then you come back with a primetime game on Saturday\nYeah yeah right that's what you do the king [laughter]\nYou roll it out for you to see a lot of the Lakers this year the NBA he's Bucky Brooks I'm Dan ...\nWell you see a lot of markets Mario to in the Tennessee Titans future and what about you miss Winston that question in a whole lot\nMore as we get set for a week seven coming up next but first Steven savers here to give us the latest oh Steve\nHello there are three NBA games tonight including that lake contest of the Lakers at Portland the gene league will offer a hundred and twenty five thousand dollar contract to elite Eighteen year old prospects who aren't eligible for the NBA yet nine NHL games deceiving goalie Corey Crawford finally returns for Chicago from a concussion\nGame five of the A.

Cleveland Sunday browns linebacker Joe Schober did not practice again due to his hamstring and the ... say linebacker ... still day to day with his ankle he did not practice today back to you\nThank you very much Steve bears and patriots coming up on Sunday from Chicago this is the dog got Joe you're on Fox Sports radio he's Bucky Brooks I'm Dan ... tonight week seven starts with the Broncos cardinals in Arizona the buccaneers take on the browns\nAnd Jim is Winston goes up against Baker Mayfield titans we mentioned them a little bit earlier and mark is Mario to go to London to take on the chargers and there's ... when you have these two quarterbacks\nDrafted once you it's going to be the same thing with golf and once I Know it hasn't been as much\nAs I thought we would get maybe it's because of Wednesday's injury maybe because it was golf slow start there hasn't been as much comparison with that but with Winston and Mario do you will always have comparisons and the Tampa Bay buccaneers I guess to have a decision to make the same thing as you look at the the future with Marcus Mario in Tennessee\nBut I mean are these two guys\nThe future for their current teams are are they in the future quarterbacks in Tampa and in Tennessee with Mario than in Winston\n... ... if your if your options picked up so the team is obviously invested enough to want to retain their services are pending an injury but I Do think you have to wonder when you pick guys at the first in the second pick respectively you would think that they're going to be changers franchise changers saviors\nA in Tennessee we've seen Marquez Mario to in his team get to the playoffs they won a playoff game a season to go but he played bad last year and he has been playing great this year was Amos west and\nThe young field play has improved however the outfield decision making continues to be a thing that we always have to talk about suspended for three games a at the start of this season\nAnd so you just don't know and the reality of it is this\nDirt cutter is probably going to be fired at the end of the season if this team doesn't turn it around\nYou could have a new general manager and place typically when you have a new general manager a new head coach they prefer to have their own quarterback so James is on notice in what he does the remainder of the season really to me with a tournament where the he has a long term future in Tampa Bay\nHas his plate done enough to warrant like if there if there were no off field stuff would Jim was Winston be around for a long term deal I think the answer and I'll just tell you I think it's a resounding yes I I think\nHe's yeah he's late well yeah he's improved if you go back and you look at how deeply last year he approved in every category of completion percentage passing yours touchdowns the interception rate was down so on the field he has done some things however when you bring in the auto fuel stuff\nUm the suspension or some of the things where you just worried about his leadership of billions maturity\nUm a lot of times as we'd like to think of the quarterback the quarterback is regal position the\nQuarterback the standard to play a quarterback the standard of um expectation that quarterback is different than any other position in football and so you want to make sure that the guy you hit your wagon sue someone that's dependable reliable productive in all those other things and so for James has\nA lot of it has to be done on the field but more importantly he has to play will will also conduct himself in a manner that we say is regal royalty at a\nPosition but the three game suspension and it's not in defense of anything it did happen\nA couple of years ago and there was also the reporting of it and the failure to do so\nBut the the sideline antics that you had with Marsha I'm Glad to more of a year ago the running on the field yelling at the raft and the game but believe it was the patriots last year when when yeah maybe the Carolina Panthers ... yeah yeah yeah but but but those are the things as well that that point up but\nWhen you look at just on the field and with the weapons around the ... I said at the start of the year\nWe can go back and forth but I think pass sketchy why is the Tampa Bay buccaneers have the best core in the national football league or the best group when he talked about wide receivers anti dance I think it's better loaded yeah very difficult to rival ingenious in in more times than not is lived up to that\nTheir defense is atrocious and they made the move this week the Mayor Mike Smith mark ... gets promoted to be the defensive coordinator\nOffensively at least on the field and when the ball is staff does exist James has done about as much as you could ask he certainly has", "year": "2018", "show_name": "The Doug Gottlieb Show", "city": "Iowa City", "day": "18"}
