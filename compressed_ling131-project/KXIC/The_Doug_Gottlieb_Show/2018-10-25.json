I don't know if he's going to play but he was hurt you got it off I think I'm In that game last week so ah they could be susceptible to a few more big place and I it's supposed to be a higher scoring affair\nAnd the trick when Smith are decent I I'll give you a running back a little Kenyan barter\nYou know Sony Michel deal with an injury Kenyan border could emerge maybe possibly if you need somebody that the running back condition you're in a deeply ... hey why not\nYeah everybody's gonna be starting James White because there's nobody to a split carries yeah and and but you know they'll find a way to split here but I Do I mean it's it's true they are yeah I have a deep sleep or for you okay what do you think of that's all right I Will be using this on fantasy shown on Sunday strict TV channel seven there you go good good plug Jay Leno or shark that's a good one and and that's\nI think he is going to put up number see he's had four or five games where he's had over six catches this year does Martin\nI don't know that anybody really sold on does Martin they're going to be behind just like they are every game so you're going to want for short and there are a third down back and catch the Balkan tobacco\nYeah but for whatever reason Johnny groom loves loves older players you know I I Want to love jail in Charlotte I absolutely want to love Jay Leno was short as a sleeper but rooting for whatever reason I just feel like you've got to do the old guy so I feel like it's going to be ... the Doug Martin show\nHe always says that you know the interesting thing about her and I wanted to bring us up earlier and I forgot is he's always considered this kind of offensive like quarterback or yeah primarily because he he had the quarterback show before the draft but I had all those you got to\nTell me one young quarterback that he developed none he didn't I mean he had been there for ...\n... ... ... show there was really there was just nobody that he'd drafted and developed ... into a big time NFL quarterback and of course a Sims obviously got hurt that thought for a minute he he might be the guy but there's he likes the older guys to your point there was the oldest Ross from the NFL coming into\nThe ... to to\nI I don't know I I guess to take up for John Gurdon I feel like I Do this a lot I don't know why but those Tampa teams Shaquille hours [laughter]\nBoth teams were a veteran teams so it's hard to develop a young quarterback on a veteran team you know what I'm saying usually when you see young ... young quarterbacks being developed its own younger teams\nI'm trying I'm trying to think of some example I think Casey might be a little bit different but I mean even the entire ... kill young Karim ... obviously very young so it's a pretty young officers overall\nYeah ... I guess Russell Wilson when he came in was it was a young team and they started winning right away and\nMaybe Ben Roethlisberger with you know when he first came into cars that field team was very you know veteran but Tom Brady gotta go back a little ways for that one yeah but I mean going back to the Big Bend example I mean there's a reason why he threw at like twelve Thirteen times game you know what I mean\nYeah so um I I'll I'll give you a couple of games that I Am very much looking forward to one is the game that Charles Davis will be calling the Redskins orange giants 'cause I'm just not I'm not sold on my red skins yet and I are worse by the same I Would not be surprised to raise the giants would not really just how it's just how it works that they the game\nThe Sunday night game the saints in the Vikings yeah law with my my guy Kurt cousins and and that defense which is a guinea Iverson Griffin back I Believe if you if if\nHe is a heavy similar is going to play or not yeah Brock when do we know that I that I think but I think you're right we don't know if he's gonna play yet reassure obviously a huge piece to that defensive puzzle I still feel like we haven't talked about\nThe Vikings as much as we will by the end of the season because ... cousins has been taking a beating almost every game because it offensive line just allows more pressures any other offhand\nI rarely reef has been hurt 'em but yeah and look this is a team that that is loaded on both sides when they get healthy when they get healthy [noise]\nAll right James Coe it has been a pleasure my friend\nGot they got out\nOf that uh I Am going to get my first vanity plate\n[laughter] because everybody and you're helping out with the highway one\nFigure land on a ... a a and\nThere's this ... going to be a in here tomorrow rich eyes of course in London and getting ready for the game from James Caan Dan how these things for Washington but\nCapitol want is building a better back one that

game that you will see on Fox at eight twenty eastern time that the judge ruled wide receiver once you know offer their match up against the bears with fellow wide receiver Ravi Anderson missing practice today some injury news in Indianapolis Colts warning back Marlon matched in practice today because of an ankle injury one day after he was limited workouts\nBut I just saw the preview in Madison was the right guy to get us out of the ... and that was the difference in the game right there you know you talk about things before the game happens and\nI just saw it again ...\nAnd he's going to die and that he's going to is going to die or on that hill I I'm going to I'm going to say it again he was the right guy it into a strike Dave is there a strike and how about you should\nEither one but the board that were balls um and and look I I you could even go with the shrinking strike zone theory right like in big moments on the road you know on the road especially in Fenway that strike zone shrinks\nBut the idea all the balls were in the same spot like hey make an adjustment here\n\nI Know you want to be perfect against these guys but you gotta G D freaking Martinez behind him you gotta throw strikes\nI mean this is no different baseball just like basketball and football it does come down to the basics that you teach your kids when they're when they're little right like um\n[noise] my new house we have a we have a we have a backyard and which we haven't had in California we had grass and everything that will and so last night for the first time\nMy son I play catch in our new backyards got new sod kind of down and still hasn't taken in but we measured often he pitches depending on the league forty four forty six feet and he's nine and he knows how to throw a little bit of a curve ball a little bit of a slider we prefer to throw a changeup he wants to throw the stuff and I said hey dude\nNobody's gonna let you pitch unless you can go out there and throw strikes have you throw strikes and the whale away on it and know coaches can be mad at ya\nYou know just throw strikes me just throw strikes you're going to be better off you're going to pitch more often and then you you get a vote to and then you can fool around and throw a curve ball which ends up being like a change of the doesn't move\nAnd that's no different than when that's incomes and whatever you do just throw strikes but\nBut I I don't blame Madsen for not having personal confidence in the moment\nOff a game he didn't pitch well against the guy who's seen him Roberts by the way contradictions ... well you know he hasn't really seen them\nHe did seem in game one now\nAnd as we talked about yesterday with Matt Holliday seeing a guy for a second time in two days does make you at least feel better about that approach\nThe end of the game in game one bottom of the fifth gave up two runs after all walk a field of choice in a single end of the game game to bottom of the fifth gave up three runs he walked first bad up here she saw and then of course you saw JD Martinez on a single\n\nSo I I don't whenever the numbers tell you\nBut\nYou want to tell me it's an anomaly hey the numbers told me the numbers told me\nI call it pressure pressure makes anyone performed differently\nBut does have you ever had a camera put in your face when you're at a sporting event and you go back you're like man I acted like a complete idiot why was that low pressure some people can't handle the pressure of public speaking\nI get up there and they have a time limit they have a microphone in the light and their face it doesn't even matter that Ryan matching\nHas shown he can pitch under pressure in the D. S. C. S. the fact is for whatever reason in the world series especially when JD Martinez is on deck he hasn't felt fared well\n\nAnd gave Roberts you know try and the same thing over and over again expecting a different result we know what that's the definition of\nA more to come on major league baseball let's talk some football NFL insider Edward rejoined the shell get his thoughts on ... ... maybe more important how bad is this injury to Ryan Tannehill\nLike I was in Miami he was at practice was it was reported was that practice and then on friday and then Sunday he doesn't play and they're like well you had an MRI and he tried to throw and now a sudden we're working on three weeks he hasn't played\nHow bad that shoulder plus can I'm Ari Cooper fix the cowboys often will discuss next\nThis is the John godly show on Fox Sports radio\nAround\nYour fan the Dodgers look out of your\nTeam is down to games do you go to blame this one on Alex way Robards analytic micro managing by as Hersh open when it comes to the world series boards radio [noise]\nHey they're diehard years in football facts that you might not even know\nThe first football game was played in Eighteen sixteen on an average gained the ball is typically in play\nFor only eleven minutes and finally pizza consumption rates go up during the week of the big game okay you probably knew that last one\nWell here's another fact you might not know that it's actually really useful especially if you're playing on tailgating true car also helps people get used cars that's right true car isn't just for buying new cars with their certify dealer networking nationwide image where nearly one million used cars you enjoy real price you know an actual women tore into simpler buying experience when you buy new or used\nAnd which ... you can see what others paid so they know if they're getting a good deal before buying they're also more likely enjoy faster buying experienced by connecting with true car certify dealers they're over Fifteen thousand troops are certified dealers nationwide\nWhen you're ready to buy a new or used car checkout drew guard enjoy more confident car buying experience\nSome teachers not available in all states\nAnd I know start with low because at Lowes pro save every day on the materials supplies they use most when they buy in Boston now get twenty percent off all in ...

let us do more for you see terms and that was one comes less than worse resources and he tells the story and\nEven though I think Mark Davis made a hundred million dollar investment and committed ten years or to ... to return because of his ability to develop quarterbacks and the belief that he and car with four may very successful partnership but so far\nWe haven't seen any indication of that\nAre grown and says he's not making any more trade doesn't see I'm trading their quarterback\nUm and there was subsequently obviously been criticism publicly uh of car and and you know some people speculating that he showed onion usual amount of emotion when he suffered some of his most recent injuries but I'm One of the raiders titans Lee Smith beta really impassioned speech in his defense yesterday\nAnd call them the toughest guy in the locker room so right now\nYou know the writers are one of the worst team to football or one of the worst off as of themes in football and car is one of the reasons because he is committed more turnovers at anybody else football that being said I still believe that crude and we'll keep car through the rest of the season\nAnd then he can he can part ways but then after the season is there's a kind of a fairly minimal or\nA dead ... visit or what about the jaguars um financially they're kind of all in um ... it sounds you know money um in terms of you know the grand scale of quarterbacks but it is to substantial and he will be on their roster next year\nWhat do they do if he doesn't turn it around\nWhile I you know I think a lot of people believe that the jaguars have one of the best rosters in the league especially on the defensive side of the ball and we saw get to the AFC Championship game even with ... as a quarterback last year\nI'm In ... as now publicly complaint I think you're going to interview with bike silver that\nEvery time they lose he's a scapegoat he is you know you buy the public as the worst player in football but the reality is that he's got the most multiple turnover games in the NFL says he was drafted in two thousand fourteen he's got the most interceptions and the most ... so\nI it seems to me is largely responsible for their failure\nOr a lot of people think that maybe Tom Coughlin and Doug ... would be interested in trading for Eli Manning\nI really don't see that happening are I think Thai rod Taylor's a guy that could have some interest to them because he's a veteran bowl quarterback who values protecting the football but ultimately I think they made the Carlos Hyde trade last week 'cause they want to get back to be physical with the running game\nInsulating the quarterback in this case orders\nFrom having too big a role that puts the ball in jeopardy or they feel like they don't have great receiver so they really need a mobile quarterback or who can keep plays alive and give their you know mediocre receivers a chance to get open\nUh [noise] uh it's got to be a challenge for them off as a way to get it turned around and I just can't see or does ever really being a big success there\nWe've seen also the the New York giants part ways with snacks and uh any like apple what about you lie manning that does he finished the year and a giants uniform\nYeah I think you know obviously there's a big fan backlash when they tried to ban chipper Gino spent at the end of last year or so he's got sentiment on his side I also think he's got\nA note trade clause in his contract so I just can't see him wanting to go finishes career somewhere else unless it was a team that really had an obvious chance that he could win with and I'm not sure any team use him in that way a including top\nCough within the jaguars going on to Super Bowls with I mean\nIt all the giants are for Twenty one and the last twenty five games they traded to defense for starters among\nThe Fort trades that have been completed in the NFL as we approach the deadline David Harrison an apple um and and I I just think the giants really miss evaluated their team I have a lot of respect for the general manager they get over to build the Carolina Panthers into a Super Bowl team\nA buddy seemed like he missed on this one in terms of really thought going into the draft that they could support Eli Manning at age thirty seven and coming up bad season or with a new system do coaching patch or or\nAre they obviously passed on so I say I'm Donald in Europe as a franchise player they saw a Barclay sick one Barclay as a generational talented the running back position and and I think that decision is going to be scrutinized\nFor years to come depending on whether\nThe giants can now get themselves in position by being bad and losing games to draft the best quarterback in the upcoming draft\nHigh most importantly ... ... what's with Rob Gronkowski in his health\nWhat was it sounds like a you miss last week stand because of a a back issue but my understanding was you participated in practice today and was even involved in holding blocking\nA pads and so forth for other players initiated contact which seems to be an indication of that is help was improving obviously Tom Brady has demonstrated that they can wonder without Julian Edelman and they can win without ... but I I think they believe that he'll be back at play this week on Monday Night football\nGreat stuff ed we're

do you think that defense changes 'cause that was one of my things that I felt like when I was watching last night and I tweeted it out like there were times last night where the defense for the Lakers just looked awful I mean totally awful like they looked last and there was a lack of effort\nDo you think that that's something that changes over time or are they going to need like let's say they get someone like ... like do they need just a total upgrade in terms of defensive personnel or can they\nSlowly implement a better overall team defense but the pieces they have or what the young pieces like a coup SMA Alonzo ... who's ...\nWho's was a terrible defensive player only people look at the box scores have terrible defense player [noise] um ... important defense ... to ... to guard the room but you know one of the times they got lit up was he couldn't guard the martyr soldiers in the post\nBut one of the other things hurting them is when you have to start or suspended its going

and now you got all these you know you get this is a good thing about the red Sox invading Dodger Stadium is there are also polite and none of them are arrogant at all [laughter] so that that many people use\nThat we all the time they're the worst fans are and I used to always say you know what they're Yankee fans and then the red Sox won and then it'll change\nIt was like man you guys used to be so nice 'cause you guys are never one and then all of a sudden you guys win and you're not so nice anymore what happened to that nice that you guys used to have to be like a you know their boss and their farm but and you got to understand they be all over and then as soon as the red Sox won ... completely changed\nAnd now it's just they they went all the time now it's just a given either patriot you're going to win and the red Sox are going to win\nBut the the patriots were bad for a long time and the red Sox were worse or even longer it's hardly explains that I Know like trust me this is like the when the same ones who play like you know it was like ten years ago they used to wear ... paper bags over their head like no way like yeah the same sort of the saints were what the browns have been the last five years but they were that way for twenty five years\nRight you're right I'm In the red Sox were like that forever um so yeah it's amazing how certain\nPeople come and act like the cubs that come through the same way now the cubs are America's darling I mean they they they when they once they won\nMean man it's like everyone just seems that whenever you're now but it's not that easy especially in baseball but it it is good for the game though I think I think it's good for the red Sox to be good it's good for the Yankees to be good I Know people will get tired of seeing them but man people tune in to watch those series\nWhat's a ... you mentioned that the Fenway tricky what's Dodger Stadium like\nVery fair or not they're not a not a great place to hit the games are five o'clock that shows are going to be um it's very fair and marine layer there as you know being out in LA\nIt can be a little difficult to get the ball out of the art but um it is very fair it's it's definitely one of the most fair ballparks for a pitcher in all of baseball and with the the the game trending towards ... home runs Dodger Stadium\nIs very fair and gives a home run that should be home runs and hopefully the people arrive on time is Dodger Stadium has a reputation guy showing up a little bit later the fans\nUm there'll be out in full force and there'll be loud and there'll be behind their team but I understand it always a fun place 'cause you know it's going to be Seventy and sunny every game\nSo so a very fair to people who don't you don't know the baseball and go that's like like new Yankee Stadium where you hit a little digging up in the air and rights center and it goes out that that's the odds that have been very fair right I'm I'm just trying to hear\nVery fair I mean do you have to hit a home run at all I'm actually to be honest with you I think that if anything Dodger Stadium is a pitcher's part over not quite to the fact that like a TNT up in San Fran as a pitcher's part but yeah it is it definitely leaned more towards pitching than it does towards headed\nAJ great stuff to look forward to seeing you on Fox this upcoming weekend thanks so much

I Want to coach this guy like this guy whatever\nBut he was he was really well liked to ESPN so he had a lifetime appointment that's a that's a calling Monday Night football games is when you're John gr heat a long term contract he was good in love it because you like working with ... better than McDonalds so it wasn't perfect\nBut he could have he could have changed the play by play guy simply by saying I'll stay if you change that play got play by play\nGuy that would have happened\nSo it had to be a long term deal and I think additionally he thought that he was going to clean house and do things his way do I think he thought to their car was in his type of guy no I I think anybody who meets their car like their car your initial meeting as men do I love this guy\nBut\nHe lacks something that group and doesn't like that some guys and the team doesn't like there there's something missing right now that doesn't mean that he's totally out on him but it feels like it's training that way and I think that interception against ah against the dolphins was\nMassive massive you know you got a coach is um\nYou gotta you have a coach's\nFirst when kind of in your hands and you know you feel like it's a coach England based upon the plays they ran in the first Fifteen and ... you know you're throwing untimely interceptions not needed that's gonna irritate anybody\nSo there's some lack of buying their do I think it was ... initial plan to get rid of anybody everybody no but I I I think he knew that was a possibility and\nThey they they had to miss understand or not evaluate the cat properly because they they couldn't make the ... thing work but and so how long will it\nTake to get back to like playoff level and contention just because and then the NBA the idea that when you you tank and you try to build for the future you know it takes one maybe two players and it's like boom you're there again but yeah NFL it's not\nThat's not that's not necessarily true it hasn't been you're not tanking you're there unless you land a free agent but in terms of tanking and getting graphics it takes several years several years I Would say it will take him two years\n\nI just mean from the NBA's perspective individual players are much more impactful and with the NFL when you strip it down it's really hard to get back to that level Mm\nYeah yes and no yes and no I mean like look if you have a good if you have the right quarterback it's dot\nAndrew Luck it wasn't you know that they were immediately much better um it a lot of it comes down to if you get the right quarterback

of Michael panics for the year with a knee injury and the goal for his academic said suffered an internal midsection injury last week and it's still uncertain if there'll be able to play Minnesota leader theories all time thirty eight to thirty to three I built Pollak this is the Big Ten today [noise]\nBest batters in the world and very few of them are match up guys you know a guy like a great Cosell that will say oh look\nThey're pressing at the corner that's going to be a problem against this type of receiver you don't hear that which makes me think that's where there's some value 'cause the marketplace the batters aren't thinking about it that way and in this case it's a simple acts as a nose handicap\nSeattle changed your mentality about running the ball and since they did that's become the focus their running the ball as well as any team in the NFL or at least as much if not more\nOn the other hand opponents yards per Raasch five point three for the line's worst in the NFL so just simple handicap you got a team that really wants to run the ball against a team that can't stop the run\nIf I'm getting three that means these are supposed to be even teams out take Seattle\nSo that happen with a Baltimore has never had before just ducking ... extra point and they lose a game that should have gone to overtime they travel on the road take on the Carolina Panthers who after losing to Washington tour around the road and beat Philadelphia make heads or tails of the Panthers for me as home dogs\nSo let me tell you quickly there was a contest you were in Vegas it's called the super contest there was a Fifteen hundred dollar version and five thousand dollar version winner take all we entered the five thousand dollar version\nWe were two games out of first place last week when three one on one now are one and a half games out\nBut our loser was the ravens so you want to talk about the agony an axe to see a betting now I Will say that we did have the giants so we got lucky there on Monday so it happens I think that game is very telling\nAbout this line there's a sense of oh the ravens are going to bounce back and that was a coin flip game that they lost\nBut boy who to the ravens play next week the Pittsburgh Steelers so if there's ever sort of a sandwich spot where you have an NFC game you just lost a ... a tough game and now you got Pittsburgh next week and you got the Panthers I guess they were lucky to beat the eagles\nBut let's do the old six point home field flip ravens favorite by two as you said that if this game were in Baltimore Ravens will be favored by eight does that sound right to you know what they'd be favored\nBy a guess three is is a neutral site is ... you know that that seems like too much\nAnd to me that's a sign this is an example where I get to the Carolinas been kind of lucky this year in Vegas is not high on them I just think it's an overreaction I'm taking the two at home with the Panthers\nPeople are bailing on the Jacksonville Jaguars left and right teams seem to quit defensively after the ... ah wasn't holding up their end of the bargain Philadelphia comes in playing better football we thought but then they lose the Carolina Panthers at home\nAnd it Carolina okay I guess that's the same question there are three point favorites at home and said the nine ... on the roads they'd be nine point favorites nine point favorites if it was at home\nRemember this was a tricky one this is in London a scale as you remember so I said this is pretty much even you could actually meanings of home field but you could give Jacksonville point\nBecause they do play this trip every year and that is an advantage so saying that the the eagles are about three and a half points better than the jak which I think is true I like the eagles listen by definition\nExpectation is the spread that's what's supposed to happen Jacksonville the last three games have fallen short of expectation net\nSixty six points wow how the heck can you fall short of expectation sixty six points\nI mean so it really is a situation where you could say oh they're going to bounce back maybe or maybe there's some problem in that locker room we have no idea about and we started seeing a little bit of that where when you have\nTeammates saying oh sit down to start or we went ... quarterback you know you're in trouble I think an endless and let me speak from experience my dad was a coal miner he's retired\nI Want says or I have one sister drove across the country as a kid in the eighties you know when there's arguments in the family but you're in the back seat of the station wagon sure for about ten hours what happened to those arguments get more intense I think is the worst time Jacksonville to take a stressful trip I like the eagles\nAnd we'll see who gets back on the plane capital in the greyhound bringing back maybe on a post back\nFrom London RJ belly show is after hours pregame dot com is the website or go to ... or

this week in rock and roll history I start off back in Nineteen sixty six where the Supremes became the first female group to have a number one album on the U.S charged with a Supreme they'll go go knocking the Beatles revolver from the top of the sharks\nAlso this week in Nineteen sixty six the beach boys good vibrations made its debut on the U.S singles charged written by Brian Wilson and my love the track was recorded over six weeks in four different Los Angeles studios\nThe cost of over sixteen thousand dollars a recording engineer would later say that the last take sounded exactly like the first six weeks earlier this week in Nineteen Seventy six Bob Seeger releases his ninth studio album\nConsidering the style he plays the two ACL injuries he's had in the beating he's taken like what's your assessment of Shon watching and what the likely is it that he would stand this season considering the injuries and the durability\nWell it's a great question and uh you know we are seeing quarterbacks run the football more or design runs with the quarterbacks and then we've ever seen before or or the leaks not protecting these guys\nAs a as as much as as they once did and and yet I still believe that you got to be real careful when you're when when a guy's absorbing the amount of hits that\nSomeone like to Sean watching as taking it's already taken a toll uh like you said you take a bus to last week's game because he's got a broken river a punctured long and and you know everything else so um he is tough you're right but he's taken way too many hits some of that as the office of wind is really struggled but says own doing\nThat he's just held the ball and you know he needs to be a little bit better and knowing when to get rid of it and not getting hit as much a but if he continues get hit the way that he has\nYou know then you start saying he's going to have a real hard time they get it through the season and and I don't think he's back to where it was last year prior to ... you know I'm coming off to me like you said but then also just pointing through a great deal of pain but what a talented he is and I'm excited about watching them play tonight\nI'm excited to see you break him down lasting mark Cooper traded to the Dallas Cowboys you know everybody has the cowboys question does is he enough does he fixed the ... which at times has been an app causing Jason geared to be a little bit more conservative than I think even ... wants to be\nWell I think he's he's got to help them and in in some way I mean you take a guy with his abilities\nUh it stands to reason that there'll be better with him but I don't think it's just a situation where you put him in and all of a sudden you're often role and I you know it's different than when Chicago brings in ... and you're bringing a pass rush or you're bringing a running back and and those positions and a lot of ways are kind of plug and play and\nThat's not the case with wide receiver I I've had receiver so I've spent very little time with who immediately you're on the same page and and they they run routes are very quarterback friendly and I've had other savers who I've spent a lot of time with an entire off season in pre season and you never feel like you're on the same page and just because of the way they do things so I I don't know how that\nAnd if you're not gonna work out they do have a pie week this week\nBut I don't know how it's going to work out over the course of the season between between the index but there there are more problems with that\nWith that often simply saying hey we need a number one though too wide receiver I\nYou know the office that line has not been you know it's been set but they're not what they were a couple of years ago some of that Travis rhetoric not plan but even the others who have been in the lineup for not flying at the same level\nAnd that's been taken a lot of pressure and and then also a when they've had the protection of guys have been open and you know maybe ... ... for oh so there there's a lot of variables in this I'm a little hesitant to say that\nThat I'm Ari Cooper's presence is going to change what they've

it's a decisive indicative test I that's what a litmus test is that like this is who they are\nLike a litmus test is usually I mean should have been the spurs\nNormally a playoff team one that's playing without a point guard right now but they do have veterans and their exceptionally well coached and they had to Marlboros and they got the Marcus Aldrich like that's a good litmus test\nAnd I I I don't think they failed because they should have won the game in overtime they could have lost the game and regulation so if it was a pass fail they would have failed but if it's a a through ... grade they probably get a probably get to see\nMaybe a C. plus because they did it without Rondo and they did it without granting\nThe sons are no litmus test they just are not there one of the worst defensive teams in the ... in the NBA\nThey gave up Seventy six points Seventy six points in the first at it it seems\nSo LeBron James is first when as in LA Laker comes on the road in very on Lake or like uniforms\nIn there the normal a road purple which used to be called liquor blew some people like myself so called liquor blue but they put in some black stripe with little yellow on the side and they went like all read show with the Laker uniforms with the exception of that black stripe anyway\nThey go on the road and they get a win\nAnd you should feel good about it if you're a Laker fan if you're a LeBron fan still doesn't shoot the three well but he had Seventeen and seven at the half he didn't play the fourth quarter and\nAnd they play today and they play today so if you now if you look at uh some of the defensive numbers\nYou know Phoenix has been just abysmal I mean really ridiculously bad\nThe clippers have been tremendous by the way Phoenix has the they're twenty eighth in the ... percent as defense at forty nine point three should be pointed out to San Antonio remarkably is actually the worst that one's a surprising\nUm guarding the three there in the bottom ten the league there in the bottom five bottom ten in every statistical category defensively\nWhereas the Lakers are actually quite good defender three\nBut I wouldn't use last night as litmus test 'cause you're taking on a team with the twenty fourth most points allowed in the NBA twenty eighth worst in point differential twenty ninth worst twenty eight tied for twenty ninth with a phone opponents yoga percentage\nAnd so while Alonzo ball looked tremendous last night as good as you looked at all like your uniform last time he looks good last year against Phoenix yeah twenty nine\nSo I point is not that I'm selling Lakers stock around buying Laker stock but they did what they were supposed to do and they did it on the offensive and better than they should have defensively they let their guard down 'cause they're up so big and it was so easy\nBut it was the sons of team that fired their coach last year in the first week of the season and fired the general manager of the week before the season this year they're a mess and they look like in last night not all it missed us", "show_name": "The Doug Gottlieb Show", "year": "2018", "city": "Iowa City", "day": "25"}
