end up end up in the studio and go stand that [noise] oh man I'm\nRight everybody didn't\nPlay ball over there and even that don't really know that it's come to jog around the same\nDay [laughter]\n[noise] okay by the way there's a guy also standing up outside the studio I thought he was clapping it's a homeless man taking a leap on my mind that LA is on the highway\nThat was the other day right yeah look at that plane up over on the highway all yeah by the way that guy the idiot landed the plane I'm a one on one out here that guy should have to pay for my gas and my insurance for the next day I knew a lot Pedro that guy's a\nMoron [noise] [noise] I don't know if you realize that the Lakers beat the nuggets die on\nTheir back there\n\nNow let me ask you this was the reaction to the Lakers beating the ... was it worse than when they won the\nSummer league titles were pouring aqua feed on each other\n[laughter] it's a very good very good comparison I think last night's\nWas worse for the simple fact of were five games into the regular season\nAnd the Lakers and their fan base we're celebrating no disrespect to the nugget that's who were on beaten\nBut they were celebrating a seven point win over Denver me because it also came on the heels of the win at Phoenix\nThat's where that is where Lakers basketball has been as of late so this proud franchise with their what Seventeen titles yelled at his job you're the fans\nSeventeen hundred and ten a hundred or a high or whatever it is the point being is how much does you want [laughter] John's getting his soccer line of [laughter] just off ... off all that is\nWhat it is who's going to bat eight [laughter] the the uh the Lakers are celebrated their second one of the season against the luggage on October twenty fifth\nThat tells you at least some early joined us was okay maybe we're starting to turn this around like this is\nToby was court said it was a big deal brown was doing his thing I Do think the Lakers will be better and and I do think the Lakers and the next couple of years we'll be contending for the western conference crown and it may be an MBA crowd\nBut last night was amazing to see the energy and excitement over a regular season when on October twenty fifth against Denver\nLook I poke fun at at people that go to ... and it's all ingest it is to me Boston some balls um I mean if you if you get excited and want to dress up like he man I'm at every June or whatever it is and go to ... in San Diego and pass up all the beautiful beaches he can have somebody autograph one of your\nAh your action figures that you bought it the toys are us close out that's fine you go do what you got to do I'm not here to judge\nAnybody and I don't want to make fun of Laker fans all the way by celebrating the went over the nuggets but let me ask you this than if the Dodgers were up to oh in the world series would they be this excited about the LA Lakers\nNow yeah yeah you're probably right I'd I'd be the Dodgers city they're so desperate for something to rally around they they've got to have something to rally around and so they get excited over this stuff and it's great to have him abroad in LA and there's good storylines there and it's a lot of fun\nBut just the idea that that's where this organization is that that's where the franchise has fallen that a regular season win over the nuggets to move to two and three on the air is now a big deal for the like\nPeople were calling this a statement when because you were able to stop the\nNickel a joke it's trained [laughter]\nAbout what ... that's that's what we call the statement every now and the NBA look he's a really good\nCenter but let's be real here this is the the Lakers getting their head on this or the worst defensive team in the western comfort All right so you've got that ... at least you've got the update and the entire MBA so\nI Do so they they're giving up the most part is\nThat other deep enough to get the ah by the way is um [noise] his mock\nMood Abdul ... ... and the big three All right you got to be out there no that's\nNot up to speed on my uh my ...\nWhat about uh Rodney Rogers yeah ride the riders left handed yup yup ... statement went over the sonics that's kind of where these New Jersey is kind of took a turn that kind of took that bb blew out of it and tried to go to the mid nineties no doubt that there's going to be good Denver is going to make the playoffs\nWhat what all getting our back on track the weirdest daylight dire lies beneath are they kidding you I I don't think that it would be a smart move I as I said no but I'm going to change my mind on this you don't want to join us because on Monday [noise]\nFor an hour I'm this exact show ripping Jason Garrett to shreds you mentioned the Texans game with the cowboy yeah let's talk about the the Redskins game this past Sunday and how Dallas you split it so conservatively ended up losing on that field goal that hit the upper right the Jason Garrett\nHe that he was getting immediately disappeared on the front office says oh my beer we're going to give up a first round pick ... no one talked about Jason Garrett edits issues anymore so it would be so like the cowboys to resign I'm already Cooper\nWell he's got to justify his pick right he's got you got to justify the trade right so of course they're going to resign and because he's got to make it seem like that's the guy we identified\nAll long of course we are good with this this man we're going to give them a contract extension a hundred percent and and look it's not everybody does that if you over pay for something that you want to get the most you can possibly get for it and I and and we all know that if you you'll you sometimes you buy a new coach\nIt could be eighty three degrees out and you're going to wear that because you just bought it you do not care and it just so Jason Garrett he's going to wear this code out and even if he knows he's not getting what he should probably get production wise from Ari Cooper you still going to maintain his love for ... for his loyal guy and he's going to\nGo with the long term extension for could [noise]\nLike I got a hair cut yesterday and I got this shit on my forehead that you're going to wear a hat today but no I don't even know yeah yeah of course you know I haven't gotten that far up yet [laughter] around here are All right Rob what are we got for like ... seconds number two [laughter]\nYou guys mentioned this earlier with John middle off we have a rematch of the NFC the original playoff game between things in the Vikings this Sunday do the same get revenge for the Minneapolis Miracle [noise]\nUh no I like the way that the bike yeah mine right now I I really do I think I\nMinnesota's at home the defense teams have come around I Know John didn't like that Jay bureaus was out but I think that there'll be able to keep the change running game and check and then in the ... the wide receiving do all that you've gotten Minnesota with the amazing season the ones having in direct the Vikings\nUm I you know the saints are good too I don't feel like the saints have won five in a row and they're under the radar\nBecause I think we made more of a deal about Drew Brees breaking the record and getting a piece of notebook paper after he broke the record on Monday Night football which I'm Still trying to figure out at least get the guy a peachy folder or ... you give them a blank piece of a notebook paper\nUm that I feel like they've been under the radar but Minnesota to their credit fit fat Thursday night last of the rams and you can say whatever you want about a current cousins and he's not a top tier quarterback he's been unbelievable this year he's still turns up all over too much but look at his numbers look at the way he plays in a shootout game he went ... he went\nA attach for tat with Aaron Rodgers inland both field I think he's been a great signing I liked the Vikings on Sunday night\nWe got time for one more Ralph game three of the world series is tonight games foreign fives scheduled for Saturday and Sunday the question is will the world series extend beyond this weekend\nAnd well we have\nIt gave baseball on Tuesday in Washington\nYou wanna go first on this yeah no shot\nUp already done so down you can blame ... Roberts all you want bottom line the red Sox who\nJust a better team than the Dodgers period end of story stop pointing fingers Dave Roberts and point the comeback of yourself and say why did I go out and buy that ... Jersey put it on the shelf it's a rap after this weekend [noise]\nI like walk or ... or ... ... ...\n... the idea of John the rap single the signal and then I just started to talk for I like walk her view alerts that I I think that the Dodgers do win tonight whether they win Saturday or Sunday that something to be seen\nA will Baker maybe you'll get his biggest when as a pro coming up on Sunday are you going to tell us next then we will tell you the next year and the ...
