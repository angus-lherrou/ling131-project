been doing all these parachutes\nWhat what about Jared golf has impressed you\nBecause I mean the guy was such a quiet mind confident um you know it makes every go it's best to watch uh playing with them in all he does it it'd be better day and then now\nI'm In the office of line it's for the most part he's been able to step into throws go through his progression Z like I think I think that because you guys have you ... so many incredible weapons or for him to throw to end his numbers I Do kind of feel like the offensive line and their dominance their ability to protect him\nKind of gets under rate is is that fair\nUh I I mean from the standpoint\nWe there on a rate that you know we know we can do a lot of things that we're doing a when I play the from office on line the past couple of weeks or you know you've got special ... um they just come to work every day within this bill and they go after and so having those guys definitely makes a lot of things are easier so\nBranding cooked joining us on the Doug ... show on Fox Sports radio you guys had the weekend off cause that Thursday his he had the Thursday game in your mind what is going to allow the rams left he's gotten off the hot starts before but now the league watches film starts to adjust to you what do you think you guys have to do to continue to improve\nYou know it was gonna say that they would just continue to focus on ourselves not about the politics about what we do and then you have great have you know great days and be there so so\nAs long as we continue to focus on what we are in\nTheir parents get here and let the outside and we'd outside noise I think we'll be get far\nYeah but I mean there's got to be something something to work on other than ... other than kind of all the just take care of ourselves like anything specific that you watch on TV like man this has got to do this better because I've been to a Super Bowl I Know what to say\nWell if it was definitely wouldn't be fair in Africa that are now\nA fair enough um Seahawks week now last year I Know you weren't part of this team but last year they went up and they just kick kick the hell out of the sea hawks and they just and the Seahawks head terrorizes division but the reins of always played them close even back when they play conservative football\nWhat's it like around the facility when it's Seahawks week is it a different week is it like when you're in New Orleans with the with the falcons was it like when you're in New England when you know you when you have the the ravens one of these elite teams what's it like sea hawks week ranch facility\nHuh I think you know I'm ... yeah I think you hit your head as one of those weeks that you know you're gonna be kinda tough football team especially in a division\nOr whether it's made a lot of history you know you can use to set up and know that is going to be along the side of the stuff that\nYeah and three consecutive game right three consecutive games away from home that's kind of a unique that's like a unique set of a set of circumstances you being a veteran in that in that group I'm a you know how different do you think it's going to be for your often because you know defensive lines like when you go to Denver\nOr in two weeks they got a quick or get off how much does that change how you guys approach things\n[noise] you know I think is one of the things that uh you know we ... you know we can practice must have been ... knows that food was going to be a two kinds as loud\nAs fracking which is kind of a focus um I think it's going to help with the one of those things right are going to set a thought the I have some good with\nWhat's McVeigh really like\nI think if we can get a guy that are very energized come to work every day I'm you know what eight sided mine I very special very special close um no I like to go to another player out there oh how high ... or ... you know throughout practical no game\nLast thinking most important thing who in white grams uniforms or blue and yellow rams uniforms if they ask you to choose which would have been [laughter]\nOh [noise] you know I'll have to go to the fans for that what they want to\nDo what makes you feel more clean what what makes them more clean\nAdmirable yellow special but then again you know that little white is well I think that'd be one of those ... and that's just in the spirit\nHey I Know how important is for you to to blow people away within this off as you've been doing it so far continue helping success said travel to Seattle thinks joined us on Fox Sports radio

crazy popular and the team just wasn't Georgia frontier he wasn't just wasn't below up\nAnd I didn't I really didn't like the blue and yellow uniforms and so I like the blue and white kind of they were like the old goals that that one that that the St Louis fans broken but when they came out Thursday night and the blue and yellow I was like\nThose are really dope those uh that that's yeah I'm
