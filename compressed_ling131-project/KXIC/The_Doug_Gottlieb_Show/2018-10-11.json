all kinds of the\nFan base but uh who\nElse would you rather have right I mean who else would you take you'd have to start looking somewhere in the Michigan community one would think or what would you do just go completely outside and start from scratch and I think so\nI I just think that he hasn't been able to prove that he can't win the big game he won't get us to where we need to be\nWell which it's a quarterback driven sport let's see if she Paterson can get it done\nUnder the lights and the big house Ross thanks for calling back call back what's we might convince very whenever I'm this is fun the three words to add\nA nice little spice cherry on top to the Jimmy butler Sunday that we've all been served as sports fans the three words players only meeting that is a report according to a what a ... he\nCalled the ... players only meeting he's called it from the athletic Jimmy Butler called the players only meeting today airing his feelings toward situation in management per week sources butler express the players he would compete with them as science pointing Tim staying with the franchise into the regular season\n[laughter] until until February trading deadline well I mean

very\nY'all don't have what takes inside\nAnd I'm going to start barking at you in practice so won't that be fun I don't know if anyone else to talk on this meeting I Wonder what I Do not know Carl

none of that\nTo the media none of it yeah I just you know working out some things get ready for the season she yeah Jimmy Butler came in and totally towards the place cursed me out crushed up general manager totally verbal undress Carl Anthony towns and pumped him other than that\nJust regular practice at one time I mean Rachel in town still I assume so she can she finally back into jumped today

line\nI I've no idea but I made up my on lock is lock it away maybe I Will throw at twenty yards and unless you're telling me unless you're telling me I'm allowed to go Dallas over Jacksonville isn't unlock is locked going because I feel that one big time you can do both you can do to to unlock\nThe loser by the way in tonight's game is in last place in the ... the defending world champs with Carson went back for three and he would be in the cellar and I think that happens because the giants cannot cannot have one in five start they cannot look\nLife in the face I think after that I think

I did that was that my outlined voice or there was an official meeting her to cause that was the out loud voice Doug\nYeah yeah I that's what I thought too I'm\nStill let let's let's bringing out for blue course that running back for the Houston Texans in that one too in a row to absolute nail biter is right like there is no overtime game you know it's going to be the Texans he joined us in the dugout show on Fox Sports radio um where where were you when the coasts decided to go for it [noise]\nYup alpha where were you when the colds decided to go for it [noise]\n... yeah [laughter]\nI mean we were you sitting there going like are you ... I mean what was the reaction you're sitting there watching I'm helmet on probably what what was what was your reaction [noise] uh\nOr a [noise]\nRamos so and then I Know you have to go tell us no I'm not um\nThat that was a horrible okay so I I don't know how many people remember rate the rate ... Ruth story a but\nHis um his ex wife or his his his estranged girlfriend or a wife I Can't was his wife\nShe was pregnant and um he had he hired two guys to kill her like run or off the road and he was following them as they did it right isn't that just isn't that what happened I'm trying to remember the exact story yeah I I Can't remember if he was\nFollowing or not but it was his girlfriend and then they pulled up in a vehicle and had it blocked than she can go anywhere\nI Believe they yeah shooter or did they yeah yeah yeah because she really she meant right she died she gave birth to the child who's now with special needs child\nAnd you know he got how many years in jail over Seventeen just yeah between Seventeen and a half or so okay so what I don't is a hard one to someone like that ever deserve to get out of jail\nWhen you when you when you do that right\nAnd it was it was really about the fact that she was suing him for child support wasn't then I mean it was like there's\nWays in which you can react in and if someone gets pregnant and you can overreact and like we have somebody killed\nAnd then\nAnd yeah and then at the end and that and then the child has done a irreparable mental harm even though he ultimately survived\nYeah from those actions yeah there's reports that group wants to have a relationship with the sun which\nAnd I ... and then like the the other party he was on the loose and he was hiding in saying the trunk of a car when police ultimately\nFound him right um he was spared the death penalty\nAnd he was found not guilty of first degree murder\nSo he's found guilty of conspiracy to commit murder or shooting into an occupied vehicle\nAnd using an instrument destroyed unborn child who sends to Eighteen to twenty four years in prison\nI don't like\nThat that's really that's a hard one writes like yeah I mean I guess this is when we all we hear about those sentences being handed out we were always saying like well he's going to jail and you know but he was a young man when he went to jail now he's out in the street\nI don't know\nI'm OK never gets out I Know he's going to get out but the idea that he legally he can have some sort of relationship with the child who we tried to have killed I don't know\n... and and just to clarify the he was had her first she was following in the vehicle and then he stopped and then the vehicle pulled up I'm alongside of her there was a mother vehicle behind her that ended up during the shooting\nYes yeah um and he was on I think he was on the phone with with the with the for the vehicle that was following like yeah\nAnd this was I was still in college at the time and then of course he was he was on the lam and he tried to flee and they had like he had like four thousand dollars in cash in a bottle in urine that he was like ... and he was in the he was in the trunk\nOf a car that's another part of a dog just because as you said you're in college I was in you know around the same time as well and all of a sudden now you're to this point we're all at this point in our lives where we remember it\nIt's still fresh in our minds if you will where it's you're like oh wow now that sentences entirely over just for that that's what I find it so striking so when you say Disney's deserve to stay a jail for this whole time\nA are likely to agree with that I Do agree with that in the it seems so short doesn't it because it's just so I mean it is Seventeen years but it just it seems so short because it's also a story that we followed at that time\nYes yes destroys your when it's really been a long time yeah we're actually ... like you know Nineteen years or Eighteen years whatever in jail I mean he's been in jail for Nineteen years\nUm that's a hard one\nThat's really how I'm Glad I'm not a ... that's one of those ones that I'm Glad I'm not a judge and I'm Glad I don't set down these penalties because even though you're found not guilty of something you you you know that he set it up and\nBe a no I don't know\nDoug I show Fox Sports radio ... this ah yeah there's nothing good comes from that store like last week I said that the Steelers falcons felt like a a must win game\nAnd obviously if you're the giants you lose this game you're you're one in five on the season\nAnd remember that ... it's not just that you had faith in Eli Manning and that's why you drafted sake one Barclay you honestly thought your team could win it last year you didn't just lose LBJ and you're off into line was a mess you lost all your wide receivers\nYou had no running game you had no offensive line you bring your GM you bring your coach and you try the short term fix\nAnd thinking hey our window is still open one in five and the window for the season feels pretty closed I like right like this division is struggling I the red skins had the Redskins played had a week off and then played on Monday Night say plenty of time to repair and they looked\nCompletely unprepared for the states\nI mean through British jobs back those debts down first time he lets apply right like when you didn't know\n... the Redskins aren't good the cowboys having shown the ability to pull away from anybody every even the games they one has been an absolute struggle\nAnd the eagles have been disappointed two and three right now but instead of we always look at the giants right maybe it's because New York maybe it's 'cause there'll be J maybe it's because of their drafting second they drive to take one Barclay has anyone thought what if the possibility of the eagles\nLosing that many thought about that what happens if the eagles lose\nSee here here's the thing about locker rooms like the eagles is all of\nThat hey we're going to have fun hey we're going to do it our way hey we're going to talk a little bit of trash this this a little bit like Seattle and outlook Seattle's dominance lasted a lot longer the eagles had one good year\nYear before you know they got up to a good start but then uh they were awful at the end of the season\nRemember this is the defending Super Bowl champions they play the giants on the road if they were to lose now they do have three home\nGames in a row but if you're a two and four and you've got the Panthers and I think the pain is a pretty\nGood I don't think they're great and I think they have to win in meat grinder fashioned they're pretty good then you got the jaguars coming in I think everybody respects what they have defensively and they've been banged up and wide receiver then you get the cowboys you'd have to go to the saints\nYou still have to go to the rams steps to go to the Redskins does it go the cowboys\nI guess anyone thought of the possibility what happens with the Philadelphia Eagles are two and four just start this year with the Panthers coming it\n\nDon't get me wrong I think the giants are in worse shape obviously if they're one in five in that same division and the giants would then have losses to the cowboys\nAnd the eagles in division\nAnd still have road games upcoming in Philadelphia\nBut uh\nBut you look at the Philadelphia Eagles and I like I I feel like tonight is maybe not must win for the eagles but boy that locker room could very easily fish or a little bit if they're too in for if you lose to the New York giants\n\nYou know shot with the the cowboys and the second the cowboys lose to the Texans there's questions about Jason Garrett's job status and there's you know oh del back from junior or was already questioning the giants\nI mean I I I understand that there's ... of adversity in anybody's season and the eagles could overcome that in adversity but you don't want to be two and four and then lose to the giants this year when the season was still the meteor schedule to come\n\nSo if you want to go call it a must win game or a you'd be wise to win game that's great I just I think we're looking at the giants and not paying attention at all to the possibility of\nEgos losing his game two and four and still a very difficult schedule the cup hey Heisman a Heisman Trophy candidate plant hurt the season find out who next\nThis is the dung godly show on Fox Sports radio\n[noise] see I'm Out in the postseason as Largo rock star I Am Sam pregnant isn't high in the\nWe've got you covered\nFox Sports radio\nHey sports fans it's time to get in on the action

me during the season [noise]\nKnowledge Alabama quarter back to a tongue about law he\nSprained me according to mix said banned them that's the reason to as a knee brace however it hasn't affected human games obviously also really has it affected him in practice but they've been revealing the injury yesterday\n[noise] to me\nThat I don't really I mean it's not that I'm not sympathetic I also think this is one of the reasons you know one you keep two quarterbacks in case one gets hurt but also you motivate that quarterback to\nHurt or injured does if you're injured you go there you go into the room what are your hair you can get back out there and lead our team you're injured jailing can come in and take some wraps remarkably he's heard not injured\nGuests you Doug is looking at tax laws that would allow his team to play more games in London\nA I'm going to go with the um [noise]\nUh what's his name ... a shot ... yes\nThe jaguars older according to the daily mail looking into what the tax laws are in may be wanting to have his team play more than just one game in London yet to keep the franchise base in Jacksonville\nBecause of tax purposes higher taxes playing in London or in London so we'd rather keep the human Florida same thing with players who would be maybe playing in multiple games there but that's what ...\nAnd when I get a lot I like it I mean I'm sure Jacksonville doesn't love it in terms of how many times they use their stadium ... and all of that is just a an incredible wellspring for the local economy\nBut I'm like this happens and I mean in the United states a lot of businesses are based in Delaware does anybody actually live in Delaware like no you you it's for tax purposes um in in Nevada others business based in Nevada may have to spend more than half of the year\nSo what's happened three hundred and sixty five anybody want to do that math it's a hundred and eighty three eighty three it's been a hundred and eighty four nights a three hundred and four nights in Nevada in order to to make it work [noise] so uh the tax purposes as I look I was my first team I was supposed to play on [noise]\nIn Europe we trained in Italy and our home games or in St Petersburg Russia [noise]\nSo [noise] so yeah [noise] just to fill Jeanie Buss she needed to fire Mitch cub jak ... brother ... boss she wanted the Lakers decided the brawn James [noise] rich Paul\nKobe Bryant yes that's according to a piece in the athletic by Sam a mixing that koby sat down with Jeanie and twenty seven genes said hey you need to clean house if you want to have any hope of LeBron coming to LA [noise]\nI I Believe it I I think he liked Mitch but you know they just didn't do a good job what's interesting watching the Lakers play last night they have very good debt much better athleticism across the board or the young players in the old but I don't think they're a great team now the top three the top three team or in the west and I don't think it's particularly close [noise] um [noise]\nBut if you look at that roster I think there's I think only ranging from [noise]\nThing only Britain Ingram was from the Mitch kept jak era so they've they've turned over that Ross are in short order\nGesture Doug will be able to buy tickets to watch tiger and fills pay per view match play event Thanksgiving weekend in Vegas [noise] all of us\nNone of us

pay per view aspect of it [noise] there is a chance that I'll be going to that event on print it out All right and I guess you on the cruise dog was was kicked out of class [noise]\nOnce was kicked out of class group\n[noise] ... um [noise] well\nI think he's had a class I'm going to go with music yes\nToo much talking Doug [noise] couldn't keep my mouth shut and yeah that happens to have to

that ... will be their game one starting pitcher for the national league championship series tomorrow night in Milwaukee against the Dodgers the Dodgers have previously announced the crucial would get to start in the game\nMean from Les beyond bell too you know pick talented running back who gets out to Todd girlie that's always been a huge mismatch it has to be less of a mismatch than it used to be that it's not any\nDifferent than the NBA right that you make two choices that center you either play small ball\nOf you know this but a BJ Tucker started Center for the Houston Rockets or last preseason game PJ Tucker\nI was ironic about PJ talking when he came out of Texas at like six foot four is a powerful where people said he'd beat too small he'd have to be to guard with three when it got to the NBA instead now he's playing five it's worth the other way\nYou make a decision the NBA or do you play small ball and use a a a guard forward as your center and you use his toughness and versatility and hopefully a shooting the stretch out the defense or or\nYou put a big shot blocker in there that's a ridiculous athlete and he doesn't switch you just kind of hangs around the basket\nKnowing you're going to give up some open three point shots but you're gonna give up your shots at the rent\nI look I I think we all look at it you know linear fashion look at well quarterback and wide receiver\nDefense is obviously know that you got to invest in defense of a defensive ends and pressure on the pastor and that that's what made the gave the eagles first in the wind over the last ... but also allowed them to be dominant last year\nThe reason they're cutters the head coach at the expense of loving Smith is because the organization viewed him as\nIs often said his coaching as an important component\nIngenious way instance early success so\nAh let's see if he's changed by this bad experience that he's had a I think most people would question\nOf whether that's likely to change behavior that's existed for very long time with this particular player a I'm not surprised is certainly see the box\nGo out and use him as a centerpiece of their marketing campaign I think they want to reinforce their relationship with him\nOr you know it's going to cost Twenty one million dollars to have him on the roster next year they've already committed to that so I don't really think it's a surprise I think it'll be interesting to see if he can pacify a and use Mike Evans and Sean Jackson or as well as a riot fitzpatrick did the first three games of the year\nYeah and it was it said said definitely fascinating and interesting stuff last thing game of the week is Monday Night football I assume you Sunday Night Football Kansas City taking on New England\nUm you go back a couple of weeks ago and I think all of us we didn't want to hit that panic button were but we were tempted to do sell especially watching him in Jacksonville after losing to lions as well like who'll\nHum heavy fix everything or is it simply a matter of who they play\n[noise] well I think it was on an upswing just because you know now of what this is Josh ... third third week with the team Rob Gronkowski is healthy again they got Julian Edelman back last week or so I think there's an expectation that often simply they should have proof from this point forward\nA bar anymore injuries but this this is a huge game for them because they're model for getting to the super bowl has bent to dominate the AFC East\nOr you know have the best record in in the AFC get home division round game and then host the championship game and go to the super bowl [noise] uh that's the way they've always done it while if they lose or to Kansas City this week\nThen they'll effectively be four games behind the chiefs in the race for the number one seed long time you know in the future though it is\nAnd you know Patrick my homes will a present a different\nDifferent the player for them to defend themselves against but a bill belch acts that great success only making a seventh NFL start a bell checks tenant do against a quarter backs started fewer than ten games against him so\nUh it's a real interesting match up uh and and real pivotal in terms of how to mentally or the playoffs where they might be bought one of those games like the play whether it's a new Englander Kansas City at\nThe at

[noise]\nDidn't have you been following now some of what's going to come in on a going\nOut on Twitter yeah with where we're with the Jimmy butler meeting [noise] yes yes yes\nCan you give give people the the whole kind of blow by blow and then the he said he said okay\nSo we all know what happened yesterday you talked about it at the top the outburst at practice the interview afterwards with ESPN while the timber wolves ended up canceling practice earlier today\nThere was that a report from uh the athletic saying that the timber wolves led by Jimmy Butler had a players only meeting today we're butler expressed his feelings towards the players\nAnd how he was feeling towards them as it looked like Minnesota was likely to\nMove forward with him this season Jeff ... then followed up with that sweet of saying that's fake news the Minnesota Point guard saying that quote it wasn't no players meeting you just made that up you all got to relax with a fake news of course this coming from Sam's who have the report about the players only meeting\nAnd uh so yeah so this is the back and forth at doing that I missed anything of the the following the tea green bottle\nOf the Jimmy butler so called players only meeting\nA no no there's a there's a dairy St john's to know them who's you know like a ... I was just like what meeting and so there's\nThis sense I'm a ... there's there's this sense that um [noise] uh\nThat maybe it was an invite only right I think is a possibility that some of the guys had worn at the meaning is because they're not going to be on the team\nThat that could be that could be as well maybe it was just there was room the uh the athletic reported that butler also wanted to sit down with Carl Anthony towns and talk with him that he made this a known to the wolves front office\nAre earlier maybe that was part of it maybe it was just stay weakens town sort of thing I Would think Jeff he would be in the meeting though\nDon't you I mean as you said\nYou know if there is Johnson autumn isn't in the meeting Jeff ... probably going to be in that meeting right unless you just say we can put downs butler\n... yes but he said it wasn't a players only meeting you know I don't know that could be a\nLot of gray area years writing yeah there was that it wasn't specific you just said it wasn't no players meeting you just made that up yeah that's cool yeah by the way and then and then you need ... to Rachel Nichols that there was a meeting so I don't know\nI've oh thing is um do you what I ... I said that the guys in the break a and I I Know we are in a network here but it sure seems that ESPN is doing everything they can to promote the Jimmy butler a story line and have it do great harm to the Minnesota timber wolves\nAnd I find it interesting that in a in a side where we're at a time where you shouldn't take sides it sure seems like sides are being taken\nIn this to help one's agenda\nIt seems it's been very very pro Jimmy Butler and Minnesota's the one who now has to have their trade leverage be lesson you had a deal that could have got Josh Richardson from Miami now maybe Miami doesn't want to give 'em up anymore you know so I don't know that's that's opinion that's not that's not anything or the report that's my opinion\nThen buyers opinion I don't I I I'm going to [noise]\nWas different um [noise]\nI I I don't think it I like I don't think you're wrong they're trying to promote the storyline but it's because they have it is a story line and they got you know they have a willing source who's willing to put himself out there and Jimmy Butler right so\nI remember when I worked with ESPN there were people and I remember I Would listen to Fox Sports radio sometimes and they were there are people who had at the time when the networks like seize ESPN promoting it sounds like you're damn right you do what we do it at Fox has done not to have something good you have something interesting you promote that crap out of it\nIf you don't you would you expect others to do sell so I'm not critical of that you know like\nUm we got Thursday Night Football we have it's it's on paper it's too\nYou need to have great protection and they saw offensive line even though it's got some new pieces is not protecting Eli nor creating an alpha ... Barclay\nWas said call instilled the right pick you know I don't think so and I never did so I mean I totally respect Dave Gettleman\nBecause I think he believes business was told to me that there was not one of these quarterbacks even after may feel queasy loved enough to take anywhere very high so if that's what he chose the giants basically now have to think that the top five next year which is probably or there'll be drafting\nThey're going to have to get a a quarterback maybe the Oregon kid or you know look I don't know I don't watch college football so they're gonna have to get one of those guys they probably should have gotten them this year but\nLook David Gettleman has proven in his last two graphs he's taken Christian McCaffrey number eight to say can say calling Berkeley number two he goes against the grain and he's a little bit of a of a personnel dinosaur in that regard\nIt a little bit of a personal dinosaur now part of the the reason that could go after Christian McCaffrey at that point in the ... they already had a quarterback here's the thing that I I think is really important to realize with Eli Manning [noise]\nUm it wasn't like it was just bend Mac do who thought he lie manning was was on his way out it was the general manager it was John ... the owner\nUm they all had to be on board in order to call Eli Manning in and say hey we're eventually going to work towards getting Davis ... some wraps\nThat we're gonna play Gino Smith\nI mean honestly I don't even think they wanted to play Gina Smith it was just it was more than ... said hey being a stint me at the end of the game just sent me fine and they did they called his bluff and he wasn't bluffing and then he did this Marty life thing and you know got everybody else to act like they were upset\nDude I sound Victor Cruz on ESPN earlier today and I liked her first I've personally hung out with him I Know his charity work I think it's a good dude but Victor Cruz is reason for a for believing the giants would win tonight is you know you'd I man and he just finds a way I had just find a way\nLike what year are we in that's one that's on now says Tucson accurate just find a way why hasn't he found a way in years\nI'll even give him a pastor last year because they weren't surrounded by town like that many people who have been around he lived that long all saying yeah this is last year now you have a completely new front office a new coaching staff and they're convinced you a lie doesn't have it like how many people have to say as an avid\nBefore you realize he doesn't have [noise]\n[noise] so you're John Bruce should go ahead or a round music\nSo do you think that ultimately in the long run if Dave Gettleman was correct that you\nKnow they didn't like baking Mayfield they didn't love Sam Donald they didn't like any of these guys and if they are at the top of the draft will he ultimately in the long run be looked at for doing the right thing for taking say Kwan if he does a great job and they get another quarter back this year\nGoes like we kind of have ripped on him for like man you really should have got a quarterback they should have gotten a quarterback but if he gets sake one and a quarter back because they were bad the year before he got there and\nThen he's kind of like well what what did you expect me to do I'm dealing with these old players so it gets the quarterback and the running back are we going to look at that like well he did the long play that was the smart thing\nUm I I'm sure that's how many people will look at it I Will look at it as this becomes a last year right just becomes a waste each year you know why\nPut off to tomorrow which you can not only do today and he could have stuck a stake in the heart of the jets the jets are sitting there third and they don't take Donald after the browns don't take Arnold and the jets like are you kidding me we get the number one guy in our board and were dropped in third if you're moving heaven and earth\nSo um do I think Herbert and again you're also we're also operating and he does that mean they are absolutely going to get Justin Herbert it doesn't hurt you know is is is that it is that a formality\nOne we don't know if they will have the first first picking the draft\nAnd and this is a little bit of this is what we talked about earlier which was which we talk about the last couple of weeks which is a lot of those bottom teams like the Arizona Cardinals they already have their quarterback so I'm there may be the bill bill ... but that's not to say that somebody else doesn't leap frog them\nOr what what's to say that the number one pick in the draft isn't traded away and ultimately somebody else who needs a quarterback decides to leap frog then what then what do you do at number two they had the chance to dressage Sam garner was number one on most everybody's board and the national league and they chose to let him go to the jets had three\nThat's a tough pill to swallow\n[noise] Hi Doug on the show rules on Fox Sports radio um man we got a lot to get to during the show Joe Buck's going to join his upcoming next we'll definitely talks in baseball and we'll talk some football he saw the eagles up close why does he think they're not hit on all cylinders\nTouches you about ...\n[noise]\nA sports fans football season's here and it's time to get in on the

I don't mean to ... and I'm sure people do still all the time but Gibson's homerun I was my best friend growing up so my closest friend now is miles Simon he's now in the system with the Lakers\nAre he we're both Mets fans because of our he was a mess and I was missing because my dad was a New Yorker and we're just watching Gibson and he turns means like Gibson is going to hit home run and I was a kid at who's like was you know run\nAny your dad perfectly describes any hits it and he says I don't I don't believe what I just I don't believe what I just saw and that's the ... and then he laid out which of course is what\nWould broadcast as all taught to do and no one ever does and just let the ... and the crowd noise and it was amazing I remember exactly where I was during that moment is the power of a baseball baseball moments I let's let's get back in\nCollege I was in college and I was the one door that was back in my dorm room watching watching the world series everybody else was was out doing something and I was I was watching it so I didn't hear my dad's call because I was watching it and I heard stories call\nWhich is just as good and just as poignant and and brilliant\nAnd he says you know in the years is rounding the bases right pumping his arms instead of the year of the tropical the impossible it's happened which is like I mean it's just so poetic perfect uh you know those are two great calls that night\nThe giants play tonight and um I ... it is a hard transition but whatever LBJ as an interview with just seen Anderson and little lanes there and it was usually little lane rules with truly but instead he ruled with a with Errol BJ to worry about that you spend\nA lot of time together and the ... and not during\n... when you when you sat down with the giants are for this game how how much how much ... is there to pick out how much does that still an issue within that those were novices\nOn I I don't think anybody cares to be honest with you I talking to ... and I think it's because of the way ... handled it and if there was any\nYou know ... said after the game you know air that brought this team together then I'll do that every time I to me it was more the reaction by the head coach and that's it for as upset as the ... and the ownership of the giant should have been at\n... ... ... if nothing else kind of ah not really answering the question are you happy in New York the answer should have been hell yes if they put their money behind me and I'm going to do but but that wasn't the answers we now first disappointed they I'm sure where to that they should have been thrilled with the way their first year I coach handled it and\nI I think he came off in showed exactly what he's all about and I don't think anybody cares one quick about\nThat interview with the giants I think they're worried about the eagles and I don't think it's just you know BS athlete speak I don't think they care I I think the media it's another example of how the media and I'm part of it you know I'm sure we'll talk about it tonight the media cares more about it then the players are the people involved\nWhat about ... not in terms of the criticism but\nIn in the closing window here right like they did change they they changed coaches they change coordinators they changed lines they get a new running back they got the wide receivers back and yet\nHe's still kind of getting real quick hot potato football and they're still not as productive as they should be um what's your sense of of Eli Manning and the idea that maybe father time is is announcing his presence\nMore I think I think it's a convergence of all that stuff yeah they change the fence wine that doesn't mean they often wine good ah it doesn't mean that you know they've they've solved the riddle uh they're better than they were but I don't know that they're opening gaping holes for Barkley who's as impressive the guy on the field as he is off the field\nOr what a good kid he is and I you know we'll see if they can squeeze another year out of Eli Manning another two\nYears out of Eli Manning fine they obviously didn't view those other quarterbacks this franchise guys they viewed the running back as a generational running back and he may very well be but it doesn't mean they have to buy into the hype on darnel or any of the other guys and they're going to have to hope that they can squeeze two years out of\nThe line manning and and that back um and I and that's often the wind you know continues to shell and get better but uh if it doesn't then they're not going to win if it does then that got shot in a really bad decision\nWell listen I have a great call tonight can't wait to hear you Troy and I'm an air in on the game with the defending champions taken on the giants and then said travels to Milwaukee can we do they call the ...\nGame one of the LDS big time for you and thanks so much for doing his job always pleasure art dog anytime tank on a\nJob up joining us on the Doug ... life getting you ready for Thursday Night Football which is on Fox and of course friday night you got game one of the an L. D. S. that also on Fox and like you said I I say that all the people all the time like oh man you're taking a red eye you're flying across the country in the middle of night to go to Miami like\nYeah I'm not flying the plane I'm writing in the plane was flying the plane that that actually that something ...\nNewsworthy\nThat something newsworthy and noteworthy this in fact is not um I we got a bunch of things still tend to get to on the dug out Late Show again Thursday Night Football seven thirty eastern time for thirty Pacific is there an upset brewing tonight on Thursday Night Football they go to Vegas get some of the numbers next\nThis is the jump godly show on Fox Sports radio\n\nPlays it makes you rise out of your share\nThis is why you love\nSports radio\nHey they're diehard years in football ... you might not even know\nThe first football game was played in Eighteen sixteen on an average gained the ball is typically play\nFor only eleven minutes and finally pizza consumption rates go up during the week of the big game okay you probably knew that last one\nWell here's another fact you might not know this is actually really useful especially if you're planning tailgating true car also helps people get used cars that tried to guard isn't just for buying new cars with their certify dealer networking nationwide image where nearly one million used cars you enjoy real price you know an actual women tore into simpler buying experience when you buy new or used\nAnd were true car users can see what others paid so they know if they're getting a good deal before buying they're also more likely enjoy faster buying experienced by connecting with true car certify dealers they're over Fifteen thousand troops are certified dealers nationwide\nWhen you're ready to buy a new or used car check out your guard enjoy more confident car buying experience\nSome teachers not available in all states [noise]\nAnd I don't zones helping you get more time is what we do best like free battery just now you can stop the second guessing and finally started you know matter of just ... cable or the time has come for a new one ... test your battery right on the spot free of charge and coming today for the long way so you can see the road even in the worst one\nVisit any of our fifty five hundred locations nationwide and let us do more restrictions on diesel store\nHalloween and we can go now than when you own furniture and the Chinese and playing some fans like feeling\nPay minimum wage\nTime off and first play they can't even figure out figure out the saints\nAnd it's really the real quick the great analogy here is and you being a athlete that you don't understand the highest level of competition I think this is going to resonate with you ... what's the difference between the the club champion and golf\nAnd a guy on the tour\nRight it's those two or three shots around right on what was that thin lie that's the difference quite frankly like when a wise guy with a sharp says oh I like the skin\nIt's not going to win sixty Seventy eighty Ninety percent that it's going to win fifty five percent of the time a drunk baby flipping coins wins fifty percent of the time the difference is one in twenty games you've got that little extra value and you win that twentieth game\nUm Tampa Bay buccaneers come in and they've had a week off and they have the image Winston backup quarterback Lana coming in and licking their wounds after getting stopped by the Pittsburgh Steelers Atlanta's a team that they played everybody close up until last week but now the sudden they're in desperation mode I Know this is one of your best bet the week which side of which side of the the the corner young\nLet me ask you a quick question Winston fitzpatrick given the current givens do you think Winston as an upgrade yes\n... C I it's interesting because I actually think it's a potential where in the locker room they know this is about his contract of Winston had a three three years laughter if it wasn't like we got to figure out what we got was this guy ultimately finally I Wonder if he'd be starting here\nBut I really liked the falcons it's three and a half\nOr nothing about this we talk about it every week home field advantage in the NFL was three points the falcons they're at home if they were even teams against Tampa Bay it'd be three three and a half\nYou telling me Tampa is only a half point the lesser teen compared to Atlanta\nI get it and land that has so many injuries\n... oh actually I just had one of my guys say it's down to three even so wow I mean you're right there has been significant injuries on the defense for the falcons and I don't think they're near as good of a team as we thought they were starting to a year but let me give you one example we talked about the look a headline\nLast week if you're that this game Atlanta was favored by six and a half\nNow their favorite by three it just because they got beat so bad by Pittsburgh and again that was a bad last downgrade them a point but we're still getting a ton of value on the falcons lane only a field goal now assuming these are even teams against Tampa no way\nI Cincinnati in first place to get the Steelers coming in the Steelers still have some of field issues are trying to figure out the lady on bell deal but they did a they did blow out the said falcons this game is always a vicious game you know bond as perfect of course on the other side of the football was your ...\nOh I actually one of my best bets the week on the Steelers Pittsburgh to me is the easiest team in the NFL to handicap\nEither pass or fade um\nUnless it's a must win and I don't mean kind of a almost a must win\nBecause if it's almost a must win they're hanging out playing PlayStation three they're not worried yet and again as a Steeler fan I hate this because we don't get home field even when we do make the playoffs and you know again I guess we're a little spoiled but hasn't made a Super Bowl since two thousand ten\nBut boy when they have a true must when\nThey play as well as anybody typically and right now I Know they won last week but boy they lose this game against the hated rival it's gonna be a lot of problems and we're getting two and a half with Pittsburgh and oh by the way here's the clincher\nSteelers at Cincinnati last twenty nine times twenty four and five straight up Twenty one in eight against the spread winning by an average of nine points there's been seven times the bangles had a better record like they do now and those twenty nine a current or thirty occurrences in those\nOh I'm Sorry twenty nine seven times banquets had a better record\nPittsburgh in those game seven in a straight up six in one against the spread\nWhy is it just a fluke no it's Pittsburgh a lot of people don't realize is like a two and a half hour three hour drive the Cincinnati Bengals don't have the best fans at home typically Pittsburgh takes over half that stadium and they're very comfortable there give me the Steelers getting points\nOr you can check out his show called fair to Vegas you can join us not after the show good at ... dot com their official lines provider for the Associated Press R.
