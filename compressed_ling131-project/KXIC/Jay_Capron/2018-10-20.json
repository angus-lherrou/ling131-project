{"month": "10", "state": "IA", "station": "KXIC", "content": "But it was interesting the way you tweeted this when you said a his thoughts on the best blocker and they're receiving corps I Want to hear that but also price freshmen and the game day view from 'cause he coaches and the press box okay so let's hear those three highlights right there who's the best blocker he says\nA random Smith is the guy that he really point to their very high on him and he's actually coming off a you know his two best receiving you got it catches the last two weeks he's got Thirteen all year so\nHe's looking good in the past game still looking for his first touchdown but I think that's just a matter of time but now he's ... he's the biggest wide receiver six three to Nineteen\nReally physical guy and he said what are called Coleman says whatever process him is that no matter if it's a running game or a pass it goes to somebody else he's got this finish in the play through the through the what's it like he has always looking for somebody to block right and punish and uh\nOf course I'd like to see that obviously blocking a in Iowa scheme which seems to be able to block yeah this is a requirement yeah and uh he's he's done a really good job of that\nSo you talk about um as far as I Want to break that down just a little bit deeper so did he mentioned to you because I Know you talk to them regularly and you know you you roll through the position coaches each week on that broadcasters are different coaches so did he mentioned reference earlier in the year that\nNot that they were feeling pressure but you know Brandon Smith as you mentioned has had some key catches Nick easily it's had games of ten catches six catches two touchdowns here one touched down there\nThat I don't want to well I guess I Will use the word consistent theory on this and see but it did he address that from earlier in the year to where they're they're obviously on a good plan right now you know trying to support is the combination ... they're trending up for it but\nUh you know titans are covering their their area the family's doing his job of running backs are so I shouldn't say dizzy feeling the pressure but did he mentioned that that hey we're we're headed the right plan and we've been working with the guys to start governor basis\nYeah I mean he's very happy with the progress they've made especially your over years is a really remarkable what they've done the other top three receivers easily Smith and spent more set up forty six catches this year and that's what I asked them is going to get with injury yeah for touchdowns between um a ... percent is every Nineteen years on his catches so he's become a deep but they want them to be a um [noise]\nYou know that that's a kind of what he wants to another data basically three receivers they don't really use anybody else but uh I guess that those guys are healthy they're they're happy with what they're getting out of them\nYeah and that's why when I asked that question because mark you know how it is because you're there on the regular in his fans now and even former football players with what level you're at there's always a competition between the offense and defense\nAnd then there's the skill position players have a nice little competition hey we're getting ours and we're I don't think it's mean spirited but it's a recovering hours what are you guys doing what have you done for lately type things so but then as you mentioned uh what what was what was his thoughts about a price freshmen and then a Dubuque and the press box of last\nToo yeah so we wanted to ask them about Tyrone Tracy junior because the cat indeed everybody was excited about coming into the season a really really highly regarded recruit um has gotten in a little bit uh I got one that the one catching up to you and I for twenty two yards\nOr so interesting because he's actually been dressed for both real games which is a sign I think that I see that they like him and they wouldn't bring weather wise 'cause you're limited and how many cars you can bring on the road and he hasn't played neither one of those games so the question still remains can red shirt because he still hasn't played for games and he could still directly Roger they're not sure about that yet but he's\nReally thrilled with the kids practice habits I said the kid religious pastors him all the time to do more film work and he said he was a kind of a almost a nuisance over the summer time because they kept calling them and taxing them and drawing up at his office saying let's let's focus on more film was to some more work\nFrom al yeah he's\nHe's a cop and he has a very bright future question is are we seeing much this year I I'm not sure we are out of say\nWell it's interesting you bring that up because I had heard coach parents or a ... mentioned is that that that that for game new NCAA that'll right so you can get some experience of guys are getting picked up at the end of the area you want to save easily or snap and\nMethane to play for that reason but that then new rule of a change has been interesting 'cause now you can put a kid like that in grass especially if somebody gets hurt or yeah or even if they don't just get some experience but you still going to get a red shirt\nAs you mentioned just one catch so it's a total game thing right as a rule of change so\nAnd market let's do this so we got about another minute and a half before we had to break here but as we do that\nUh we'll do our predictions next segment but I Want I Want to go more around the big time this last segment and a list is oh pets okay we're marking me again this week they talk on the first week mark and me we talked basketball and not much basketball
