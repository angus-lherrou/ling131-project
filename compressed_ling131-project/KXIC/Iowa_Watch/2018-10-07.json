City\nWeek on the Iowa watch connection\nI Will tell you that the Democratic chair and Republican chair we may disagree on a whole lot of things but we do not disagree on how one [noise]\nIt's a unique Lehigh a one phenomenon it's got to be far more inclusive everywhere and and that excites me because I think that that's good for Democrats and it's good\nFor democracy but it's about to undergo some changes [noise] this just continues that process that tries to make sure that we can have a process of an honest transparent and allows people to participate as\nIowa's presidential precinct caucuses our topic this week\nThe I Will watch connection is presented by the Irish Center for public affairs journalism on line and I don't watch that war here in Seattle down [noise]\nThe whole fifty years ago following the most was Nineteen sixty eight election campaign national Democrats ought to make the presidential nomination process more transparent placing more power in the hands of voters instead of party leaders\nIowa Democrats adapted their precinct caucus system to elect delegates at the most local level from precincts to county conventions from there to district conventions then to the state convention and finally to the national convention\nIn order to go through that many steps given technological limitations of the time I was Nineteen Seventy two caucuses were held on January twenty fourth and soon a first in the nation tradition to coal\nBut after each election cycle Iowa has to fight to keep its status and as former state party chair and former congressman Dave Nagl notes it's led to along the lines with New Hampshire which holds the first primary in the nation every four years\nNew Hampshire conducts the primary which is state government run\nIowa conducts the caucus which is run by the political parties the state government is not involved a and that is as it should be a because the state government in New Hampshire says it will hold your selection process for you but we won't tell you what to do\nWith this all ... is a choice of the Iowa Democratic party in the Republican Party in terms of how we want to select our nominee not told by the government who we should select or ... or ... or or killed or towards one candidate or another but therein lies the problem\nThe DNC can't do anything to New Hampshire or they've tried in years past but it's a state run process and bill gardeners adamant that he's going to be first primary in the nation is he should be\nWe on the other hand or creature requires you approve of the state of Iowa but our governing body the Democratic National Committee\nAnd so they set a son of the road for conflict with New Hampshire\nOr by uh two requirements one which I think can be met and the other I'm not sure can\nFirst is is we conduct a precinct caucus has a selection process and we use ... good selected to the state convention or the county convention as a measuring stick because of success for a candidate whoever gets the most delegates to the county conventions\nPercentage wise wins the Iowa Democratic caucus\nA New Hampshire is just absolutely adamant that we could not go to a straw poll the ... Republicans to do so because they they did that when this thing was originally created\nSo the DNC is now required I Would release little raw totals as well as diligent equivalent Caesar delegate counts\nSo I wouldn't have Hampshire which with a pack of never crowded each other once we do we lose both both of us will lose are now in a situation where the DNC is set up a conflict with New Hampshire for Iowa that we're gonna have to try to work out but at this point we don't have any resolution of that\nNow the Democratic National Committee has issued guidelines for the twenty twenty Iowa caucuses I spoke to DNC chair Tom perennials on September twenty fours about them\nTo make sure that uh it easier for people to participate if you're a veteran and you're deployed overseas that should\nPreclude Jennifer I'm participating not only in the Iowa caucus but in any caucus\nOr if you are a person with a disability and you you have a mobility impairment should make sure that any caucus site is accessible\nOr if you are a shift work or a or you have a family care responsibilities they should be able to participate and we're working very closely with the party and they have been exceedingly responsive or they were part of the group\nWho ah helped us a put together the series of reforms and and what happens when we're making these process things more inclusive is that more people participate\nAnd that's what we want to do Democrats want to make it easier for folks to vote they want to make it easier for folks to participate you look at what Republicans do across this country they pass these horrible voter ID laws to make it harder\nFor folks to participate their their purging voters that ballot boxes or they're they're doing nothing in the White House in the face of Russian interference\nWith elections are these are really important things that I have great confidence that we're going to see a very robust caucus and twenty twenty and\nIt's got to be far more inclusive everywhere and that excites me because I think that that's good for Democrats and it's good for democracy\nSo Iowa and New Hampshire have made peace in terms of the changes in Iowa will will not undermine the New Hampshire process I Know that was one of the concerns that folks and New Hampshire had\nI'm confident we can thread that needle very confident\nThat all may be easier said than done given the possible conflict between longtime allies Iowa and New Hampshire but as Dave ... told me on October fest he has some ideas\nOne thought that I had ... is is we can release raw tools but not until after New Hampshire's eldest process and then try to get to the secretary of the New Hampshire to agree that the absentee ballot participation is not the same as Rob told", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Iowa Watch", "city": "Iowa City", "day": "07"}
