and philanthropy this Thursday October twenty fifth from five to seven at the Terry True Blood recreation center in Iowa City I'm Mark pits for I hurt radio in Iowa City and Cedar Rapids and this has been air time\nThis week on the Iowa launch connection but I use the fundamental problem in American society to bring social fabric were the American people are looking at one another as enemies or his adversaries\nLack of civility has dominated political discourse of late\nMay come to town actually listening to the people that they have to separate editing\nIs it too much to ask that people can disagree agree appoint we're rarely\nAs disagreeable as our party identifications would indicate we might assumed to be\nCivil political disagreement our topic this week\nThe I Will watch connection is presented by the I was Center for public affairs journalism online and I will watch dot org here is Jeff die [noise]\nThere's a bit of a paradox these days at the very time we have more ways to communicate than ever we tend to individually take advantage of a few of them often consuming media that reinforces our personal world views and ignoring those that may challenge us\nTo some degree that's encouraged by a major political parties as they build their respective bases of support\nAs a result we may be more polarized than ever and that is getting in the way of having meaningful conversations about important issues as we choose not to talk with those who might have differing views from our own\nI Will watch executive director editor ... takes us to one county where people with opposing political views are trying to have conversations\nSeems a lot of people cannot have a civil conversation about politics especially hot button issues like abortion or immigration you've heard that\nYeah we've been told it no surprise but we wanted to share with you today some people talking with each other about issues and also the way we talk with each other about politics especially when we disagree\nYeah there's a lot of violence the nastiness over the place as well\nAnd um\nBut yeah I I've seen lots of promising interests and really cutting through it and realizing that if we could just stop with a lot of the rhetoric that alone would be a tremendous improvement\nThat's Jeff Shipley of Fairfield\nHe's a former Iowa Republican state central committee member former Jefferson County Republican chairman and a losing candidate for an Iowa house seat in twenty fourteen\nHe is among a small group of a little more than a dozen Jefferson County residents meeting through a national effort called better angels which is dedicated to raising the level of political conversation too well\nCivility\nIf you're wondering why we're telling you about Jefferson County the southeast Iowa what county virtually split it's twenty sixteen presidential vote with Donald Trump winning forty six point seven percent of the ballots and Hillary Clinton winning forty six point two percent\nIt is one of three counties I Will watch reporter Matthew McDermott visited for two months in summer twenty Eighteen to see if people could have civil conversations about politics the other two counties were Van Buren county to the south of Jefferson County and were Donald Trump won a robust Seventy two percent of the vote\nAnd Johnson county north a bit and work Hillary Clinton one sixty six percent of the vote\nBut there must report that I Will watch dot org concluded that polarization is powerful keeping many Iowans from even trying to have a conversation with someone with whom they disagreed politically too much emotion people told McDermott\nJoe man to Reno of Fairfield explains it this way people\nDiametrically opposed views on abortion and Oregon could sit down and say you know there's a middle ground here and I can understand your point of view you can understand my point of view and then there actually is common ground\nWhere but that's really not the driver is not that we showed disagree of out of worship we're sodas and drove to the most contentious issues in my opinion\nIs that there's something about the winning and losing\nOf a a\nSeparate groups in terms of how it's being presented everything now is is like there's a women's Democrats or Republicans I'm and\nEverybody wants to win nobody's saying it's a win for the United states yet know what I'm saying is that when the United states that second voice\nYou heard at the end belongs to mark Dwyer a semi retired business woman from Fairfield who has served as associate vice president of business development at Cambridge investment research she's a Democrat\nHaving run unsuccessfully for county supervisor in twenty sixteen she served on the nonpartisan Fairfield school board for ten years she meant to Reno and Shipley are trying the better angels approach along with others and hope what\nThey are doing catches on we'll have more about better angels later in this report before that though we want you to hear how these political opposites talk about their disagreements\nThe catalyst for this particular discussion is a question we ask about driving by a sign east of Fairfield but says Hillary Clinton for prison\nWhile listening to the latest accusation on the radio that Donald Trump is racist Shipley zero in on media coverage of politics\nI'm desperate for news and opinions but I just that's why Trump appeals to me because of I don't trust the media and I think they've been doing a poor job I think a lot of this uh incendiary headline reporting again filled with half truths or or delivered distortions or\nOr whatever it is is really ... the biggest thing preventing us that every time we were gonna turn on the TV we're going to be outraged about something and how the media seems releases last Eighteen months has been one thing after another about whipping people into a frenzy and getting upset about\nDwyer has pushed back laying blame on political leadership but doesn't attack\nOur leaders aren't they're not pushing in that direction our leaders are capitalizing on the polarization in my view a and they're trying to be very careful to stay identified with their base", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Iowa Watch", "city": "Iowa City", "day": "21"}
